Words: Is there an online tool to accurately assess the relative rarity of a word in English?I'm looking for something more definitive than just guessing from the number of returned results of a search engine llike google.
Yes do an online search for example "biggest online free English corpus" There are many of these corpora that should give you the statistical information you are looking for.
