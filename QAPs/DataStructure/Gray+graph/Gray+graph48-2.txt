How does information theory relate to image processing?
This is very important and something I have been thinking about seriously on for the last year or so. We know that colour blind people and non-colour blind people can look at the same image and see two different colours. So, if we pass a colour-blind image through one colour matrix we may see the number 7. Pass it through a different matrix and we may see the number 4. Clearly not only the meta-information has changed but the semantic meaning of the image has changed. That is that actual image's perceptual information has changed. As I said I have been looking at this for a while now and have found no research or studies found on the subject. It is fascinating and if you are interested in continuing with this line of investigation drop me a line we could collaborate if you like. dave@ccs-labs.com
