If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
No, it means neither. (tl;dr: you might need a teacher.) Statistically, it means you're more likely to give up. If you give up, then you won't improve. But "just" more practice? No. It's possible you need more training. Practice is a vital part of training, but it's not the only part. A teacher or a teaching curriculum is another part. There are many ways to learn (and thus improve). Never underestimate the ability of the human brain to improve... but, (depending on your pre-existing knowledge and resources at hand) "just practice" is a fairly inefficient method of improvement (unless combined with other methods).
