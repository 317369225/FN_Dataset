I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
It's very common at the end of a relationship to feel a sense of loss.  What you are experiencing is completely normal.  It's not very different than the 5 stages of grief that we go through when someone we love dies. The 5 Stages of Grief (Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Foundation - Dianne Gray) - Fire it up with cj . The 5 stages include denial and isolation(will he come back, should I wait for him- bargaining), anger (angry at parents), and depression.  The final stage is acceptance and throughout this process there is HOPE.   I'm sure there are things that both of you have done to create this situation.  This is the gleaming jewel for you.  What do you own in creating this relationship? What did your boyfriend do?  Can you forgive him? Yourself? (12/24: Forgiveness: 3 steps to Forgiveness (Gary Renard) - Fire it up with cj)  What is the higher order learning that you can take away from this situation? Once you have found your personal learning then it's time to let-go. Letting go means letting go of the vision you had as a couple.  Take the things you loved about yourself/him, these are memories that will always be with you.  Let go of the emotions, thoughts, and accept that it is now over.  Here'a nice process to try: You will need to modify it, but check this out: Here is another video that may help: Toltec Wisdom - How to Let Go (Don Miguel Ruiz, Jr) - Fire it up with cj.  My sense and your sense too is that this likely maps to something beyond just the boyfriend (family dynamic), because your loss and reaction seems beyond the loss you'd have with a boyfriend.  What other losses have you sustained in your life and that you have not resolved? Do both situations have some parallels?  This would be good info to explore with a therapist, or a good friend that is good at listening.  Hope this helps.
