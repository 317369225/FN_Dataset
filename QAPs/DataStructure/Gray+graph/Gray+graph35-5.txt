What is the outcome of a $15 minimum wage in the U.S.?
A simple supply/demand curve (http://www.netmba.com/econ/micro...) indicates that an artificially mandated price which is higher than the market would dictate, absent of coercion, creates a surplus of that good/service, and a shortage of people who can (or 'choose to') afford it. Vice versa, when an artificially low price is dictated, this creates a shortage of that product/service, and an increase in the quantity demanded. This is what happened when Nixon mandated lower gas prices in the country in 1979; long lines began to appear at the pump, as demand was higher than suppliers could afford to provide for at the artificially low prices. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/... In the case of a legally mandated higher minimum price of labor (minimum wage), basic economics tell us there will be a resulting surplus of minimally skilled labor (eg unemployment). So in other words, the people who purport to be helping poor, low-skilled workers, are in fact forcing them to be unemployed. Once they are unemployed, they have little chance of gaining the skills and experience required to earn $15/hour or higher. This is why the unemployment rates of people in the inner city, and also of teenagers, is so high. Next thing you know we have generations of people who are incapable of leaving welfare subsidies, because they have low skills and little work experience. Frankly it's a nasty form of slavery imposed on these people. What kind of jerk would do this to someone?
