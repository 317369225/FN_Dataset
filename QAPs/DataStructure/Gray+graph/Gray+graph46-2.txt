How can electric cars be more environmentally friendly when electricity is mostly generated by burning coal?
Think about it... you need petrol to deliver petrol to petrol station. Doesn't this sentence sound ridiculous? As mentioned above the electrical cars are more efficient and the delivery systems of electricity are more efficient as well. The Energy conversion efficiency for petrol cars are between 10%-50% where electrical cars can be from 70% to as much as 99.99% (theoretically). That said the amount of that energy is lower for electrical cars. But this is also being addressed (UK electric car breaks speed record) Additionally, there are so much possibilities to gain renewable energy at home: solar panels (in some countries you can get them for free), temperature difference generators, wind kites to name the few. You could install a solar panel on a car itself.Â  Further reading:Thermoelectric energy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th... http://www.thepowerpot.com/ Wind energy with kites Makani - Google High-altitude wind energy from kites!
