What are the greatest dashboard designs, and why?I am looking for some cool dashboard designs following the latest design trends and UI Patterns. Dashboards mainly displaying the analytics, performance graphs and the most vital information.
"Cool" dashboard design? Is your goal to impress somebody with the visual eye candy or is it to communicate the story contained in the data? I hope it is the latter. Good dashboards may not be "cool" but they are effective. Also, latest design trends and UI patterns are less important than the principles of visualization best practice. These principles align with the way the human mind works - resulting in less trendy, but more enduring work. My suggestions: 1) Read the work of Edward Tufte and Stephen Few. 2) Choose vendors like Tableau and BonaVista, which have best practice baked in. 3) Ask me for a free critique. Part of my job involves designing dashboards and I have served as a judge on dashboard design competitions.
