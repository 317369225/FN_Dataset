Was mathematics invented or discovered?
"The mathematician is an inventor, not a discoverer."-Ludwig Wittgenstein, Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics   Zak Stone’s previous answer assumes that there’s a meaningful distinction between the linguistic and symbolic systems used in mathematics and something one might refer to as “mathematics itself.” This is a distinction challenged by Wittgenstein as well as many contemporary philosophers. It’s a very difficult position to summarize, so start by considering this:   We’re tempted to describe the development of calculus as a discovery because we believe calculus to have been in the world long before Leibniz and Newton put pen (quill?) to paper. But ask yourself: “In what sense was calculus there all along?” (Are you sure your answer is about what you’d typically call calculus, rather than physics or psychology?)   Then think through some gray areas. Would you say graph theory and theoretical computer science had been there when the first travelling salesman attempted to find the shortest route for his deliveries? Were the designs for a viable spaceship there since the dawn of time?
