Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
If you define Socialism in its broadest sense - shared ownership of resources - we're all socialist to some degree: we all, with only a tiny exception, believe in a national military, public roads, parks, and police and fire departments. A smaller, but still very large group also supports public education and Medicare and unemployment benefits. So when the accusation "he's a socialist" is leveled at Obama (or anyone) it's usually a political gambit, not a meaningful critique. (Same with calling someone Fascist, by the way.) Obama certainly doesn't support subjugating the democratic process to further the socialist agenda, which is where the real problems come. He has never, to my knowledge, suggested that shared ownership should be forced into society. He supports and abides by the decisions of duly elected officials representing the interests of their constituents which, in some cases, call for government intervention in the private sector. Every president... ever has done this. If one feels that the government is too involved in the private sector, all one has to do is vote him out and he'll gladly step aside. The only issue is of degree. Obama certainly favors a more balanced wealth curve and stronger regulation of the private sector than some of his opponents on the right, but, frankly, not by much. If you look at the potential Republican candidates, or Bush, or John McCain from 2004, you won't see much substantial difference in stances on shared resources, only rhetoric.
