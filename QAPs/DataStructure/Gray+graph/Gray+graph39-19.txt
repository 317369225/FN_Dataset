Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
Those right-wingers or Tea Party people who use "socialism" as a cudgel to slander Obama, when you ask them what it means, they have no idea. They're on board with anything that undermines and de-legitimizes him.
