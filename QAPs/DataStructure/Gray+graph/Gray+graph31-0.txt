Why are people suddenly using Quora?A half-dozen people have followed me over the holiday...
Quora has been receiving an increasing amount of press including articles in: TechCrunch: http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/03... Fast Company: http://www.fastcompany.com/17130... ReadWriteWeb: http://www.readwriteweb.com/arch... Louis Gray: http://blog.louisgray.com/2010/1... GigaOm: http://gigaom.com/2011/01/03/ste... ...and 178 more news stories and 2.05 million results, according to Google. Besides the press that it's receiving, as Chapley Watson mentioned, there are a lot of influencers and other early-adopters currently using the service.Â  If they're sharing their questions and answers on Twitter and/or Facebook, then every time they do that they're sharing it with their entire social graph. It will be interesting to see if Quora continues to grow momentum and it becomes sticky with a wide user-base much like Twitter and Facebook have.
