What is "tensor calculus" and why did Einstein need it for some of his theories?
A simple non--detailed explanation. Calculus deals with change, Tensor calculus simply deals with how Tensors change. Tensors are defined by the way they change when transformed to a different co-ordinate system. And calculus is required to know how they change. If P and Q are tensors in a co-ordinate system, and P=Q is satisfied in that co-ordinate system. When transformed to another co-ordinate system, in general they take the form P`=Q`(Where P` and Q` are transformed tensors, this result requires knowledge on Tensors, and this expresses the same thing in an equation of the same form as in the original co-ordinate system). According to Einstein, Physical laws must be such that they are true in any frame of reference(i.e., co-ordinate systems, a sensible point isn't it?). Which is same as saying laws of physics must be such that if its true in one frame of reference, it must be true in all frames of reference. Tensor equations exhibit this property of being true in all frames of reference, when true in one frame of reference. Hence, Einstein used tensor to construct his theories.
