Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
No.  But the people who usually make that kind of statement are conflating Socialism with social democracy--like the one we already have and the ones that all other first world nations have.  Ours is significantly less "social" than most of theirs, but none of us are true Socialists.  While we may want universal health insurance and retirement benefits and unemployment insurance, etc., none of us much goes in for the whole "the government owns the means of production" stuff that defines actual Socialism.
