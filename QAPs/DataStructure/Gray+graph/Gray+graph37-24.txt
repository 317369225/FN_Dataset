How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Originally Answered: How can I get a job at Facebook, Google or Epic?Companies like Facebook, Google etc. look at how comfortable you are with programming and how in depth your knowledge is. The way you go about acquiring that knowledge is completely your own. And there are more than one ways to it. Online judges are definitely a good way to practice coding and get familiar and comfortable with it. But it is by no means a prerequisite. As for when someone says you must have good projects under your belt, I would personally define a good project as one which had a purpose (you just didn't do it so that you can put it on your resume) and, as importantly as the previous reason if not more, one which made you learn something. Either ways, its all about learning. And to be honest, one of these is not an alternative for the other. Online judges are more about problem solving and help deepen your knowledge, projects help diversify it. Most of your interviews would be based around algos and DS. So first and foremost, get your basics right. Kernighan and Ritchie, Tanenbaum, Cormen are some books which will help you here. Be thorough with them, basics are absolutely vital (you don't learn to code by just 'reading' a book). Also in almost all your interviews you would be asked typical interview questions so going through Crack the Interview and geeksforgeeks is pretty important from an interview perspective (there are other sites as well like glassdoor, careercup which you can have a look at). And given that you have time, you can pretty much try your hand at online coding and do a couple of good projects by the time you sit for placements.
