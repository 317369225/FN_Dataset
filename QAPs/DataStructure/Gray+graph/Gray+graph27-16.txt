I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
Hey, cheer up!! :)  And thanks for the A2A. First of all, don't ever ever think of ending up your life whatever hardships life gives you. You can't even think what will your parents will go through after your suicide. Promise me, you won't do this. And all this for a boy who rejected you? Come on! I'll tell you a harsh truth. No one will ever love you more than your parents. No one.  Yeah, you went on to have a beautiful relationship with him. You had some beautiful memories. But he betrayed you. Who lost in the long run? You should live your life to make him realise that it was his loss not yours.You want to cry? Cry as hard and as long as you want. But once you are done, bounce back. Hit the gym. Work out. Invest in yourself. He was not your identity. Don't feel like a loser because of him. Be a strong and confident woman and embrace your studies and be successful. REBUILD YOURSELF. Talk to your friends. Only you can help yourself. When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us. And please remember to hug your parents the next time you meet them and also if you do become successful one day, which I'm sure you will, thank your ex, because if it was not for him, you won't be standing there.
