Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
He is socialist because he has been labeled as such by the right, and is believed to be so by 35% or so of the country.  Going back to Jacksonian era of American politics, where conservatives (in that times sense, obviously their ideology doesn't match up very well with modern conservatives) tagged abolitionist Whigs and "Black Republicans" with the socialist labelled, socialist has been a attack conservative hit liberals with.  Socialism, to the right, has generally just meant scary liberal.  Obama is more liberal than movement conservatives and scares many right wingers, so he is a socialist to them.  In a technical sense, "Does Obama support the systematic ownership of the means of production by the state?"  like Hugo Chavez or mid-century France or Britain?  I don't think it matches up very well.  The closes matches, TARP, did not nationalize the banks and it sold the auto industry, and the Fed is selling off all the assets it received, and is not under Obama's authority anyway.
