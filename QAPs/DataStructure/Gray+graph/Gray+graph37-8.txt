How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Originally Answered: Which programming languages should I know to get an internship or job at a top-notch company like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?Adam Hupp has the right answer. I have one more item to add: if you know a scripting language like Python, you can blaze through standard interview questions much, much faster. Time is of the essence in a coding interview and less time spent making marks on the board translates to more time for thinking. Of course, you have to know the language _well_, which is to say that you shouldn't cram it just for interviews. However, if you plan on programming for a living and you don't know a scripting language, you will be outpaced by those who do. Most of the questions I ask can be solved in half the pen-strokes (or fewer!) in Python, but most candidates choose Java or C++. PROTIP: If you're in school and don't have to use a specific language on a coding assignment, using a scripting language will almost always mean you can finish faster.
