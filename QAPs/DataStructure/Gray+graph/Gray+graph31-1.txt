Why are people suddenly using Quora?A half-dozen people have followed me over the holiday...
Adding to the mix - when I askedRobert Scoble something similar last week (ref: http://www.quora.com/l/1gtFut47) his answer resonated. In particular: Early adopters are finding better ways to explain it to others. The quality of answers was finally unavoidable (TechCrunch has used them several times). The doubling effect finally kicked in (try doubling a penny every day for a month. On last day you will go from $5.5 million to $11 mil. Makes day one seem boring, huh? Network effects kick in big time. Yes, there is a lot of coverage lately, but I think this speaks more to the point of why the numbers are increasing so rapidly.
