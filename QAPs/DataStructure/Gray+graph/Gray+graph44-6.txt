What are the greatest dashboard designs, and why?I am looking for some cool dashboard designs following the latest design trends and UI Patterns. Dashboards mainly displaying the analytics, performance graphs and the most vital information.
Even the best dashboard designs vary depending on what one it trying to measure and the line of business you are in.Â  While prebuilt dashboards can be a solution, often its not possible to find one that captures the critical elements of your business (especially if you are a science and engineering firm in R&D or manufacturing) One ideal solution to dashboards for science and engineering / R&D companies is to use existing tools like plotly JavaScript Graphing and Charting Library | Pricing and Description | plotly.js to enable any competent HTML webpage designer to build you what you are looking for.
