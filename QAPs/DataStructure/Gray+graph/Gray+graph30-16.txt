Was mathematics invented or discovered?
It's interesting to note that Wikipedia describes the 16th century mathematician Rafael Bombelli as being 'the inventor' of complex numbers. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raf...) The problem with describing him as an inventor is that complex numbers turn out to have far more interesting properties than simply being used to solve polynomials. Euler showed that when you use the 'imaginary' number i, the five most important numbers in mathematics are related by the simple equation e iπ +1=0  I find it hard to believe that Bombelli invented that. He laid the ground rules for complex numbers, and it was later discovered that these numbers had many interesting properties waiting to be discovered. If we can claim that Euler's relationship is an invention, then we should also consider the Mandelbrot set to be an invention. This set contains all of the points on the complex plane for which a straightforward complex polynomial is bounded. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man...) Can we really believe that Bombelli, or even Mandelbrot, sat down and said "OK, I'm going to invent this new set with a sort of heart-shaped thing in the middle and these weird frilly blobs on the side, and no matter how far you zoom in you'll always see more of it." Mandelbrot's set, like Euler's relation, like complex numbers themselves, was a discovery.
