If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
Practice makes a man perfect. If you really have that passion, better start right now. Right now may be you are not that good but who knows?may one day you can become a rock star programmer because of your passion ,dedication . You can start with C language. First of all build a strong basic. I'm giving you a link where you will find some tutorials on C. hope those will help. When you will have a strong basic concept, then you can move on to web development. But for that you have to learn some more languages.
