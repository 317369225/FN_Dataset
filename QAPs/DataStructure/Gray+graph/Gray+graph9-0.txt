I want to learn quantum mechanics. Where do I begin?
Study the origins ,roots and history of the japanese tea ceremony. If you come to a point where you can appreciate the cultural and personal significance of it then study quantum mechanics. You will need the patience you have gained whilst studying eastern philosophy to follow and study quantum mechanics for a lifetime and learn something new each time you pick up a book on the subject. That being said i was introduced to the subject in graduate school studying physical chemistry. Start with the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom and Planck's breakthrough in explaining the graphs of black body radiation emission.  In the case of the Bohr atom the mathematical model of coulomb's forces equaling centripetal forces with the velocity term from this fed into a quantized angular momentum  or mvr= nh yielding the radius of a hydrogen atom was an enlightening moment of understanding for me years ago. Have fun and enjoy the journey. I have..:) There are different approaches to learning this subject. What i have just written is more along the lines of studying the history of the development of the subject versus just diving into the math and equations and filling in the blanks later. Im not sure which works best but the historic approach is what was offered to me. The h above is h bar by the by but i can't find it on my keyboard. As previously eluded to you will need algebra, classical college physics( not necessarily calculus based but that saves years if you do study engineering as opposed to pre med physics as i did) and calculus as a base to understanding the subject.
