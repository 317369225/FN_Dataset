Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
John-Charles Hewitt's answer covers things pretty well here. The fact is all Western Democracies require socialist aspects in their governance in order to function. If you are a conservative and believe that socialism can only destroy America it would be worth noting that the single most powerful socialist entity in the world today is the United States Armed Forces. It is really nothing more than a government program, albeit a very, very big one. President Obama is a socialist in the way that all Americans are, they just won't admit it.  The U.S. highway system is used at some time or another by nearly every citizen.  It was built by American socialism.  The electricity generated by the Hoover Dam is harnessed by millions of people and again, it was built by American socialism.  As a Democratic Socialist I can say that the President isn't as committed to socialism as I am, not by a long shot, but every American is to some degree a socialist whether they like it or not.  That includes every Republican in Congress, every member of the Tea Party and President Obama.
