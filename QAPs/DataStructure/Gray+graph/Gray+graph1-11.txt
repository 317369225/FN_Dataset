Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
A lot of people I talk to on Twitter use Twitter instead of an RSS reader. It is amazing that so many people use Twitter for a source for links. In my opinion it is much easier to use Google reader but different mediums fo different people.
