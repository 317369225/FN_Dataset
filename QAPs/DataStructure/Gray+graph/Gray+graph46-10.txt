How can electric cars be more environmentally friendly when electricity is mostly generated by burning coal?
Originally Answered: Are electric cars actually safer for the environment?I guess one catch is that when a vehicle is petrol based, that's the only way it can be. It has a fixed pollution rate with a theoretical limit. When a vehicle is electricity based, you are shifting the burden to electricity generating plants in which we have had some success in reducing pollution by building nuclear/hydrolic/geothermal/solar power stations. There's a lot more scope for improvement there.
