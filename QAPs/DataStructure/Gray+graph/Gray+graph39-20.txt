Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
Socialism covers a wide range of ideologies and a textbook definition can't possibly cover them all.  For instance, some strict capitalists are what is called "evolutionary socialists".  This means that they wish to clear government intervention of the sort that prevents the free market from innovating to equalize supply for different jobs.  For instance, if some technology allowed you to train a doctor in the same amount of time it would take to train a burger flipper, the pay for each job would become closer.  This people who hold this viewpoint typically object against any intervention by the government other than to prevent private entities from becoming government, which makes them the complete opposite of traditional socialists. Obama is definitely not one of these people.  He takes certain actions that are more in line with socialism than a free market economy.  He prevented the development of a voucher system for public education because he said it would weaken public schools.  Instead of letting the market innovate and create a more effective education system, he continued the system where we all pay to operate an inefficient public education system. It's actions like that which cause people to label him a socialist.  The same thing goes for his health care plan, his tax plans, etc etc. Updated 16 Jun 2012 • View Upvotes
