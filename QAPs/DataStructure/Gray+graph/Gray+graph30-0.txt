Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Can you discover something that doesn't exist? Here is why I ask: there is at least one theorem (though I'll be damned if I can remember which one it was) that was proven by first defining a particular class of mathematical objects, then very carefully building up a theory of these objects, proving what their properties would have to be, and then proving that there exist no such objects! So, I have to ask: were these objects (of which there exist no examples) discovered or invented? I am not sure that I have a simple answer to that. I will say that mathematics done well certainly feels like a discovery, rather than an invention. A well-crafted mathematical theory should leave one with a sense that of course everything was defined this way---how could it have been defined in any other way? In practice, it can be a good deal more messy. Oftentimes, you start with a vague idea of what something should look like, but without any certainty about the specifics. In such circumstances, definitions change as necessary, until people hit on the ideas that work. Does this mean that it is a discovery or an invention? After all, you may have to do some tinkering in order to get the results that you desire, which suggests that it is an invention. On the other hand, what results will work was determined long before you ever put pen to paper, which suggests that it had to be a discovery. At the end of the day, can we not accept that, just like light has a wave-particle duality, mathematics can have a discovery-invention duality?
