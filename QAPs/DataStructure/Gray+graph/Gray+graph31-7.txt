Why are people suddenly using Quora?A half-dozen people have followed me over the holiday...
I found out about Quora  awhile ago, joined, then promptly forgot I did so (other than the digest emails I got once a week). One of the questions in that email was so intriguing that I logged in here.  I'm now addicted!
