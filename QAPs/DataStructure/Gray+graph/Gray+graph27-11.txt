This may sound pithy, but it's highly effective: Get out of your head and do something for others. Volunteer at a homeless shelter. Mentor younger students. Teach music to children.  Help out at retirement homes.  We often try to heal ourselves by focusing on ourselves.  Paradoxically, the best way to heal yourself is to heal others.
