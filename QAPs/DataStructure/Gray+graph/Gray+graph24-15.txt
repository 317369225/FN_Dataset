If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
I don't know exact the kind of "programming" you want but seems that it's synonym with competitive programming. And it seems you just want to challenge, since you treat web programming as "easier". If you just want to challenge, the answer is you can improve through practices, because purpose of competitive programming is make your brain works. But don't focus on that too long, just treat those mathematics, stacks, queues problems as brain games. Just treat them as games, and try to enjoy them. Don't be serious, unless you want to become a game programmer. P/S: But nowaday, game programming sometimes is easier than others because of game authoring tools like Unity.
