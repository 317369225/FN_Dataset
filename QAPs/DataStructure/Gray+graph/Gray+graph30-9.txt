Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Originally Answered: Was mathematics discovered or invented?As a mathematical realist, I would say discovery even though I cannot give a very convincing argument in support of it.   To answer the question, three things need to be taken into account: 1. Ontology: how, where and what about the existence of mathematical entities.  2. Epistemology: how we, as intelligent cognizant systems, gain knowledge of it. 3. It's relationship to scientific world: why mathematics gels so well with scientific theories.   For  the invention argument, it can be said that mathematics is invented,  exist as memes. But still many ontological questions remain  unanswered.For an already existing mathematical system with given set of  axioms, at given time there exist provable yet not proved theorems.  When complex numbers were invented, were the Mandelbrot set and Julia  set non-existent? Epistemological  questions, on surface, may appear to be trivially answered under  invention argument. But still questions remain like how come various  civilizations in history independently discovered the same mathematical  principles (borrowed the sentence from above anonymous answer) ? As for it's relationship to the scientific world, invention argument needs to come up with a convincing argument. From a realist point of view, I am not in a position to give detail explanation of the ontology but, as Jack Dahlgren mentioned, mathematics exists as logical structure abstracted from physical world.  The epistemological questions and it's relationship to scientific world are easily answered and are quite obvious to an extend.
