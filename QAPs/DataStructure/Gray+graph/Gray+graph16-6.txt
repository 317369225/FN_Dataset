What is "tensor calculus" and why did Einstein need it for some of his theories?
When quantities consist of only one number describing them, such as temperature, we use the word "scalar" to describe them. When a quantity requires more numbers, such as a position and a magnitude, such as spatial coordinates or a magnitude and a direction such as a force, we call those quantities "vectors". When we have quantities that require more numbers, not merely a magnitude and a direction, but also an oriented area surface that they act over, then such quantities are called "tensors", if they obey a particular transformation law. Stress and strain are examples of tensor quantities. When we are talking about the shape of space, then very quickly we are talking about tensor quantities. Hence, Einstein's need for this in general relativity.
