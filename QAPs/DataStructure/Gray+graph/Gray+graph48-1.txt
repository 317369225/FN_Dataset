How does information theory relate to image processing?
Saying that information theory is pretty limited when it comes to images is a little bit like saying that number theory is pretty limited when it comes to encryption systems. In either case they are relevant to more than just the given subject, and also relevant to the subject in specific ways. Many compression algorithms for video and images use ideas from information theory such as entropy coding (e.g. Huffman coding), arithmetic coding, scalar and vector quantization and context modeling. Transform coding (doing a Fourier transform prior to quantization) has been justified using foundational arguments from Rate distortion theory. Motion estimation in videos is a form of differential entropy coding. Filtering images does change the entropy of the result and the data processing inequality can be used to reason about this kind of transformations in information theoretic terms. Do people that do research on images must know information theory? Not necessarily, however it does function as a foundation to reason formally about many relevant things and I think it is worth familiarizing one self with it.
