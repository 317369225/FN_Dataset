Why is serendipity hard on the internet?It seems to me that something about the way that the web is structured prevents completely random discoveries. I can stumble across new blogs on topics I'm interested in, but it's harder to stumble across new topics to be interested in. Why?
I really liked what Adriaan Pelzer said about random being easy. It's unexpected relevance, which is precisely what serendipity is, that's tough on the Internet. But this is what StumbleUpon works on! (disclosure: I work there). We hold social, interest, and peer graphs in balance to provide the most high quality and relevant internet exploration experience possible for each individual. Here's more on how that works: http://www.stumbleupon.com/sublo...
