How can electric cars be more environmentally friendly when electricity is mostly generated by burning coal?
Answers here indicate efficiency increase as immediate justification for switching to electric cars on basis of environment friendliness. There are few more reasons for it. 1. Environment is, not always about global climate change and carbon emissions. Most important environmental parameter which we deal with in our daily lives is ambient air quality or air pollution of our cities. Electric vehicles are so much better at this. Imagine air quality of our cities is very similar to what himalayan villages have. 2. Having electric cars provide a transition to the future where electricity is increasingly produced in environmentally better ways. Germany's one fifth electricity now comes from solar, texas has budding wind farm industry, among fossil fuels gas (which is cleaner than coal) is cannibalizing coal. 3. By shifting the Carbon Emissions from many small sources (read. cars) to big consolidated sources (read. coal power plants), capture carbon dioxide is made easier. We can expect carbon capture technology to become a reality in a decade.
