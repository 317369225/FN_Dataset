If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
Thanks for A2A. Practice practice practice! I've only been coding for a couple months and I am so much better at figuring out how to solve problems than when I first started. It's easy to start doubting your ability when you struggle with a problem, but that's what programming is about. If you're not struggling, that means you're not pushing yourself (and therefore not growing and improving). If you were solving coding problems very easily, then you're not really pushing yourself and therefore not improving, and you should seek out harder problems to solve. Keep at it. The rewards are well worth the sacrifice.
