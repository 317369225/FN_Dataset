I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
The solution is very simple. I didn't say its easy but its simple. First of all regarding your boyfriend. Everything happens for a reason, don't try to figure it out now, let it go. Don't dwell in past, don't try to figure out the future. Remember you can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only comedy them looking backwards. Just let it go and live in the present and you will be astonished to see howÂ  uncomplicated your life has become. Once you start to live in the present moment by letting everything go, everything will automatically become right. But if keep on dwelling in the past nothing will change. Maybe its good, maybe not, who knows, just live your life. That was just a bad experience and experiences are there to help us grow, make our life better. JUST LET ALMIGHTY HANDLE THE REST!!!
