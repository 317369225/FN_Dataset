Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
Google/RSS is helpful to aggregate and preserve (within limits) info passively.  Twitter by definition far more instant and active.  Enabling you to trade that information on a real-time basis.  I find myself on Twitter far more than checking in with Google Reader ... I'm sure there is a client app incorporating both ... if not there should be so you can choose w/o leaving one for the other.
