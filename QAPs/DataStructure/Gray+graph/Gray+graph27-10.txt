I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
Please , NEVER lose hope to live. You are just at the starting juncture of the valuable experience called Life.Be grateful for the beautiful life you have been given.Be assured that there are many more simply lovely moments to come:) . Boys like these don't deserve your love or concern since they probably aren't even thinking of you even for a moment . He's focussing on his studies you say. I would advise you to not feel disheartened and to focus on your career once you feel you are ready to. Give this matter some time , time is the best medicine . At the end, you'll understand that a guy probably isn't worth sacrificing your dreams for , and most important , no person is worth hurting your parents for. Your parents brought you into this world, I would suggest you spend more of your  time with them and you'll definitely feel better , I assure you.        As for the guy, you deserve a much better partner than an irrational, whimsical person. Just think of it as what God does , is always for the best, and God has a better plan for you, for sure! :) Focus on your job seeking, as of now. You say you were a bright student , and I'm sure that sooner or later, you'll be able to put your talent to best use. All the best! :) Hope I helped you to feel more cheerful and optimistic . Never give up, you'll surely get the happiness you deserve.
