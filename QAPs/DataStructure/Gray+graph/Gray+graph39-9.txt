Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
He's not. He's not even a liberal, by the standard I grew up with. That's just a form of attack, like every other form of attack used by the Other Side. They've been tossing "socialist" at Democratic presidents since FDR, mostly because people fall for it.
