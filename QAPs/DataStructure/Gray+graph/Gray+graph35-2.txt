What is the outcome of a $15 minimum wage in the U.S.?
Gotta love the supply/demand curve jockeys who believe in abstract analysis more than real-world experience.  While 15 dollars is on the high side of any discussion, even in liberal ranks, experience here and abroad suggests that a minimum wage up to about 50% of the nominal median wage is unlikely to result in dramatic changes, including employment levels. "A famous 1990 study, by David Card and Alan Krueger, compared fast food employment in New Jersey and Pennsylvania after one state increased its minimum wage and the other didn’t. They didn’t find a significant effect on employment. Another landmark paper looked at US restaurant employment in 288 different pairs of adjacent counties that had different minimum wages. They found that minimum wages are effective in boosting pay, but they don’t harm employment." $15 is clearly politically unviable and pushes the limit of the 50% of median wage (currently $29k+) guidance.  $10-$12 would be a more prudent proposal for the near term, IMHO.
