What are the rookie mistakes a person makes while starting to practice for competitive programming?
The single most important tip is: learn to use existing knowledge base. (Since after edit the question title asks about mistakes, the single worst mistake is not using existing knowledge base).   Take, for example, this question. It is an aggregate of several most frequently asked questions here on Quora, meaning there already exist multiple copies of each question you ask, answered by a lot of people - especially the "tips" one, it comes up every week! Why not look through Quora questions before asking? For example, starting over is covered in What would you do- what would have been your strategy, if you are again given a chance to re-start learning programming?   Asking questions without doing a bit of research first is plain wrong midset for programming competitions (and for programming as a whole, which I observe daily, but that's a separate topic). If you wait for an answer or advise to be placed in front of you, you'll benefit very little from it, as opposed for looking for it yourself. You are not going to wait for an answer placed in front of you during a competition, do you? Updated 80w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Jatin Bhatia
