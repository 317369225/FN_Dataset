Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Mathematics, like many other things in Science, is a mechanism to describe the world around us. This mechanism, including the methodology to measure things up, the language to express our findings as well as the patterns that are named under labels such as theorems and axioms were invented by the human mind as a helping tool in recording, describing and explaining how the world works. The reason why this question exists is that people confuse Mathematics, the language and mechanism we use to describe nature, with nature itself. Humanity invented mathematics as a way to describe nature, but everything that mathematics describes was already part of nature way before humanity even existed. Mathematics is a tool that allows humanity to record, describe and explain discoveries about nature. Mathematics was invented by humanity, as a tool, but the notions that mathematics record, describe and explain were always there and they were discovered by humanity along our history.
