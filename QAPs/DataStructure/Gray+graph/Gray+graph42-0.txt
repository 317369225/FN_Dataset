Are there more or less UFO sightings after the proliferation of photo-capable mobile devices?
I'm not sure where Jon has gotten his information, but from the sources I've looked at, it seems there has been a significant increase in UFO reports since the introduction of photo-capable mobile devices.Â  It's possible that the general increase in UFO reports over the last decade or so are due to people finding it easier to sit down and google how to report them, so how meaningful the statistics below are is a question, but for whatever reason, there has been a pretty dramatic increase in the number of reports in recent years, peaking in 2012, and then declining again somewhat in February of this year. (According to both MUFON and NUFORC - which probably hold the largest databases of reports). According to MUFON, which is the largest organization that accepts and investigates reports of UFOs, the number of reports they receive has been increasing dramatically in the last several years: Quote below from this article: UFO witness reports on rise: U.S. investigations expanding "While the witness database of reports appears to be growing by about 30 percent annually, here are some annual numbers of total reports from Robert Powell, MUFON's Director of Research: 2007, 2,203 reports; 2008, 4,220 reports; 2009, 4,990 reports; 2010, 4,534 reports; 2011, 5,137. During the first 10 months of 2012, MUFON has received a total of 7,272 reports." "In 2006 there were 1,733 cases filed with MUFON," according to Fletcher Gray, MUFON's deputy director of investigations. "This is an average of 144 cases a month over a 12-month period. Here we are in 2012 and the year has not ended and MUFON's average caseload for the United States is more than 700 cases per month." Here is a graph of UFO reports submitted to MUFON between 2000 and 2009 (from this article: Trends in UFO reporting reveal the real hotspots) This is a graph of reports to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) between 1945 and 2006: This is a graph of UFO reports in Canada between 1989-2012 compiled as part of the Canadian UFO survey : That said, whether an increase in reports has anything to do with the ubiquity of cameras in recent years is unclear, but it certainly plays into what I would assume is an increasing percentage of reports that include photos and videos.
