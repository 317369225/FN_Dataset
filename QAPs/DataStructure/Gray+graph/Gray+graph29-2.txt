Why darker area of Spectrograms means higher amplitude?I believe the Spectrograms is just frequency changes along the time, so is it should be a line in the figure? say the figure is sound wave, frequency zero means no air pressure in mouth. But I do not understand why the darker area means higher amplitude? I think darker means there are more time span on that frequency, so more lines make it darker?
