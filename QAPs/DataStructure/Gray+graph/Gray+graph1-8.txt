Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
Twitter definitely pulled me away from Google Reader, which I found hard to manage and actually guilty about. However, using the NewsRack app on my iPad has brought me back, and helped me streamline, revisit, and clear out the old junk. Kinda like facing a closet or a drawer that you know is filled with treasure, but the clear out task seems overwhelming.
