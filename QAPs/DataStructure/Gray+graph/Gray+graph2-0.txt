What are the services Louis Gray uses every day?What I want to know is how does Louis Gray process 000s of stories, blogs, feeds and tweets each day. Let's find out from the maestro.
Services I use are varied based on their function. There's no magic, just consistency. As Robert Diana noted, I do use Google Reader throughout the day to catch up on hundreds of blogs. I tend to skim most, share a few and read the full context for many. Increasingly, especially on mobile devices, I am relying on My6sense (product) to surface the best stuff for me - which is why I joined them as VP of Marketing in August. In addition to Google Reader... I use Icerocket.com to track mentions and links, as it is the best Blog Search and Realtime Search on the Web. I use Google Alerts as well, but find this less useful. I use SiteMeter and ChartBeat to see realtime visitors to the blog and their origin, which helps me find new links and new services. I use Tweetie for Mac to read and manage multiple Twitter accounts. I use Twitter (product), Facebook, FriendFeed (acquired company), and Google Buzz to see what the world is saying and sharing. Clearly, I use Quora as well, as more people from my social graph and important business and tech leaders participate. My blog is hosted by Blogger (product) and I use the Samsung Galaxy Tab and the Epic 4G for mobile connections. Both are powered by Android (operating system), which has built in notifications for mentions on Twitter, and updates via E-mail and Facebook. The best way to find stories is to observe for new things and interact with the entrepreneurs by email and phone, beyond scanning referral logs and watching for stray social media mentions. If I do find I think I have something new that has not been reported, I check both Google Blogsearch and Icerocket to see if I am new to the game. This increases the chance I will write.
