For people who like being dazzled by genuinely new knowledge, what are some of the best books you have read?I am talking about books from a wide variety of fields, such as, Anthropology, Physics, Linguistics, Technology, etc.
The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses by Jesse Schell. Even though the title might make you think it's only oriented for those wanting to learn about game design the book is written in such a way that it can be applied to many other forms of creative design, there's also a lot of other great tips in here that I've actually found myselfÂ  applying on my daily life. It's a great and enjoyable read, you can always look for a better resume at Google to try and get a better idea, but I'd kindly encourage you to read it.
