What is "tensor calculus" and why did Einstein need it for some of his theories?
Asked to answer -- http://www.quora.com/What-is-tensor-calculus-and-why-did-Einstein-need-it-for-some-of-his-theories/answer/Rob-Campbell-13 and http://www.quora.com/What-is-tensor-calculus-and-why-did-Einstein-need-it-for-some-of-his-theories/answers/3938701 both provide good answers but I'll add a slightly more abstract perspective. For a few centuries mathematics and physics were dominated by the space of real numbers, R n   .  It was on this very well-behaved space where calculus, and later real analysis, and the calculus-based physical theories of classical mechanics and electromagnetism were all developed. But by the late 19th century and through the early 20th century, mathematicians were abstracting R n   by peeling away various assumptions.  Eventually they found the simplest space on which one can do calculus -- the differentiable manifold.  Manifolds are spaces that look like R n   only locally, and they provide the power to model objects like curved surfaces embedded in higher-dimensional spaces (although they are much more general than that). Einstein collaborated with many of the pioneers of this field, which was known as tensor calculus in its earliest incarnations, and noted that the assumptions implicitly in the use of R n   were too rigid to generalize special relativity.  By taking advantage of manifolds he was able to develop general relativity in a very elegant and straightforward manner.  Since then manifold have been embraced even further, and now just about every physical theory, from classical mechanics to thermodynamics to quantum field theory and even string theory, is defined on an abstract manifold.
