How important is social media monitoring in your company? How much time and money do you invest in it?In my experience, social media monitoring it’s an important step in every company, regardless of the industry, and can bring great benefits for a business if it’s properly managed. Do you have such a service in your company? Do you think it should be automated or handled manually?
Yes, I'm building something in this space. Something far more advanced than the basic monitoring metrics. But as Steven Kolinsky mentioned, my monitoring technique would have a heavy usage of manual interference until we reach a stage of error free semantic Technology.
