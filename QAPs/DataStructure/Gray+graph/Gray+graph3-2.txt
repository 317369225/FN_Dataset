Why is serendipity hard on the internet?It seems to me that something about the way that the web is structured prevents completely random discoveries. I can stumble across new blogs on topics I'm interested in, but it's harder to stumble across new topics to be interested in. Why?
well, the internet is, at its very core, a set of relations and interconnections so one could argue that that's the reason, since everything is already connected somehow by someone, random discoveries are hard to make unless you through some means are able to find an 'uncharted' piece of the internet which you can connect to the whole network. I guess that would be a serendipituous dicovery
