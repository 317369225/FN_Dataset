Was mathematics invented or discovered?
This question kept me up all night....for a lot of nights. I've read some great answers and arguments here with a lot of insight. I'm no expert in this subject but I absolutely love and appreciate it. Currently I am reading 'Mathematics for the Non-Mathematician' by Morris Kline who considers mathematics to be an artistic language, that is certainly invented. Here's an excerpt from his book.   Mathematics is a human creation. Although most Greeks did believe that mathematics did exist independent of human beings as the planets and mountains seem to, and that all that human beings do is  discover more and more of the structure, the prevalent belief today is that mathematics is entirely a human product. The concepts, the axioms, and the theorems established are all created by human beings in mans attempt to understand his environment, to give play to his artistic instincts, and to engage in absorbing intellectual activity. While mathematics produce formulas, no formula produces mathematics. The lives and activities of the men who study mathematics is also fascinating. The special talent, if there is such, which makes mathematicians have been found in Casanovas and ascetics, among business men and philosophers, among atheists and profoundly religious. Recognition of human element in mathematics explains in large measure the differences in the mathematics produced by different civilizations and the sudden spurts made in new directions by virtue of insight made by genius. - Morris Kline
