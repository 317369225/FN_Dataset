Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
Is the president a socialist in the true sense of the word?  no and anyone who says so is just parroting their party line. he is a person that believes that collectivism is better than individualism, this is what shapes his beliefs and policies.  That's the issue that most on the right and those who stand for individual liberties have with theman.  But socialist, no....
