Was mathematics invented or discovered?
I don't really understand the either/or. Mathematics is a tool - like screwdrivers and computers. It is something humans invented. There were no mathematical scrawlings before humans came along and I don't think the birds and the fishes were thinking seriously about mathematics before us. However, once I have a tool in my hand, like a screwdriver, I can discover all kinds of uses it wasn't invented for. It can open paint cans, act as a shim or even help me to recover that coin that fell under the car seat. Much the same goes for mathematics - except that mathematics is a much more complex tool than a screwdriver, and so there is a lot more to discover about it, and there are many more parts waiting to be invented.
