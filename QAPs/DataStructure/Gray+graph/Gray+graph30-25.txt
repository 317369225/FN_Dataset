Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Originally Answered: Is math discovered or invented?I suppose this asks the root question, "Is match a natural invention or a human invention." What qualifies each? A human invention is something like this wonderful tea I'm drinking. (It really is good!). It was invented by someone who brought together the natural world and made it into something new. Thus, we can define a human invention as something created by a human that brings together the natural world to create something new. A natural invention is something like the clouds. It's something that would've existed without any human interference. So we can define a natural invention as something that would've existed without human intervention. So what about math? Well, math is much more abstract than the examples I used above. But let's get to it: Would math have existed without human intervention? No. Math is a human invention. Math is a tool -- a tool used by humans. No one and nothing else uses math except for us. Math may reference the natural world, but it is not to be confused with a natural invention. In conclusion, Math is a human invention. It was invented.
