How can I make my blog content more visible/shareable?
An easy way to make you content more visible is to improve the visuals in the content. With some good images can make your content more appealing to read. A big problem I see with most content marketers, is they treat visuals like an afterthought. More often than not, they throw in a crap stock photo at the top of their post and call it good on visuals. Here are some ideas: Screenshots - If you are talking about anything that happens on a screen, screenshots with annotations add a lot of value to your writing. It makes your ideas easier to understand. Charts and graphs - Graphs seem like a boring idea, but they can be powerful tools for storytelling. They help people visualize the  highs and lows of a journey. You must choose the right metrics to really  flesh that story out, and sometimes that involves information you’re  not always comfortable sharing. Infographics - Usually get a lot of shares, but they can be time consuming. I recommend using an old piece of content that was popular and converting that into an infographic. This will give you a better chance of it bring popular and worth your time investment as well. Quotable social images - This is my favorite stock photo replacement. ools like Canva  allow you to easily place text over images with plenty of templates to  get the image the way you want it. This is a great way to take some of  the quotables out of your content and place them on relevant images for  easy sharing that will drive more visitors to your content.
