I want to learn quantum mechanics. Where do I begin?
Read these three books: 1st for a theoretical understanding of the extreme basics of QM, I recommend: 1) The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics Followed by 2: 2) Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum: Leonard Susskind, Art Friedman: 9780465036677: Amazon.com: Books These books provide a good enough technical understanding of QM for non-physicists. Furthermore they start out from the very basics of Calculus in the first book, all the way to the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, i.e. a quantum mechanical mass on a spring. For one of the most important applications of QM, read this book: Quantum Computing since Democritus: Scott Aaronson: 9780521786492: Amazon.com: Books
