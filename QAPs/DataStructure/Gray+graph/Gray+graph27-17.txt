I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
I want to suggest two rules for life as so you can move further in your life.   " Care About Those only Who Care about YOU " " Give Love back to Those only  Who Loves YOU " Don't waste your time and energy on those people who has no respect and care to you. Have some value to yourself. I can understand it takes time to forgot your dearest person. But believe me you will find not a lot but few people who silently care for you so have good time with those people. Find a person who energies you with positive thoughts during your tough time. ( Or I think Quora is also a great source to energies yourself ). There are some suggestion so you can come out from depression :- Try to busy yourself in whatever things you love to do. Plug in fast music (which you like ) in your ears , pack yourself in room and dance until you not tired off. Not just think , write down it somewhere. ( May be some day it comes as novel and you recognised as writer). just a thought Join a gym, keep yourself healthy. Travel to different places with friends or family. Have some conversation with your parents regularly. If you have time , join a class of your interested skill like playing guitar , dance , painting, signing etc. You have to be happy either to show that person or to believe that your life is not dependent on one person. You are a diamond for your parents. When you will not be in this world no one cares but they ( your parents ) will lost their precious diamond.
