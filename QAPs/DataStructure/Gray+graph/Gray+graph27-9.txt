I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
Wow, it seems that you're pretty mixed up. Firstly, you WILL get through this, you may not believe it now, but you will. How do I know this as fact? 6 years ago, I lost my wife, soul mate and mother of our son to cancer. We had known each other since we were 11, she was 36 when she passed away. I went through similar times, severe depression, I didn't want anything, couldn't function ... I lost our family home & my business. Her death effectively ended my life for 5 years or more, the only thing that stopped me joining her was our son, who at the time of writing is now 9. Anti depressants can help, don't be afraid of exploring that option, I describe them as something that keeps you more level ... no more, no less. Instead of having the real low points, let's say 2 out of 10, you are midway, 4 / 10. The flip side of that is that you don't have real high points either 6/10 rather than 9/10. Does that make sense? Do not concentrate or focus on what you've lost, just focus on the day, what you need to do and what you want to achieve. Personally speaking, it seems as though you need to let it go; if it is meant to be, then it will be. Chasing him won't help. To read more of my story, have a look here ...
