Words: Is there an online tool to accurately assess the relative rarity of a word in English?I'm looking for something more definitive than just guessing from the number of returned results of a search engine llike google.
Bill Welden's answer is correct, andÂ  if you want to go directly to the search engine that graphically plots a word's frequency over time, try https://books.google.com/ngrams/. Going directly to this URL also gives you the advantage of being able to plot two or more words on the same graph, to test their frequency relative to each other. It will also accept multi-word expressions.
