Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
Barack Obama is not a socialist. His policies don't include the expropriation of the owners of the means of production to make them, in one way or another, public, the property of society. His policy towards healthcare is not socialist (independent of his personal opinions). Rather, it can be best called a social welfare policy, and a weak one at that. The American healthcare system will remain largely the same; it is far from the universal heallthcare systems that all other industrialized nations possess, a product of their welfare state policies, not socialism.
