Why was the word 'Internet' used in the 1620s?According to Wolfram Alpha's word frequency history
It wasn't. Querying for [internet word frequency] on WolframAlpha pulls up the graph that suggests there are a few hundred instances of the word "internet" used in the 1620s.  Examining the sources [1] for that page shows that the only source that could have potentially provided the word frequency data by year would have been Google's digital book corpus: Michel, J.-B., Y. K. Shen, A. P. Aiden, A. Veres, M. K. Gray, The Google Books Team, J. P. Pickett, D. Hoiberg, D. Clancy, P. Norvig, J. Orwant, S. Pinker, M. A. Nowak, and E. L. Aiden. "Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books." Science 331 (2011): doi:10.1126/science.1199644. Google provides the ability to do a date-restricted query on their books corpus, so we can query for occurrences of [internet] in books written between Jan 1, 1600 and Jan 1, 1700: https://www.google.com/search?q=... Google returns about 5810 results with the word "internet" in the snippets, but clicking on the actual results reveals that optical character recognition merely misclassified words like "internor" or "interpret" as "internet." Ultimately, this reveals limitations in our current optical character recognition algorithms. [1] http://www.wolframalpha.com/inpu... Updated 10 Mar 2012 • View Upvotes
