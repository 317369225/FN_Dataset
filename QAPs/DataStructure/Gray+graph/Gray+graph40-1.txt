Can colorblind people use red-and-blue 3D glasses and experience a 3D effect?
Contrary to Brian's very scientific answer I don't think it would matter if you were colour blind. The coloured lenses work as a filter to separate the images into left and right, this is all done before the image has reached your eye so how you perceive the colours should not have any effect. The modern Dolby 3D system uses coloured lenses in the same way as the old fashioned glasses, the colour differences are just far less pronounced. I haven't heard of any complaints about this system relating to colour blindness. Super Special Bonus Info - Strangely most people who can't view modern 3D are left-handed.
