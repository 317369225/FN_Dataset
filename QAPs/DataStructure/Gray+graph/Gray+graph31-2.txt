Why are people suddenly using Quora?A half-dozen people have followed me over the holiday...
Here's my take on Quora and it's appeal.  Let’s Talk about Quora: http://bit.ly/g8i8aG As I wrote in this post, I believe that Quora is unique in the thought provoking dialogue and conversations about different topics that it's been able to produce (and which run the gamut from social media to business and philosophy). For me the feel of Quora is reminiscent of some of my favorite graduate level courses at University. It is that exploration that makes it so attractive (for me). When I asked folks on Twitter what they thought of Quora, one person responded: “It’s like twitter, but just for smart people.”  When I read his tweet, I had to laugh because though I see it slightly differently, I could definitely see where he was coming from in his response.  There is a high caliber of conversation that is happening on Quora.  Moreover, it's happening among thought leaders and influencers who have been the early adopters of this platform and who are engaging in an honest exchange of ideas and friendly debate.  To date I've mostly been a voracious reader of the different points of view presented on this platform.  I'm hoping to have some time this week-end to dive a little deeper and share some further thoughts with the great community found here.
