Is there a climate computer model that can accurately arrive at today's climate with only historical data?
When comparing climate models to any historical observation, it is critical to decide what your metric of comparison is. You say "today's climate," but do you mean "today's surface temperature" or "today's precipitation patterns" or "today's cloud variability," or all of the above? For example, some models are 99% effective (meaning they model the historical data at 0.99 correlation) at hindcasting surface temperature variations (including after volcanic eruptions), but they have extremely low skill at recreating the precipitation patterns we've observed. So, first, decide what aspect of the climate model is most important to your overall question. Additionally, looking at only one climate model, however "good" it is, is not the way to qualify this question. The real effective diagnostic evaluation of climate models is the multi-model mean of all available models, and how large the spread is between all of those models for a given comparison metric. This allows us to identify areas where models can be improved and/or are in the most disagreement. As a first shot, I suggest reading the executive summary and the main text (section 9.4 especially) of Chapter 9 of the 2013 WG1 report of the IPCC.
