What are the rookie mistakes a person makes while starting to practice for competitive programming?
Here are few pointers from my experience. 1. Initially we all are boosted up about competitions organized on sites likeÂ  Codechef and Codeforces to fight for that glory. but there are whole other level of mistakes involved. Long running contests like Codechef 10-day challenge is kind of the biggest mistake a rookie(who has just entered in this field) can make. We all want to have that good rank in long contests to flaunt about, but wasting 10 days on 4-5 questions that's pretty harsh for brain too.You can't get all questions in beginning, so most of the time you will end up figuring out the meaning of question . Sometimes it may happen that question looking like a mountain now may feel like a simple one later on when you have prepared enough and tested waters. Many beginners like me did that mistake and I became more question focused than concept focused. "To OVERCOME this mistake, make sure you practice more and more question on SPOJ, TIMUS, CODEFORCES and other judges. it would be better if you practice by topic like starting from "Number Theory and Simple AD-Hocs " and finally reaching topics like "Graph theory and DP". 2. If you are in a contest, make sure you try/attempts all questions of your known domain. Say, there are 2-3 questions about graph theory and you know graph theory even little bit but somehow you couldn't get them accepted, make sure you try them after contest, with or without the help of editorial.This way you can be more experienced of that topic and more prepared next time. :) 3. Make sure you know your coding language fully. Sometimes simple syntax error can take lot of your time. 4. Most importantly,make sure you Practice , lot , a lot , a whole lot.... Best of luck !
