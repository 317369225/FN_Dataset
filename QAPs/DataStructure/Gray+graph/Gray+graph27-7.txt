I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
What you are feeling for him is NOT LOVE. It is a sort of addiction to another person that some people call "codependence." It's where you lose your own identity because it is absorbed into someone else's life, personality, or state of mind. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG with taking antidepressants. They can help, and they rarely cause any terrible side effects. They are not "sleepy" or "dopey" drugs, but just something to help you manage your moods. You need to talk to a counselor. You can recover from your addiction to this man, just as if you were addicted to drugs or alcohol. I'm not speaking metaphorically -- you have an actual chemical addiction, just like to a drug. The difference is that the chemicals are manufactured in your own body, and piped into your brain in ways that are related to this person. It is not easy, and has nothing to do with will power. It's why people seek treatment or help when they are addicted to something -- because it's NOT easy, and because it has NOTHING to do with whether or not you're a good person, a strong person, a smart person, or anything else. You're a human being and thus you are potentially vulnerable to addiction. It's no different than being vulnerable to catching cold. Would you feel like a failure for catching cold? Or if you did catch cold, would you feel like you were weak or wrong for taking cold medicine? It feels like you are having emotions about this, but actually you are having something very much like drug cravings. Please get some help.
