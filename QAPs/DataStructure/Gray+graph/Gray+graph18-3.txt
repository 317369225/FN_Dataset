How can we find all simple cycles in an undirected graph efficiently?
Each node gets its number as its value Now repeat the following steps: each node gives its value to everything it's connected to each node takes as its new value the max of the value it already had, and what it just received. stop repeating when values no longer change now group nodes by value: ones with equal value are in the same cycle. On further consideration, this is the algorithm for connected components, which is related but not the same. A node can be in two simple cycles but only in one connected component. I don't know if this algorithm can be extended to that question. Updated 7 Mar 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
