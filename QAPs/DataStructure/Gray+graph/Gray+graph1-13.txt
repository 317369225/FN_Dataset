Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
I use both google reader and twitter. where twitter helps me to get quick streams of information the content is often sporadic and multi-faceted in nature depending on whom i am following. i find with reader the content is updated regularly as a news feed which makes for more considered reading. i dont find that they necessarily compete for my usage attention. when i have the time i use reader and i when i need quick updates i hop onto twitter. mobile integration also goes a long way to consolidate.
