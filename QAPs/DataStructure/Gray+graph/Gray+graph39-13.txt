Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
I'm much more comfortable with the idea that President Obama is a corporate lackey, in comparison with being a Socialist.  Dyed-in-the-wool socialist hate money, the responsibility of owning stuff and want to live in a yurt and eat granola.  Corporate lackeys are a different breed altogether.  They want to grease the skids for corporations, as long as the corporations cut them in on the take.  They like money and the power and stuff that it buys.  Corporate lackeys, however, can't run squat! Just look at what President Obama did with the Annenberg Challenge in Chicago: Spent millions of dollars to "change" school outcomes of children, but in the end, there was no difference between what he did and normal Chicago public schools. So is President Obama a socialist?  No more than both Bushes, or Clinton.  Is he a "corporatist" (facist?).  Maybe.  In a great article by "The New American",  http://www.thenewamerican.com/ec... , Robert Locke is quoted as saying: "The point to all this is that if we going to criticize the Obama  administration’s economic policies, we need to be sure we have its  economics right — and if we are paying attention, we see far more continuity with past administrations than we do change.  There have been no fundamental changes, despite candidate-Obama’s  mantra about “change you can believe in.”  (For this reason, many on the  Left have grown as uneasy with this administration as any Tea Partier,  even if for different reasons.)
