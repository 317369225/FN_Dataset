Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Originally Answered: Did humans invent mathematics or did it already exist?It's all invented by people.  Mathematics is part of our language to describe reality.  There are many mathematical descriptions of reality, called mathematical models, and some of these models are pretty good, so we use them.  That's what science is about.  Science studies reality, constructs models of reality, and evaluates those models.  Science overlaps engineering and technology which use those models. Mathematics, science, engineering, and technology are closely intertwined, and they're all invented by people. Updated 2 Sep • View Upvotes
