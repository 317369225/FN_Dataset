I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
Ohk first of all your problem isn't your boyfriend, it's you. Four years in college transformed my way of thinking completely. You correctly mentioned it's not that you can't get over him it's that you don't want to. You need to understand something that your life is just not worth giving up, for one guy who doesn't even love you.No matter how much you love someone it's you who matters the most. If someone you love decides to leave, you let them go. You can't force your love on them and ask them to stay. Instead you move on with a thought that for what it was worth, you had a great time. If they loved you the same amount they'll come back but you don't wait, you move on. You said you still have some self respect left, then just respect yourself and come out of this situation that's been troubling you and your parents both. No matter how much the guy loved you, your parents have loved you more than that and always will. You can try engaging yourself in the things that you like to do, for example, pursue your interests. All this will keep you involved and you won't have time to think about it. Keep yourself busy. Bottom line, your life is worth much more than this. Just move on, if it has to come back it'll or else you have many more adventures in life to see. Always!always! seek love only where you have a chance to find it or else you'll end up disappointed. Good luck and love yourself first!
