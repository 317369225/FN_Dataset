Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
I note that after a mostly flat rate in most of 2010, the pickup has started again. Does this rise coincide with the release of the official Google Reader Android app? I use Google Reader quite a bit - I follow some quality RSS feeds, and also stream my LinkedIn updates there. Plus, sharing goodies in Google Reader is great for my team, instead of spamming up Twitter etc. I think Google Reader has evolved, both to the tune of Social Media and Mobile.
