How important is social media monitoring in your company? How much time and money do you invest in it?In my experience, social media monitoring it’s an important step in every company, regardless of the industry, and can bring great benefits for a business if it’s properly managed. Do you have such a service in your company? Do you think it should be automated or handled manually?
With social media management, monitoring, analytics, and social media lead generation, a few rules apply: Be ruthlessly efficient with your time. Earmark 1-2 hours each day and that's all you have to do what you have to. Respond, comment, say thanks,  point out something, make a few mentions, like, Tweet, ReTweet, whatever. Use tools where you have to. You'd need tools to schedule tweets, take stock of conversations on the web, automate parts of social media management, generate and track leads as they come by. Outsource social media management, if you think you are good at it. Your time is better spent running your business and not chasing conversations and putting out fires as they erupt.
