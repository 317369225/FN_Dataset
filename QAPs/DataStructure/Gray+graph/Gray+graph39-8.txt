Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
Originally Answered: Is President Obama a socialist?A number of influential people have been persuaded that Obama is indeed a socialist by the research and reporting done by Stanley Kurtz in his book Radical-In-Chief.  For example, Paul Mirengoff at Powerline - the folks who broke the Rathergate story - gives Kurtz credit for persuading him that Obama is a socialist.  See, http://www.powerlineblog.com/arc...  I may have played a small role in giving more people the courage to probe into Obama's ideological beliefs by being the first person, on record, to verify that Obama was a revolutionary Marxist during his sophomore year at Occidental College in Los Angeles.  See, http://www.newsmax.com/RonaldKes...  "Obama, then," Mirengoff determines, "was a socialist when he left college. As of 1996, there is no good indication that he had abandoned socialism. To the contrary, the best evidence is that he was still a socialist at that time." The larger issue, of course, is whether or not President Obama is still deeply committed to a socialist perspective.  In Mirengoff's analysis, Obama was still a socialist when he was elected president.  See, http://www.powerlineblog.com/arc...  Although Mirengoff no longer blogs for Powerline, his analysis remains a powerful and convincing proof of Obama's commitment to socialist ideology.
