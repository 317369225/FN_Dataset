How important is social media monitoring in your company? How much time and money do you invest in it?In my experience, social media monitoring it’s an important step in every company, regardless of the industry, and can bring great benefits for a business if it’s properly managed. Do you have such a service in your company? Do you think it should be automated or handled manually?
Social media monitoring is important if there are people talking about your brand online, or if you can get them to chat in any way. Social channels should be viewed as another form of communication (in addition to e-mail, phone) and should be treated as such in regards to customer support. Also, social media response should never be automated. You may be able to get away with a few scheduled marketing messages, but your customers will be able to see right through you. They can tell if you're being genuine or robotic. The best advice I can give is dedicate a position to post and respond to customers/fans on all social channels- ideally someone with some experience, (not an intern). From there you can gauge engagement and hire additional employees if necessary.
