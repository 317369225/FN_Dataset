If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
It absolutely needs practice . If you love coding , with a bit of practice you will be able to code . You surely need some knowledge in maths , and you need to know the code syntax and understand the logic of the computer then you just need to use your brain - put it alltogether and : MAGIC ! :) Don't give up ;)
