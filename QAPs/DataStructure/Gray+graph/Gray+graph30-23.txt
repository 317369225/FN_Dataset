Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Discovery (by humans) : Is a human's process of finding already existing* materialistic things  OR  already present nature's rules which can be applied to materialistic things. e.g. human discovered that there were dinosaurs . Invention: Is a process of creating materialistic or non materialistic things which were never there before humans**  e.g. Wheel is an invetion,  though nature had wheel like other structures but creating appropriate stucture like wheel that can be used to transfer things faster from one place to other , is a invention. Mathematics is an Invetion. We dont have any record/proof  that numbers (in the form that we use) were there before us.  And mathematics is just a tool to represent discoveries and invention both of human beings.   Discovery of Gravity is best represented by mathematics. Invention of Rocket works based on mathematics. But this tool called mathematics had to be invented and it's big a tool and still in process of making much bigger tool. *Before human beings started recording things via pictures or actual things. ** or atleast we dont have proof that they existed.
