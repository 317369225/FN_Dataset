Was mathematics invented or discovered?
I should point out that, like many things, this is not simply binary. There are numerous philosophical positions. The two you describe are, as others have pointed out, termed constructivism and platonism, respectively. Though even the term platonism is largely incorrect, since that's just a subset of mathematical realism. There's also constructivism, logicism, formalism, empiricism, intuitionism, social constructivism, and fictionalism to name just some of the more popular ones. Were this a numbers battle (no pun intended) and we were to poll, we'd discover most scientists tend to be platonists.
