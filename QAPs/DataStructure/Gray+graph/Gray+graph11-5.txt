How important is social media monitoring in your company? How much time and money do you invest in it?In my experience, social media monitoring it’s an important step in every company, regardless of the industry, and can bring great benefits for a business if it’s properly managed. Do you have such a service in your company? Do you think it should be automated or handled manually?
Hi I work for Fashionbi (Complete Digital Marketing Tools for the Fashion industry), a social media analytics firm. Having your social media presence monitored can be extremely helpful - especially if you have decided to focus a lot of promotions and marketing in this manner. Regarding time and money invested. Personally, I would suggest having it automated, or having someone with the expertise and capabilities to handle this. It is possible to handle this manually - however, it would save you so much more time that you could save focusing on things that need more of your expertise :)
