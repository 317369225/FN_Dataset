Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
There hasn't been a socialist with any degree of political power in the US since Eugene Debs.   The people who call Obama a socialist are neo-Calhounites and those who despised the 1960s on moral grounds (which is to say they also loathe the Clintons).
