Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
I certainly use it less than I did pre-Twitter, but I've come to feel like RSS is almost a secret weapon, a way of tuning in to the more thoughtful, more nuanced, less of-the-moment sources that don't get much airing in social media (my most used folder in reader is "smart people"). RSS isn't something the "Facebook generation" will ever really care about, and knowing how to use it well can be (IMHO) a competitive advantage.
