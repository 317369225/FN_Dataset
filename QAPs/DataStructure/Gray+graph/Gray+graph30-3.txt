Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Originally Answered: Did humans invent mathematics or did it already exist?Mathematics is all an invention of human beings! Those that argue otherwise usually use examples in which the referent of a mathematical symbol is assumed or is 'obvious'. Whilst doing so may be natural, it is not rigorous. To be similarly non-rigorous: add a dash of rigour and the human intervention will appear. That is, if you really examine what the mathematics means you will find a model, and that model is unquestionably a human invention. Ben Levy may argue that "four ducks and six ducks make ten ducks" and it was always thus even before we discovered it. If you examine it, however, the business of what "four ducks" really means is fraught with difficulty, let alone what it means to "join" another six ducks to produce ten ducks. There are plenty of philosophical, linguistic, and semantic examples that illustrate the difficulties. Adding rigour is not obvious, not easy, and does not give the impression of "always having been there". David Hilbert's program to formalise all of mathematics took many pages to get to 1+1=2  , and ultimately foundered on Gödel's incompleteness theorems. The kind of naïve mathematics that most people think "has always been there" leads to things like Russell's paradox involving self-reference. It is not at all obvious how to get rid of paradoxes like this and others. None of which diminishes my respect for, and admiration of, Plato and his "platonic forms", Pythagoras and his "mystical numbers", or any of a host of others who may think differently to me. In my view, mathematics is already beautiful, significant, and powerful enough without it being somehow "out there waiting to be discovered". Updated 10 Aug • View Upvotes
