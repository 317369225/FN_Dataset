How can electric cars be more environmentally friendly when electricity is mostly generated by burning coal?
They're more efficient, even when running on juice generated by coal (the whole system from acquisition of energy source to transporting it to generating it to "fueling" the car to driving it...). They're cleaner too because power plants are consistently regulated and are a smaller number of "pipes" to keep up with. Cars of various ages and states of repair have various degrees of dirtiness... not so for power plants coupled with electric cars. The word of the day is "efficiency." Oh, and that's before factoring in the fact that hydro, nuclear, and other energy sources, which themselves are cleaner still are in play in most countries and parts of most countries... Or that you can recycle your batteries but you can't recycle your gasoline. Did I mention you can install your own solar panels and generate your own juice at home for free without belching any CO2 or smoke at all?
