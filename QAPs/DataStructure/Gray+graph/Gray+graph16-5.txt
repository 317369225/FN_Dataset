What is "tensor calculus" and why did Einstein need it for some of his theories?
First, calculus.  This is the maths of change.  If a road slopes upward, how much does its elevation chance for each metre along.(metre = meter if you're American.) Or how fast does the position of a sports car change for each second that ticks by.  That's its speed, in metres per second (m/s) or kilometres per hour (km/h).  And that's it.  Calculus is all about change. Imagine you are running for a bus, perhaps at 5 m/s.  This describes how much distance you cover in each second - but not which way. Quantities that only need one number to describe them are called scalars. If you wanted to say which direction you were running as well as how fast, you could tag on something like NE (north east).  The whole thing reads: 5 m/s NE.  But NE or NW are a bit vague.  Sailors and airline pilots wouldn't say 'north', they'd say 000 (zero degrees east of north).  North east becomes 045, east is 090, NW is 270 and so on.  Direction is another scalar, you can completely describe it with one number. Speed + direction (velocity) needs two numbers to describe it.  Quantities like this are called vectors. A map reference needs two numbers so it's a vector.  If you stood at your bedroom door and watched a fly buzzing around, you'd need three numbers to say where it was: height above the floor, distance from the wall with the door, and distance from the wall at right angles to the door. Anything that needs three or more numbers to describe it is called a tensor. The rate of change of the position of the fly involves the change of a three-number quantity - a tensor - with time. That's 'tensor calculus.' The maths behind Einstein's theories involve changes in three or four dimensions (ouch!)  And these changes require tensor calculus. So there.
