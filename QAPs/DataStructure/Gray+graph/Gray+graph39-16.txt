Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
The Republicans and Conservatives are just throwing mud when they say this. Unfortunately, this mud sticks on the huge number of uneducated, unfree minds who vote. On the basis of Obama being a socialist (having some left policies), some even say Socialism and Communism are the same thing. On the same logic, I could call a republican a Fascist for their right wing policies that really does hurt people. You see? Ridiculous crap. In face, Conservatives are much closer to Nazism (war, obliteration of certain classes, refusal to tolerate certain groups) than Obama will ever be to Socialism.
