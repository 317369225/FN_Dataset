For people who like being dazzled by genuinely new knowledge, what are some of the best books you have read?I am talking about books from a wide variety of fields, such as, Anthropology, Physics, Linguistics, Technology, etc.
Dated, but still wonderful, H.G. Wells's Outline of History is a great read, and I would add his Experiment in Autobiography.
