Is there a climate computer model that can accurately arrive at today's climate with only historical data?
The short answer is no, you can't get to current temperatures without considering CO2. Climate models are very successful at recreating temperatures for the last 100 years when they take CO2 into account, but are always off when they don't include the rise in CO2.Â  To quote the indispensable Skeptical Science blog (@How reliable are climate models?): There are two major questions in climate modeling - can they accurately reproduce the past (hindcasting) and can they successfully predict the future? To answer the first question, here is a summary of the IPCC model results of surface temperature from the 1800's - both with and without man-made forcings. All the models are unable to predict recent warming without taking rising CO2 levels into account. No one has created a general circulation model that can explain climate's behaviour over the past century without CO2 warming. Figure 1: Comparison of climate results with observations. (a) represents simulations done with only natural forcings: solar variation and volcanic activity. (b) represents simulations done with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases and sulphateaerosols. (c) was done with both natural and anthropogenic forcings (IPCC). As you can see in graph a) above, when models only consider natural forcings such as solar variation and volcanic activity, they just chug along without any sustained rise in temperature (the gray band). In the third graph, however, when both natural forcings and CO2 are taken into account, the models match observed temperatures with extraordinary accuracy.
