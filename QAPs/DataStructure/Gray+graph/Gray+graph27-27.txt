I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
PAST :  nothing can be done or changed about it  so forget it. Remember to love someone is never a fault of yours. PRESENT :  take a one week break from everything. Instead of procrastinating yourself start understanding your past decisions from a mature point of view. Visit calm and serene places like beach. They will fill u with refreshness . once there think about how you can gather everything back - your messed up life. Don't just look out for answers or opinions from other people in how to handle your life. When you yourself try to look out for the answers you will discover the inner you which I am sure will guide you in the best possible way and it will be better than our fellow people 's suggestions. { meditations is the single most tool u need now } And now the question about ending your life ! No.. Thats never the solution . . whenever u feel like this just spend time with your parents. Sleep in the lap of your mother and all worries will be gone. As Mr AMIT said the kicks and challenges further in your life will be much more than this one . I know its tough said than done but still enjoy your life to the fullest and you will emerge out strong. Hope this helps...:)
