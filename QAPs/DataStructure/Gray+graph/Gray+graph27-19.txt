I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
I would just cut to the chase. That can be harsh now but that will help you. About you missing your boyfriend. What you miss is not the understanding or the compatibility, but the attention you got from him and the fact that you could bury all your little dark secrets in him while you see other girls in college still getting that. Maybe you even don't want to let go because of all the years and effort you have devoted to this. The bad news is it is going to suck for a while. The good news is non of the things you lost are irreplaceable. If only,  it is for the good that he dumped you now. A few years from now when you are in a professional life and are tired all day and just want to come back and lay low for a while, you would value the importance of space, something you ll now have. Use that space and time for your benefit. Trust me being a guy,  I would not blame that guy either. He did what's best for him. And there's nothing wrong in it. You need to get on with your career too. Today that is really important for everyone,  being independent. Wasting time sobbing over guys is pitiful but not wise. There are too many out there. It's impossible you already found the most apt one in the first go itself. Secondly about your career. You say you are still in your engineering. There's nothing wrong in toiling a little hard. Even if it takes time,  something will turn up. And at the end of it you ll be the one reaping all the rewards of it. Your own salary, your own sweat? Nothing tastes sweeter. Not even if your dad buys you an audi, your own scooty will still be more special. So hang on there and stop being so weak. If success was was easy to achieve it wouldn't be rated so highly. And remember always. What doesn't kill you, always makes you stronger
