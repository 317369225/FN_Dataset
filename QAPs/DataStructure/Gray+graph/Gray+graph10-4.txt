Who are some of the greatest scientists, past and present, in the field of distributed or concurrent systems?Also what are their accomplishments?
I'm really surprised to not see Per Brinch Hansen, who pretty much invented the whole concept of the monolithic kernel for controlling concurrent access to serialized items and developed Concurrent Pascal as a way to better write concurrent programs. I'm also surprised to see Tony Hoare missing - he was one of my inspirations, with his work in communicating sequential processes (which covers both the "concurrent" and "distributed" aspects of the question) and who holds the Turing Award, Royal Society, IEEE John von Neumann Medal, and a Knighthood for his work. Honorable mention should also include Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard who gave us the Simula 67 programming language, the first object-oriented programming language, complete with objects, classes, sub-classes and inheritance,Â  virtual functions, garbage collection and coroutines. It's the coroutine aspect that makes Simula 67 relevant to this answer, in particular. More modern names would have to also include Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams who initially developed Erlang at Ericsson starting in 1986. There's some serious bad-assery in there...
