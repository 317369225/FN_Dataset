What is a good list of animals ordered by intelligence?I guess the first 10 places are easy to identify, however, when the list is large is difficult. Another list would be interesting also grouped by species.
One other insight might be to think about what's a good list of animals ordered by how good they are at video games.  For example, pigs are better at some video games than chimps.  It gets you thinking. There's some more examples I wrote about here: Can Animals Crowdsource? Can They Perform ‘Human’ Intelligence Tasks? My guess top-list though would be Human, dolphin, chimp/apes, pig, whales, Parrot, dogs, cats, bears...
