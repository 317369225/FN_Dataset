Why was the word 'Internet' used in the 1620s?According to Wolfram Alpha's word frequency history
I don't know. But what I know is that "Internet" was a lingerie brand in Argentina from the 1950's to the 1970's, as this fragment* of an ad from 1956 proves: It was published in the magazine Radiolandia in July 14, 1956. It was sold in Casa Zule, in Viamonte 611, in Buenos Aires (doesn't exists anymore but I put the location in Google Maps if you are interested to go). If you can read in Spanish, here is a whole article about the history of this brand: Una gran familia llamada Internet Also, check this out (Internet invento argentino - masqueforo.info) where, besides a brief version of the info of the previous link, you'll see the whole ad I posted (not just a fragment) and another ad (I can't link them here because the forum where they are posted tries to make me click in some spyware suspicious thingie)
