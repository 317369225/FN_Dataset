If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
Real programming in a real world rarely includes stacks, queues, trees, graphs, or all those things that you mention.  Real programming is about how to solve real world problems which most of the time won't get solved just because you know the most efficient data structures or the fastest algorithm. If you must do your competitive programming, by no means do it, but just remember that it's not the end of your programming career, or the end of the world.  Whether you are good at this or not, at the end of the day it most probably won't matter much when it's the time for you to get a real job.
