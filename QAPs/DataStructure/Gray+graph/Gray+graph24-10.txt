If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
Everybody's different, and aptitude certainly helps, but programming and problem solving are learned skills, so yes practice makes perfect.  Hopefully, no matter what speed you work at, you find yourself loosing track of time because you're interest in what you're doing is off the charts :D Try this as a starting place.  I've found a number of MIT OpenCourseWare courses to be interesting and informative.
