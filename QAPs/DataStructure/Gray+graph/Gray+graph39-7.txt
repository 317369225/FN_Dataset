Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
Obama is not a socialist per s√® but he leans that way. I talk from outside. I'm in Europe, where everything is more socialist than in the States. The problem in my opinion, is not socialism: I know socialists and have lived under a socialist/communist regime (Ceausescu's Romania). Obama is nothing like that. But he's a keynesian. And JM Keynes had some of the most idiotic ideas from all the economists. It might be just the libertarian in me talking, but I know the other side, I've started out as a promoter of Keynes and ended up a Rothbard fan. The bottom line: Obama is not a socialist, but he has some tendencies in that direction (because of the keynesian influence). But he's a great guy overall.
