How can electric cars be more environmentally friendly when electricity is mostly generated by burning coal?
Originally Answered: Why is electric vehicle considered as environment friendly when coal is to be burnt to charge them?This is known as "long tailpipe argument" and can be simply refuted by pointing out the following: not all electricity is generated by coal. there are less poluting options, like nuclear, and renewable ones: hydro, wind and solar. even if generated by coal, power plant efficiency is considerably higher than petrol engine, including losses by distribution. this is why electric cars get much higher MPG values, even higher than diesel engines. energy generation is limited to a "single exhaust" that can be tightly regulated, as far harmful emissions are concerned. it is also easier and cheaper to improve one power plant than several million cars. internal combustion engines spew most emissions during starting, accelerating or idling (for example in traffic jams). Stop'n'go systems do help somewhat, yet electric car uses no energy when stopped and thanks to constant torque, energy usage is linear. In fact, when braking, electric vehicle regenerates some of the energy and refills the batteries a bit. To conclude, EVs are much more efficient energy-wise then their petrol brothers, regardless of the source of energy. Their only, but critical drawback is energy CONTAINMENT. And while we are nowadays able to store adequate amount of energy to a gasoline powered car, battery packs are still large and heavy, but most importantly, they take quite a while to charge. This is the only reason electric cars are not the norm in today's society. Updated 18 Feb â€¢ View Upvotes
