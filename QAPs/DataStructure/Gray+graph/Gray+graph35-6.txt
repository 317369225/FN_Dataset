What is the outcome of a $15 minimum wage in the U.S.?
My answer is that the idea that the government has the power to force people into contracts involuntarily will be more firmly rooted in the nation's psyche. You probably wanted a complicated economic analysis. Price controls cause people to act differently than they would if they were free. This is supposed to be a free country.
