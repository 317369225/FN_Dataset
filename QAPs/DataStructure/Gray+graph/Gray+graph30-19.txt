Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Mathematics is purely a human invention, not because the math principles discovered over time were untrue before their unveiling (because that isn't true; all mathematical notions we know today have been true through all of time), but rather because mathematics as we know it is simply a human invention that we use to understand universal properties. Similarly, the concept of Nature as a tangible object/s is a farce because Nature is simply a artificial concept that serves as a medium through which we regard our physical world. I am not saying that certain properties of the physical universe that have come to be understood over time were not "in effect" before the time in which they came to be understood. Rather, I am saying that Mathematics as we understand hold no control over universal principles. Mathematics is simply a neat and simple word that is used to symbolize our knowledge of the universe around us. By this thinking, I've come to believe that Mathematics is an invention in the same way that Nature was simply invented as a way of compiling our knowledge of a subject into a single category. I am not saying that we as a species created all laws of physics and set them into motion. Overall, this debate seems to be an argument of definition as to what "mathematics" is, universal laws or a human simplification of universal laws. In addition, to quell this debate, one must first fully define the distinguishing characteristics of "invention" and "discovery."
