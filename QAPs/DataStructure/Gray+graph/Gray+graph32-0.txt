Neuroscience: How is electrical conductivity different between white matter and grey matter?
Tissue conductivity (siemens/meter; S/m) is influenced by signal frequency and the degree of anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the tissue. Because accurate measurement of tissue conductivity is difficult, an "effective conductivity" is often used. This is an approximate value for the tissue averaged in space over many cells. The reported value will vary depending on the specific animal and measurement technique employed.   Grey matter is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic so a single average mixed value is often reported. For example, Logothetis and coworkers (2007) reported an average value of 0.404 S/m which is essentially frequency-independent in the range 1 Hz to 10 kHz. White matter is much more anisotropic and inhomogenous than gray matter.  Its longitudinal conductivity is 5 to 10 times greater than its transverse conductivity.  Thus, a separate value for longitudinal and for transverse conductivity is often reported. For example, Nicholson (1965) reported average white matter longitudinal and transverse conductivity values of 1.13 S/m and 0.13 S/m, respectively. Using these published values: white matter longitudinal conductivity (1.13 S/m)  >  gray matter conductivity (0.404 S/m) > white matter transverse conductivity (0.13 S/m).

You can also use this IT'IS online applet (link: interactive tissue frequency chart) to get the conductivity values for grey matter and white matter. Select the type of tissue and plug in frequency range, and it will show you a graph of  conductivity as a function of frequency. The same site (link: range of values " IT'IS Foundation) list the following average conductivity values for frequencies up to 120 Hz based on a few publications. Grey Matter (GM) longitudinal=0.255 S/m transverse=0.195 S/m mixed=0.185 S/m White Matter (GM) longitudinal=0.797 S/m transverse=0.098 S/m mixed=0.369 S/m WM(long) > GM(long) > GM(trans) > WM(trans) WM(mixed) > GM(mixed)
