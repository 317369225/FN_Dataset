How can electric cars be more environmentally friendly when electricity is mostly generated by burning coal?
Originally Answered: Are electric cars actually safer for the environment?This is a very difficult question to answer. The answer is "probably", but it rather depends on the car and other factors:   here are some factors:   1. Electric power stations are more efficient than internal combustion engines - 35%  for coal power stations (Power Station Efficiency) versus 18% for cars (Internal combustion engine). And this doesn't include the energy costs in refining petrol.   2. Transmission losses for a electric power are maybe 10%, only a few percent for petrol.   3. Petrol can be stored in a tank with 0% losses, charge/discharge cycles on Lithium Ion batteries (the equivalent of filling the tank) might be 10%. The electric motors themselves are not 100% efficient either. However if they don't have a gearbox (many don't) there are less losses in getting power to the wheels.   4. Electric cars can recycle some energy through regenerative braking; pure petrol cars cannot.   5. Electric cars are heavier than petrol cars, and if you want a long range comparable to a petrol car, much heavier. This means you need more power to accelerate. This is a substantial extra energy cost, dependent o the size of the batteries.     Add all this up, and they are comparable, with electric cars probably slightly better. But reducing CO2 emissions is not a good reason to buy an electric car. If that's your motivation, buy a smaller car with a three cylinder turbo diesel engine. Not much fun to drive, but they run on the smell of an oily rag.
