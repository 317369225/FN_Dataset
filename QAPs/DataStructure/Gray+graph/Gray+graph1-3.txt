Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
I think this is a simple contrast: I find it much easier to use Google Reader for "can't miss" sites where I want to see each post.  Twitter is better for sources where I'm OK with only seeing sporadic posts.  To me they solve two different problems.
