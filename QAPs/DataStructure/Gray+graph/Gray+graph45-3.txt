What is a good list of animals ordered by intelligence?I guess the first 10 places are easy to identify, however, when the list is large is difficult. Another list would be interesting also grouped by species.
The VERY first place IS very hard to determine.  WE are more dexterous and have the body better equipped to handle physical jobs, but dolphins have a frontal cortex in their brains that is, in perspective, four times the size of ours, and that is the part of the brain used for reasoning and getting ideas, so THEY'RE more intelligent, but WE do more.  They have also lived much longer than we have.  We've been around for about 100,000 years, but they've been in the water for twice as long.  Before that, they lived on land, but returned to the water when conditions got bad.
