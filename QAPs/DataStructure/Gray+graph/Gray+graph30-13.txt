Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Originally Answered: Is math discovered or invented?Well, that's a tricky question. Let us see their definitions first, Invention:-  A new device, method, or process developed from study and experimentation Discovery:-the action or process of discovering something or being discovered. How was Maths first possibly elaborated ?    When humans began to live in a civilization, they began activities like rearing cattle, cultivate crops, and perform trade. Activities like storing, gathering and trading needed a way to measure or count.The very first device for counting numbers was the human hand, counting on fingers. To count beyond ten fingers, they used natural markers, rocks or shells. It is believed that Abacus was invented[1] during this process. According to me, Maths would not be an invention, but a discovery, as the laws of science are not invention but discovery. For e.g. :- We do not say that America was invented by Columbus. It was existing even before Columbus, he just found or discovered it, hence we say that Columbus discovered America. Similarly, 2+2=4 was true even before humans existed, hence gaining a knowledge that 2 added with 2 gives 4 cannot be termed as an invention but a discovery. [1] Abacus can be termed as an invention because it is a tool derived to count the numbers.
