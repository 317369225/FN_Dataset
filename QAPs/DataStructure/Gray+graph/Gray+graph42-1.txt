Are there more or less UFO sightings after the proliferation of photo-capable mobile devices?
Actually, there are surprisingly fewer UFO sightings since digital cameras and mobile phone cameras have become more accessible. If UFOs were real, one would believe that the opposite would have happened. The fact that there hasn't been an increase in UFO sightings likely means that there aren't any. Or, that if there are, then they've decided to move their operations away from prying eyes. Updated 19 Dec 2012 â€¢ View Upvotes
