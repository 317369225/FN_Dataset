How important is social media monitoring in your company? How much time and money do you invest in it?In my experience, social media monitoring it’s an important step in every company, regardless of the industry, and can bring great benefits for a business if it’s properly managed. Do you have such a service in your company? Do you think it should be automated or handled manually?
For our (industrial) B2B-company, we only need to check social media a few times per day. The business is not 'social minded'.
