Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
As recently as September 2010, the Google Reader team displayed a pair of graphs, the first of which showed the number of active users and the second, which showed the number of read items per day. Both charts were increasing, at record highs. See: http://googlereader.blogspot.com... Active Users of Google Reader (September 2010) -- defined as logged in within the last seven days Items Read per Day Within Google Reader (September 2010) The question asked if Google Reader has seen a decline in usage, and suggests Twitter's increasing popularity would be impacting a decline. But as you can see in the chart, there has been an increase in use overall, not a decrease, even if the growth percentage is less than that seen at Twitter or Facebook over the same period. Any suggestions here or elsewhere of a decline in usage is either personal or anecdotal.
