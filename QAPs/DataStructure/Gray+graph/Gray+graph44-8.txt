What are the greatest dashboard designs, and why?I am looking for some cool dashboard designs following the latest design trends and UI Patterns. Dashboards mainly displaying the analytics, performance graphs and the most vital information.
Mint.com has a really clean dashboard. Dashboard, as Stephen Few says, is a visual display of the most important information needed to ac achieve  one or more objectives which fits entirely on a single computer screen so it can be monitored at a glance. Mint's dahsboard doesn't fit into single screen however, instead of flash and attractive visuals, it displays data in most insightful manner. Updated 22 Mar 2012 • View Upvotes
