How important is social media monitoring in your company? How much time and money do you invest in it?In my experience, social media monitoring it’s an important step in every company, regardless of the industry, and can bring great benefits for a business if it’s properly managed. Do you have such a service in your company? Do you think it should be automated or handled manually?
I find that social media monitoring is an undervalued tool for understanding  opinions, topics of conversation and trends around your brand. It can be a great supplement (or, in some cases, substitute for) traditional forms of market research in that you are able to analyze how people naturally talk about your brand without the filter of prompted questions and artificial settings. This research is great for campaign ideation and development, new product features/design, and competitive analysis. Social media monitoring is both an art and science in that there is no software tool that will always give you perfect results. It takes time to craft valuable monitors and analyze what topics and conversational trends are most relevant to your brand. Such tools are often a great starting point for further research rather than a source for that final answer. Such monitoring is undervalued in that it is often the first piece to be eliminated in a marketing budget as it is sometimes difficult to calculate related ROI. However, when done well, the research will help improve campaign impact, brand positioning and new product development.
