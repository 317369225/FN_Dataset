If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
You just need more practice and sustained motivation. You remember your first days at the elementary school. You did not type letters correctly at the beginning, after weeks you did it via just writing the same letters again and again. I think programming or solving algorithmic problems (data structures etc) is analogous with the typing letters progress.
