Words: Is there an online tool to accurately assess the relative rarity of a word in English?I'm looking for something more definitive than just guessing from the number of returned results of a search engine llike google.
Go to Google. Enter the word, followed by "definition". Search. You'll see a gray box with the definition, before the results. At the bottom of the box, it will say "Translations, word origin and more definitions". Click the arrow next to it. Now at the bottom of the box is a graph, showing the frequency of use of the word over time. Click on the graph to get a more detailed one, with labeled axes. I just found out that the word "pendulum" constitutes .000232% of all the words in contemporary documents. It peaked in 1878 at .000541%. Why? I guess physics was a pretty hot topic (in published documents, n.b.) at the time.
