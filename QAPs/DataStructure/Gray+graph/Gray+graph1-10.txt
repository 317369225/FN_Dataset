Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
