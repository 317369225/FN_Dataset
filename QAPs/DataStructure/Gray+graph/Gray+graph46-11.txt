How can electric cars be more environmentally friendly when electricity is mostly generated by burning coal?
There are several aspects to this question. There is an enormous difference in efficiency between an electric motor and a gasoline engine. An electric motor is about 97% efficient while a gasoline internal combustion engine is only about 30% efficient. An electric vehicle recovers energy with regenerative braking. This isn't possible with a gasoline motor. Modern coal fired power stations are designed to be as efficient and clean as feasibly possible. Gasoline engines in cars cannot implement these additional techniques because of cost and weight. Not all grid power is generated from coal or other fossil fuels. Grid power is increasingly from solar and wind power stations and from hydroelectric generators. The percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources varies per region but is rapidly increasing worldwide. One can safely assume that by the time a Tesla vehicle reaches the end of its potential life, almost all the energy it consumes will be from renewable sources. Electric vehicles do not need servicing and oil changes and filter changes. Gasoline engines produce a significant amount of additional toxic waste which contains poisonous substances such as heavy metals. Most developed countries have excess capacity for producing electricity. This has resulted primarily from high electricity prices influencing consumers to consume less electricity. The coal-fired power stations already exist and probably no new ones will ever be built. These power stations will be decommissioned when they reach the end of their useful lifespan and as renewable energy replaces them. It makes financial sense to use these power stations while renewable power stations are being developed.
