Why is e-commerce such a hot area in venture capital now?
Commerce is, essentially, an analog activity; bartering, give and take, browsing, upselling, etc. Ecommerce is the promise of converting an analog activity to a wholly digital one. The first Internet bubble brought us over many of the major hurdles, but now there are many innovations (Square, for instance) that, by virtue of their simplicity and being empowered by mobile computing, are bringing the analog ease of a transaction to the digital space. Put another way, VC's maybe can finally smell that there is real potential with ecommerce today versus back then.
