Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
He's not much of a socialist really.  None of his policies carry very strong socialist values.  It could be argued that Obamacare is more socialist than any healthcare legislation that preceeded it in the United States since it provides for all citizens, but it's not really socialism. Obama's not a socialist.  That's the long and short of it really.
