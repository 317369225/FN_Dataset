How did Adam D'Angelo improve so fast in TopCoder?http://community.topcoder.com/tc... (grey to red in a year)
In 2002 Adam was already performing at a high level in programming contests. He probably was training hard for the IOI and got a silver medal that year. Starting from 2000 he was selected in the national IOI training team: http://www.uwp.edu/sws/usaco/200... http://www.uwp.edu/sws/usaco/200... http://www.uwp.edu/sws/usaco/200... Topcoder takes some time to get accustomed to if you did high school programming contests because the time span is much shorter and your accuracy in coding needs to be much better. Much like a chess master switching to speed chess, Adam took a while to get to his true rating. You can see other impressive curves Petr http://community.topcoder.com/tc... a target in 6 contests (he already was in a team that placed 2nd twice in the acm icpc when he started doing topcoder) Tomek http://community.topcoder.com/tc... (acm world champion) Guys who were already strong at an international level would shoot through the rankings. More recently though there are people who start with programming competitions on topcoder and it's pretty interesting to look at their rating graphs. Here's roypalacios asking in 2007 for advice how to go from gray to red on topcoder: http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/... And then in 2011 he achieved it :). Updated 29 Jun 2012 â€¢ View Upvotes
