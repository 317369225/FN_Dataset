Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Originally Answered: Is mathematics discovered or invented?It's as valid to ask this same question about Art or Music, or any other creative discipline. Mathematicians come up with creative ideas and look at how and if those ideas fit together with other creative ideas in a consistent fashion. It's true that some mathematical development of our frameworks is inspired and motivated by the fundamental behavior of the universe, but it is also true that there are Mathematical questions that can be asked and answered which aren't inherently embedded in nature. Some might object, saying humans are constrained to find only the mathematical relationships which the universe "allows" in some sense, but that type of argument is true for Music as well -- the sounds we can organize and call Music are also constrained by what the universe's laws allow matter to produce.
