I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
Let's face it, you love him, but he doesn't want to be with you. You already know it. From my point of view, you should move on. It doesn't mean to find another boyfriend, but find your own certainty. It need some time to find out you are the best person for you and nobody can replace this role. However, you also need to work on that, it doesn't come spontaneously without your attention. So what you can do? You need an activity which helps you out in this case. Do some sport or whatever you like doing without relying on someone else. Here should be something. Only if you continue like this, it will hurt and the pain never disappear. You need to get rid of negative thoughts, which is better done by doing something.
