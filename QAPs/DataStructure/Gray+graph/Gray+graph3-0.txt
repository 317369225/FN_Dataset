Why is serendipity hard on the internet?It seems to me that something about the way that the web is structured prevents completely random discoveries. I can stumble across new blogs on topics I'm interested in, but it's harder to stumble across new topics to be interested in. Why?
Serendipity is, by nature, fringe-focused. What does this mean? Saying that it is difficult to make "completely random" discoveries is not true - it is difficult to make random discoveries which is also interesting (to you, as an individual). So, the core serendipity problem can be translated to this: Calculate the set of "things" the user is already interested in (using PeerIndex topics and parsing the user's social graph, for example) Determine how this relates to the set of "things" the user is not interested in yet. Return a subset of "things" that the user is most likely to be interested in. So, serendipity focuses on the "fringes" of the user's fields of interest. This is a moving target, and very hard to calculate (however, not impossible).
