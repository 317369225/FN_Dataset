Which CS areas have the most low-hanging fruit for research?
I'd like to add Computational Biology to this list.  I switched areas a few years into my PhD from Compute Graphics to Comp. Bio; largely for this reason.  Comp Bio is a field with a constant stream of new data, and new *types* of data.  This means that there is constantly the ability to do research that is, at some level, fundamental.  Furthermore, many of the most basic problems in the area are hard (in the complexity theory sense), and there's often a lot of room for improvement over the current state-of-the-art solutions.
