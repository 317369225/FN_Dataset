How can electric cars be more environmentally friendly when electricity is mostly generated by burning coal?
The key item to know about electric cars is that even if all the electricity used in them comes from coal, they are never LESS efficient in amount of fossil fuels used and in CO2 and other emissions than a comparably functional gasoline auto. Sure, 5% of electricity is lost in transmission, perhaps another 2% more in mining and transporting the coal but significant amounts of energy are also used in finding, drilling, pumping, transporting, refining and delivering petroleum --> gasoline to your filling station, probably more than 10%. An electric car uses little or no energy when stopped at a stop light, and actually gains energy from braking. From there it is a matter of working toward replacing the coal-produced or Nat. Gas-produced electricity coming to your charger with environmentally sustainably-produced electricity. If a pure electric vehicle can't serve your driving needs consider using a PHEV, a hybrid gasoline-electric where the electric batteries are chargeable from the grid and can serve most of your daily driving needs, and a gasoline engine will automatically take over if your trip runs the battery down. For two-vehicle families, have a pure electric vehicle for your least-demanding service, and a plugin hybrid for unusual trips. Also note, anywhere I used "gasoline" for convenience above since I know I'm talking to a US audience, you will greatly improve you environmental footprint and your bank account by purchasing a comparably priced diesel engine vehicle (and maintaining it well).
