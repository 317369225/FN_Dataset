Why is e-commerce such a hot area in venture capital now?
For the same reason why good sales people typically make more than good IT people, it's quantifiable.  For the last 5 years many of the consumer plays in the Valley were working to indirectly monetize users (e.g., through ads).  That meant that #s that were being focused on included uniques, page views, engagement metrics, etc.  Sometimes that translated into revenue.  Other times it didn't. So while a few of those bets (notably Facebook and Twitter) paid off, many didn't.  And therefore a lot of VCs likely feel burned out on social media/social networking plays and many feel that consumer Internet investing became a bit of a crapshoot (especially given the difficulty of predicting what would go viral and what wouldn't). With e-commerce sites it's pretty easy to tell whether they are successful. Whether they're selling stuff. And given the explosiveness of models like Groupon and Gilt it's a pretty appealing place to invest.  Investing trends ebb and flow and right now it seems like there's a whole host of companies that are looking to remake commerce as we know it and an equally large number of VCs lining up to fund them.
