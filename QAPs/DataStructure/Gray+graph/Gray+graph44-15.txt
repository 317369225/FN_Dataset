What are the greatest dashboard designs, and why?I am looking for some cool dashboard designs following the latest design trends and UI Patterns. Dashboards mainly displaying the analytics, performance graphs and the most vital information.
Turned on by the new Alto Mail from AOL. Good UI changes to your webmail to create a more organized environment. AOL just got some mojo back by providing simple ways of tweaking yourÂ  mail filters feature, as well as various ways to view your emails.
