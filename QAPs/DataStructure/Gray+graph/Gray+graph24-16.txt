If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
You will need more practice, yes. Hence the phrase "practice makes perfect." With that being said, you also need inspiration and imagination. Without both together you wont have the desire needed for practice (homework, studying, etc.). In my experience, simply put, enjoyment is the fuel of perfection. All things considered: Is programming right for you? What are you goals in programming? Are they attainable with your current state of interest? Is there another hobby, major, or career that would be more suitable? I wan't sure what I wanted to do in college, but I knew it was going to be with computers. Computer Science intrigued me a lot and in high school I was fascinated with Java and algorithms, but I always enjoyed working with my hands on projects. Computer Engineering was a great choice because of the hybrid created. I still find time to work on my own hobby projects, whether it's confusing code for a homemade java game or a circuit full of messy soldering. My favorite projects are when I get to incorporate both worlds of computing into a single project via programmable microprocessors, circuits boards, bread boards, or my arduino. In conclusion: Find interest, enjoyment will follow, you'll get practice, you get better. Good Luck
