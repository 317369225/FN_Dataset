If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
I'm assuming that you are talking about programming in an academic context, and not in an actual job. If you are in school, bear in mind that the kinds of problems you are asked to solve are approximations of real world problems, and there are two important differences: You may not be genuinely interested in solving these problems, and you may not have a team of people with whom you've been working for years to solve problems. If this is the case, I say do what others suggest and keep practicing. Finding something outside of school to work on that you are interested in doing might help. Join a network of people with similar programming interests and start building relationships. Once your interest improves you will probably get faster and better.
