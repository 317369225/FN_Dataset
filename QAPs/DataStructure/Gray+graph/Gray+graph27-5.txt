I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
You are making things complicated for your self. Believe that you are the best.Believe that life is awesome. Whatever happens in life only happens for the good. Delete the negative thoughts first. You did not get the job instead of cursing yourself(negative) lookout for other jobs may be you are going to get a better one better the one you did not get(positive).I failed in all the interviews most of them but I always deleted the negative thoughts and kept positivity and it helped me. About your love life.please don't go behind the lost love.Enjoy the singledom.Don't care about anything anyone.You still have a lot in life enjoy every bit of it.Don't regret for anything in life.I can't guarantee if you will get somebody better in your life but I can tell you that you deserve better.Keep that in your head.don't think too much about anything. â€‹If you can convince your mind you can come back to wat you were. Spend time with people who love you family or friends.It is ok to shout at your parents they are the only ones whom you can take granted. So just chill and everything will fall in place. Hope that helped.
