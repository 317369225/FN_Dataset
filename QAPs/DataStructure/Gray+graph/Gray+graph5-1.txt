For people who like being dazzled by genuinely new knowledge, what are some of the best books you have read?I am talking about books from a wide variety of fields, such as, Anthropology, Physics, Linguistics, Technology, etc.
Chaos by James Gleick.  It really makes you think of how simple mathematically the world around is might be we just don't know it yet.  I don't believe in God but this book made me wonder. One of my favorite points of this book is a part about a fern bush.  No 2 fern bushes are exactly the same, even given the same conditions forever they would turn out differently by seemingly random chance, it is chaotic. Most mathematicians and physicists try and do their best not to do non-linear types of mathematics because they don't generally have any answers.  I think it was Richard Feynman who did a simple y = mx + b graphing program to plot points for an identifiable real world fern bush, and yet the simple equation created truly chaotic systems! It was a mind bending book.
