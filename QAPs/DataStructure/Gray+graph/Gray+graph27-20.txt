I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
Forget him, and work on finding another boyfriend.  Consider transferring to another school -- even moving if you need to, in order to avoid seeing him every day. Treat yourself as well as you can afford to, getting a bit of exercise, eating well, and getting enough sleep, no matter how your mind might race.  Take your therapy seriously, and ask for a new counselor if the one you're seeing now isn't helping you. And finally, this is the time for you to rediscover a hobby, or to embark upon a new one.  You need reasons to live which have nothing to do with your old BF, or with anything or anybody who is not good for you.  Re-engage with your job, looking for a new one of you're not happy where you are -- even if the new position pays a bit less (if it pays too much less, stay put so money worries don't add to your depression and anxiety.  If you are at all religious, deepen your connection to your faith.  And when you're not doing anything else, just spend the time loving on yourself in any way you want, so long as it isn't self-destructive.  GOOD LUCK
