Was mathematics invented or discovered?
Originally Answered: Is math an invention or a discovery?"Math" is the process used to understand the relationships between groups of things.  It is an artificial, invented construct that makes use of the innate properties of those things. For instance, there may be a cluster of rocks by a stream.  Until math was invented, no one knew if there were seven rocks there or blumteen.  The rocks were present, but they had no relationship to man until Byuke showed Smork how "one rock" was different than "two rocks."
