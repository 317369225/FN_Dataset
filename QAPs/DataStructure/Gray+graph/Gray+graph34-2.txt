What opportunities exist for US or Europe based start-ups in the Remittances vertical?Specifically interested to learn about how profitable the remittance business is. What are the hurdles? What unique opportunities present themselves? How big is the market? How can startups leverage this space and compete with the big banks?
As always, Faisal has a fantastic answer, but he focuses on just one part of the market: actually remitting money. In my opinion there remain huge opportunities for ancillary services, whether for consumers (e.g. to compare costs like a Kayak or Hipmunk does for plane tickets, something I've been working on) or for remittance companies (I believe there is a need for more identity verification services, etc). One benefit I see of focusing on one of these areas is that an expensive on-the-ground network is much less important than it would be for an actual remittance company.
