Can colorblind people use red-and-blue 3D glasses and experience a 3D effect?
I have no problem using red - blue (green?) lenses to view movies in 3-D. However, it is probably not as intense as those with normal vision. It is a little lame in my opinion, but that is MY perception and I know I am somewhat lacking.
