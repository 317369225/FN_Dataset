How is it possible that scientists achieved a temperature that is lower than absolute zero?
We are arguably using a bad unit of measure, the +1 * Kelvin. We could instead be using the -1 / Kelvin (the negative reciprocal Kelvin; let's say "NegKelvin" for short). Let's look at two ordered lists of everyday temperatures, and see for yourself which unit is more intuitive: From coldest (cold) to hottest (negcold), in the better NegKelvin units: 0% of particles are energized Cold = -infinity NegKelvin Ice melts = -3.661 milli NegKelvin Room temperature = -3.411 milli NegKelvin Water boils = -2.680 milli NegKelvin Hot = -0 NegKelvin Population Inversion (>50% of particles are energized) NegHot = +0 NegKelvin The quantum gas in the Schneider experiment = +somethingSmall NegKelvin Lasers lase = +somethingBig NegKelvin NegCold = +infinity NegKelvin 100% of particles are energized versus From coldest (cold) to hottest (negcold), in the worse Kelvin units: 0% of particles are energized Cold = +0 Kelvin Ice melts = 273.2 Kelvin Room temperature = 293.2 Kelvin Water boils = 373.2 Kelvin Hot = +infinity Kelvin Population Inversion (>50% of particles are energized) NegHot = -infinity Kelvin The quantum gas in the Schneider experiment = -1/somethingSmall Kelvin Lasers lase = -1/somethingBig Kelvin NegCold = -0 Kelvin 100% of particles are energized Compared to the laws of physics, our unit of measure the Kelvin is the negative reciprocal of what's useful, and thus has an unintuitive discontinuity in the middle of the range. (extra credit: why is it asymptotically difficult to cool an object to +0 Kelvin?) Updated 74w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
