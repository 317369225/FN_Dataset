What is the best web-based project management software?
It depends on what you need to accomplish. If you are simply looking for a basic project management tool there are many options listed here already. But if you are looking to build a product and manage all of the projects related to that, you might consider a more purpose-built project and product management tool. I am the CEO and co-founder of Aha!, and it might be a stronger option than a general project management tool. And it might be more than you are looking for, but over 20,000 users now use it for similar work. No matter what you are planning or building, you will likely benefit from a tool that can tie your strategy to your product development and track all of the projects that the team is completing. We designed Aha! to get product and project teams out of spreadsheets, wikis, etc. so that they can work more efficiently. You can also easily track phases and milestones and dependencies in your projects. Having your whole team use the same Web-based tool ensures that everyone can collaborate and share documents easily. Since integrations are likely important to you, it is worth noting that Aha! integrates with many popular apps like Slack, Zendesk, and Salesforce. We also integrate with the most popular developer tools, including JIRA, Rally Software, and Visual Studio TFS Check out a few screenshots of what Aha! can do for product and project teams.
