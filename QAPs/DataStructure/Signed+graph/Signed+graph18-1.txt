How do you determine points of inflection from a graph of the derivative of a function?
If you already have the first derivative, and you know its formula, take the derivative of that and set it to zero. This will give you the possible points of inflection. To make sure it is, you can pick two points on different sides of the possible inflection point. If the second derivative is negative on one side and positive on the other, the point is a point of inflection. If you only have the graph of the first derivative and not the equation, at a point of inflection, the first derivative would be increasing on one side and decreasing on the other.
