Is Barack Obama America's one and only supreme leader? If not, why does he pass so many executive orders?
He doesn't, it's just the Republican Spin Machine that has all those blonde robots alluding to that. By the numbers, you know, actual facts, with no leg showing, Obama has signed fewer executive orders than Bush2, Bush1, and Reagan.  About half as many as Eisenhower.  About ONE SIXTH as many as Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover.    But they didn't have bimbos cooing about how "some say Obama is the most dictatory president EVER".
