Where can I find a great infographic designer?
You might look for groups that focus on infographic design, whether academic or professional.  Follow the group activities and try to network there.  As an example, there is an active meetup in New York that can be a great resource and is regularly frequented by some of the best in the industry: http://www.meetup.com/New-York-D....  Some of these participants would be open to free-lance work. You might also try reaching out to people who are well connected in this space, such as Nathan Yau of http://flowingdata.com/.
