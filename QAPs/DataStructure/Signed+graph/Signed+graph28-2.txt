How do you define 'traction' for a start-up?
Engagement: I think of traction in terms of engagement by your target stakeholder groups. If you are building a development platform, look at the number and quality of developers using it. If you are building a consumer play, how many consumers are engaging with your product? If this is all new to you, I would recommend reading Dave McClure's AARRR methodology as a starting point, and then customize for what is appropriate for you. See: http://500hats.typepad.com/500bl... Revenue: I think revenue is super important, but the result of a long list of precursor actions. Most of the startups I work with are doing great with the precursors, but haven't actually made a lot of revenue yet. That is totally fine, as long as they are getting the initial engagement. Cost Per Action/Acquisition: I think measuring acquisition cost is absolutely crucial for any startup, but completely useless without a measure of Lifetime Customer Value. The game is simple, the cost to get a customer (CPA) needs to be lower than what you make off of your customer (LCV). I fully expect CPA to go down while LCV to increase over the life of a startup, so I consider engagement measures (do I have a product anyone cares about?) to be much more important in the beginning. Press: I simply view the press as a tool to get acquisition cost down.
