Why haven't any companies been able to challenge LinkedIn?
The thing about Professional Identity is that it is an ever-changing landscape that relies on user-generated content. And it's relevant because everyone's UGC is there already (and constantly being appended). Ever hear the saying, Nothing attracts a crowd... Like a crowd? LinkedIn solved the Chicken/Egg problem of getting enough users to post their professional resumes to the site before any relevant competition emerged to do the same. Now that they are approaching 400M users, not only are the network effects strong, the bar for new entrants to provide a substitute is extraordinarily high.Â  The lack of viable challenger is a direct result of having to achieve meaningful scale to simply achieve parity is generally not an 1) easily fundable proposition, 2) easily marketable narrative, nor 3) easily engineered.
