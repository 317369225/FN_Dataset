Is Barack Obama America's one and only supreme leader? If not, why does he pass so many executive orders?
Barack Obama is the President of the United States.   The power he has are the expressed powers (granted explicitly under Article II of the Constitution), delegated powers (granted by acts of Congress) and implied powers (which are necessary and proper to execute the other powers).  The President may issue executive orders as an expression of the powers listed above.  These carry the full force of law, but like laws are subject to judicial review. President Obama has actually signed fewer executive orders than any other modern President.  To swipe a graphic from Five Thirty Eight: Every President’s Executive Orders In One Chart | FiveThirtyEight
