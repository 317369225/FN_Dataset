Why don't more young professionals buy into a Wine Clubs? What is appealing/unappealing about a wine subscription?
I enjoyed my Wine Selectors Quarterly delivery as the Wineries actively provided a good cross section of regional experience. I loved it particularly travelling interstate and being able to identify local wine that I had previously tasted. The selling of the benefits seem to me be a lost art when promoting the product and yes many were simply dumping wine. A wine club must have a significant point of difference from the rest to bring new subscribers on board. How are you getting your USP to your target market?
