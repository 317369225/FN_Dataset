Why is the fundamental theorem of calculus nontrivial?
The fundamental theorem of calculus is such a big deal -- such a good way of computing integrals -- that people forget what an integral is.Â  The FTC relates three different ideas: 1) Definite integrals, which are limits of sums: [math] \int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i^*) \Delta x[/math], where [math] \Delta x = (b-a)/N[/math] and [math]x_i^*[/math] is a number somewhere between [math]a + (i-1)\Delta x[/math] and [math] a + i \Delta x[/math]. This represents the total amount of stuff (whose density is f(x)) between x=a and x=b, where "stuff" can mean area, length, probability, volume, distance, you name it. 2) Indefinite integrals, which are running totals: [math] A(x) =\int_a^x f(t) dt[/math] is the total amount of stuff between a and x. 3) Antiderivatives: A function F(x) is an anti-derivative of f(x) if dF(x)/dx=f(x). The first FTC says that dA/dx = f(x), in other words that an indefinite integral provides an antiderivative. The second FTC says that [math]\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b)-F(a)[/math], so that anti-derivatives are a great way of COMPUTING integrals. But a key to computing integrals isn't the same thing as an integral, any more than the key to your front door isn't a house.
