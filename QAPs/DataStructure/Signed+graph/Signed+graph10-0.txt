Is the fact that people are not freaking out about Facebook's losses and their inability to come up with a plan to become profitable (Facebook Graph Search doesn't sound like a big money-maker to me) a sign that the Web 2.0 bubble is near its peak?
Disclaimer: even though I work at FB, I speak only my personal opinion/speculation. Graph Search is actually a huge money maker for many reasons: 1. FB makes most of its money from Ads, and most advertisers care about clicks and Page likes. When people know that they can be found by the query "People near me who like KFC", they are more inclined to start liking KFC. (We've seen this phenomenon happen - that people are more willing to share when they think the world cares - in personal blogs, Facebook wall, and even Quora.) More likes = more money. Sometimes, Likes can cost a few dollars EACH! 2. There are many interesting things FB could charge for certain search queries. For example, "Software Engineers that live in San Francisco" is very useful for recruiters. This could be huge when Graph Search API gets released. FB could charge per API call) 3. Search ads. Promoted search results. 4. By logging what queries you search for, FB can optimize your ads better. 5. Bing profit share. I'm sure there are plenty of reasons that made Zuck interested in Graph Search, and profit must have played a small part.
