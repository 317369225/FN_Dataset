Can I use 3D charts in my PowerPoint presentations?
Hi, Yes, you can use the 3D charts in your presentations based on your requirements. The chart options which comes loaded with PowerPoint are very limited so you need to understand a concept to make a right choice. Dynamic Charts v/s Static Charts As a creator of a Powerpoint deck, your content which needs to be presented using a 3D chart can wary significantly. Certain set of data belongs to a group which will keep on changing over time (Dynamic) and you need to keep updating them in your slides over a period of time while the other data is Static data which represents a fixed data(Example: Historic figures, Large data mining/cube data) and requires no or significantly less updates. So, If your data is dynamic, then you have no option but to rely internally provided options in PowerPoint but if you wish to present some Static data then there are some amazing 3D cubes and charts available in presentation templates on portals like http://inkppt.com which can be taken for free or purchased to make your communication amazing simple and attractive to your audiences. Hope my answer helped you in some way. Thanks Aayush Jain
