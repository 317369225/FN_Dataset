How do you define 'traction' for a start-up?
As Geoff and Bart said already, it is about proof of market value for this specific startup. It can be a lot of things but basically it requires outsiders to deal with the product/service the startup proposes. However, one missing point in the previous comments is the dynamic of traction. Not only do you need to have good metrics but they must also trend north. Flat figures do not make it. Momentum is key to define traction.
