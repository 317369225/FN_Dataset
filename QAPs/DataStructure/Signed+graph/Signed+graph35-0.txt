How does breaking writing into paragraphs work?
Can you write a paragraph that consists of a single sentence or even a solitary word? Yes. If it's a complete thought, you're fine. And it works well as a way to bring greater emphasis to that sentence or word. Just don't do it too often or it gets really old really fast. I find as I get older and more [fill in the blank] I write shorter paragraphs and more of them. Perhaps it's merely a sign of incipient senescence. At any rate, breaking up text into short graphs makes a passage easier to read, especially on the Web.
