How do I prove this without graphs?
Presumably the question means that either the roots p and q are both <N, or p and q are both >N (not one of each).  Presumably, also, F(p) should have been F(x), so F(x) = ax² + bx + c. The quadratic is a scalar k ≠ 0 times the product of its roots k(x-p)(x-q), which multiplies out to kx² - (p+q)x +pq, so k is the same as a.  Since (N-p) and (N-q) have the same sign,  their product is a positive number M. Then a*F(N) = a*(aN² + bN + c)  = a*(a(N-p)(N-q) ) = a*aM = a² M. Since a square like a² is always positive, this has the same sign as M, which we just showed is positive, as required.  @Sanidhya, Do not trust arguments involving F(-∞), unless you have really good definitions of what you mean.  Since F(-∞) is not a number (or in computer science shorthand, NaN), perhaps its sign is Gemini instead of + or -?  It's better to stay with finite arguments, when possible.
