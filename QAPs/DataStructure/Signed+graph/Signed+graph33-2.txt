Why is the shear force diagram for uniformly distributed loads asymmetric even though it is a symmetric beam?
It is a consequence of the convention we use in the definition of the positive sense of shear coupled with the direction we consider positive for the x-axis.  Another engineer looking at the same beam from inside the paper would have the shear positive at the other end.  The physical state of the material has to be symmetric. An analogy would be walking up a hill, we call that a positive slope, whereas walking down the same hill, we'd call it negative.  It just depends which direction you consider positive and also which slope you define to be positive by convention.
