What is the most bizarre job interview you have ever been party to?
Having conducted tens of thousands of job interviews in my career, there have been many bizarre ones that come to mind, but following is the one that was the most traumatic for me:   As I was escorting a candidate across the lobby to the hiring manager's office, people were suddenly running down the stairs, screaming that there was a man with a gun in the building. Seconds later, gunfire erupted. I immediately shoved the candidate out the door and we made it to the parking lot, but I turned around and re-entered the building to assist my colleagues. This was the 1988 ESL massacre in Sunnyvale, CA where seven coworkers were shot and killed, and the gunman held us at bay for 5 hours.   I learned later that my candidate had arrived early and parked directly across from an RV in the parking lot. As the candidate sat in his vehicle for several minutes, he noticed an agitated man in the RV staring at him. It was the gunman, who was waiting for my candidate to leave before beginning his rampage. Updated 138w ago • View Upvotes
