Why don't more young professionals buy into a Wine Clubs? What is appealing/unappealing about a wine subscription?
Wine clubs usually peddle iffy wines that diplomats are trying to off-load. If you want to enjoy a great discovery of wines, hook up with a wine shop and find one guy who has a flavor profile that matches your own and have him pick you wines to try each month.
