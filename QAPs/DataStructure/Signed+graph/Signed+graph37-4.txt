How do I save money while online shopping?
Sandidhya Gupta and Sam Gong make good points. Don't buy stuff online because you came across an ad and couldn't resist: buy stuff when you need it. Don't go by the amount (or percentage) of discount: just see if the final price you pay makes sense for the product. Compare not just with other online outlets but ALSO with easily accessible brick-and-mortar stores. I would like to also look at the payment methods they offer, whether they give additional discount or cash-back on a particular payment method. Usually credit cards work out well just because they are interest-free loans: buy near the beginning of the billing cycle if you can. But don't go around collecting various (pre-charged or credit) cards or (website or bank) accounts just to get the rock bottom best deal.
