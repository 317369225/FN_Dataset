Why does Ashton Kutcher have only ~900 followers on Quora when he has 6M+ on Twitter?
The reason why Ashton Kutcher only has 900 followers on Quora when he has 6m+ on Twitter is because Ashton Kutcher is a main stream celebrity were by the majority of the early Quora community members are made up of the internet tech community. Which means that while he may be a star in the eyes of the rest of the world to many people here Ashton is just like any other up and coming investor in the world of web startups just with a little more access because of his "star power". That's not to say that one day he won't be note worthy in this industry just that he isn't quite yet. As like any other new investor it takes a few successful investment ventures and market knowledge gained over time to garner the respect of your peers. While as an actor he has done this by staring in successful sitcoms and movies he has yet to my knowledge to have a successful exit which is the true measure of a VC's status in todays industry. However with his resent resume of investments and intelligent choices in mentors I believe it is only a matter of time before crosses that level. When/If Quora becomes mainstream and opens up to the world i'm sure he will have tons of fans following him from his previous acting work and with more experience quite few more from his new.
