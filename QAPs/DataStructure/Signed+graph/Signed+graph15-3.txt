What are the best resources for learning data visualization?
Data visualization is a great field to approach with a beginner's mind. Not too long ago, IMO, the best practices were very prescriptive. However you will need some theoretical knowledge as a foundation. A good way to get past that first step is by reading books for beginners. I recommend both Nathan Yau's books, Visualize This: The FlowingData Guide to Design, Visualization, and Statistics and  Visualization That Means Something,  Designing Data Visualizations: Representing Informational Relationships by Noah Iliinsky and Data Visualization: a successful design process by Andy Kirk (pro tip for the last one: get the electronic version). All of these books are easy reading and require no technical, computer science or design background. Then how to go beyond that. The visual design aspect of data visualization, as well as the UX/UI part are not very different than their non-data vis counterpart, so the same resources apply. On the technical side, there are tools such as Gephi or Tableau (which while they require expertise, are not what i'd consider programming) which can be used to create amazing things. As an aside, a good knowledge of data science / analysis / statistics / database skills can't hurt. Then, if you're willing to write code, there are javascript libraries such as d3js or three.js,  or the processing language. Books exist, as well as many online tutorials and most importantly a vibrant and helpful community.
