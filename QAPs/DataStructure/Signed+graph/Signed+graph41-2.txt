What is the best web-based project management software?
In the digital products arena there are many tools for the technical part of product management - JIRA, Pivotal Tracker, Trello, Asana, etc. All these tools help you with managing the engineering task management or in other words getting features from the top of your backlog to production. They do little to helping you decide what should be on top of your backlog though. There are also many project and task management tools like Basecamp, Blossom.io,  Wrike, and many others. These tools are good for project planning, task management,  simple progress tracking, etc. For a business-minded product manager the critical task is the task of prioritization though - what problem, for whom am I solving and what are the best products/features I can deliver. That is where a new class of business product management tools emerges. If you need to analyze and centralize user feedback, structure and organize your solution/feature ideas, prioritize your work, monitor high-level progress and communicate your plans on a beautiful roadmap, I invite you to check out  http://www.productboard.com For the full disclosure I am the founder & CEO, but our users are madly in love with what we do for them and I believe many of you can find incredible value in what we do.
