Why haven't any companies been able to challenge LinkedIn?
The network effect is pretty strong. As a normal user, you want to have your profile on the same service with everyone else to connect to, and the same service all the recruiters use. As a recruiter, you want to use the service with all the job seekers. This basically makes it very difficult for any other new service to get off the ground. I think Facebook would be capable of competing with them but has never prioritized it and probably never will. They have other more important things to worry about, and it is difficult to accommodate these similar but distinct use cases in the same product without adding a lot of complexity. Â For example, should users have different privacy rules for who can see their professional profile vs. their normal profile? Are professional "friends" different from normal friends? I think they could work through all this but it would be very costly on the product. Meanwhile, they have other similar but distinct use cases they also are trying to accommodate, like Twitter-style following, messaging to small numbers of people, Medium-style publishing, etc. You can stretch a product in a few directions but not in all of them and so it's important to prioritize the ones that are most important competitively. Could Facebook or someone else with a graph and distribution like them use their network to bootstrap an independent product, and avoid the complexity? BranchOut, a LinkedIn competitor built on Facebook Platform, was a good example of this. They got 30 million users to sign up, but even with the massive distribution they got from Facebook, they had a lot of difficulty with engagement, and people were still unwilling to move from LinkedIn. Facebook could probably do better if they built their own app, but they would confuse users with two similar, semi-overlapping products and in the end I don't think their advantages would outweigh LinkedIn's network and the product they've built.
