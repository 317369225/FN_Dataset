How is it possible that scientists achieved a temperature that is lower than absolute zero?
Hi, We're used to seeing temperature defined in terms of the average kinetic energy of the system but not in this case.  Here, it seems the condensed matter community (which I'm not a part of) is defining the temperature of a collection of particles based on energy level occupation according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann formula for a system in equilibrium: [math]p(E) \propto e^{-\frac{E}{kT}}[/math] p(E)dE is the probability for a particle to be in state with energy E. This is the whole business of higher energy levels should be less occupied than lower energy levels. But if you can create an inverted system, with higher energy states exponentially more likely to be occupied than lower energy states, well, that's very strange indeed, but you can recycle this equation, granted you now allow T to be negative. Anyways, this is my best guess for what's going on here. 100 karma pts to whoever can get ahold of the actual paper.  (my school doesn't have a subscription to science???)
