Where is the chart that shows when the astrological Sun sign is in the water element?
The following shows the basic lessons of The 4 Elements, which are modified by Zodiac Sign, and the presence of planets in a Birth Chart. **WATER SIGNS (CANCER, SCORPIO, PISCES)** Water Signs have learned, or are learning,to use the emotional sense of Compassion and Understanding without words. Water is the 'Universal Solvent' that unconsciously links us all. The Sea is symbolic of Jung's 'Collective Unconscious'. The Water Signs bring sensitivity to that level via the Jungian Feeling Function which evaluates activities in terms of "pleasant or unpleasant" or emotional "pleasure or pain". Water people are not particularly strong, so they tend to be retiring and need motivation from externals. They might use their ability to manipulate emotionally rather than confront others. They are the Caretakers and Mothers of the world. They can use their need for seclusion to work behind the scenes of life - perhaps doing research of some kind. They also relate to Art, Music, and Dance. **AIR SIGNS (GEMINI. LIBRA. AQUARIUS)** Air Signs have learned, or are learning, to be thinkers and use the rational mind which evaluates activities in terms of "right and wrong" or "good and bad". Air refers to the rational Jungian Thinking Function, mental energy, and Communication of all kinds using words. There is a need to make study practical rather than academic. Air people tend to be detached from others, and avoid emotional expresssion. This allows for objectivity, but can mean that they lack compassion, and value the "Letter of the Law" rather than the "Spirit of the Law" which is concerned with individual motivations. **FIRE SIGNS (ARIES, LEO, SAGITTARIUS)** Fire Signs have learned, or are learning, use of the basic life force to motivate self and others. They relate to Instinct, and the Jungian Intuition Function which perceives the activities of life instantly as a whole. Fire Signs like action and challenge and are learning how to motivate people. They are not too concerned about practical matters, and not particularly good rational thinkers, however they are able to instinctively get right answers. So we can see that, for example, a Water person would benefit from association. Fire people are attracted to Sport, Having their own business, and academic study - theories rather than practice. They do not like being told what to do. **EARTH SIGNS (TAURUS, VIRGO, CAPRICORN)** Earth Signs  have learned, or are learning, how to use and control material things. They relate to the Jungian Sensation Function which perceives life via the physical 5 Senses. Earth energy is slow frequency so there is a need to combine with the natural forces of Nature in order to be creative. Earth people do not like to be rushed, and will become stubborn if attempts are made to hurry them up. They use this as a method of controlling their surroundings. They are learning the basic lesson that real, permanent, growth occurs as a result of cyclic activity. The daily routine. Organisation. They are the Business Managers of the Zodiac. Some say that they are materialistic, and money is important to them, but this is rather a means of achieving physical comfort, and security.
