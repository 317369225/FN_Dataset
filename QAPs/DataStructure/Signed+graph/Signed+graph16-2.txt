Is Quora's practice of auto-following select Twitter Followers AND adding topics without your permission shady, frustrating, etc.?
This extends to Facebook, too (SIGH).  The usability best practice is to recommend and allow users to 1) select one or few; OR 2) do a mass select.  They've broken the rules here and are running the risk of info-saturating people. Evidently Quora doesn't realize that we want BETTER information - not necessarily MORE of it.   As a P.S. someone (evidently Quora) has recategorized this question and it now does not appear on the home page for group response. That to me is a chicken butt move.  :-(  Set me straight if I'm wrong, Quora!
