Can I use 3D charts in my PowerPoint presentations?
Yes definitely you can. With a bit of touch-up using bevels and surface materials, you can obtain amazing 3D pie charts in PowerPoint. Look at this one from my PowerPoint 2010 archives: Its not as bad and unprofessional as a lot of people say. Things largely depend on your angle and perspective. Another example with glossy surface (PowerPoint 2010): I agree to the point that sometimes it does misrepresent data, but if you use it smartly enough, it can actually make people look at your otherwise 'boring' and 'lifeless' data, such as this - Sometimes, grayscale does the magic for pie-charts - There are no hard and fast rules as such. I agree they are less formal, but it all depends on where and how you're going to present. Good Luck!
