My education slope is constant from my childhood to BE, is it a good sign or a bad sign?
good sign sign of increasing slope in educational career is very good ...most students dream to maintain it ....but most of them fail in their attempts.    You need not worry even a little because that brings tension in you and your career slowly gets ruined .....You shuld be bothered if you were having a decresing slope rather you have a constant slope ...this means your state of mind in the field of education is constant(This is a good sign) Ultimately your graph is good
