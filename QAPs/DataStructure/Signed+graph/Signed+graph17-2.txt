Why don't more young professionals buy into a Wine Clubs? What is appealing/unappealing about a wine subscription?
Wrong product for the target market? Often the wine club's stock is 'dumped stock' or pre-purchased in bulk, and I believe most customers can see through this. In many cases, it is not a guarantee that the wine is good quality. Young professionals generally have more funds and would probably prefer a customised, wine cellar approach instead of a wine club. If the wine 'club' model was based on curation of new wines that may be more suitable for the Young Professional market. Plus it should be seen as a private, exclusive by-invite-only, velvety rope kind of 'club' â€“ not a club that mum and dad join. I would consider offering a $500 a month wine 'club' for young professionals, which offered one-off local wines, international wines and a vintage wine (or two). I would promote the wine by subscription model 'vs' the club model. 'Club' just sounds old. It is critical to create an online experience of discovery that is different and is not possible at the cellar door. Since most wine clubs are online, I think the Bottlenotes.com concept of creating a Taste Profile for each person so that you can create social connections with similar wine drinkers is the missing ingredient from other 'clubs'. Appealing: Someone else doing the work, and easier to share discoveries. Not appealing: Wine discovery at the cellar door is more fun.
