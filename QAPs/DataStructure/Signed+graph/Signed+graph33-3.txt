Why is the shear force diagram for uniformly distributed loads asymmetric even though it is a symmetric beam?
consider a  beam with a point load acting in the middle so that you can clearly get the concept of shear force . shear force being a force should follow some directions . You should understand that we take same signs only  when the two half's of the beam behave and move in the same direction of the force applied but in the above case half part of the beam moves down and the remaining half  part of the beam goes up when the forces acts down then both parts of the beam should definitely get the opposite signs because they are behaving in the different way for the same force acting.literally they are moving in opposite directions so they get opposite signs,it is as simple as that YOUR DIAGRAM SHOULD SOMETHING LOOK LIKE THIS BELOW FIGURE  (FIG -2) ,IF YOU DETAIL IT ,because uniform load is nothing but distributed point load                           FIG-2
