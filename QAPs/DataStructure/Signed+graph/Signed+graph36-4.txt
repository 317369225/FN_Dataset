What are some unknown facts about the cast & crew of the television show Friends?
I would like to add these :  The character of Ursula (Phoebe's twin sister) first appeared in the sitcom "Mad About You" as a waitress. Lisa Kudrow played Ursula on both "Mad About You" and "Friends". The shows creators did not originally intend for Phoebe to have a twin, but they added the character to explain why Kudrow was appearing on two different shows on the same network, at one time as a part of the same Thursday night line-up. David Schwimmer (Ross) was offered Will Smith's part in "Men in Black" but turned it down. And finally an intresting one : Out of the three main guys, Monica has only kissed Chandler. Rachel and Phoebe have each kissed all three. Rachel  dated Ross, kissed Chandler in two different flashback episodes, and  kissed Joey during that horrible arc where they were a couple. Phoebe  kissed Chandler on that episode where she was trying to out his  relationship with Monica, she kissed Joey a few times randomly (while he  was preparing for an acting role and after he fulfilled her goal to  have the 'perfect kiss'), and she kissed Ross on New Year's Eve and in a  flashback of the friends before Rachel came along. Monica  has ONLY kissed Chandler. She was originally supposed to be with Joey,  but they ditched that storyline. Even though there were a few episodes  where she and Joey were "together" for joke purposes, they never kissed.  (Now, some of you die-hard fans will say I'm incorrect because Ross,  her own brother, was her "midnight mystery kisser." However, we never  saw the kiss, so it doesn't count.) Source (hubpages)
