Astrology: What are the effects of the Mars-Saturn opposition in the chart of a person with an Aries ascendant Moon-sign Virgo, if Mars is present in 5th house/Leo?
In addition to what RTK has indicated--> Any time Sat/Mars especially mutually aspecting as in 1/7 or 4/10 --connection is there--It gives a rise to Status due to the aggression, self belief, tenacity, energy of the individual but the climb will not be easy. Stomach and Legs some problems. Won't be surprised if some scar exists in these two places or at least one of them. Some accidents. Child of the native or grandfather of the native could have been uprooted from native place at a young age (<10 years) or will have an accident but escape unhurt but vehicle can be severly damaged (that too in a T junction) Mother will have health problems. Very analytical. Engineer /technical  .
