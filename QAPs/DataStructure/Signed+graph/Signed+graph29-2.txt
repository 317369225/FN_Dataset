How is it possible that scientists achieved a temperature that is lower than absolute zero?
The other answers to this question are excellent. But if you are still trying to get your head around this, think of it this way: In thermodynamics we might talk about system A at some internal energy and system B at a lower internal energy. Normally, if you bring these two systems together, heat will flow from the system of higher internal energy (A) to the system of lower internal energy (B). If our two systems are systems of atoms, this will always be the case. But these guys have created a system that includes magnets and lasers such that when it is brought into contact with a system of higher internal energy, heat will flow from their special system (of lower internal energy) to a system of higher internal energy, hence the interpretation of a negative temperature, since heat flows in the wrong direction. The confusion comes from our normally associating 'temperature', with 'internal energy' which is not appropriate here.
