How is it possible that scientists achieved a temperature that is lower than absolute zero?
That is pretty wild.  I'll be interested to see if the results are repeated by other teams. If I'm understanding what they're saying (and there's no guarantee I am), it sounds to me like: They are depicting the temperature scale to be something like this: The scale starts at absolute zero and increases to infinity (although infinity isn't really infinity - it's just the highest possible energy state.  So, at very low temperatures we'd expect the particles in a cloud to all be at low energy states.  If we imagine a graph of energy level that is like a sine curve and then put all the particles on that curve, at low temperature it would look like this: At the infinity reading we would actually expect the plot to look like the below plot.  The particles aren't all at the top, because at the highest temperature, we'd expect entropy to be at a maximum, so the particles would be as spread out as they can get. Now this is where the weird part comes in.  They seem to be saying that it is possible to heat the particles even more, and to push them all to the highest energy stage, even though this requires that we LOWER ENTROPY!  So, the below picture would be at the far end of our temperature dial, which is actually NEGATIVE ABSOLUTE ZERO!  Weird, huh? I think the important thing to do to even try to imagine this scenario is to stop thinking about temperature as hot/cold, like we conventionally do.  Instead think of temperature in terms of the characteristics of temperature - energy states and entropy.  What they have done is create a gas cloud that has the characteristics of a negative temperature.  But, they DID NOT PASS THROUGH ABSOLUTE ZERO TO GET THERE.  Instead, they pushed through infinity, into negativity infinity, and then down. At least that's how I'm interpreting what they are saying.
