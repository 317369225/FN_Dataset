Is it possible to solve the equation [math]x^3 - 6 x^2 + 3x + 10 = 0[/math] without the help of the hit-and-trial method?
Indeed, this equation can be solved fairly easily. The first step in the general solution of cubic equations is completing the cube: replacing the first two terms, [math]x^3+px^2[/math], with [math](x+p/3)^3-(p^2/3)x-p^3/27[/math]. Here, [math]p=-6[/math], and therefore we get   [math](x-2)^3-9x+18=0[/math],   or   [math](x-2)^3-9(x-2)=0[/math],   which can be further factored as   [math](x-2)[(x-2)^2-9]=0[/math].   Its solutions are given by [math]x=2[/math] and [math](x-2)^2=9[/math], the latter solved by [math]x=5[/math] and [math]x=-1[/math].
