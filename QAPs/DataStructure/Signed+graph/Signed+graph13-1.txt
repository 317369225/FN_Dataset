Can any professional astrologer tell that ifÂ  Planet Sun is located in Sagittarius sign, which is 3rd house in my birth chart then what kinda impact this will have on me
Yes and no. Things like your Ascendent (AC) and the placement of its ruler matter more than your sun sign. And any good astrologer is going to want to look at your AC, Sun and Moon together. If you can get me that info I could give you an educated answer. So, missing the majority of the data notwithstanding... Sag Sun in the 3rd... I'd expect education and/or travel to be quite important. Both Sag and the 3rd house indicate travel (the 3rd, short distance and day-to-day; and Sag long-distance), as well as education ( the 3rd, grade school; an Sag all higher ed). Maybe you relocated for school? International student? Maybe you moved around as a kid? Flight attendant? Hard to say with just sun sign info. I'm happy to tell you more if you give me more of your chart details?
