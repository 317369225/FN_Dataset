Where can I find a great infographic designer?
I highly recommend to choose a design agency that meets your expectations in regard of visual aesthetics, execution and budget. Have a close look at their previous work to see whether their style is a fit for your target audience. Keep in mind that some agencies have limited availability due to high demand, thus get in touch as early as possible to keep the roadmap reasonable. Here's a list of people that I think create exceptional work and I often recommend: Nicholas Felton http://feltron.com Stefanie Posavec http://itsbeenreal.co.uk Always With Honor http://alwayswithhonor.com Column Five Media http://columnfivemedia.com Golden Section Graphics http://golden-section-graphics.com Catalogtree http://catalogtree.net Hyperakt http://hyperakt.com David McCandless http://informationisbeautiful.net Tiffany Farrant http://tiffanyfarrant.co.ukAlso, you could get in touch with us (http://interactivethings.com).
