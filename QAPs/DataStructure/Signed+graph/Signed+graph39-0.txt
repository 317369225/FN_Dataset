Why does Ashton Kutcher have only ~900 followers on Quora when he has 6M+ on Twitter?
Ashton Kutcher was actually a very early user of Quora, and back then Quora a) didn't accept Twitter as a method of signing up and logging in and b) didn't import the social graphs of users when they signed up. Therefore, every single one of his follows is from someone manually clicking on the Follow button on his profile. Updated 220w ago • View Upvotes • Not for Reproduction
