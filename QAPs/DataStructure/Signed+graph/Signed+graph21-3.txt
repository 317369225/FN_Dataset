Is Barack Obama America's one and only supreme leader? If not, why does he pass so many executive orders?
Firstly, the Constitution has been carefully written so that there is no Supreme Leader. The different branches of government are all set up so that none is Supreme. In fact, the President is very constrained compared to some foreign Presidents. Secondly, what does a Supreme Leader do? He gives orders. And since they are on behalf of the Chief Executive, they are Executive Orders. So the way you could judge a Supreme leader is by the number of orders he gives - id he spends his time trying to persuade people instead of issuing orders, he is not very Supreme. So Obama's relatively small number of EOs suggests that he is not very Supreme.
