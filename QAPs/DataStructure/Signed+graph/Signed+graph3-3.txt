Where is the chart that shows when the astrological Sun sign is in the water element?
Astrologers find when the Sun enters and leaves the water signs (Pisces, Cancer and Scorpio) by looking it up in an ephemeris such as the 21st Century 200 to 2050 at midnight by Neil F. Michelsen and Rique Pottenger.   The ephemeris is mostly used by astrologers as it is quite expensive and only consists of tables showing planetary movements.  Professional astrologers also have chart calculation software that calculate when the Sun and other planets enter and leave a sign. To simplify things for you, listed below are the times when the Sun enters and leaves the water signs in the year 2016: Sun Enters Pisces:  Feb 18 2016 10:33:40 pm (MST +7:00) Sun Leaves Pisces:         Mar 19 2016 10:30:09 pm (MDT +6:00) Sun Enters Cancer: Jun 20 2016 4:34:09 pm (MDT +6:00) Sun Leaves Cancer: Jul 22 2016 3:30:11 am (MDT +6:00) Sun Enters Scorpio: Oct 22 2016 5:45:32 pm (MDT +6:00) Sun Leaves Scorpio: Nov 21 2016 2:22:20 pm (MST +7:00) You can use this as a guide.  However, it is very important to understand that in some years the Sun will enter and leave a sign on a different day than when is shown for 2016.  It some cases, it can vary by several days before and after the dates shown here. Finally, there are now several apps for Apple and Android that will calculate where the planets are on any given day.  Time Passages makes an especially good one for the Apple Iphone.
