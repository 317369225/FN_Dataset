How do you define 'traction' for a start-up?
1) Established Brand - visibility in your vertical market(s) and customers, evangelists, partners, investors "grok" what your company and products/services are about. 2) Revenue Stream(s) in place. 3) Referenceable customers. 4) Web Site Traffic. 5) Social Media Visibility & Acknowledgment by Influencers. 6) High Growth may or may not be good - too much can kill a startup as fast as no customers or traction. Every new startup is not going to be like Google, Groupon, Facebook or dare I say Quora. 7) Localization or Strategic partners outside of US who support and believe in your product, services and company. 8) Cohesive management team that has worked together through rough patches in the road. 9) Sufficient revenue, customers or "visibility" to drive investment (if needed). 10) Customer advocates who evangelize your brand.
