Is Barack Obama America's one and only supreme leader? If not, why does he pass so many executive orders?
Okay, the standard you seem to have set is that the number of Executive Orders a President passes demonstrates how dictatorial and "supreme" they consider themselves to be.  The obvious contrast then would be that any President who uses few Executive Orders is obviously respectful of democracy, doesn't consider himself "supreme" and seeks to use the democratic process rather than just impose his will. Well, the other posts have already demonstrated that...among modern Presidents...Obama posts remarkably few Executive Orders.  So by using your own standard, you've just proven that he's not someone who considers himself a supreme leader, he seems to be very respective of democratic process, doesn't consider himself better than other leaders.
