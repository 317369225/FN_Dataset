Why haven't any companies been able to challenge LinkedIn?
I think the best positioned company to challenge LinkedIn is Quora itself.  It is definitely true, as Adam and others have pointed out, that LinkedIn network effect is very strong and any challenger will have to have serious critical mass just to try. But Quora does have such mass, and also has superior quality. LinkedIn graph is basically about who one knows and does not say anything specific, beside claims, about what they know and how good they are. On Quora, I can see that instantly by going through their posts and see how good their expertise in the field of their answers is, how well they write and express themselves and how well they manage their reputation and standing on Quora. Right now, I would not hesitate for a moment to use Quora content as direct evidence in support of someone I am interviewing and I would prefer the quality of their answers (and questions and other contributions) to  just who they are connected to on LinkedIn. Actually, even in terms of connections, I would much rather like to see that a candidate had meaningful interactions on Quora  I can see with someone instead of just having a link to them on LinkedIn. This business model is superior in terms of margins and profitability to other models such as advertising, as the stellar growth of LinkedIn revenues and profits has shown. IMHO Quora has an amazing opportunity to disrupt LinkedIn and generate lots of revenue from it. We will see (probably soon)  if they do it :) ...
