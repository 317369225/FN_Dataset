Why is the fundamental theorem of calculus nontrivial?
No, it's not the definition of the derivative.  Indeed, it doesn't define anything. It's a theorem which says when you graph the derivative, then the signed area under the curve is equal to the total change in the function. The derivative  [math]f'(x)[/math]  is the rate of change change in the function [math]f[/math]  at  [math]x.[/math] The integral  [math]\int_a^b F(x)\,dx[/math]  of a function  [math]F[/math]  is the area under the curve  [math]y=F(x),[/math]  above the x-axis, and between the lines  [math]x=a[/math]  and  [math]x=b.[/math]  (If the graph  [math]y=F(x)[/math]  dips below the x-axis, then the area below the x-axis has to be subtracted, and so the integral actually gives the signed area.)  This area can be computed by finer and finer areas of rectangles, called the Riemann integral, so in fact, the integral can be defined formally without explicit reference to areas. That the area under the graph of the derivative is equal to the total change in the function was first shown by Nicole Oresme in about 1350.  His mathematical language was different because symbolic algebra had yet to be invented.
