Is it possible to solve the equation [math]x^3 - 6 x^2 + 3x + 10 = 0[/math] without the help of the hit-and-trial method?
Let's say you don't know the cubic formula, Cardan's formula, Newton's method, etc, but you do vaguely remember from school that [math](x+a)(x+b)=x^2+(a+b)x+ab[/math], so you suspect that a third degree polynomial might be factored into [math](x+a)(x+b)(x+c)[/math], in which case [math]-a[/math], [math]-b[/math] and [math]-c[/math] would be roots. So you grab a piece of paper and multiply out [math](x+a)(x+b)(x+c)[/math] and you get [math]x^3+(a+b+c)x^2+(ab+ac+bc)x+abc[/math] Comparing that to [math]x^3-6x^2+3x+10[/math], you confirm that the coefficient of [math]x^3[/math] is 1 in both expressions. Good. Now, for the other coefficients we see that: [math](a+b+c)=-6[/math] [math](ab+ac+bc)=3[/math] [math]abc=10[/math] Now, if [math]a+b+c=-6[/math], then at least one of those three variables has to be negative. But [math]abc=10[/math], so one of the other variables must also be negative. Guessing/hoping/assuming that the roots are going to be integers (because they often are in this sort of question), you look for factors of 10 to satisfy that [math]abc=10[/math] bit. [math]1\times2\times5[/math] and [math]1\times1\times10[/math] are the only combinations you find. (I should mention here that in all the expressions above a, b and c are interchangeable, soit doesn't matter which value you assign to a, which to b and which to c). OK - so there's no way you're gonna satisfy [math](a+b+c)=-6[/math] with two 1s and a 10, BUT a 1, a 2 and a 5, with two of them negative, will do the trick [math]1+(-2)+(-5)[/math] is indeed equal to -6. A quick check verifies that [math](1(-2)+1(-5)+(-2)(-5))=(-2-5+10)=3[/math], which satisifes [math](ab+ac+bc)=3[/math] Factorisation complete! Now we know [math]x^3-6x^2+3x+10=(x+1)(x-2)(x-5)[/math]. For that to be equal to zero, any of those three brackets must evaluate to zero, so the answers are -1, 2 and 5.
