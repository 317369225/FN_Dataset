Is Barack Obama America's one and only supreme leader? If not, why does he pass so many executive orders?
He actually has passed a lower number of executive orders than several of his predecessors.    It's just that the ones he has made have been very vigorously opposed by the other party, who claim that he's been uniquely willing to use what is constitutional power.    This rather disproves the suggested premise of the question though.
