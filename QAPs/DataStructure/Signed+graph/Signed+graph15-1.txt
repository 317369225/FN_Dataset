What are the best resources for learning data visualization?
To learn data visualization, you will need two things: data and visualization tools. Collect or get some data and create your first graphs using some of these tools: Static Visualizations ggplot2 is among the best R tools to plot data. It is based on the grammar of graphics book by  Leland Wilkinson and has a simple and elegant syntax Matplotlib is the de facto Python tool for plotting. It is a comprehensive solution. Seaborn is an extension to Matplotlib that offers more graphical options Dynamic Visualizations D3.js is a great tool for data-oriented graphical representations Leaflet.js is an open-source geographical plotting library Shiny allows R users to write small web applications. It can be combined with ggplot2 to create powerful interactive visualizations Bokeh allows you to write interactive graphs with Python. Good luck learning data visualization!
