How do you define 'traction' for a start-up?
I don't think profitability is a immediate and convincing sign of traction in a start up. Sure, profitability is a good barometer of how well a company is performing financially but it's not a good indication of market penetration or product/service uptake/usage. If you had 1 customer after 6mths in operation paying you $10k/mth with a cost base of $500/mth then you are profitable but you certainly don't have traction. You only have 1 customer, which is obviously a risk, lose that 1 customer and you fail. Twitter is a great example of this, do they have traction? - YES , Are they profitable? - NO These would be my priorities 1. Engagement 2. Traffic 3.1. Users/Clients 3.2. Partnerships 4. Revenues 5. Profitability - Profitability can only be achieved when you have revenue- Revenue can only be achieved once you have paying clients (I don't see investment capital as revenue)- Clients are a direct result of engagement and traffic.- Acceleration of client acquisition can be found via partnerships Engagement is critical. I have seen many great startups fail because they don't or can't engage with their target market. Without engagement you can't even begin to measure traction as you have none.
