Is Quora's practice of auto-following select Twitter Followers AND adding topics without your permission shady, frustrating, etc.?
I just set up my Quora account - ack! I autofollowed over 3,000 people. How can this possibly be useful to me in any way? I keep getting topics added as fast as I can remove them. I currently have almost 180 topics still after spending around 10 minutes purging many. Definitely bad practice to autofollow people like this and add topics without our permission.
