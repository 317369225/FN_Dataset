What is the most bizarre job interview you have ever been party to?
I had a fun interview at McKinsey & Co. We were 8 interviewees in a conference room, with pizzas in front of us. There were two interviewers in isolated rooms, who were calling us one at a time. One of the interviewers arrived an hour late, so effectively there were going to be 7 interviews before lunch, and 9 after. We interviewees did not know this -- and everyone, except me, got interviewed before lunch. No one really understood why I wasn't interviewed yet. Long story short, we started having lunch. I assumed we should be using forks and knives to eat the pizza -- this was McKinsey & Co. Apparently, it was only me who was using silverware. We started talking, discussing old-heard stories of bizarre McKinsey interviews, and how I haven't been called yet, wherein I made a remark -- "How would you guys feel if I was an interviewer, and have been observing you for the past 3 hours?". If I remember correctly, 2 slices of pizza landed on the floor, 3 of the interviewees immediately picked up silverware, and the other 2 almost ran out of the conference room! [I was really only an interviewee] Epilogue: I did not get the job offer. After my first interview went a little too well, both the partners came up to me and told me I was "over-qualified" for the role I was interviewing for. I was informed that I contact the recruiter and reschedule my interviews for the next higher up position in the coming week; I got a call next morning from the recruiter saying that I'm "under-qualified" for the other position, so they cannot extend me an offer.
