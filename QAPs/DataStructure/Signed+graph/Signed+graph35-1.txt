How does breaking writing into paragraphs work?
A paragraph is a block of text that addresses a certain topic in one or several sentences. Typically, a paragraph is as long or as short as it needs to be for its purpose, with sentences more or less as thoughts, and the paragraph collecting thoughts on the same topic. This paragraph here has introduced the idea behind breaking text into paragraphs and is now discussing their structure in a more specific sense. It won't go on for much longer, because the idea itself is pretty general. What I want to do is give you clear examples of use. See what happened there? I started on the general idea, broke it into a bit of detail and followed it down to where it naturally led to a different idea. This is actually part of the fun and creativity of writing: there are rules; some strict, some less so. You could even say that most of them are often just guides, with the goal being that what you produce is clear and readable. In other words, it has to be written with the reader in mind. While short paragraphs can serve a purpose, one of my favourite books of all time has paragraphs that go for longer than a page. Don't worry, I won't replicate that here! I just hope that this discussion gives you some food for thought. Best of luck!
