Is Quora's practice of auto-following select Twitter Followers AND adding topics without your permission shady, frustrating, etc.?
It surprised me, but I kind of like it to a point. The past few weeks have been showing me who on my Facebook social graph have been signing up, as they auto-follow me. My policy (at the moment, subject to change) has been to follow everyone back that follows me.  I figure either we have something in common here & they found me, or we are connected on FB where I have my own filter process. But it was surprising to me at first. I'd love it if it gave me the option to follow specific people when I signed up, but also notified me when people from my FB social graph signed up so I could go follow them if I wanted to. However - I have no idea how complex the engineering issue is in that case.  It may not be something that Quora could easily implement with the structure as it stands. So it may be unreasonable. That said, I have to answer: No, not shady, but yes, a little frustrating.  But also a little useful.
