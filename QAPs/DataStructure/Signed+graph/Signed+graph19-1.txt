Can I use 3D charts in my PowerPoint presentations?
You can, but you should be aware that there has been a big shift in the last few years in design thinking, where we moved (back) from so-called "skeuomorphic" (realistic-looking) to flat designs. This was most notable in Apple's latest released of its Mac OS, but the change has been rather pervasive; pretty much everyone followed suit, and since Windows 8 we are seeing similar designs, not to mention open source desktops like KDE. Arguably, 3D graphs fall into the skeuomorphic class of design. With that in mind, you should consider that "flat" is now arguably back in fashion, and whether a flat graph (which cannot really be skewed by perspective) is not a better choice for your presentation. While 3D graphs may look nice (to some), they have the drawback that they can skew reality because items that are "further away" can appear smaller. There are of course many debates on flat vs skeuomorphic design. Read the following article for an interesting introduction: The Battle Between Flat Design And Skeuomorphism. Disclaimer: I had never heard about skeuomorphic design until a course I did a few months back, in which the instructor introduced the concept. Before that, I disliked the flat look, but since understanding more of the reason behind it, I have come to embrace it.
