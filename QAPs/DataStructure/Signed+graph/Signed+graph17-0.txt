Why don't more young professionals buy into a Wine Clubs? What is appealing/unappealing about a wine subscription?
I think the model of a wine club is a little outdated.  The customer needs to be empowered with the choice of what wines to buy.  Going forward you will see more wine buying models like lot18.com and what Gary Vaynerchuk is doing with "Big Button Deals" (passing special deals along to customers with bulk buying highly rated wines).  There are a lot of localized and specialized models too, Garagiste in Seattle comes to mind. In the wine world everyone believes that they are an expert, so giving the customer the power to be their own expert is what will get these savvy wine shoppers to sign up.  The major issues with most of these programs has more issues riding up against god-forsaken state laws and the three-tier system.
