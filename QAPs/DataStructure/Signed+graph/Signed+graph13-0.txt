Can any professional astrologer tell that if  Planet Sun is located in Sagittarius sign, which is 3rd house in my birth chart then what kinda impact this will have on me
The Sun is your essential self and through life we move towards the 'light of the Sun'. Carl Jung asserts that we should 'strive to be who we are' and in this sense your natal Sun will give you a hint of that direction even though all the other parts of your birthchart will also have an influence.   Sagittarians aim high as shown by the symbol of a half man half horse with a bow and arrow pointed to the sky. He is emerging from his animal nature and aiming high although there is no target. The energy is vibrant, curious expanding and ever spiralling upwards.   The third house is the house of communication and short distance travel which is also a form of communication. Knowledge, and education also creep into the communication of knowledge as does ones siblings since they are formative factor in ones growth environment.   So you would be a person with a lot of questions and an ability to talk the legs off a chair. Always rushing around searching for an answer and striving to know more about whatever interests you. Teaching would be a good profession for you as would sales or any profession that requires a front man with a loud voice.
