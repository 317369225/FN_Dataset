Where is the chart that shows when the astrological Sun sign is in the water element?
I'm not sure if I understood your question. But anyway: The water signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. So, any planet (astrologically speaking, the Sun and the Moon are also planets) in any of them is in "the water element", and only in them. Aquarius is not a water sign, not any of the other signs. If you're born when the Sun was in Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, your astrological Sun Sign is a water sign. If not, no. You don't need a special chart for that, just open your birth chart (the chart cast for the time/place of your birth) and look where the Sun is. In fact, if you were not born in those days next to when the Sun changes sign (around 21st of most months), you don't even need it. If you're born in the 20th of April, I'd check the birth chart. If you were born in the 15th, your Sun would be without a doubt in Aries, for example - and surely not in a water sign. If this is not what you meant by your question, please ask again.
