Date-wise my sun sign shows to be Scorpio. But the sun in my natal chart is in Libra. What is my real sun sign then?
Since the chart is created according to the exact date including the year, time and place you were born--the real Sun sign will be determined by your chart, not by the date. The Sun, Moon and other planets make ingress (moves to the next sign) at different times and often on different dates. In fact, according to NASA's best guesstimate, all parts of the cosmos return to the same positions in the heavens where they were at given point in time roughly 25828 years after the first time. In short, that means even your twin, no matter how close in birth time, cannot have precisely the same chart you do. If your chart shows Libra for the Sun with your having used the exact date including the year, the exact time and the exact place you were born, then you're a Libra. If you haven't done so yet, check your chart at Horoscope and Astrology - Homepage - Astrodienst and see what that says. If that says you're a Libra Sun, you can bank on that: You're a Libra Sun. Hope that helps.
