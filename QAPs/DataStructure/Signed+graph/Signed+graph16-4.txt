Is Quora's practice of auto-following select Twitter Followers AND adding topics without your permission shady, frustrating, etc.?
I think in all fairness to Quora they're seeing explosive growth. So that was probably a great idea when only 5 - 10% of your friends/contacts were on. Looking at the huge spike though of the last few months they'll probably revisit. Growing pain?
