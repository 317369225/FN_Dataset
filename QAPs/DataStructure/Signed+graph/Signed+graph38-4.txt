Why haven't any companies been able to challenge LinkedIn?
LinkedIn's current vision as an HR tool and sales intelligence data source is simply not interesting. Many people say "yes I am on it but I don't use it". Pulse is addictive but discussions are short and resemble fleeting Twitter conversations. Quora and Medium are better platforms. I can publish on Pulse to reach my LinkedIn contacts, but I am not compelled to write exclusive original content. Pulse also is a great platform for influencers. LinkedIn will eventually get disrupted in several areas. I am working on something closer to its original vision, which is to make business deals happen.
