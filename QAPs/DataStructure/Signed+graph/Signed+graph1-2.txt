Is it possible to solve the equation [math]x^3 - 6 x^2 + 3x + 10 = 0[/math] without the help of the hit-and-trial method?
By hit and trial method, do you mean checking the eight divisors of 10?Â  (1,2,5,10, and their negatives) There are cubic formulas, just like the quadratic formula, but they're a little more complicated, and they sometimes introduce sums of imaginary numbers that aren't obviously real numbers.
