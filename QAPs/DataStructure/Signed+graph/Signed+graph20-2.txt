Why is the fundamental theorem of calculus nontrivial?
The answer by Lorenzo Sadun is very good: it is complete, direct and straight to the point. I just want to add about the psychological side of the question. Indeed, [math]\int_a^b f'(x)\,dx =f(b)-f(a)[/math] looks trivial because it looks simply as a definition of definite integral. And it looks such, because we use very similar notations for indefinite integral [math]\int f(x)\,dx[/math]. But the situation is the opposite: we now use similar notations for definite and indefinite integrals thanks to the fundamental theorem of calculus (FTC). In fact, definite integral is defined as a limit of a certain sum, and indefinite integral is defined as antiderivative - two seemingly different things. For details read Lorenzo Sadun's answer.
