If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
I find Facebook to be an exemplary tool for maintaining ties with the people of your past and present.Â  Twitter on the other hand, is an incredible tool to branch out and explore who is out there basically risk-free. The interests and contacts I have developed through my Twitter account, particularly in the arenas of Modern Art, Philosophy, Design, and Spirituality have been illuminating.
