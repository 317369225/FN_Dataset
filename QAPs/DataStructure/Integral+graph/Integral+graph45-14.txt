If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
You should, if they're hot or smart, or have really selective friends. Freaky-looking profile photos are good for a few points too. Facebook used to be about privacy and people you know, but now it's just another public marketing channel. Vive la difference! Happy friending!
