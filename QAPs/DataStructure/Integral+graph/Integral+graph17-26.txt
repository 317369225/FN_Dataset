What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
Identity. Search gave us a way of finding things. Social gave us a way of communicating. But is there a good model for who we are? It's more than just personalization and it's more than the interest graph. In both cases, they speak to our tastes. But our identity consists of questions like: What are our desires/goals? What is our history? And how does that effect how I am today? Facebook and Google has taken steps in this direction. Google tracks where you go and Facebook tracks your likes and clicks. But both of these either take a lot of work or they are crude approximations. Plus they also miss the offline element. Just food for thought but what if there were a browser that tracked every site I viewed, every product I research, every article I read and the time spent doing all of this. Of course privacy were an issue but if I had control (and not a third-party like Google or Facebook), that could tell me so much more about my interests, my desires and my goals without "Like"-ing anything. What if my phone knew that I spend the weekends with my kids or that I've been spending too much time at work and it's time for a vacation? What if it knew that I am a big fan of Japanese food because of the frequency by which I eat there? What if it did this without "checking in"? The manner in which we communicate with technology is still pretty crude and there's a lot of room for automation.
