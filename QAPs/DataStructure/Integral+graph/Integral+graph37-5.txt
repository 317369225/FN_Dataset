How did Quora suddenly start getting many more users around the beginning of 2011?Loads of my contacts have suddenly started to follow me over the last two weeks. Is it due to SEO?
Well as Quora has been around for a while specific on-site functions can't be the only answer. The hockey stick curve is probably kicking in due to: i) the Press has deciding they need a new darling and have chosen Quora and hence the flood of press; ii) the technorati backing a winner early offers the chance to state your visionary qualities and is self fulfilling (see previous); iii) the product scales across users well (things like spotify don't scale across regions therefore there are terminators in the chain reaction); iv) there are massive inherent ego boosts to those engaging and the audience for self promotion has just hit critical mass for recognition. ;-)
