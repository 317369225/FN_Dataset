My calculus teacher said that it's impossible to integrate the function sin(x 2 )  . How, then, is my TI-84 graphing calculator able to find the area underneath its curve between two points?
First of all, It is a misconception that some particular functions are integerable and others aren't. As integration means to find such a function whose rate of change wrt to change in a particular independent variable is the given function, and such a curve always exist. To prove my point, lets assume a long road with no ends(symbolizing the y-axis ie the position axis).Let a car be placed(initially t=0,it is at rest) anywhere on the road.now the car is programmed in such a way that the speed of car at any time t is cos(t). Now somehow we are able to record the position of the car on the road at every instant dt moved by car. When we plot the position of car along y-axis and the time along x-axis we get a curve (continuous-as every dt has been taken in account; differntiable-as no steep changes in the velocity is practically possible). This curve is actually  ∫cos(t)dt. Now as this curve has complete resemblance with the predefined curve of sin(t),hence we say that--∫cos(t)dt = sin(t)+ c. Here c is any arbitrary constant as the car could have been placed any where on the road. Now suppose we were unaware of the function sin(t) than we would say that cos(t) is not integerable. Same analogy holds for the question that whether sinx2 is integerable or not.hence we should ask whether there is a predefined function whose derivative is sin x^2 or not. Hence,it all depends whether the integerand of the given function has already been well defined mathematically or not. For example-erf(x) is used to define ∫e^x^2 dx. Hence,the graphing calculator is able to calculate the area under the curve without even defining the function,by some approximation methods.
