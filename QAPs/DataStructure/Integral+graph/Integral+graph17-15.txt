What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
Mobile. I very strongly think mobile is the next big thing, and if you haven't already noticed it is already here. It took me some time to realize it though. Now with all (are there any tech companies without a focus on mobile?) the major companies taking the mobile-first approach, and few of them brave enough to take the mobile-only approach some major money is being pumped into it. Consider initiatives like Android One by Google which plans to take the Android platform to low cost mobile phones in developing nations, and programs like Internet Org by Facebook and Project Loon by Google which are striving towards bringing the rest of the unconnected world to the internet, where again the main medium for accessing the internet would be a mobile device. Also Project Aria by Google is again an initiative geared towards building cheap modular phones which are easily upgradable. It is mobile everywhere. There are probably a ton other initiatives, but I'd like to point you to some interesting numbers. Now if you see Facebook's 2014 Q4 results (Page on shareholder.com) you'll find some very interesting numbers. * FB has 1.4 billion monthly active users * Of that 1.2 billion access FB from their mobile devices i.e., 85.7% * From that number, 530 million people access FB from a mobile device only i.e., 37% That last number is ridiculously high, and goes on to show how important mobile has become. Think about it, many of us did not have a smart phone 2-3 years ago (I did not), and now it would be really hard to even imagine without having one. Updated 26 Feb â€¢ View Upvotes
