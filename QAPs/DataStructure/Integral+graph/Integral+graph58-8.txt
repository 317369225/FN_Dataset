What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
I've reviewed and tested dozens of project management applications in the search for the perfect tool to manage a small to medium digital agency. At this point I've settled on Liquid Planner (http://liquidplanner.com) for project tracking , resource scheduling and time tracking, Asana (http://asana.com) for micro task management and collaboration, Xero (http://xero.com) for quoting and billing. Liquid Planner is one of the most useful resource capacity management tools I've ever come across, given its priority-based scheduling approach. Very useful for doing capacity planning as well as managing the day to day workflow through the studio.
