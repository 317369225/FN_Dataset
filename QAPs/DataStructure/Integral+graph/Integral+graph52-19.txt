Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Every time I've tried FB Graph Search, the results weren't at all helpful. The idea has potential, but I don't see it being a danger unless FB makes some significant improvements to it.
