What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
I haven't found it yet!  Some glue and rubber bands holding together various systems works, and Jira ain't bad, but I haven't found anything particularly compelling in this market hole sadly.  Asana is glorified todo but it works too.  If you find something that works for you let me know.  This is a hugely common problem for small digital agencies, and the fact that there isn't anything that's really killing it for the market space is shocking considering the plethora of options...
