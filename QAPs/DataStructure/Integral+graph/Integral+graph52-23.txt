Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
A few quick thoughts on the topic:   Given my profession, I have a bias towards Facebook and spend a lot of time on the site. However, I also would not want to restrict my future discovery (restaurants, stores, vacation spots, etc.) to just the things that my network of friends have endorsed or checked into on Facebook. Perhaps once I have had an opportunity to vet my options (aka I am further down the funnel) I might be more interested in what my network endorses, but certainly not always and at every stage of my research.   Secondly, and what I believe to be an inherent issue with Facebook today is the fact that so many of us are “friends” with legitimate friends and family, but also acquaintances (people we used to work with, go to school with, just met, etc). It doesn’t always make sense for me to see advertising based on what a girl I went to high school with 20 years liked on Facebook. Now I am going to see restaurant recommendations in Miami based on where she ate and enjoyed a recent meal? Don’t get me wrong, I understand there are other components to the FB’s algorithm that determine ad serving and search results but at a high level these are my thoughts. In summary, I like it and will continue to test it, but I know that for the immediate future I will continue to use other sources as well for answers, recommendations, etc.
