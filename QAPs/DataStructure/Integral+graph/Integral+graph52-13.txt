Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Well No I don't think so. Yes as an idea, Facebook graph search is cool but when I make a search I don't want to see what my friends liked or did. I need answers from people who are good at in telling me what I'm looking for. This is same as Facebook questions vs Quora, People selected Quora more than Facebook questions because in Quora people who knew the subject answered the questions. And after some time Facebook stopped Facebook questions. I don't say Facebook will stop graph search, but I'll prefer answers of the professionals when I'm looking for something.
