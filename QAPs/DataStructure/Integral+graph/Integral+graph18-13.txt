Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
Both of them - Nagios and Zabbix - are worth to try. Their major advantage is that they are open source. But in personal oppinion these programs are too difficult to use in some cases. Too many installations, plagins, settings. We are using 10-Strike Network Monitor It is easy to install, has huge number of different checks that allow to keep an eye on the whole network, and you can set notifications, if something is going wrong. Company has another one - Network Mapping and Monitoring NMS It can draw a network map in addition. Hope, my experience will be helpful Best wishes Elison
