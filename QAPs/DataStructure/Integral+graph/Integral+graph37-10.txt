How did Quora suddenly start getting many more users around the beginning of 2011?Loads of my contacts have suddenly started to follow me over the last two weeks. Is it due to SEO?
Originally Answered: Why did Quora get so much attention at the beginning of January 2011?Speaking from my personal experience: I was introduced here by an article on AOL news about technologies that will rock 2011. AOL has a lot of users, that could be the case. Seeing this might intrigue people because its much more intellectual than Yahoo! Answers, at least, it is in my opinion.
