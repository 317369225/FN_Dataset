What is the easiest way to calculate the area under the curve (integral) of a graph in excel?
Hi, You can calculate the integral in Excel using the data that were graphed, the graph itself is not needed for that. Numerical integration Alternatively, you can use the "chemist method", i.e. print the figure, cut out the area under the curve, and measure  the weight of the cut-out paper piece using a scale. A precise analytical scale is needed, that can measure for tenth of milligrams, chemists have these in the lab. You will have to measure the weight of a reference area, too, so that the area could be calculated from the masses and the size of the reference area.  A very old method from the age of strip chart recorders... :-)
