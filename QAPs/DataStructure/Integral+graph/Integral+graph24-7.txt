My calculus teacher said that it's impossible to integrate the function sin(x 2 )  . How, then, is my TI-84 graphing calculator able to find the area underneath its curve between two points?
Well , Your teacher is actually right. What he/she meant is that it is impossible to find the indefinite integral in terms of general functions. It is true in case of sin(x 2 )  . Having said that, it is always possible to find the area under the curve which is definite integral. There should be some finite/non-finite area, which should have some numerical value. This can be found for all continuous functions, which can be concluded intuitively as well.
