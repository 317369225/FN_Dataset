What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton.

I'm with http://dapulse.com and we have dozens of digital agencies among our customers. See screenshot below As you can see we enable: 1. Setting and tracking high level goals 2. Setting and tracking tasks 3. Clear ownership (managing the human resource) 4. Setting dates 5. Clear hand-off from one team/person to the next. 6. Clear streamlined workflow. Each row is clickable, and inside it is a feed with all conversations, sharedÂ  files and in short a searchable knowledge base. You can also invite your clients into the system to stay updated on your work, offer feedback etc. Clients will only have access to their project.
