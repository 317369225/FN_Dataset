Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
Both Nagios and Zabbix are good tools and give you a lot of flexibility to write and configure checks and plugins. In terms of specific support for Network Monitoring both can provide similar functionality to determine network transfer rates, connectivity, etc... However, one of the downsides for both products is they are not able to intelligently correlate what impact network latency, retransmissions or  dropped packets have on your overall application performance, and thus, how your users are affected. Full disclosure I work for Ruxit, and similarly to Zabbix and Nagios, Ruxit is able to monitor your network, but more importantly, Ruxit tells you what (if any) impact your networks are having to your applications performance.  In addition to Network Monitoring, Ruxit also provides information on your application response times, details around failures, and insights into your users' experience. Ruxit offers a 30 day free trial and if you have any questions about Ruxit or Network Monitoring feel free to reach out to me.
