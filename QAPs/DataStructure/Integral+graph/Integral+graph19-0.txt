How will users benefit from Khan Academy's integration with Facebook's Open Graph?
Lots of our users love sharing their achievements, which intuitively makes sense, since many feel proud of what they've learned. Open Graph integration just gives them a slightly nicer, more permanent way to share (and keeps us in line w/ the future of Facebook's API). We don't automatically share anything on OG, but users can choose to share individual achievements. The user experience actually hasn't changed much on the Khan side (yet), but now when sharing the artifacts on Facebook's side are friendlier, play nicely w/ Timeline, etc. And finally, the same way that I encourage all of our new dev hires and interns to "brag" loudly about the cool work they're doing, because...well...it's brag-worthy, I personally like the idea of encouraging learners to be proud and brag when they feel like they've learned something new.
