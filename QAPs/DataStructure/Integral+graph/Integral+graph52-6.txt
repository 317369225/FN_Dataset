Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Originally Answered: How much of threat is Facebook's new Graph Search to Yelp, Foursquare and Google?Let me ask you something else: How much of a threat is the Airbus A380 to the Tesla Roadster? Apples vs Oranges? I think both question are a little in the style of comparing Apples (the fruit!) and Oranges. Both questions compare something that is only somehow but at least roughly comparable: Airbus A380 and Tesla Roadster both are some kind of transportation vehicles Facebook Graph Search (FGS) and Yelp, Foursquare and Google all have something to do with internet and peopleFGS vs others FGS only works properly when enough people actively share as much and as diverse data about their lives as possible on this one platform and when people are willing to learn the "syntax" needed to properly operate FGS. The other products work because they gather the opinion of 1-10% of the visitors of a location and aggregate a "crowd-opinion" out of that. This "crowd-opinion" is then put into the public via Google etc. Overall I don't think people tend to increase the amount of shared stories, I think they tend to decrease the amount of shared stories, because people become aware of what's happening with their data. That means that FGS won't work as good as demoed as long as it searches only "public" information on Facebook instead of also going though "secret" or "restricted-access" information.
