Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
This is because people want immediate results.It is not easy to please the entire country in one year of holding the office .Well,I think it is impossible to please the whole nation. And moreover the country was in a dismal state after 10 years of bad governance. He is like Steve Jobs who took office when APPLE was in a disastrous state.Everybody knows what happened next. Modi is also acting like the CEO of INDIA who is steering a wrecked ship to safety.His visits to foreign countries is not for sight seeing.He is trying to woo the potential investors and building the brand INDIA. If the results doesn't improve even after 5 years then we have the voting power,don't we?:-P So have some patience and keep calm.
