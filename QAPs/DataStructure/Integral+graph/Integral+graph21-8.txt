Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
The only reason is because there are no elections around. When election comes media will again start to collect temperature updates from the whole country and you will know graph is rising or falling. These news are just out of focus these days so some people feel graph going down. Let media be free from salman's case first...
