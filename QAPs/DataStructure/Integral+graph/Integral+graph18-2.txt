Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
I agree that both are good, but I would actually go with a third option: Solarwind's Network Monitoring Software - Network Monitor. Here are a few reasons: Simple installation with wizards Administrators can install by themselves, no professional help needed. Installation & configuration takes less than 2 hours and you're ready to start monitoring applications.Â  SAM alerts are based on correlation based events SAM gives better insight on where the errors have occurred and what triggered the alert. Users can set up dependencies to suppress alerts and only respond to alerts causing the problem. On the Nagios side, installation and configuration can be quite complex and requires Linux know how. Also, administrators may need professional services assistance to get Nagios monitoring applications. One thing to keep in mind with Nagios is that alerts are only triggered based on dependencies and the occurrence of the alert or errors is not explained. As a quick summary I would only say that while Nagios is quite in depth, Solarwinds holds their on in this regard and is more user friendly.
