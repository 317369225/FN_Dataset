What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
What we used in our agency was MyIntervals. ( Online time tracking, task management and project management ) We really loved using it from the time tracking, deliverables, reports and everything. Its not the prettiest out there anymore but who cares. But make sure you have your process and systems setup first before you use any software because if you don't SCOPE CREEP.
