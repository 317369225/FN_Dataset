Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
I don't think it is decreasing. Actually people who don't do anything aren't criticized as they do nothing. But when someone tries to bring a massive change in the way people perceive something will always have an opposition. Mr. Modi wants to change India for good. He and BJP have a long term target. To gain something, one has to lose something. The hike in prices and things like Land acquisition bill might have made people angry but let me tell you that whatever Modi is doing is great for everyone. If he stays on for next 10 years or so , we will allÂ  witness a new India and a country which will make us all feel pride . #SabkaSaathSabkaVikaas
