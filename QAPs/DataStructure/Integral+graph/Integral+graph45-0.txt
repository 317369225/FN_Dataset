If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
No. Please don't. Identity theft is a very serious problem. If you're like most people, you have your birthday listed (of course you want your friends to remember your birthday, right?) and even if you don't list your birth year, that's fairly easy to guess based on school information. You also probably have your location listed (and Facebook forces you to make your hometown public now, if you put that information on your profile at all). These two pieces of information then make it easy for identity thieves to guess your social security number, because SSNs are assigned based on where you're living when you're born. [1] Good luck getting your identity back. Why would you? If your sole reason to accept is that you want to increase your Facebook friend count, please, just get out more. Make some real friends. If you think the person is hot and want to stalk their photos -- sorry, it's probably not a real person. It's probably some shady dude trying to steal your information. [2] Yes, it's your account, but don't be stupid about it. ----- [1] Researchers at Carnegie Mellon experimented with guessing social security numbers based on information gleaned from social networking sites, and they were able to guess the first five digits of a person's SSN 44% of the time for 160,000 people born between 1989 and 2003 -- in the first try.

Among those born recently in small states, the researchers were able to predict full SSNs with 60% accuracy after 1,000 attempts. Source: http://www.informationweek.com/n... [2] I'm assuming that by "random" you mean someone you have no connection to at all. If it's some "random" person in a class / organization you're in, or some "random" person you met on Quora, that's a different story.
