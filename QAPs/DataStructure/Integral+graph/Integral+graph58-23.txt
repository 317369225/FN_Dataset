What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
If you want time tracking & project management in one app, what about other needs like billing and contact management? I ask because taking these needs into account can save you time and money, as opposed to trying to integrate other apps into your workflow (which becomes a costly, inefficient hassle). I'd suggest looking into a system like WORKetc. It puts project management, time tracking, billing, CRM, and other tools into one Google-Apps integrated web app. This would allow you to manage the entire client lifecycle in one place: from picking up leads and managing your sales pipeline, to collaborating on projects and tracking time, to using billable data from your projects (i.e. expenses, timesheets, products) to create invoices and directly bill your client. WORKetc also has support and email marketing modules, making it one of few all-in-one business management systems for the low-mid size businesses.
