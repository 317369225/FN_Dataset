What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
You should try Celoxis (http://www.celoxis.com). It's got the best and easiest to use weekly time screen in the industry. Our users often swear its responsiveness as they start keying in the projects and tasks. The time and expense modules are fully integrated with Project Financial. So you can easily track and manage costs, budgets and revenues. Celoxis' resource management capabilities allow you to easily track resource loads and utilization as well as measure free capacity for taking on new projects. Instead of a static view (unlike most other tools), our resource load chart offers a "real-time" view based on current state of progress. It helps in making informed resourcing decisions based on data rather than the static “plan”. Celoxis' cloud access is $25 per user per month with volume and duration discounts. You can get a full featured 30-day free trial (http://www.celoxis.com/trial.php)
