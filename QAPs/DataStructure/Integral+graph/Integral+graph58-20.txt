What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
If you need time tracking... Check out Kanban Tool - Kanban board with Time Tracking. The configuration is really simple and the tool is easy to use. While in your board view, the right side panel will display all recent timers. You can remove any timer or edit the entry. Moreover, your work flow and time tracking efforts can be evaluated with Time reports: summary and detailed one.
