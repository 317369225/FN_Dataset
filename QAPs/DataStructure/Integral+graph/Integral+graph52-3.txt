Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
I can't image those others haven't been planning for more social graph integration themselves. The future is more social than search. There is an abundance do opportunity for each of the companies listed, and by all reports they are smart enough to realize that a strategy of beating Facebook at their graph building is not a good 'bt the company' position If someone can put real time data or contextual social value into the equation, there's no threat from progress
