Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
While I can't answer your question directly, I can point you to our site IT Central Station that provides validated, authentic reviews from real users of network monitoring tools and other IT software. I will be happy to give you a quick summary of what some of our real network engineers are saying about Nagios and Zabbix. As of today, the majority of our reviewers prefer Zabbix, and the debates get quite passionate about which solution is best. One of our reviewers writes that “if you’re fed up with Nagios or doing a brand new deployment, taking a serious look at Zabbix will be worth your while.” He says that Zabbix offers a quick and simple install, support for multiple platforms, a variety of templates covering most popular software, integrated graphs, and escalation management.

One user writes "It enables us to monitor a diverse set of vendors that we deal with. We work with major vendors such as Microsoft, Citrix, Cisco, Symantec and Dell and we were looking for something which out of the box would enable us to monitor all of these solutions."
