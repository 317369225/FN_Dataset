What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
Hello, we use BamBam! PM software. It’s fully integrated with time tracking, wiki and (!)  Springloops SVN/ Git version control software. The tool is free up-to-ten users so it’s a good choice for small and middle size teams that don’t want to spend a lot of money. Because of its integrations this is the best tool I’ve ever used.  Project Management Software for Professionals
