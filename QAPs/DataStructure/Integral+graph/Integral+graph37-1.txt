How did Quora suddenly start getting many more users around the beginning of 2011?Loads of my contacts have suddenly started to follow me over the last two weeks. Is it due to SEO?
They have very good social 'onboarding' and virality built-in. The ease of which you can import your social graph from Twitter and Facebook, and the default setting to auto follow everybody you know from there who's already on Quora helps, as well as being able to follow people you know from those networks as they sign up. And the way it tweets/shares your answers to questions isn't too spammy, so people will have been seeing a lot of Quora related links of late. It's also really bloody simple with a clean and clear UI. You can't put a value on simplicity - it's incredibly hard to pull off.  Sometimes 'simple' beats 'best'... Plus early adopters have been playing with it during Christmas downtime, and all the people they invited have just come back to work...  Timing is everything?
