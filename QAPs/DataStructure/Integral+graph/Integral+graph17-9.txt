What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
Universal Translator. Unless the internet seeks to unite all peoples of the world by becoming a medium for translating languages accurately, it can never live up to its nameâ€”'inter' = within and 'net' = connections. Succeeding in this, and knowing that most wars (international and domestic) stem from basic misunderstandings, the internet will become mankind's ultimate passageway to world peace!
