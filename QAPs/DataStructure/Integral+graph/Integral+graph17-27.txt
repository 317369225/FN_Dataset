What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
Money. Money will be closely tied to identity management made possible with new technologies. The definition and face of money is in for a change. With virtual currencies like Bitcoin, the race for mobile payments, I foresee the possibility of an entire revamping of financial system(s) in the future. Not imminent, not without a lot of resistance from the establishments - banks, regulators, governments - however someone will (if not already is working) work on a new simpler, more democratic method for money and its management.
