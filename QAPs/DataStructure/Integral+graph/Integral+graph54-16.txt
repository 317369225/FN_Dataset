What should all first time entrepreneurs know before starting their very first business?
Before starting my first company I was at a startup panel discussion and the same question was asked to a very successful entrepreneur from the dotcom bubble. He said "Don't start a business that needs venture capital funding to be successful." If your business model is dependent on raising large amounts of money you will waste your time doing this instead of building the business and the odds are not in your favor (<1%). Of course, I ignored his advice, and in hindsight I wish I hadn't. It would be my answer now too.
