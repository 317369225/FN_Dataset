How did Quora suddenly start getting many more users around the beginning of 2011?Loads of my contacts have suddenly started to follow me over the last two weeks. Is it due to SEO?
Why hasn't anyone pointed out the thick ties between Quora and Facebook? Surely the fact that two of Quora's founders had big roles at Facebook gave the network a certain amount of Silicon Valley street-cred from the get-go. Thus getting on the tech radar was as good as automatic. Then, from what I understand, the big names of tech showed some willingness to use it. From there, it was a short hop to TechCrunch, Scobleizer et al. But, yes, the reason it's seemed to pick up and retain so many users is the beautiful convergence of existing UX protocols. Why now? Maybe the clever crowd suddenly got sick of Facebook, and found LinkedIn too boring and self-serving....
