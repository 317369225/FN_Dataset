What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
i would start with asking your team why Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore? There are literally tons of options to chose from and many of the suggestions in this thread are great products. That said, the best project management system is the one that works for your team. I would suggest trying those you like best for at least one month. If you see usage drop, discuss why and move on to another one. Repeat until you find one that sticks. In the end there will be some system that works well for your team because your team enjoys using it. We love using Trello but we use other systems too. Whatever works.
