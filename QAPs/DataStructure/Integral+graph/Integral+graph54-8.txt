What should all first time entrepreneurs know before starting their very first business?
I think it is important to know how long this will take until successful business will be created. In most Startup stories I have read it takes 3 years at least. Average is 5 years. But the good news is that you don't need any graduation to do business. So you can create a successful business instead of getting a graduation :) I have read about 500 books in that topic. My favorite books are: "Think and Grow Rich" - Napoleon Hill This book gives a basic understanding what money is and how you should think about them to become an entrepreneur. First published in 1937, more than 70 million copies sold. "Unlimited Power" - Anthonny Robins As all angel investors and venture capital fonds are saying the most important factor of the startup is people in it. So this book tells you how to become an important person. How to build healthy minds and complete control your life and work. "Rework" & "Getting Real" - 37 Signals These guys are unbelievable. They are breaking all rules. They will teach you how to build a Startup from a scratch without any investment, marketing, advertising companies and all other stuff what is necessary for corporations. "The Lean Startup" - Eric Ries It is bible of Startups, wich helps you to understand how things in real world are working. How to test your startup fast, how to know your audience, how to build minimum viable product and much more. These books are like a solid foundation for your knowledge and business. And as a first time Entrepreneur you should join the StarterPad and become an important part of Startup Community. Build knowledge and resources you need! Good Luck! ;)
