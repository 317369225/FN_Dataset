If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
I used to have a strict policy of not accepting "Randoms" on Facebook. As my activity level transferred to Twitter, I found that I was meeting a lot of great people through my tweets that I could have never met on Facebook. So, based on this, my policy has changed and I now accept "randoms", but I put them on a "randoms" list which has extreme security settings and very little access to my profile information. Basically, we are connected and that's it. Our relationship is about as deep as a Linkedin relationship.  I look at it as an "option" on getting to know them. If they prove to be weird or unsettling in some way, then I simply de-friend them.  Generally, I'm pretty open and I like to give people a chance. You never know, they might surprise you in a good way. In my own experience, the super cautious approach espoused by answers above has made Facebook a bit of a siloed experience. As a result, Facebook has become my filing cabinet for friends and photos. I don't do much there. Most of  my activity is on Twitter, Quora and Foursquare. I totally understand some individuals' trepidation in being widely transparent. It really comes down to a personal choice and how much you can tolerate. Personally, I'm with Zuckerberg, and I think the world should be more open and transparent. I never liked cliques and secrets.
