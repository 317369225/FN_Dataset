Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
The facebook's new search engine may be threat to other social networking sites like LinkedIn as facebook is continuously increasing its functionality & look to compete with the updating of technology. Also facebook already have a well established users databases unlike many other social networking site who are still struggling to gain users confidence like Google+ or Zurker. And with the release of new facebook search engine facebook has just added a milestone against its competitive social networking sites.                      But till now i don't think so it will create threat to search engines like Google whose searching algorithm is still far more better than facebook in global domain where we have to search for something that doesn't envolve the views of your friends. We can say that, in one respect facebook search engine is better than Google that it gives quite a good result for the local searches that is being bound by the social circle of your friend list  but Google already have tried to cope up with this by integrating all of its products like youtube Google+ blogspot, g mail, Google  Cloud  into one so that it should know as much as it could about the user that greately helps in optimizing the search for a particular user.                        Additionally Google also have almost last 10 years  of search query data of all user that uses Google that hardly facebook have which help Google to find important pattern & reliable data from such huge data.
