What should all first time entrepreneurs know before starting their very first business?
Become a jack of all trades and a master of one or more. As the (co-)founder, know all the rungs of the product ladder - from need discovery, papertyping, user scenarios, prototypes, design, tech, user feedback, etc - and, iterate in small increments. Remember to build only the Minimum Viable Product in the early stages of product development. Constantly validate your assumptions. Not to forget the sales and marketing ladder - know how to pitch your own product to customers. This also serves as a great way to gather more requirements.  And, the fund-raising ladder - build a network, build a presence in the community and work on financials, schedules, what not. Keep a watch on the runway and plan well in advance to start fundraising attempts. Do a little of everything at least once, you will rarely do all three simultaneously in the beginning. When you do see yourself finding the need for all three simultaneously, it's time for you to expand your team. You will, by then, have had enough experience to know what works and what doesn't and apply those metrics on to their efforts. Compelled to add this: Founders of two startups (the startups are not even in the neighboring space) mentioned the same phrase on different occasions on their philosophy on building a core team: If you can't build, and if you can't sell, I don't need you right now! " It can't be coincidence. And, I tend to agree a cent percent. Updated 20 Sep 2013 • View Upvotes
