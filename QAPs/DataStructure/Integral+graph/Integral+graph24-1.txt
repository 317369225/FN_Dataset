My calculus teacher said that it's impossible to integrate the function sin(x 2 )  . How, then, is my TI-84 graphing calculator able to find the area underneath its curve between two points?
Probably what your teacher meant to say is that this function does not have a Antiderivative, or primitive function, which means that it's impossible to evaluate the indefinite integral. Then, since there's no primitive function, you can't integrate the definite integral sin(x 2 )  analytically. What your calculator does (and you can do as well) is to apply numerical methods to find the value of the definite integral. It's just that stuff you see when your teacher defines integral as an infinite sum (or Riemann sum). It basically sums a bunch of rectangles,  trapezoids or even infinitesimal pieces of 2nd degree functions to find the area under that curve. (Refer to Simpson's rule) There is a website that makes these calculations in an explicit way, see the image below: That's the graph of sin(x 2 )  , and the definite integral from 0 to pi  is approximated to 0.794576979982  , but that sems a rough approximation, since I'm using only 20 rectangles. If I use 100 rectangles, it'll look like this: Now, the result of the integral is 0.778944061317  , your calculator might be using a different method (using small trapezoids, or whatever), and thus, it might be reaching to more precise results. The website I've used was:  https://www.desmos.com/calculato... TL;DR: You can find the area under the curve of any function, but sometimes it may take more than F(b)−F(a)  to reach that result
