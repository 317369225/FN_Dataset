Should YouTube integrate Facebook Open Graph to promote wider sharing of YouTube videos?I'm guessing YouTube won't do this given the relationship between the two companies, but given the popularity of video on Facebook it seems that not doing a deeper integration of Open Graph creates more opportunities for Viddy, Socialcam, etc. on the Facebook platform. Despite the tense relationship between Google and Facebook, I suspect a lot of YouTube's users are active on Facebook.
