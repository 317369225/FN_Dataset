Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
To be threat to Google it has to attract users to actually search on that. That is the biggest problem for everyone who wanted to challange Google - Bing does deliver relevant results, but it is just hard to turn anyone's habit. From brand point of view, Facebook is in much better position to attract users to do searches on it. However, it still requires to offer at least something unique for users to do searches on it. It will have some of it, but probably not enough according to my estimate, at least in inital roll-out. But in general, it is not impossible that Facebook might be able to deliver some significant value to users in search, and when it doesn't and must ask Bing, users should find those results reasonably good...
