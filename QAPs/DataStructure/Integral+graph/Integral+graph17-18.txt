What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
I don't think I could put it better than Paul Graham in his "Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas": "One of the more surprising things I've noticed while working on Y Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startup ideas are... Any one of them could make you a billionaire. That might sound like an attractive prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may notice you find yourself shrinking away from them... [for example] Replace Email: Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now. Email is not a messaging protocol. It's a todo list. Or rather, my inbox is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it. But it is a disastrously bad todo list.... This is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible to replace. On the other, it seems unlikely that people in 100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now. And if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now?" These massive technology-enabled shifts may not be the next trends, but they are certainly future trends.
