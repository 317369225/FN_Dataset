Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Facebook's graph search will most likely not hurt Google because most people use Google for information on a spefic topic not to find out what their friends think about it. Facebook however may hurt linked in, foursquare, or yelp.
