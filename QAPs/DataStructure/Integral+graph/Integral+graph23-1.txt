How can social graph content from Facebook be integrated effectively to trigger an online travel booking flow?
Philip's suggestion is a good one for getting your users to 'brag' about theior purchase, this works well and I've seen it implemented on tour operator websites. But back to your question which was about integrating Facebook content into a travel booking flow. I'd question the need to embed it in the flow, once your users are in the flow you really want them focused on the task at hand with little distraction. I'd suggest any content from Facebook is better integrated into your product landing pages which users will browse before entering the booking flow. At this point in the user journey supplemental content like this will be of value and can be persuasive and make the difference between them bouncing elsewhere and continuing into your booking flow.
