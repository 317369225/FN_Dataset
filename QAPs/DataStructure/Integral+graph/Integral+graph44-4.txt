What are the best sites (or tools) using the Strava API?What are some of the best examples or executions of 3rd parties utilizing Strava's API for any of Strava's sports?
If you have a running race coming up anytime soon, you can predict your race time with Racepredictions. The site analyzes your recent runs on Strava and looks for your fastest efforts within those runs. It then uses those efforts to build your predictions, based on proven algorithms (Riegel, Cameron, etc). The calculator is similar to the one used by Running for Fitness but since Racepredictions has access to the granular data of your runs, only the fastest efforts are used. In addition, I've also seen some good examples of apps built on the Strava Google Groups page.
