What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
B2C The next big thing will be connecting people online through the interest graph - that's how you make friends when you go to a party and meet a stranger - someone soon will try to build that online. Facebook was primarily built around social graph. B2B Connecting businesses with consumers online. Most of the interactions currently are static, not real-time. You go to a website, submit a form, send an email, etc. Soon it will become real-time and dynamic. In real-life as you can walk to a store and interact with the owner, soon that will be possible online. Updated 25 Jul 2011 â€¢ View Upvotes
