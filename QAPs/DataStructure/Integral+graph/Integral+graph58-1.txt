What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
Well as I am working for it my opinion may not be objective, but I believe you should give it a try. Comidor (Task Management - Comidor | Enterprise Collaboration )has a Task Management package that can help you schedule all your and your team's tasks and link them all with the running projects from the Project Management package. Some more collaboration tools are offered (resource management is included) that will help you more organize your business. Take a look at the site, check its demo version and see if it suits you!
