How did Quora suddenly start getting many more users around the beginning of 2011?Loads of my contacts have suddenly started to follow me over the last two weeks. Is it due to SEO?

Why?http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/02... was the original site that brought me in, but Quora has gained the attention of many reputable sources in the last month. Sources including Forbes, CNET, The Business Insider, and BBC have all taken interest. This certainly seems to be the breakout startup of the new year, and although I am certainly new to the site, I can't wait to see it develop.
