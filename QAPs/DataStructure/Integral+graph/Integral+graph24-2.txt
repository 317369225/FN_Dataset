My calculus teacher said that it's impossible to integrate the function sin(x 2 )  . How, then, is my TI-84 graphing calculator able to find the area underneath its curve between two points?
Your calculator cheats, and you can too. Start by graphing the interesting part of the function on a big piece of paper. Now take a straightedge and mark it off so that the curve is cut into Vertical strips.  Next, draw a horizontal line where the left side of each strip meets the curve.  This horizontal line and the horizontal axis will cut the strip into a rectangle.  We all know how to find the area of a rectangle.  Repeat for all of the strips, and sum the values of the strips.  Your answer will not be perfect, because each part of the curve will have a little triangle bit that hangs off unmeasured.  Even with this error, your value will be close.  If the error is unacceptable to you, you can make it smaller by using narrower strips. As Steven Dang said, this is called a  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ri... . For some equations you can calculate the integral precisely.  That's the regular integration you are used to seeing.  For other functions this is hard or even impossible.  For these hard cases you can use the strip method to get a good enough answer. ... To do it mathematically (in english)... divide the area between your lower and upper values of X into some number of evenly spaced points.  Calculate the value of your function for each of the points, including the lower bound, excluding the upper bound.  Multiply each calculated value by the distance between the two adjacent points, and finally add up the multiplied values.
