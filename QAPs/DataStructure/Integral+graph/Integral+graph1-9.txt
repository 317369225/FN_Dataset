What is the easiest way to calculate the area under the curve (integral) of a graph in excel?
First, I'm terrible with Excel and know of no function that will directly calculate the area. I can give you a general idea of the math needed but I would use the data in another program, such as R or Python. First, convert each data point into a rectangle with height in y-axis units and width in the steps between data points on the x-axis. Finally, add them together to get the area under the curve. If you are doing this on a calculator, you might want to take multiple x-axis steps to save time or use the means of multiple x-axis steps to smooth the data at the expense of time. I know that isn't a satisfying answer.Â  As an aside, "back in the day" we printed the graphs, cut them out, and weighed them on an analytical balance then compared them to a set of weights for known areas. Just be sure to use good paper and be consistent.
