My calculus teacher said that it's impossible to integrate the function sin(x 2 )  . How, then, is my TI-84 graphing calculator able to find the area underneath its curve between two points?
Using the laws, identities, and integration techniques we all learned in calculus, the function cannot be integrated. Calculators, as well as most analytical programs (ie: Wolfram, Mathematica) use approximation techniques such as Riemann Sums. For more information: Riemann sum Updated 8 Mar • View Upvotes
