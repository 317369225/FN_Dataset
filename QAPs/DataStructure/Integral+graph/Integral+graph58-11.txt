What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
My recommendation is HiveFlux: Real-time task management and planning. It's a great tool for collaborative and communicative teams. This allows you delegate tasks to your team and see what they are doing in real-time. HiveFlux is ideal for small digital agencies better manage their work, particularly when their teams are dispersed in several projects.
