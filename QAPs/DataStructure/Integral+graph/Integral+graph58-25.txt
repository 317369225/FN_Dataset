What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
I've used Basecamp in the past and I know some people today that swear by Asana because it's task focused. A great addition to systems like these is something like Donald (http://getDonald.com). You can then have all your client email communication stored and searchable in one place. Great for team members to stay up to date on threads they weren't included on.
