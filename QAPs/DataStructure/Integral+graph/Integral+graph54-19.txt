What should all first time entrepreneurs know before starting their very first business?
In retrospect, when we started Licensario, I wished someone told me that it's ok not to get everything working perfectly the first time you do them. When you're starting up there's always this feeling that you have to master all domains and everything has to be perfect or people will not use your product. It's quite a relief to know that it's ok to fail. Startup life are a roller coaster just make sure that the next low point is higher than the previous one. And don't be afraid from public shame. It's never as public as you think. You're not that lucky... You probably burnt yourself with a pinch of your target market. Just learn and don't make the same mistake twice.
