Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
Personally, I prefer Zabbix. Pros: Capable of producing customizable maps and logical interconnection diagrams to help you better visualize your network. Simple installation and configuration An all-in-one solution, which helps monitor and manage network performance across the board. Can run with or without an agentCons: Although scalable, it doesnâ€™t always function particularly well with large infrastructure Reporting and monitoring functions could stand to be improved with out-of-the-box support for flat file configuration. Can be difficult to properly secure without documentationThere's a few other tools that I've found useful though and you can read more about them here -> Five Of The Best Free Network Monitoring Software Tools
