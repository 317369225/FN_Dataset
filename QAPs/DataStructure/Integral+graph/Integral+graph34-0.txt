What are the technologies for managing graphs and integrating data in a mobile device? What are the applications of those technologies?
If I am not wrong there is one technology for managing Graphs in mobile devices for Android and iOS and this is Sparksee 5 mobile. It is a full fledged Graph Database with a very small software footprint (45K bytes) and high data compression, which allows for complex queries i small application space, and high performance. You may find a blog on that at Graph management for mobile devices, and full information about Sparksee 5 mobile at Sparksee high-performance graph database . Regarding the applications, the blog also explains good use cases like: managing social data, managing the whole mobile data, or managing map data. See Use cases for mobile graph technologies by Josep Lluis Larriba Pey on Graph management for mobile devices.
