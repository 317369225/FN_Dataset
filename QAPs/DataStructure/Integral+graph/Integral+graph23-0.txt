How can social graph content from Facebook be integrated effectively to trigger an online travel booking flow?
You can promote stories published via a specific application, so why not have a "Share your trip" button at checkout that lets people publish to their stream.  You can then promote these stories to the friends of the users who publish their purchase.  Check out all the coupon sites (e.g. Groupon, LivingSocial) for really great post-purchase sharing implementations. If you're question is about how to integrate Sponsored Stories onto your own site, the short answer is: you can't.  Sponsored Stories are only published on facebook.com
