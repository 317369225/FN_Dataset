Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
Depends on what capabilities you are looking for. Nagios has the largest community of plugins and therefore can be customized to handle your needs. However Nagios uses text files and the config can be quite arduous. On the other hand, Zabbix can be quit easy to config and works off web monitoring. It provides visuals, which are useful yet not fantastic. ServerFocus has a pretty good breakdown in one of their editorials (Page on serverfocus.org) Another new tool to look at is BigPanda. BigPanda sits on top of Zabbix and organizes its data into easy to read incidents and graphs- Zabbix - alternative to alert madness - BigPanda
