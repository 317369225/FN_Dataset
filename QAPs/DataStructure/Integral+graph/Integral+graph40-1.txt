What are some promising Big Data startups?Including both funded and non-funded ones. And maybe some OSS apps or stacks as well. (A startup doesn't always have to be a company, does it?)
The startup BIME Analytics focuses on providing a solution to analyze and visualize data, wherever it comes from (web service, on premise, big data, RDBMS, etc.). For Big Data datasources, it supports SAP HANA, MongoDB, Redshift, Vectorwise, major Hadoop engines (Impala, Hive, Presto, Spark) and in particular Google Big Query, where the implementation was so good Google asked to become technology partners back in 2010. Here's some example dashboards of Big Query, working with several billions of rows https://showcase.bime.io/dashboa... https://showcase.bime.io/dashboa...
