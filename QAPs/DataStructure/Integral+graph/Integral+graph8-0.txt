Should YouTube integrate Facebook Open Graph to promote wider sharing of YouTube videos?I'm guessing YouTube won't do this given the relationship between the two companies, but given the popularity of video on Facebook it seems that not doing a deeper integration of Open Graph creates more opportunities for Viddy, Socialcam, etc. on the Facebook platform. Despite the tense relationship between Google and Facebook, I suspect a lot of YouTube's users are active on Facebook.
You're basically right. Google has been resisting integrating with Facebook in a lot of ways. There is a share button on Youtube videos to share the video on Facebook, but that's about it. But Facebook is here to stay, and in the rapidly changing world of the internet, businesses need to adapt quickly to survive. If Youtube doesn't add more Facebook integration soon, they may find themselves overrun by competitors who know where their users really are: Facebook.
