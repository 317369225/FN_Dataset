What should all first time entrepreneurs know before starting their very first business?
I am in the process of starting my third company. The first two were created with no investment capital whatsoever. Our new company is well on the way to doing the same thing.  My last book, The Leap, largely documented my learnings from this.  Here are a few thoughts: Big, Selfless and Simple.  Big ideas get noticed. Incremental ideas are noise. Selfless ideas make it much easier to enlist others. Actually, people would rather not see you get rich. Solve their problems. Simple - start with a very simple proposition. This is not necessarily the concept of minimum viable product.  More like minimum viable description. Identify the pain point. Identify the very high level description of what you will do. Let the customers fill in the details. Avoid Risk.  It has been well documented that many of the great entrepreneurs were actually great risk mitigators. Survey the landscape. What steps can you take with mimimal risk. Take them.  Repeat.  Entremanuer. I have often said I am a good entrpemanuer - repeatedly coming up with shitty new business ideas. Let the customers tell you you are wrong. Let them start to point you in the right direction.  The only thing that makes an idea great, is if it gets the customers to start a rich dialogue with you. They will lead you to the real answer.
