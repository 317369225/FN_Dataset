Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
Hi, I uses both nagios and zabbix but I would like to vote in favor of zabbix due to following reasons. 1. It is web based but gives the flexibility to use API and working with API is quiet easy. 2. The Mysql Table structure is easy to understand. 3. It is right that its history data eats lots of mysql but it is not so important and can be reduced/ fine tuned. 4. Once the agent is installed , most of the resource monitoring is automatically added. 5. You can create your own commands and attach to it. 6. You can have scripts on server which can be executed on client side. 7. Its graphs are Extremely good and flexible , which is not available with nagios. 8. Its reporting is also very flexible. 9. It has auto discovery feature. 10. You can control it as you can control the nagios. 11. Once you start exploring it , you will get to know more features which are generally missed in other monitoring tool , like inventory , syslog monitoring. 12. Export/ Import config and templates. 13. Saves a lots of time , as system admin we can not afford wasting time in writing configuration files. 14. Last , there is nothing in nagios which can not be done in zabbix. Nagios is good for environment where the resources do not change frequently , other wise you will start hating it writing configuration file on daily bases.
