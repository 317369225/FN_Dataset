Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
Because the Weight of the promises are so high that people can't wait even though government doing moderately well People are still hoping for fulfillment of big promise like 15lakh, low Inflation, Black money ,creating jobs fast etc..Now this promise needs time for jobs you need skill development which he is focusing, For black money reforms in law and Intelligent foreign policy.Its too early to judge now if you don't see result in next two yearÂ  then you can call it a Failed government but not now.
