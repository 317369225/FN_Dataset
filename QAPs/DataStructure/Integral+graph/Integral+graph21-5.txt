Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
Decreasing?? Seriously. have you ever been in a better governance in the past 10 years ever. Like ever. Don't you read newspaper. Take the Yemen Rescue mission. 26 Countries including USA asking India for help. Nepal earthquake: Relief reaching the very day disaster took place. People were criticizing Modi's foreign visit but you know the future benefits the deals he has signed are gonna bring. Well if you are thinking that the government and Modi are a bit down these days, i just ask you a simple question. What do you know about the Burj khalifa. The tallest building in the world. Yes you are right. Now go for the engineering that made it possible, setting up a strong foundation so that the future would be better. That's what Modi is doing. He is setting the foundation for a strong India . So please get your facts correct .
