What are the best sites (or tools) using the Strava API?What are some of the best examples or executions of 3rd parties utilizing Strava's API for any of Strava's sports?
I found one more - http://www.StrabbaRanks.com Strabba Ranks is a regional ranking system that awards KOM-holders points based on the number of riders beneath them in the KOM segment.  So the more people you beat for a given segment, the more points you are awarded for it.  Results are tabulated weekly and published Sunday night.
