How can a mobile application take advantage of facebook's open graph?If its a web app then it makes sense to just redirect it to your web app, but with mobile i guess the main purpose that we want is to have more users using it or download the app. the ticker and stuff is not available yet in fb mobile app, so what is a good strategy?
This answer assumes you are asking about integrating native iOS/Android apps. With that in mind, for a native app to take advantage of Facebook's Open Graph, the app needs a web endpoint. This is why apps that began as a website (like Spotify) and heavily funded apps (Instagram, RunKeeper) were early to integrate into Open Graph. They either started out with a web endpoint (Spotify) or were able to build one for Open Graph compatibility. Without a web accessible backend, user data remains "trapped" on the device, inaccessible to Facebook. There are essentially two ways to build the web backend required for Open Graph integration: You can build one yourself, or you can use a feature from a "backend as a service" company like Kinvey (Kinvey Service Fixes Crack In Facebook's Open Graph Back-End), which can automatically create and serve the web endpoints required by Facebook to publish into the Open Graph. Regardless of the path you follow to Open Graph integration, the exposure (throughout your users social graph) and engagement is generally a good thing for downloads. User acquisition is one of the primary reasons why app developers wish to integrate with Open Graph. Disclosure: I am the VP of marketing for Kinvey.
