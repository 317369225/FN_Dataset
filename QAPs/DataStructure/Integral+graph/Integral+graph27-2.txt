How do we know that the definite integral is the "area under/upper the graph" since the indefinite integrals are just an antiderivative? Where is the connection between the antiderivative and the area?
Take a simple function like f(x) = x. Its antiderivative function is F(x) = 1/2 x². Now the area under f(x) = x for some value of x is that of a right triangle or that of a square divided by 2 (1/2 x²) which is the same as the antiderivative function. If you change the slope of f(x) you now have the area of half a rectangle under f which has increased or decreased by the same factor as the slope in relation to the area of the square.
