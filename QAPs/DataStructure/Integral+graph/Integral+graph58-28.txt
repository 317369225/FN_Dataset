What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
Per the criteria you described, I think Wrike (http://www.wrike.com) would match your needs. And I'd recommend it not only because I work for the company :) Among our customers, there are quite a lot of digital agencies who say that our software helps them "juggle multiple fast-moving projects". Wrike has a lightweight workload management function, a built-in time tracker and lots of other features for getting things organized and collaborate with your team.
