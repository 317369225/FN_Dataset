Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
I am not sure how the Modi's popularity graph looks like now, but I can say that people of India were so much frustrated with previous Congress government that they no longer want to wait for the results promised. It has nothing to do with Modi, everyone knows that he is at least trying his best to recover Indian economy and working towards bringing India back on the world map. But people need to understand that things take time, we have selected a PM not a magician.
