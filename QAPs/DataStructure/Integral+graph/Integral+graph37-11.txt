How did Quora suddenly start getting many more users around the beginning of 2011?Loads of my contacts have suddenly started to follow me over the last two weeks. Is it due to SEO?
From all the answers I have seen above, it seems that the main reason for it to take off was their "sudden" embracement by the media, technology and non-technology.Part of this may have been catalyzed by the founders personal connections.
