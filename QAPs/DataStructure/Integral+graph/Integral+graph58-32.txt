What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
Running a small agency I've found most project management software to be total overkill and/or not worth the price tag. Since we collaborate on Github (yes, our designers use Github) we end up using Github Issues to discuss and collaborate on features for a project. We also use Github Issues for bug tracking and project milestones. Github Issues with the addition of something like Wunderlist or a whiteboard does the trick for us.
