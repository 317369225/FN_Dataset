What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
Applied Machine Learning on Mobile devices. That phone in your pocket is filled with applications, with sensors  to measure movement and the world around us, with communications tools  that put us in touch with work, home, family, friends, service providers  and strangers. That phone in your pocket is poised to teach itself how to work  better, based upon how you use it, which applications you run, and how  you use it to communicate with others. A patent granted to Google last week explores different ways that  parts and pieces of your phone can communicate with each other to  remember settings in different contexts, to re-rank information based  upon location and time and place, under a mobile machine learning  system. Imagine, for instance, landing at San Francisco International Airport  to visit your brother. As you step off the plane, your phone resets its  location and displays time and weather information on its home page for  San Francisco. You open your phone, and the number for your limo  appears at the top, with your hotel next, and then your brother’s home  number (it would show his work number if it were earlier in the day). You had booked a room and limo online, added the trip to your  calendar, sent a few emails and made a phone call to your brother while  planning the trip. Your phone recognized that you had arrived after you  turned your phone back on, and moved (or re-ranked) phone numbers to the  top of your contacts based upon your need for them. It's possibly the closest they can get to you to "track" your activities and learn from it. Read this for more details: Google Granted Patent on Mobile Machine Learning
