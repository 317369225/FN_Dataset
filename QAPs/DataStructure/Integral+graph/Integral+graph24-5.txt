My calculus teacher said that it's impossible to integrate the function sin(x 2 )  . How, then, is my TI-84 graphing calculator able to find the area underneath its curve between two points?
When I took calculus my teachers said the same thing. It took me a while to recognize that by 'not integrable' they meant 'not integrable in terms of elementary functions'. Other answers have already said this but I repeat it because it's such a frequent miscommunication that all teachers and textbooks should make this point so that students don't have to wonder about why a function that satisfies the conditions for integrability is 'not integrable'. Any continuous bounded function on a closed interval is Riemann integrable (these are sufficient conditions). The set of integrable functions is larger than the set of differentiable even though differentiation (being local) is easier to do. Your calculator is calculating the integral of an integrable function and does not recognize or need to recognize that the function is not integrable in terms of elementary functions.
