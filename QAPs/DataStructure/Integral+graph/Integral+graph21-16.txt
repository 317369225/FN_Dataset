Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
Because we Indians have formed a habit of blaming others for our incompetence and failures. We cannot achieve something, the Government policies didn't suit us. We want Modi to do everything for us. In such a scenario, loss of faith is no big deal.
