Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
Nagios at least 3 GUIs which do allow you to edit the configuration, I find the ability to add or edit monitors using web as essential. I also considered Icinga but it seems that the default web UI does not allow edit and I am looking for a solution: * easy to install and update on Ubuntu - apt-get solution is highly desired * ability to add-remove monitors using web interface. Now, I identified these 3 solutions, but I don't have time to try all of them . I suppose someone already did this and he could be able to do some recommandations: * http://www.nconf.org/ * http://www.nagiosql.org/ * http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/ - not nagios based Note: I am not looking for a big setup, I am more interested in a small setup, but one that is very easy to configure, I want to use nagios to test if different web services are altered.
