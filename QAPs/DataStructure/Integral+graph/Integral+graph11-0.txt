If FB apps are dying, do we build open graph-integrated external sites instead?
No. We have a bunch of realtime multiplayer games that live on our own websites and a host of Facebook applications. The applications beat the website for Open Graph driven activity every single day. I highly suspect that this is the case for most integrations, to be honest. It's simply a matter of conversion: If you have an app with exactly the same functionality inside a FB app and inside a standalone website, the Open Graph activities generated will be the same. The same activities will probably results in the same interactions from within Facebook: The same clicks, likes, comments, etc. After the click is where you'll see the results moving away from each other: Whenever you send somebody outside of Facebook as a result of a click in the FB ecosystem (be it an ad, open graph action, newsfeed post or whatever) a certain amount of the clickers will drop off. Always. People are simply used to the 'see something in FB > click on it > end up somewhere else within FB' mechanic. That dropoff can be quite dramatic. I've seen cases where you'll see two thirds of the clicks just disappear. There is an upside though: No 30 percent for FB off of your in app transactions. Â What you need to do before deciding to go with either an app or a standalone website is test: Measure the dropoff. If it's worth more revenue than the 30 percent Facebook'll take, just go with an in-FB app.
