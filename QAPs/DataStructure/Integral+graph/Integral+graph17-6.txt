What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
I think the next big trend is going to be data analysis and predictive systems. There is an avalanche of information on the web and in order to use it, the trends in the data have to be analyzed. Data holds vast potential and its analysis can be used in security systems, marketing, healthcare and number of other applications. Big data analysis is often considered as a computationally intensive problem which is holding back many companies from developing algorithms for analysis. Though with the advent of new technologies this problem has been solved to quite an extent but much more is yet unexplored. IBM Watson has set very high standards for big data analytics with terabytes of data being processed and analyzed in seconds. Google is also not lagging behind on this track with lot of machine learning algorithms being developed that out space a normal human being's ability to think.
