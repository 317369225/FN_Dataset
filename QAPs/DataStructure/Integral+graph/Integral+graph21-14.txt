Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
People elected Modi as PM of India with lot of hope.  But when the Central government is talking about big things they are simply ignoring the real issues. What justification is there to bill Rs.69/- for petrol when the crude oil price is below 60$ a barrel.  Remember Manmohan government only billed you Rs.72/- when crude oil price was above 110$. I do not agree to everything in the question.  But it is time for Modi Government to look into the practical difficulties of common man.
