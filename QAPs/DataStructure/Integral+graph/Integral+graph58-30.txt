What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
Here are my choices. We're a small marketing team with a team of 5 and we find basecamp and jira are a little too complex for us. We tried all of these and find it Gratify and Do are just enough for us. More comprehensive and powerful but complex: Basecamp Asana jira Marketing team focus: Gratifyapp Brightpod To-do action focus: Do DoTask wunderlist
