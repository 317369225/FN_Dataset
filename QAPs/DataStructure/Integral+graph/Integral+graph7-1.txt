Which websites have done an excellent job at integrating open graph into the user experience?Lots of websites I see have FB like, tweets button sprinkled over the place without any cohesiveness. I want to know websites which have done a good job at using social media graphs & plugins strategically. I know the usual suspects like Tripadvisor & Yelp, so any other examples would be really helpful.
