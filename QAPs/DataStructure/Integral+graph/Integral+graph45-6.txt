If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
I don't accept total randoms. I'll accept pretty flimsy connections -- "We had one class together back in third grade, and you didn't even talk to me? Come on aboard!" -- because it's kinda cool to see what sort of random connections get built that way, but if it's obvious I don't know the person, no way.
