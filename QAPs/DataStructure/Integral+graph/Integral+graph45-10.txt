If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
It's obviously up to you - it's your Facebook account.  Personally (and in general amongst my friends), Facebook is used for connecting with people you know or have at least met in real life, so accepting a request from some random person isn't often done.  In general, I think Facebook is geared towards this kind of interaction, and as a result you'll probably have a better experience on it if your friend network matches it. The site integrity team at Facebook (and perhaps its analogue at Twitter) definitely does do some work to help users avoid unwanted interactions (in this case, friend requests that will ultimately be rejected).  But as Steven points out, it's impossible to do this with absolute certainty (if we could, there'd be no need to bother asking you to accept! :-).  At the end of the day, it's your account, and you should do whatever you're comfortable doing with it.
