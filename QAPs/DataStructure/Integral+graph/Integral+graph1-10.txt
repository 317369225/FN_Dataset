What is the easiest way to calculate the area under the curve (integral) of a graph in excel?
In numerical analysis class we were taught to approximate the area by selecting a starting width. Then divide the graph into a set of rectangles, with the highest point (and the lowest) point. Take the products of the highest points times the width of the subgrid and add them together. Do the same thing for the low point values.  These two numbers give you an upper and lower bound for the value.  Repeat this process taking smaller subgrid widths.  Stop when the width of the subgrid is of an acceptable size.     This process is limited by the number of data points you have. If you only have a finite set of data points you are limited in the size of your grid. There are other numerical analysis processes for estimating an integral. You might look into text books on the subject. I do not know the source of your data. If  your data (observations) are a random variable you might be able to generate new points with a simulator. You might want to look into statistical analysis.
