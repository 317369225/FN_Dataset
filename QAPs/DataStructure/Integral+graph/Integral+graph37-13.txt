How did Quora suddenly start getting many more users around the beginning of 2011?Loads of my contacts have suddenly started to follow me over the last two weeks. Is it due to SEO?
I agree with Joanna Yan Avery, Bob Scoble, etc.it's the mentioning in social media platforms and TechCrunch et alÂ  that has attracted more users. I have been on for about 6 or 8 months and have seen a surge in the past month or so
