Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
Both are good, I've used both and they made me happy. Some points about those two tools: Zabbix has a web configuration, while Nagios uses text files. While web configuration seems nice, it is a pain to automate like using Chef or Puppet. Zabbix has graphs and stats collection via SNMP or custom agent. Nagios don't. Even so, you must think if you are really looking for graphing support or just a robust monitoring system to tell you if something goes down. Zabbix is resource hungry. It uses a DB to store all the stats and configuration and this can grow exponentially depending on the number of hosts you are monitoring. Nagios works very fast and normally will not require the ammount of resources that Zabbix does. You can tune zabbix, of course, but it's more work to do. In summary: I think Nagios is a best monitoring tool, while Zabbix is a nice do-it-all software. I would also take a look on Icinga (https://www.icinga.org/). It's a Nagios fork with some improvements, specifically a new shiny Ajax powered web interface.
