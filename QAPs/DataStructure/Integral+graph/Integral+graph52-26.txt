Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Too soon to know. Nobody's using it yet, and I think it's kind of a stretch for Facebook to assume people will in the first place. So far, it's looking like it might end up being the Google+ of the search world. Cool idea, slow adoption, likely the butt of jokes.
