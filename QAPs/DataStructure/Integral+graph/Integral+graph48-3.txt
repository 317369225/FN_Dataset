What are the 17 greatest mathematical 'break throughs' ever?
The original breakthrough was the creation of mathematics itself, but it's lost in time. The discovery of prime numbers Proof of irrational numbers Formalization of the concept of "proof" The Euclidean axioms. The discovery of conic sections. The discovery of pi Arabic numerals The invention of algebra The invention of limits The invention of logarithms Analytic geometry Integral calculus Graph theory Abstract algebra Non-Euclidean geometry Information theory GÃ¶del's incompleteness theoremThat last one is kind of a capstone to the whole enterprise.
