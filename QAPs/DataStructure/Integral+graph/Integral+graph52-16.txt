Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Don't know the answers to above questions yet and don't fully understand the graph search yet however my comment for now is this, the 'Like' system on FB cannot be taken as an indication of a business (page) being neccessarily great as competitions and pop up 'like us before you see this info' disguise the real meaning of it and just collect heaps of likes when such 'tools' are implemented...so in terms of searches....Robert Scoble...is your list collecting in relation to work you do?
