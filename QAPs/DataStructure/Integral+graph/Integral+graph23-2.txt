here's what the UJ could look like end-to-end: 1. single sign on so new members can register and create an account with you via their FB credentials - when this happens the 'sign-on' event appears in the users newsfeed 2. implement the 'like' module on your HP - so the same user can become a fan of yours on FB and/or see how popular your site is with other FB users generally and their friends specifically. 3. implement the 'recommend' module on your key destination pages - so the user can see which destinations have proved most popular with other FB users generally and their friends specifically.Â  4. post purchase 'share' functionality as described by philip zigoris
