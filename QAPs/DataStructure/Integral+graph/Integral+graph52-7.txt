Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Really interesting article by Robert Scoble, but I would like to learn more about how the new FB graph search helps you in places where you don't have FB friends? For example, I know no-one in Buenos Aires. If I'm going to visit there, how do I find a great restaurant from FB graph search if there are no results among my FB friends? I'm punted to Bing and back to the more anonymous recommendations from the other services. So does this mean that FB Graph Search is really good at finding answers you already knew? I think it is telling me that I need more FB friends. But since they're FB friends and not real friends, are the results of what they like any more reliable than than the stranger reviews on other sites? I have to say, I hardly know most of my FB friends. I fat fingered a popup once and it sent FB friend request to a thousand contacts from my Outlook, most of which were business contacts that I wouldn't spend much time with outside of the business context. I agree that the other services will need to do something to present their users with added value from the data in their databases. I don't see at this point that the Graph search results will really be any 'better' that what you get today, particularly if you have a low friend density in the topic you're searching.
