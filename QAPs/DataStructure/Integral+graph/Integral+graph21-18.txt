Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
The graph may be declining for individuals who are ignorant, or whose opinion is not personal but influenced by what media is showing. Do a personal research and be specific. For example- which country Namo is visiting, what he did in that country, signed any deal?, then what are the socioeconomic implications of that particular deal. Be smart in asking. Don't generalize the environment.
