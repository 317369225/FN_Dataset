How does Facebook determine when to post an Open Graph Action to the news feed?Our experimentation with Facebook Open Graph Actions suggest that the Edge Rank of these Actions is significantly lower than standard stream.publish actions.Â  Does anyone know if there's anything we an do to enhance the likelihood that these actions will be posted to the News Feed?
My major advice to you would be to analyze how your open graph actions and subsequent stories are performing. Best place to start for that would be app insights. Facebook exposes a ton of useful metrics that would give you a very good insight into your open graph integration. Also if your open graph stories contain links to your site, you should be getting another set of valuable information from the clickthroughs originating from your open graph stories and ending on your site. By analyzing all these metrics, you can paint a very good picture of your open graph story engagement. While there are a lot of factors that determine what shows up on your newsfeed, one of the main end goal of all of them is to make the feed very engaging for you. So if your open graph stories are not very engaging, users will stop interacting with them and Facebook would find this out very soon and start demoting them. Ideally what you want is that stories generated by your open graph actions generate a lot of clickthroughs, likes, comments, etc and your story impressions will automatically rise with that.
