Which technical innovations have the potential to transform the education sector in the next 5 to 10 years?
Serious games (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ser...).  People are spending more and more time gaming - not because they're trying to escape, but because games are more intrinsically rewarding and effective at maintaining one's focus and boosting productivity.  Games could absolutely transform education in the next decade.  For the sake of our collective future, I hope they do.
