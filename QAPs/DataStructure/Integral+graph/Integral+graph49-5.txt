Which technical innovations have the potential to transform the education sector in the next 5 to 10 years?
1. Simulation based grading: The way grading is done in some online programming courses is by simulating:running a program a student has written with given input and verifying outputs are correct. I think this can be done in other fields of study, esp. engineering. 2. Simulation based education with deliberate practice: shown a large effect size for medical education , probably true for other types of education. http://journals.lww.com/academic... 3. Mobile persuasion and computer based persuasion and game mechanics all hold interesting potential for the motivation part of online education.
