Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
We always seem to want something more when we are chasing it. After we have it, maybe our percieved value of it declines. Also, it is easy to have a lot of expectations when you are voting someone to power, but once the promises are not immediately delivered upon, you begin to lose hope. There might be a lot of reasons the promises are not materialising immediately, the government may actually be trying and facing difficulties or may not be trying at all. But to the outsider, it is the lack of results that shows. Not the effort (or the lack of it.) Also, we often find it easier to complain about what we don't have than be grateful for what we do. Though that is not a bad thing for a democracy. The graph, whether it shows a rise or a fall, may not have anything to do with what the Modi government is doing or not doing. It just may be that a wave is difficult to sustain. As they say, getting to the top is easier than staying there.
