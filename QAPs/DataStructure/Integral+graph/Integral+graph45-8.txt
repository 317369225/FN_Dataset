If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
Frankly I'm wondering WHY people are randomly requesting to add me as a Friend.Â  I understand on LinkedIn that for business purposes it often makes sense to try and gain an introduction - but on Facebook I just can't see how someone I don't know in any way, shape, or form, would add value to ME as my friend - although it may further their goals to simply amass friends in volume.
