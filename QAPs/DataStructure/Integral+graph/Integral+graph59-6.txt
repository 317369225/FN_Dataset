What are the most useful gems to use in Rails?
At RailsCarma, we use a number of gems to make our work easier and quicker. One among them is Resque Gem. What does Resque Gem Do ? Resque creates background jobs using Redis. Since it supports multiple queue, we can place them on multiple queues and process them later as well. And it comes with an administration interface for monitoring and managing the queues. Resque is intended to be used in situations where high volume of job entries are required, and provides mechanisms to ensure reflectiveness and consistency of behaviour while providing statistics using a web dashboard. When we have a long processing block of code which we don’t need to execute it inside our web application request cycle, a background processing queuing system is the only good solution. Hence we get faster performing ruby application. Though Resque is inspired by DelayedJob to a great extent, if we need multiple queues in our APP, Resque is probably a better choice.
