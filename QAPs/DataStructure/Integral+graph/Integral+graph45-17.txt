If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
Depends on how you use Facebook. If you use it to share information publicly (i.e., you would be happy with anything in your account being published in the New York Times), by all means accept random requests and make sure that people cannot deface your content. This is how a lot of celebrities use Facebook. If you consider Facebook to be partially private in any way (a risky approach to begin with) then you certainly shouldn't accept random requests.
