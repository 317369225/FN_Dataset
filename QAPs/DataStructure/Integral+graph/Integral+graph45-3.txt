If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
I only accept friend requests from people I've met in real life or have already had some amount of interesting or meaningful online interaction with. Most of my posts on Facebook are set to Everyone visibility and anyone who cares is welcome to go to my profile and read them, but I don't want a bunch of stuff from people I've never met in my News Feed, and I've never seen the appeal of having a huge friend count. So to answer the question, no, at least if you're me. There is no 100% correct answer, though -- different people have different approaches.
