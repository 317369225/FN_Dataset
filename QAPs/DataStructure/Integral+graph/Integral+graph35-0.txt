Are online fashion retailers looking to integrate with analytics focused startups that focus on increasing loyalty, retention and taste graphs versus building their own?
I believe they should be and are interested. This is the case for entry-level and intermediate online retails (not just in fashion). In these cases it makes sense to spend time research the options online and choose one which fits their needs at an approx 80% level - obviously they will not find each and every feature in their wishlist). At higher levels (larger turnarounds, more complex businesses, etc) it probably makes sense to write directly a custom analytics solution. Even at those higher levels though it might be a useful learning experience to take up and use a ready-made solution, see where it is not enough for them and then make something custom covering their needs to a 90-95% level (and keep adding to it until they reach 100%)
