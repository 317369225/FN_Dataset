What should all first time entrepreneurs know before starting their very first business?
Founder commitment is often asymmetric.  Plan for it. Marc Benioff was a co-founder but not the first real CEO of Salesforce.  Elon Musk was Chairman and first investor in Tesla but not the first CEO.  Eduardo Saverin [whatever happened there, I don't know, but ...].  So: Don't have founder drama, or at least as little as possible.  It's too destructive and energy consuming. Have a 5-year vesting schedule, with a one-year cliff from date of funding (not conception).  This avoids a lot of drama by design.  See: A Simple Commitment Test For You And Your Co-Founders by Jason M. Lemkin on SaaStr Be honest with each other about your long-term commitment, come hell or high water. Step out of the way if you can't carry the load, and help bring in people who can. Usually, all the co-founders are 100% committed in theory.  But not always for 100% of the journey, as it ends up playing out in practice. Updated 8 Nov • View Upvotes
