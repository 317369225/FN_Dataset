How did Glassdoor's Facebook App increase by one million DAU in one day?
The open graph did the big push in my opinion, but they also used other Facebook viral tools to really kick it in. When you signed up it said something like "to activate your connections invite these people" and it prompted you to send an invite to all friends. Old school method, but I guess it really worked. Also they used great language: "X friend just activated a connection".."X friend wants a favor from you.."and so on.
