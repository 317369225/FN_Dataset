What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
I don't know if it'll be _the_ next big trend, but reputation is going to be a big deal. It took me about a year to realize the importance of what Timehop is doing. There is so much data being saved nowadays, and as individuals, we have no idea how it's being consumed and surfaced now, let alone 5 years from now. <shameless-plug> This, by the way, is why I've recently built this side project Page on www.scrubber.social that searches your social history looking for potentially embarrassing things so that you have a chance to clean it up. </shameless-plug>
