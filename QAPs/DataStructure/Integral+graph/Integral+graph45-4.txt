If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
Yes, if they are in fact a "pseudo-random" person. What I'm talking about here is someone who you don't immediately recognize by name, but who has, say, 44 shared friends with you. I accept these requests in order to build my local community, since with that high commonality, I'm sure to meet that person in meatspace in the next 6 months or so. Its then kind of fun to blush as you meet someone at a party for the first time and realise that you've been FB connections for a while now.
