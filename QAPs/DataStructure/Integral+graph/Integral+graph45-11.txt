If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
I friend "random" people only if all of the following criteria are met: It is reasonably evident (from their pictures, wall postings, etc.) that the account appears to be a real person who is not using the account as a puppet It appears highly likely that I will meet them either socially in person or over a professional platform in the near future. Being local scores points here There exist at least a few notable common friends They respond to my message asking them to introduce themself and why they are adding me Updated 21 May 2011 â€¢ View Upvotes
