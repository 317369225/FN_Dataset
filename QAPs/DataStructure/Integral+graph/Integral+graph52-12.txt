Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Since most of the answers here have done a great apple-to-apple comparison, Let me try giving a different perspective. I once had a chance to visit Komatsu in Latrobe, PA. Stumbled upon and figured out they make impregnable armors for the US Army among other defense systems, the point is, every time a new armor is rolled out of their R&D labs,  US Army attempts to make bullets/artilleries that can penetrate and make this armor vulnerable. And the viscous cycle continuous, Komatsu, again, goes back to drawing board and reinvents another armor that can be impregnable by the newer bullets/artilleries. This leads to make US army strongest, whether in armor or artillery. Taking a cue from above, we can conclude that one player disrupting another player can certainly lead to having better products or services. In social media case, it is for end users. With Facebook’s new Search Graph, it may not disrupt LinkedIn, Google, Foursquare or Yelp at a fundamental level, but it sure will make the individual silo level competition buck up and react soon enough. also, check this recent update from Mashable ' Tumblr Serves Up Hilariously Awful 'Actual Facebook Graph Searches' http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/a...
