What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
I found BootStrapToday is an intelligent Application Lifecycle Management Platform on SAAS model. With its built-in intelligence and automation you can track your project, accelerate the decision making with improved resource management. You can also track individually and get notified for every change. it provides a great control over time tracking. visit www.bootstraptoday.com
