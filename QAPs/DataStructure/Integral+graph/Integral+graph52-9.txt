Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Here is the fundamental weakness with the new Facebook Graph Search: When you are looking for something, you are looking for an opinion from people whom you trust. They could also be people who you trust on that matter you are searching for specifically. At some point your search will reach something which none (or just few) of your trustees (on that matter) have an opinion about, and have posted a rating for. Your choice would then be to fall back to the masses opinion. And in that case Facebook's Graph Search competes directly with Google (and other topic related sites such as Yelp, Trip Advisor, etc.). But in this case it is more likely Google and others win over Facebook, as they have better systems purifying mass opinion data, filtering any "Spam Opinion" sources. The real question even Facebook hasn't really dealt with is: How can you find someone you could (in-directly) trust, even though you (as well as your friends or trustees) do not know them. If you look closely, you will notice this is a general Security related issue rather than being just a social search riddle. You basically want to know if a web site, application, message you just received from someone you don't really know, is considered reliable to use. I was looking at your question, trying to find a totally new way to look at it, and this quest has brought me to a completely new realm of trust. One I believe is worth developing a system for..
