How do I consolidate maths and physics for JEE Advanced?
Maths Go through your notes and note every formula. Trigonometry: Generalize results derived form questions, inequalities, rules etc. Many questions are bases on direct application of results. Tabulate the notation of every trigonometric function from every transformation rule. For solutions of triangles, jot down EVERY formula and check online for any new formulae as it is the only way . Or derive them in the exam hall. Pretty lousy that is. Calculus: Note the standard models of integration and differentiation, write down the rules to formulate and solve a definite integral, indefinite integral, graphs of continuity and discontinuity. For differential equations, classify the equation models accordingly. P&C, binomial theorem, statistics, probability: Note necessary formulae in statistics and important results and models of combination in binomial theorem. Rule of addition, rile of multiplication is what is required for the other two chapters. And plenty of common sense. Co-ordinate geometry: You can manipulate the options to get the answers sometimes. Note the representation of a line and conic in its different forms, transformations and all other derives formulae for lines, pair of straight lines, 3-D and conics. Matrices and determinants: Different types of matrices, how to solve them, system of equations, solving them using GJ method, Cramer's rule etc. Consistency of a matrix, rank. Quadratic equations, system of equations and complex numbers: Just note the points you feel are important. Physics List the basic concepts and theory of each chapter. Note important results, derived formulae from the basic formulae. Refer to handbooks and books by noted authors as they contain the theory of every chapter in order and pretty much everthing required for JEE syllabus.
