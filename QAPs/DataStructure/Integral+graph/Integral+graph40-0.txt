What are some promising Big Data startups?Including both funded and non-funded ones. And maybe some OSS apps or stacks as well. (A startup doesn't always have to be a company, does it?)
*** Last updated January 2014*** I've answered this question elsewhere on Quora, but it may be worth modifying and repeating that response here: Many startups use big data underneath their applications, of course, but aren't doing anything innovative on the big data front. It's useful to restrict this list to companies that are working with a new technology as well as providing a new form of service. The following are some loose, overlapping categories... For in-database analytics (big data, not traditionally in the cloud, often using columnar database innovations, and lately, Hadoop): Aster Data Calpont ParAccel - now underneath AWS's RedShift Greenplum Netezza Vertica Notice, this wave of startups have (all but one) been acquired in the last several years... I still consider these late-stage startups even though they're borderline cases. Rather than include a much, much longer list of databases, I'll just refer you here: For advanced analytics (data mining, machine learning, sophisticated modeling, simulation): Continuum Analytics Databricks KNIME Paradigm4 PiCloud PLOM.IO - commercialized as Epy.io - beautiful pitch, good cause! Precog - recently acquired by RichRelevance Revolution Analytics Skytree Ufora Yhat From my perspective at Ufora, interest in tools designed for practitioners of advanced analytics (coders, quants, researchers, analysts, data scientists) is heating up. Regression / classification / graph analysis generalized to accept a company's unique data, sometimes with GUI-driven control and less coding: Alpine Data Alteryx Ayasdi BigML Context Relevant Lavastorm Analytics Neo Technology tresata - automated predictive analytics For SQL / NoSQL / Hadoop combinations (true big data, large scale data processing, often limited advanced analytics capabilities) in the cloud: Actian Datameer Hadapt Inktank / Ceph JethroData - "fully indexed SQL on Hadoop: Platfora Splice Machine - "real time SQL on Hadoop" Zettaset Developer centric NoSQL/Hadoop tools for managing big data: Cloudera Datastax Hortonworks Infochimps Karmasphere MapR Mortar Data Qubole - "intuitive UI to Hive, Pig, & MapReduce" Rainstor Sqrrl For search, data visualization, basic data mining, and predictive tools; often using other NoSQL solutions: Centrifuge Systems Digital Reasoning EdgeSpring LucidWorks Palantir - grown up out of the "startup" phase Tableau - also grown up out of the "startup" phase Trifacta - data transformation phase of ETL Data resale: DataSift Exversion Factual Quandl Topsy GPUs: SQREAM Technologies Specific Verticals Ad-Tech: demand-side platforms Adchemy AppNexus BRANDSCREEN DatXu Invite Media Lucid Media MediaMath Triggit Turn X+1 Ad-Tech: online marketing optimization tools Coremetrics Omniture RichRelevance Unica Bio: Accelrys Affymetric Ariadne Genomics BioXpr DNAnexus Eagle Genomics Geneva Bioinformatics IO Informatics Spiral Genetics Life Technologies Tripos Discovery Informatics Engineering / performance monitoring: Concurix ... many more. Finance: 1010data Arialytics QuantConnect Quantopian Marketing: PivotLink Kontagent Clario Other lists of analytics and data startups: 42 Big Data Startups - Vote for the Top 10 Data startups collection on Pinterest Big Data Start-up Funding By Vendor Much to add, including some important ones.  If I have an opportunity, I'll continue to extend this list.  Some useful blogs and market research, although startups are only a portion of their focus: The Big Data Landscape Kurt Monash: http://www.dbms2.com/ Merv Adrian: http://blogs.gartner.com/merv-ad... James Kobelius: http://blogs.forrester.com/blog/143 IDC: http://www.idc.com/ Intersect360: http://www.intersect360.com/ It's also worth keeping an eye on the established firms, of course... Oracle, SAP (HANA), Microsoft, IBM (SPSS), SAS, MathWorks, MicroStrategy, MarkLogic, TIBCO, etc., and consulting companies like Opera Solutions, Mu Sigma, Accenture.  McKinsey is building out an advanced analytics practice.
