What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
First of all, it is very important to list your priorities to really determine which system will be the best fit (check this blog post about "Choosing the right project management software for your agency" http://www.functionpoint.com/blo...) I have been using Function Point Software since I joined the company (more than one year ago). The software is designed to small and mid-size creative agencies and provides online timesheets, resource management and more features such as: Customer Relationship Management Creative Briefs, Estimates & Proposals Traffic & Task Management Job & Project Management Scheduling & Calendar Media Insertion Orders Invoices & Profit Analysis Staff, Client & Vendor Collaboration Client Extranet / Portal Digital Asset Management Financial & Management Reporting Updated 17 Jul 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
