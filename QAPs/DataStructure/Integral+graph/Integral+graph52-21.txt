Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Facebook Graph Search takes Local Search to the next level. Google cannot give me answers to queries like "My friends who work at ABC" or "My friends who live in Bern" or may be "My friends of friends who like Actor XYZ" - so you get it, how powerful graph search is as a tool - be it marketing, research or in general anything that you want to find about anyone across the world!
