What should all first time entrepreneurs know before starting their very first business?
Focus wins.  You should develop a thesis, set out a core strategy, and implement that strategy.  Of course, you can easily still fail.  Your thesis could be wrong.  Your strategy could be bad.  And you could fail to implement the strategy.  But if you don't focus, the only chance you will be successful is luck.  And there are people who get lucky and are successful because of it -- but you do not want to trust your success to dice.  To take things into your own hands, you must focus. The thing most entrepreneurs mess up on is that they are not focused enough.  They do not play to their strengths.  They try to do too many things at once.  Multitasking is not a strategy for business success.
