What is the easiest way to calculate the area under the curve (integral) of a graph in excel?
I'm not a mathematician, but as I understand it, integrals are used for functions because they have an infinite amount of points and the area is therefore impossible to calculate the usual way. Excel graphs are not like that, as you most certainly have a finite amount of points and you just need to add up the area between all of them. Therefore, you want to go into your original table, and for each point, calculate the area between that point and the previous one. Then calculate a running total, or just the total at the end, depending on your needs. Btw, as you have percentages in this example, that result would make very little sense.
