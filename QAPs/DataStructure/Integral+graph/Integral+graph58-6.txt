What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
When it comes to resource scheduling (a vital element of project management for any digital agency), not all of the solutions used by the bigger agencies are expensive! Saatchi & Saatchi, Grey, Ogilvy and Publicis are just a few of the many well known larger agencies who are using Resource Guru to handle resource scheduling, and with plans starting from just $19 p/m it's well within the budget of smaller agencies as well.
