What are the best sites (or tools) using the Strava API?What are some of the best examples or executions of 3rd parties utilizing Strava's API for any of Strava's sports?
I made location based Game using the  Strava Activities, where you can be the king of an area (couple of 100  square meters) if you have ridden most of all the Strava-Riders at this  Area. So the time is not important, but how many of your rides went  through an area. On a LeaderBoard you then can be a King of a  City/District/State/Continent/World, depending on the numbers of Areas where you are the king. You can download it at: Stravistix Game - Android Apps on Google Play I would be happy if you would try it.
