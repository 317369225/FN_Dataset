What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
Facebook and Twitter are great platforms for social sharing and interaction, but it is close to impossible to make sense in all this.  How can you detect, extract and follow events, discussions, trends, topics and people?   Take a look at Quora topic How does Robert Scoble sort through all of the tweets he receives?  He follows more than 30,000 people handpicked to ensure good coverage worldwide, and is browsing through thousands of tweets daily.  This is very much like browsing the web before "search".  So the next big trend after “search” and “social” must be social discovery.
