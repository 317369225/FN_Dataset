Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
I don't see it decreasing. The number of people who have started questioning him have increased and rightly so. Also, the number of people who believed in his model have reduced. But those who still believe are strong believers and they have faith that the model will succeed. The reasons why Modi wave may decrease is: Unnecessary comments by RSS spokesperson on religious conversions and related issues. His mistake in not forcing the Rafael deal to make in India. Overbranding and overpublicity
