If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
Like James Hritz, I keep a separate list with shut-down info settings. No one will have my birthday and I don't have my town or network listed. Because I am a writer and active on many platforms, I have many people I connect to that I don't know, but if there's no real connection, and no context provided, I connect, then hide. There are a number of reasons I will not friend someone, but for the most part, I accept that I will have more "friends" who are really fans than I want to actually be "friends" with.
