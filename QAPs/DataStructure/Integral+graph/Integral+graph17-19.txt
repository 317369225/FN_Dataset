What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
The next big trend will be connecting the internet of things with solutions for the real (physical) world. Companies like: Nest; Lockitron; Lapka; Square.  These companies will be really big in 5 to 7 years, specially Square. Websites that automate your web life like IFTTT will prevail like the ones I've said previously. In a near future, you'll see lots of apps copying IFTTT. Updated 24 Dec 2013 • View Upvotes
