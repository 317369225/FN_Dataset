How did Glassdoor's Facebook App increase by one million DAU in one day?
The graph appears to be off by one day. The jump was most likely due to their new blog post (http://www.glassdoor.com/blog/co...) that went viral via FB/Twitter/Digg/Pinterest (bound to, given the number of people looking for jobs). DAUs dropped in a few days, so the user engagement wasn't sustained (although about 25% of the new users seem to have been retained). Overall it's a nice case study of how inbound marketing via blogging can be pretty effective.
