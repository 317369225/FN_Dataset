How can social graph content from Facebook be integrated effectively to trigger an online travel booking flow?
We are currently implementing several FB integration with our travel packages booking website, here are few ideas we came up with: send the customer 3 days before departure email with complimentary pdf guide for the destination. In the mail we call him to share info about his trip via FB or email, when he uses our application and post and shares an interesting comment he might win a price. Similar way after return from the trip, customer gets an email to comment the destination through an app which might post his comment on his wall.
