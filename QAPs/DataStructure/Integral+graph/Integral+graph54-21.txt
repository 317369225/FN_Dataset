What should all first time entrepreneurs know before starting their very first business?
There is no such thing as a successful entrepreneur.  There are only successful teams. Lots of good advice in the answers to this question, but almost all the advice is cast in terms of the individual entrepreneur and what you as an individual should do.  But the popular conception of the brilliant individual entrepreneur is a myth.  If you are an individual entrepreneur, the first thing you need to do is find an exceptional co-founder or two.  Ideally you have complementary skills and perspectives.  All of you have to be as wildly enthusiastic about the startup as you are.  And all of you have to be able to be brutally honest with each other, able to hold each other accountable, able to adjust roles over time, and able to bounce back after ferocious disagreements.  If you can't find one or two other people who are as insanely excited about this opportunity as you are, that's a clue.   :-)  If you can, then you have enormous leverage, and you might actually have a chance.  Then you can read all the advice that everyone else has to offer, and all the books and the blogs, and decide as a team what makes sense in your situation and what you are going to do today, tomorrow and the next day to realize your vision of changing the world.  Good luck!
