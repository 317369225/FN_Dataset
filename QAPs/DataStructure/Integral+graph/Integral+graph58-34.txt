What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
You could try Swydo because we focus on recurring work (we call them subscriptions) that most digital agencies have and have an integration with Adwords, Analytics and webmaster tools. Its free up to 2 consultants and 10 client workspaces. best regards, Jeroen
