Should YouTube integrate Facebook Open Graph to promote wider sharing of YouTube videos?I'm guessing YouTube won't do this given the relationship between the two companies, but given the popularity of video on Facebook it seems that not doing a deeper integration of Open Graph creates more opportunities for Viddy, Socialcam, etc. on the Facebook platform. Despite the tense relationship between Google and Facebook, I suspect a lot of YouTube's users are active on Facebook.
I think Google should integrate with Open Graph for the following reasons. Google distinguishes itself from others such as Apple and Microsoft by being against closed systems and supporting open systems. Google's Android works on any phone. Chrome works on any phone or computer, all of Google's apps such as the Youtube app work on iPhone too. Why not integrate with Facebook ? Facebook is popular and nobody can deny that. It makes sense to integrate and take advantage of the user base.
