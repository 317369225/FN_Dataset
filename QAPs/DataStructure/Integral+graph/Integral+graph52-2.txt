Originally Answered: How much of threat is Facebook's new Graph Search to Yelp, Foursquare and Google?Let's break it down a bit, shall we... Google - Low threat. Google indexes, well, everything ever, Facebook, just what your friends (and friends of friends) have done on Facebook.  Otherwise, as Philipp M. W. Hoffmann stated, it's a real apples to oranges comparison. Yelp - Medium Threat. Yelp has been trying to "socialize" it's network for some time now by letting to add friends, etc., allowing you to see specifically what your friends, etc. thought of a given place. This is one of the things that Facebook's Graph Search will be able to do, but here's the rub: Where Facebook has the friends, Yelp has the reviews. You could look around Facebook to see if your friends liked a restaurant, barber, etc., but people just don't do that as much as people leave reviews on Yelp... yet. Foursquare - Low to Medium Threat. Foursquare wasn't taken out when you first started to be able to "check in" to places on Facebook, so I doubt Graph Search will be that much more dangerous to them now.  That said, Foursquare has plenty of other issues, completely unrelated to this, that they need to deal with. All of the above said, it really depends on if people actually use the damned thing in the first place.  "Graph Search" is a horrible name (ask your typical, non-industry person what "social graph" means and you'll see what I mean) and not everything that is introduced on Facebook is an instant winner. If anything, this may finally help improve the site's overall search, which has been sucky since day one.
