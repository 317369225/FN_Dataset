Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
I don't think it's going to affect them in the long run, because there needs to be diverse places for data to be kept, if all your eggs are on Facebook and it goes down you've lost it all. Diversity puts pressure on bigger platforms for transparency and accountability.
