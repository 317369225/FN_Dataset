What is the best way to integrate a graph database with mongoDB?I wish to use a graph engine to provide suggestions or related information based on data in mongoDB.
Since there's a few years since the last post, I was wondering if anyone would have further ideas to the topic. I'm specifically interested finding the most convenient way to implement collaborative graph editions using ShareJS+livedb. Currently this has a MongoDB wrapper. Dealing with graphs in MongoDB sounds a bit troubling, though. Would be interesting to hear recommendations for this type of use case. I'm now looking into MongoGraph - and any experiences with this would be very welcome, too.
