If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
Facebook is a platform, upon which we each lay our own versions of "community" or "network". For me, it works as a simulacrum of my offline friendships and close business relationships, and so I have chosen to draw a digital line in the sand at “family and close friends whom I've known for 4 years or more". Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule, but I would find it an insurmountable challenge to manage in excess of about 400 Facebook friends with any integrity. That said, I have several friends with 3,000 or more Facebook friends, and I KNOW they are simply accepting random friend requests galore. Do I feel there is value in this? No. At least not for me. Given that LinkedIn offers a perfectly good business network infrastructure, and myriad platforms and tools offer “shout-out” channels (Google Buzz, Twitter, et al), Facebook's differentiating value proposition is its ability to keep you up-to-date with your friends in an unobtrusive way, allowing you the option of intensifying or lightening your connectivity in an organic and fluid manner. However, if you can't track the relationship, how can you possible manage it effectively? To each one’s own, but the mix of identity risks, relationship management challenges, and quality v. quantity dynamics keep me firmly in the camp of “no random Facebook requests”.
