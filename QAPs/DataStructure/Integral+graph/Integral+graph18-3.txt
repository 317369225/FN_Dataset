Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
IMO there is no comparison between Nagios and Zabbix. Zabbix wins hands down. Having working with Zabbix since 1.4 it has evolved into a great product and the features coming into 2.x are amazing. Some features that zabbix has that Nagios is lacking - Auto Registration - Auto Discovery (agent devices, snmp, etc..) - Aggregate Graphs (this is very useful when looking at the overall picture) - Distributed Monitoring - Windows Service Discovery (coming in 2.x) - Native JMX Support (coming in 2.x) There are many other features that Nagios just doesn't have not to mention the ease of use.
