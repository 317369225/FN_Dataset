Why don't sites integrate Open Graph Actions more frequently?What's refraining them from adding custom open Graph Actions to their website? Complexity? Time? No interest?
As per my understanding and experience with online retailers, if the site wants to have some Facebook integration, including a few OG tags and a like button (provided by FB or some social aggregators like ShareThis) does the job. Generally, add a custom OG action in the workflow is considered as an extra step. Also companies are not sure how much revenue uplift they can get by using OG actions. Social Media is still considered as non-core for most of the sites. So getting time of IT team on it hard. OG actions can not be implemented in a way that any third party service implements them for the sites as an embeddable widgets.
