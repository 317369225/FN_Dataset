How tough is it to clear the bridge courses for CS at RIT?
It is tough to clear the bridge courses. When they give the bridge course it is with a mindset that you may probably need more focus on your basics. Having said that i had 3 bridge courses and i don't think more 2 people cleared the waiver. It is not easy. Here is my other point of view. They have financial constraints since it is a private univ. this is their way of making money and hence not many students would clear the waiver. If there were many students who would clear they will raise the difficulty of the waiver test the following year and the trend continues. In short, i don't think you will get it waived off but it is worth a shot you might just get lucky you never know. Clearing all three bridge courses is a challenge but maybe you might get a course or two waived but it is a huge task and would need solid prep.
