Facebook has blocked Microsoft from deeply integrating into their social graph. Does this indicate that Facebook is (still?) working on a phone of their own?
My guess is that it has more to do with ads than Facebook making a phone themselves. They've tried before, and it's bombed every time because everyone can already use Facebook on the phones they have now.
