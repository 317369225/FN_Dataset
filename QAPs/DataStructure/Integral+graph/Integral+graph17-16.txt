What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
In one word, mobile. In the USA, the cost of upgrading mobile networks is expensive. Compare to Japan where one tower covers a much higher percentage of the population. Europe, might be somewhere in between. The real next trend is augmented reality and ever more capable mobile devices. Accelerometer applications, NFC applications, camera based applications like Trimensional and the non-mobile MS Kinnect. Also, mobile manufacturers will have the ability to add new and interesting sensors to mobile devices. I would believe that the following things are inevitable on a mobile device: Locomotion (wheels/treads/wings), ambulation (arms/appendages) Printing (3D based printing, and plain old paper) Chemical sensors (pick up smells, do medical analysis, etc.) Depth perception ala Kinect and eyeball tracking. Digital projection, eventually holographic. Solar power cells. Radiological Detection Quantum 8-QBIT calculators(Any other sensor ideas?) Whenever a new feature appears on a device, the industry will rush to develop applications for them. The most interesting thing is that we now have the ability to introduce sensors to widespread computing due to the small size and cost of mobile devices. The Internet is old, generally centralized, but the mobilenet will have the power to disrupt through decentralized, local interactions. Updated 23 Jul 2011 â€¢ View Upvotes
