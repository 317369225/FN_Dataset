If some random person adds you on Facebook, should you accept?
Facebook are hypocrites -- they used to encourage people to add many friends (also, what is wrong with meeting randoms and hooking up?).  Now, facebook discourages and punishes people who request multiple randoms.  It's completely the opposite of what they stood for in 2007.
