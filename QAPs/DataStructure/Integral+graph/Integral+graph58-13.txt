What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
You should try out Brightpod (http://brightpod.com). It's a task management tool built for marketers and is really simple to use. Brightpod was built by the team from DeskAway once we realized that marketing teams/digital agencies need a specific tool that solves their problems. So what problems does it solve? Helps plan faster: Brightpod has ready-made marketing workflows (task lists) that help marketers plan campaigns faster. Also, you can save your own workflows and reuse them since a lot of marketing tasks can be repetitive. Better for managing content: It's super important for a marketing task management tool to now have features to manage content marketing. Brightpod has a simple editorial calendar that does that right now with a lot of updates coming in the future Better file storage & collaboration: Marketing teams share a lot of data with each other. Brightpod lets you store files, comment on them (great for approvals) and send messages to team members.
