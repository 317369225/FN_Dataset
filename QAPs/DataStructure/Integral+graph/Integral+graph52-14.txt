Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Originally Answered: How much of threat is Facebook's new Graph Search to Yelp, Foursquare and Google?Because Google has Google+ the threat is minimal. Most likely they already have a project similar to Facebook's (I would presume that Facebook made the hastily announced disclosure just to steal the spotlight from Google, but that's already pure speculation). The losers are not the usual suspectt. The losers are Bing and Linkedin. Bing is losing because at the end of their current partnership with Facebook the balance of power will be dramatically inverted. Web search is a known topic, nowadays is only a matter of implementation and deep pockets (for all those servers and all that bandwidth). They don't have their own social network. They will be screwed between Google and Facebook. Linkedin is losing because suddenly the kind of professional networking they are offering is just a feature made possible by Facebook Graph Search. You heard it from me, FB just transformed the mighty Linkedin into a feature. For me the consequences are already set in stone; to survive Bing will have to merge with Linkedin (and perhaps also with a dating web site). If they don't, their future is zero.
