Is Facebook Graph Search a danger to Google, LinkedIn, Yelp or Foursquare?See: Facebook new search - discovery engine a threat to Google, Foursquare, Linkedin Basically I agree totally with it but what are your opinions on the matter, would Facebook become a LinkedIn and foursquare killer would it increase Bing reach as stated in the videos ?
Facebook Graph search engine helps you discover people on the topics of interest similar to you. On the other hand google search engine is mostly used to find web pages on the internet both have very different so i don't think Facebook Graph search should pose a problem to Google search
