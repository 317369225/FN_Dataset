What is the best task/project management software for a small digital agency?Needs time tracking. Would also be nice if it has resource management capabilities... oh, and doesn't cost a ton. Basecamp isn't cutting it anymore and some of the more robust solutions at bigger agencies are too expensive. There has to be something in between, right?!
Absoluetly!  Though Basecamp is one of the most common project management tools, the problem is you still need to hack the default workflow of Basecamp to make it work with your content production process. Dealing with tasks, milestones and to-do lists within Basecamp makes it easier said than done. You start with Basecamp, then you realize it's missing many features for managing multiple projects at ease. And you end up buying a maze of apps that cost too much and don't even communicate properly with one another. Check out ContentCloud, a Content Collaboration Suite for publishers/content marketers & digital agencies. The platform combines task management, time tracking, scheduling with an impressive Idearoom for brainstorming with your team members and a powerful Editorial Calendar.
