Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
I agree with Raviteja. Or maybe, you simplya can't read a graph! Either way your opinion is incorrect. I would say his graph is on the rise. I never seen a more proactive Ministry of External Affairs. Two incidents: First --> An Indian girl loses her passport and money in Berlin, Germany. Tweets it asking for help. MEA office reads it (or maybe Ms. Sushma Swaraj read it herself) and the Indian Embassy gets in touch with the girl and helps her out. Second--> An Indian mother tweets her baby's picture and claiming that she is stuck in Yemen during the crisis. MEA get's in touch with her and evacuates her baby (she decides to stay back in Yemen for a while andÂ  comes back to India later) safely to India. Indian government is doing something unbelievable. They are helping even individuals who are sometimes left out. Truly unbelievable! Dave (www.myztykaldave.weebly.com)
