Why does BJP's and Modi's graph of wave, integrity, and faith decreasing day by day?
Simple reason....too many promises and none fulfilled......Modi won with 300+ seats and has not delivered....NOTHING LITERALLY NOTHING.....some mindless overseas trips and stupid swachch bharat abhiyan schemes.....theÂ  anti poor land acquisition bill and controversial yoga day and his bias behaviour towards minorities can't be ignored neither by media nor by the people.....so it sure to happen.
