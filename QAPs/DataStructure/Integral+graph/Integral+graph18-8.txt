Which is the best network monitoring tool: Nagios or Zabbix?
Like Brian, I've worked with Zabbix since the early 1.4 days of 2007.  I played with both Zabbix and Nagios, but stuck with Zabbix.  Nagios has great features, I just used what was best for my environment.  Now is a great time to be checking out Zabbix.  Their 2.0 release has some new functionality that was sorely needed.  Automatic discovery of file systems, network devices, and SNMP OIDs to name a few. To clarify a bit on what Jose noted. While the server configuration is mostly via a web interface, client agents are configured through text files and I have administered via puppet quite successfully. I find the graphs most useful for monitoring trends.  Helpful to look back over a week/month/year/etc and see why you are 'out of the blue' out of disk space, etc. A 4vCPU, 4GB virtual machine is fully capable of monitoring 400+ agents.  A pain point of mine is the load on MySQL.  This can be optimized through partitioning of the most used tables and basic MySQL tweaks.  Also, utilize something like xcache and compression for php/httpd, but these are standard improvements for most PHP web interfaces. You probably won't go wrong with either, but I, obviously, have a preference for Zabbix... Good luck.
