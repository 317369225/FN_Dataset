Why do some Malay from peninsular Malaysia still think people in Borneo live on top of trees?
Relax, it's like that everywhere. Everywhere in the world, people in capital cities ask the same kind of questions to people furthest from them. I used to live in a far place from the capital and when I went back to live in the capital, I had the same kind of questions: Do people live in tents with sand all over it? How do they do for water? Do they still travel in camels....etc. I was simply saying: Yes, they travel by camels and go get water from hundreds of kilometers carrying heavy water barrels until camels fail sometimes. They have to shovel off their way in the morning through all the sand that accumulates in front of their tent and they're constantly moving through the desert to look for an oasis. On day I even met someone and we were talking about music, when I said that I loved country, blues and jazz he was genuinely astonished asking: "Wow! You're very modern compared to where do you come from". Common... Listening to country makes you "modern"? I just said "Yes, I am." And say it in a non sarcastic way, as if it was really true and then just change the discussion course to a more productive one. No need to complicate things and try to explain things to them, they're too lazy to do some research or better, travel, so don't bother wasting time on them.
