What is the best free genealogy software?
PhpGedview and Gramps are both superb software, Gramps especially, but it's desktop alone and doesn't allow for collaboration. This is where PhpGedview shines as it allows you to import your Gedcom onto a web platform where you can help grow it with collaboration. Most of the programmers of PhpGedview have now moved on and have developed a wonderful piece of software called Webtrees. Webtrees is far superior to PhpGedview and the programmers have taken out most of the legacy code and completely revamped it. It's much simpler to use and allows you a simple process for migrating from PhpGedview. Personally, I started off with Gramps, and when I couldn't grow it any further on the desktop with my knowledge alone, looking for a collaboration solution I moved to PhpGedView and then finally to Webtrees and I love it. Would highly recommend it.
