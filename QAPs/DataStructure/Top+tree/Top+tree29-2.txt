Which trees grow the best in the desert?
Desert:  A place that gets averages under 10 inches of precipitation per year. Deserts can range from the blistering heat of the empty quarter in the Middle East, to the arctic tundra. Generally trees require more water than you find in deserts.  In North America the 14"/year  precip line is roughly where you stop finding widespread trees. In many deserts trees only occur where there is some circumstance that increases the local water supply:  The classic oasys in tropical deserts.  In North American deserts, you find trees in coulees and stream valleys.   In borderline conditions you find juniper, pinyon pine.  A few years ago I drove from Canada to visit my brother in New Mexico.  Over and over through the basin and range country we saw the following pattern: Valley floor grass/sagebrush A few hundred feet up:  Juniper. A few more hundred feet up:  Pines Higher up yet:  Spruce Higher up yet:  Concolor and balsam fir. In arctic deserts you find scrub birch and spruce. I'm sure that other people can add other trees from other desert/dryland zones. Updated 12w ago • Asked to answer by Dan Biller
