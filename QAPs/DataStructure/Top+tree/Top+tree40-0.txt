Where are the best trees to climb in Seattle?
I have only visited Seatlle once for 3 weeks, but it's my favorite city I have ever visited. I am unqualified to answer this question, but I stayed at the University of Washington.Â  I read that they had over 600 different types of trees from all over the world on the campus. The campus is also beautiful, and if you are elevated you can see some parts of the city. If you like variety, I would try the University of Washington campus.
