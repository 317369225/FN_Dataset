Which trees grow the best in the desert?
That is a hard one. Which desert? The Mojave? Find a tree native to the Mojave. The Great Sandy? Find a native of the Great Sandy. The Gobi? Find a native of the Gobi. The Kalahari? Find a native of the Kalahari. The Sahara? Good luck. Just joking. I imagine some trees grow there. My great grandfather was a logger in the Sahara; that's why it is a desert. (Joke!) Can you see the direction this is taking? There are many deserts on our planet. Each has its plants (and animals for that matter) who have adapted to life in those deserts, and those plants (and animals) will live best in the areas for which life and adaptation has suited them. So, for whatever desert you are looking, google that desert's vegetation. I suspect you will find different ones for each place. Note that there are tropical deserts, temperate zone deserts, cold deserts, and each one on Earth has a different hydrology.
