What is the best free genealogy software?
I've tried many Genealogy Software programs in the 16 years that I'm researching now. Obviously things have developed a lot over time but one program has been with more for I think more than 10 years now: Brother's Keeper by John Steed (Brother's Keeper) It's a program that I would call for the more serious genealogist, rather than those that are superficially interested in their family and collect some told stories from their relatives and pictures of their ancestors. Brother's Keeper focuses on the helping you to enter all the relevant data about every person you come across, be it a relative or a potential or just a person with the same surname (which can help in overcoming dead ends). I do like the ability to directly attach sources to the information I enter. So if I enter eg a marriage date and location, I can add directly to that information the scan or photo of that marriage certificate that I found in an archive. This is linked then to all the people mentioned on it, as eg the parents are mentioned in it for both bride and groom. Witnesses are attached to this event as well, again very valuable information as eg in the catholic belief the witnesses had to come from the family and it was following a strict pattern who was selected at former times. The only downside of Brother's Keeper might be the visualisation, professional software one can buy usually has more richer representation of your data. But that is no problem as you can still use Brother's Keeper to enter your data and then easily export via GEDCOM to the paid genealogy software package. Just a final note, Brother's Keeper is currently only available for Windows but can be run under a new Mac with a proper emulator (like eg VMware)
