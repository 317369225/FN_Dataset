What is the best bonsai tree for amateurs?
One of the most popular beginner bonsai trees today is the Chinese elm.  Most of them are imported and relatively inexpensive.  They have small leaves, grow fast and tolerate many beginner mistakes. They often come in curvy shapes. I grew the Chinese elm shown here for over 20 years.  I also agree with the trees listed on Ashley's post as other possibilities.
