What were the best movies of 2011 and why?
It's a pity no one has yet mentioned: A Separation (2011) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1832... I have watched most of the movies mentioned in this thread, but A Separation stands out from the rest by a long long margin. Currently, it has an 8.6/10 on imdb.com from 35k+ votes, a score which is far higher than Midnight in Paris, Drive or Descendants have managed to get. Give it a try, chances are you'll love it too. It has already won the best foreign movie in the Golden Globe and Berlin Film Festival. It has been nominated for Oscars for best foreign language film and best original screenplay. Update: It has won Best Foreign Language movie at 84th Academy Awards. Yay, I was right! Updated 203w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
