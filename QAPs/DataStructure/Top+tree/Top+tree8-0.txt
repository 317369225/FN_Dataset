Why do some Malay from peninsular Malaysia still think people in Borneo live on top of trees?
On the outset, I have to say, you must be relatively young. You sound like you are not over 20 (I sense some teenage angst), and on that premise, perhaps most (if not all) of the 56 people you mentioned are of your age group, or are your peers. I live in the Peninsular, and the common perception here seems to be that people in Borneo live in long houses. I am certain none of my peers thinks that people in Borneo live on trees. Out of the questions you mentioned, perhaps "how we commute everyday" would be asked out of genuine interest, and "do we still hunt heads" would be asked out of curiosity. The other questions are either asked out of ignorance (at a level at which no one over the age of 20 should ever commit) or as a half-baked joke. To them, they might be asking for the first time. To you, perhaps the umpteenth time, hence your frustration. I'm not a Malay so perhaps I might not be fully qualified to answer this question, but from my point of view, it is not the race which makes the difference but the level of education. You would rarely find someone from the urban areas asking you such questions. As for "You came here and force use to use your language?" < This is unclear, I'm afraid. Our education system teaches Bahasa Malaysia and English as compulsory subjects. I have no idea what languages are you referring too. Your question my friend, I'm afraid, is severely inaccurate.
