What is the best watering method for a bonsai tree?
Mostly depends on the qualities of the soil, the density of the root structure, and the ambient temperature and humidity. If the soil is entirely inorganic, it will probably need to be watered every day, possibly twice a day if very hot or dry conditions because the soil retains little water, which will be sucked up by the tree roots or evaporate.  Best to water such plantings until water runs out the bottom and then water again 5 minutes later.  If there is a lot of organic content to the soil it will absorb and retain the water. You should allow such plantings to dry out before watering again because roots that are wet all the time will develop root rot (although a few plants can tolerate it). A root-bound plant may trap water in the pot, which can also lead to root rot.  Be advised that when you allow your plant to dry out completely, it will need to be watered soon, especially in dry or hot conditions, or it could quickly suffer and die. Basically, owning a bonsai tree is like having a pet or a child--you have to care for it every day.
