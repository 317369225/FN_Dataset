How are coconut trees, which appear top-heavy and slender-trunked, able to withstand heavy winds without getting snapped into two?
As a tree biologist I would say that all trees (including coconut) are having a modular structure where the top heaviness is balanced by a proportionately strong stem well entrenched into the soil. As a sapling grows into a tree there is an increase in top heaviness and the diameter and strength of the stem increases  by increments of cellulose and its lignification. This is for 'normal' growth conditions that includes the routine wind turbulences. In case of very high velocity winds when the aerodynamic resistance offered by the top exceeds the strength of the fixing system snapping of parts may occur. 1.  Individual branches of the tree may break. 2.  In other cases  a fall of the top along with trunk to one side may occur due to loosening of the root hold  on soil (uprooting). 3.  Snapping of the main trunk may occur in yet other cases  if hold of the root system on soil is firm.
