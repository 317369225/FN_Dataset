What is the best bonsai tree for amateurs?
As already mentioned Ficus are an easy Bonsai to begin with but do not overlook other types. I always think that anything fast growing, Bougainvillea bonsai or Lonicera bonsai make great Bonsai for amateurs as they do give quick results and also require regular pruning etc, plenty of practise This will enable you to hone your skills quickly.
