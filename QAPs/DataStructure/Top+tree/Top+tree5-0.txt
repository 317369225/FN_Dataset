Why do all Christmas tree top angels have blonde hair?
They don't. It may just be where you are shopping but I know that they don't for mine is a brunette. However, it will seem as though, proportionally compared to the general population, there are MANY more blondies in the angel world than in real life. This could be because religiously, angels are depicted as white, blond, blue eyed, holy things. However, if this were true, then about 99% of the world wouldn't become an angel after death.
