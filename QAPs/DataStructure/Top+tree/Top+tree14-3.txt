What is the best Porcupine Tree album?
It is not possible to label any single album as the best. It depends on your taste. If you are more interested in Metal, Fear of a Blank Planet or Deadwing are probably the ones for you. If you're not very into Metal, you should enjoy Stupid Dream or Lightbulb Sun. And the pre-Stupid Dream albums are chaotically discordant in genre; Up the Downstair and Signify are representative of that era. My personal favourites are In Absentia and The Sky Moves Sideways.
