What are the best family tree websites?
The top 4 genealogy sites in the U.S.: ancestry.com legacy.com geni.com myheritage.com You can find more links here: http://genealogymetrics.ning.com/ In terms of UI and ease of building family trees, I think geni.com stands out. However, in terms of usefulness of searching and connecting family trees, I assume that having more people on the site is better. In that case, the legacy.com (http://siteanalytics.compete.com...) and ancestry.com (http://siteanalytics.compete.com...) have far more users than say geni (http://siteanalytics.compete.com...). However, that doesn't imply it'll be easier for sure, just that all things equal, the probability of you finding someone important to connect to is higher. Note: I'm don't know how often such things occur anyways, so it might be a mute point.
