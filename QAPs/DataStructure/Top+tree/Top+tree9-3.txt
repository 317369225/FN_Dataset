If I found what I suspected to be a foreign nations drone, let's say snagged in a tree top on my property. Who should I call to report it?
In general, aerial photography by foreign national is not illegal. If we are talking about suspicion of photography of Federal designated "sensitive sites", you would probably just contact the site and let them make the determination. The army base or dam or whatever. Since you would have to be very close (small drones have tiny ranges) you should be well aware of your neighbor's status.
