What is the best watering method for a bonsai tree?
The short answer is water it when it gets dry.  There's so many factors that go into how quickly a tree will dry out that it's impossible to water on a schedule.  Water retention of soil, drainage, type of tree, temperature, wind, humidity, size of pot, how much foliage is on the tree, is the tree growing?, etc. all play a part in how quickly a tree will dry out.  You definitely can overwater a tree and while you shouldn't let it get bone dry, for most trees you should let it get a little dry in between waterings.
