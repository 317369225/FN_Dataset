What are some of the best soothing songs by Porcupine Tree?
When people ask me to introduce them to Porcupine Tree, I generally follow this chronological order Lazarus Trains Time Flies Shesmovedon Half-Light Sentimental Lightbulb Sun Last chance to evacuate planet earth Stars die Piano Lessons(The happy/lively ones - almost) Now as they get hooked on these songs, their definition of "soothing" changes (as did mine). Then, I unleash to them the real monsters: Russia on Ice, Anesthetize, Arriving Somewhere, Fear of a blank planet, Normal, Halo, Blackest Eyes, Wedding nails ... (the ones which leave you gasping for air - almost) Then, as the definition of "soothing" still evolves : The sound of muzak, .3, Drown with Me, Kneel and disconnect, Feel so low, Nine cats,  Mellotron Scratch ... (the dark / psychedelic ones - almost) Now those who stick around this far start finding  every other song soothing!
