What is the most humane deed you have ever witnessed?
I met a lady and a young man who feeds the stray cats in the neighbourhood. Every. Single. Day. They've effectively adopted 50 or so kitties, and send them to the vet when necessary. They do it all by themselves, at 11PM, without fanfare or recognition. They taught me all about cats and kindness, never relenting in their efforts. And yes, they clean up afterwards and make sure everyone's okay. :) To put in so much effort for cats who aren't known for their gratitude, simply to care for a species so far removed from our own, is quite the feat. (The clipped ear means the cat's been neutered, btw.) For me, they exemplify the quote: "To err on the side of kindness is seldom an error." (Liz Armbuster)
