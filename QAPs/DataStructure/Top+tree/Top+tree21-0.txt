What is the most humane deed you have ever witnessed?
The devastating floods in Chennai, India have been making news for past days. The incessant rainfall has disrupted normal life beyond measure and caused loss to life and property, with many being rendered many homeless. In these trying times, help and aid is pouring in from all quarters in varying capacities. However, one particular act has stood out today. 5-time Chess World Champion Vishwanathan Anand, who is waging battles with his kings and knights in London Chess Classic against the likes of Magnus Carlsen, has not forgotten the agony and tribulations of the people back in his hometown of Chennai. Today, he and his wife took the decision to open the doors of their Chennai home (which has  relatively been spared from being affected by the floods) to neighbouring slum-dwellers! Being away from Chennai, he has made sure all proper arrangements are in place, under the direct supervision of his wife, Aruna.  Despite having a toddler son and an elderly father-in-law, she is making sure that food and other necessities have been provided to the people sheltered there, including 2 pregnant women! Truly an humble and noble act done by the couple. They could have been indifferent but they chose to be different.
