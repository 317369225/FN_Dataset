What was a regional movie broadcasted in DD1 (India, not in South India or Hindi) which has the below story?Â  Story: a lady goes to a forest in search of a beautiful flower and she hires a small boy and finally at the end of the movie she finds the flower on the top of the tree. It was broadcasted in 1993.
I think it's BETTADA HOOVU (Kannada Movie).
