Where are the best tree top walks in the world?
The Central Catchment Nature Reserve Park in Singapore has a nice tree top walk. This trail takes you to the TreeTop Walk, a 250mlong freestanding suspension bridge between the two highest points in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (MacRitchie) and the first of its kind in Singapore. From the suspension bridge, you can delight in having a birdâ€™s eye view of the forest canopy and try to spot different wildlife in their natural habitat. You can also enjoy panoramic views of the verdant greenery of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve and the placid waters of the Upper Peirce Reservoir.
