How do tall trees lift water to their top leaves and just how high can this process manage?
Water in a gravel bucket will climb only a few mm up the rocks. Water in a sand bucket will climb from the bottom of the bucket all the way to the top.  The smaller the spaces, the further in can climb. Water in the spaces in solid concrete can provide enough water pressure to be a problem several floors above the ground. So the tiny vessels in a tree stem can wick the water up to substantial heights. Water transport can be a limiting factor for lots of trees.  If you look at max heights by species, you find a big clump around 80 feet, then another big clump around 200 feet.  Then you have the sequoia and the redwoods.  For a long time researchers were puzzled -- they couldn't come up with a mechanism to haul the water that far up.  Last time I read, the theory was fog harvest.  These trees depend on the fog condensing on their leaves and twigs for a large part of their water supply.  If that is true, then this may limit their growth in other locations.
