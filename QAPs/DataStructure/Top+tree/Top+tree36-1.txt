What are the best family tree websites?
I have been looking into my family tree for quite a few years on my own and found that that asking my family to add to the tree on Geni.com really worked well. It's good because family members can 'claim' their entry in the tree and add the bits they know. Unlike something like Ancestry no one person owns the tree. In fact I think the point is to create one global family tree. I think some of my family now log into it more than me - especially to check birthdays. There are of course privacy restrictions in place so only limited circles of family can see all the details of close family and living persons. I've only really used the free basic package and never actually paid for the premium services like matches ( apart from on the free trial). So yes I would recommend it for multiple members of family all adding to the one tree.
