If I found what I suspected to be a foreign nations drone, let's say snagged in a tree top on my property. Who should I call to report it?
Unless you live near the coastline of your nation (assuming it has a coastline) or relatively near a border area (within 10-20 miles) it's a virtual certainty that the drone wasn't being operated by a foreign power. Most drones simply lack the range necessary for them to launched from one nation and then travel to another one. Even if the drone has markings or writing in a language not commonly spoken in your nation, it is almost certainly a privately owned device, rather than something launched by a state-level actor.this is because a state-level actor would have used a very robust and expensive vehicle,whose electronics package would have included a GPS tracking that would have allowed it's operators to locate and retrieve it before you discovered it. Unless the drone is clearly of expensive manufacture or you are approached by suspicious people demanding its return (in which case I would suggest contacting the FBI office in your area if you are in the US) I would either keep the drone in a storage area or simply throw it away. If the owner hasn't retrieved it, then they either no longer want it or they don't know where it crash landed.
