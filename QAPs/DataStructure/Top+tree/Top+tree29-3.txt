Which trees grow the best in the desert?
I am not sure where you are trying to head with this.  I am not aware of any trees that grow in deserts.  Technically, by the time you can see trees, you are no longer in the desert. You may then ask what about at the Oasis?  These pockets are the exceptions within a desert area (but they are not part of the desert, the demarcation of where the Oasis ends and the desert starts is quite clear and distinct). These days very few people refer to the proper technical terms - the areas where we see some kind of plant growing is usually called "Semi-arid areas" - and again these are not the desert proper.
