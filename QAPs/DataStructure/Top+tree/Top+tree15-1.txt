What are your favourite Porcupine Tree lyrics?
"This song leaks out onto the pavement It could be a joke, it could be a statement The more that I fake it and pretend I don't care The more you can read in to what isn't there Maybe it's time to stop swimming Maybe it's time to find out where I'm at What I should do and where I should be But no-one will give me a map I'll leave now this can't continue But I forget which door I came through And I know what the lift can be painfully slow So I'm happy to leave by the window" ---Stop Swimming. "My David don't you worry This cold world is not for you So rest your head upon me I have strength to carry you" down to the valley below You know Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul Come to us Lazarus It's time for you to go" ---Lazarus (All hail Steven Wilson.)
