Have there been any cultures that live in tree-top villages like the Ewoks?
Yes.  In Irian Jaia there are some well documented communities of natives that have lived in some very detailed homes high in palm trees.  National Geographic (I think) did a very interesting DVD about the history of the people as well as some of the details of their culture.  Having said that, I'm not personally familiar with Ewoks so I'm relating what I saw on the DVD.
