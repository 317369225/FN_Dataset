What were the best movies of 2011 and why?
Moneyball "There are rich teams and there are poor teams, then there's fifty-feet of crap, and then there's us."   Although slightly different from the Michael Lewis novel (Moneyball), writer Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) is able to make this movie about Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and how he turns a cash strapped baseball franchise (Oakland A's) into a contender by employing sabermetrics. Jonah Hill plays his best (and most serious) role to date and Philip Seymour Hoffman is grumpy, adament, yet terrific as always. Brad Pitt will no doubt get an Oscar nomination.
