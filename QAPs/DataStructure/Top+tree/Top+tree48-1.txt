What is the weather like in St. Louis, MO?
We have all four seasons, too cold and windy; too short a Spring; too hot and humid; and too short a Fall. There are truly as few as ten perfect days per year, where the Sun is out, humidity low; temperature is 70 to 80, and a slight breeze. The good news is that the winter actually is sometimes mild, when it gets into the 60s midwinter, and there are never more than five snows, never more than six inches, and it melts in 24 hours. But, of course, every ten years we get a winter with a rain/freeze that makes roads not drivable, tens of thousands of topped trees and three day power outages, possibly two one-foot snow falls that don't melt for three or four weeks. Additional good news is that some years, the temperatures don't break 100 and the humidity is tolerable. But, we have had a July/August period of 20 consecutive days of 103-106. The problem is that, unlike many towns on the Eastern seaboard where it drops thirty degrees at night, it is not uncommon in St. Louis to drop from 106 at 3 PM to a low of only 92 at 4AM. The worst part is the roads. Except for major arterial roads, the City of St. Louis had a "no plow rule" for several decades, making it very difficult to get out of your neighborhood, although the policy may have changed this year. Every minor snow, and even rain, causes massive traffic jams, partly because there have never been enough bridges, and some major interstate entrance ramps have always had too few lanes and too tight a turning radius.
