Why do birds do what they do? There is this bird that sits on top of light post by my house every single day and chirps the same thing all day. Then at night he does the same thing from a tree. This goes on for hours and its been happening for months.
He's staking out his territory most likely, or trying to attract a mate.Â  Biologically, that's the goal of life, to reproduce, so he's just doing as his genes dictate him to do.
