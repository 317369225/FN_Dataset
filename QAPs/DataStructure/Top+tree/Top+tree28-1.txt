What are some of the best soothing songs by Porcupine Tree?
Different people may feel differently about what is "soothing", but I'll go with e.g.: Russia on Ice, The Sound of Muzak, Lazarus, Heart Attack in a Lay-by, Collapse the Light Into the Earth, The Rest Will Flow, Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before it is Recycled, Time Flies.
