Why do all Christmas tree top angels have blonde hair?
Maybe because when some people think of a witch, dark or red hair comes to mind first. Angels are thought of coming from the light so, there for light hair. When some people think of a goddess or a good witch (like from "The Wizard of Oz") blonde hair comes to mind first.
