Gardening:Â What are the best interior trees?
Interior trees require at least 6 hours of filtered light per day, which, in many rooms, is hard to come by. When you see trees and other light-hungry plants in buildings, it's likely that a plant service cares for and swaps out the plants to keep them healthy-looking. In home-style magazines, the plants may be placed by designers, and don't even grow in the pictured rooms at all. The best way to choose trees for your interior space is by the amount of light you can provide in a given location. If I had the light, I'd grown a Meyer lemon tree or a gardenia (below). A weeping fig, sometimes called a ficus tree, can tolerate less light than many broadleaf indoor trees. They hate to be moved, however, so pick the spot carefully. For beginners, and for rooms with less than optimum light, I highly recommend the Norfolk pine. It's extremely hardy, fast growing, and gorgeous. We use ours for a Christmas tree:
