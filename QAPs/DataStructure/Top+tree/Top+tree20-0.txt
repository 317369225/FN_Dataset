What is the best bonsai tree for amateurs?
The answer to this question can vary significantly. In general terms, Ficus bonsai trees (indoor) and easy to grow and care for. Junipers (outdoor) are also popular and easy to care for. The answer depends on your location (e.g. light, temperature, indoor vs. outdoor, time commitment, etc.). For an indoor tree, i would recommend a Ficus, Jade, or Umbrella tree. These are our most popular trees sold on our website. Hope this helps a little.
