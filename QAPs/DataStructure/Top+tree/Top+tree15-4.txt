What are your favourite Porcupine Tree lyrics?
It's impossible for me to nominate only one song as my favourite in terms of lyrics. Most of the good ones have already been mentioned - Drown With Me, Arriving Somewhere.... But Not Here, I Drive the Hearse, Fear of a Blank Planet, How Is Your Life Today, Open Car, Piano Lessons, Stop Swimming etc. But a few others definitely deserve mention - Buying New Soul, Blackest Eyes, Prodigal, Stranger by the Minute, The Sound of Muzak; and especially, Time Flies, Trains and Anesthetize. But the first time I looked at this question, I was reminded of the early days of Porcupine Tree, when Alan Duffy was the main lyricist, and two specific songs came to my mind : It Will Rain for a Million Years I locked myself inside the capsule And watched the planet slowly turning blue The lights before me flashed and sparkled Holding keys to lives I've wandered through Circuits buzzing, visions passing Mysterious and cold upon the screen Glowing, flowing with the currents Yet never knowing where I've really been The floating seeds of timeless travel Come to rest in planes that don't exist Visiting worlds of crystal beauty Offering dreams so very hard to resist I've seen the past, I've seen the future Beyond dimension and into empty space Finding questions, never answers Living time behind another face   Nine Cats The butterfly sailed on the breeze Past a field of barbed wire trees Where golden dragons chased around Pampered poppies on the ground Two silver trout sat way on high And watched a royal samurai Plant two black orchids in a box And strap it to a laughing fox A minstrel bought a crooked spoon He gave it to a blue baboon Who filled it full of virgin snow And watched it in the afterglow Fat toad stood in his ballet shoes Teaching sixteen kangaroos How to skip across a lake They found it hard to stay awake A pharaoh played a merry tune And watched nine cats dance on the moon I didn't know what all this meant I didn't know why I'd been sent. I threw 5 clocks down on my bed The chimes danced out on golden threads And turned to footprints on my wall Sequined tears began to fall While the first one enthralls me with its ethereal quality, Nine Cats is a special song that makes want to laugh and cry at the same time.
