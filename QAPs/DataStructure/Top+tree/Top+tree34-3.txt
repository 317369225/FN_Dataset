What is the best free genealogy software?
I am a genealogy programmer, and I also know professionals who recommend Legacy Family Tree.  They have a free version, and it is all you need.  It is not a trial -- it is simply free.  They have a delux version for $30, but the free version is really all you need. Here is the site: http://www.legacyfamilytreestore... I used to buy genealogy programs like candy since I was a consultant for software companies.  This program seems easy to use while including a lot of cool tools for making charts and books, etc. This works in Windows; I understand they are working on a Mac version.
