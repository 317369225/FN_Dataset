Which trees grow the best in the desert?
Can't really answer a question like this because there's so much information missing. Most important, what part of the world are you thinking about? What are the climate particulars of the desert you have in mind - soil, temperatures, elevation, amount of moisture? What size of tree did you have in mind? And so on... As a generalization, trees in the genera Eucalyptus, Acacai, and Cassia are frequently found in desert areas, but there are many other tree-like plants that can be found in different desert areas around the world. For instance, Norm's Favorite Desert Trees and Sun Gardens, Inc. are just two articles from a google search that have a number of trees listed.
