What is the most humane deed you have ever witnessed?
Aitzaz Hasan Shaheed. It was an ordinary January morning in Hangu district and around 2000 students were attending morning assembly in Ibrahimzai High School, Hangu, Pakistan when a blast occurred outside the school. But luckily everyone was saved by the courage of a 17 year old boy Aitzaz Hasan. According to the sources he was on his way to school along with his two other class fellows when he saw a 20-25 year old man going towards the school. They all saw the suicide vest that the man was wearing. Aitzaz tackled the bomber, who then detonated his vest. Aitzaz died in hospital later that day. His courage saved the lives of thousands of students. His father made a very humble statement about the death of his son "My son made his mother cry, but saved hundreds of mothers from crying for their children," Aitzaz Hasan http://www.bbc.com/news/world-as...
