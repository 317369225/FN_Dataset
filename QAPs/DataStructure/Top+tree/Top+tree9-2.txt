If I found what I suspected to be a foreign nations drone, let's say snagged in a tree top on my property. Who should I call to report it?
In general, you can call your local police department's business phone number for matters which are not an immediate emergency. They may tell you to call back on a 911 line (for what I assume are budget reasons, they sometimes channel non-emergency activity through 911 because its how the dispatch system will connect you to the correct person). Alternatively, you can stop by and explain the situation in person. They will know how to hand the information off to another organization if they think it's appropriate.
