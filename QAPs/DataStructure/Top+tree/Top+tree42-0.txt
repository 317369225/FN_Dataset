What is the best way to get rid of tree roots?
I think Aaron has the best idea for getting rid of the tree roots in your yard.    Depending on the location & size of the tree roots, the stump grinder can make very short work of the larger roots.  In some cases however, there is no solution other than shear brute force and the axe and mattock come into play.         I have removed my share of large tree roots.  The surface ones are fairly easy to deal with but the deep ones will need to be axed out by hand!!  It will be time to put on your gloves, sharpen your axe & mattock, and go to work!!
