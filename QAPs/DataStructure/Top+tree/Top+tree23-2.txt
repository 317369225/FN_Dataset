What are some good tutorials on segment trees?
Edit: I felt bad for answering a question only with a line, so here is a longer one: I recently wrote a blog article on this matter, and I believe it has a  nice implementation (without 5 parameters and 70 lines of code). The  main idea is that instead of using recursion to build and rebuild the  tree, we use simple loops. This is memory-efficient and way easier to  code. For example the whole build function is one line, and you can  have direct access to the elements. It is basically the same idea but a  different style of coding. void build() {   for(int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) t[i] = t[i<<1] + t[i<<1|1]; } You can read the article for the rest of code.
