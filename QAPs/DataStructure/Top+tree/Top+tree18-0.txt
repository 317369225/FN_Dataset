Gardening:Â What are the best interior trees?
I have a palm in my house, which actually I feel somewhat bad about because I'll need to get rid of it soon. Palms just get taller and taller, and you cannot prune them. Eventually, they will outgrow the height of your ceiling. My ceilings are over 12 feet tall, so my palm is quite large. It's generally difficult to transplant them outside although I would recommend trying if possible. It's very easy to care for indoors. I just water it when I remember to. I also like fig trees. They're a good size for most interiors and it's unlikely they'll outgrow your ceiling. Some are quite large, others smaller, so just pick one that's appropriate.
