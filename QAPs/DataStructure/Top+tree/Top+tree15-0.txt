What are your favourite Porcupine Tree lyrics?
"Arriving somewhere but not here" Could you imagine the final sound as a gun Or the smashing windscreen of a car Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song? ... Ever thought that from here on in your life begins and all you knew was wrong? P Tree is a band that should be known for its ethereal multilayered sounds, amazing vocals (All hail Steven Wilson!) and progressive tone. Then come the lyrics.
