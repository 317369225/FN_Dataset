There is a saying "A man is seated on top of a tree in the midst of a burning forest. He sees all living beings perish. But he doesn't realize that the same fate is soon to overtake him also. That man is fool." Applies to Indian political leaders?
I don't think this applies to the majority. That day is not far when Indian will see a mass political upheaval. There is only so much that the Indian mass can bear. Not everyone is blind or deaf or dumb.
