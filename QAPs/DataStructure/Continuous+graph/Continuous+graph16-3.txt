Mathematical Fallacies: How does one explain the “π = 4” proof regarding a square reduced to a circle?
Originally Answered: Is π=4  ?All the answers given agree with mine. However, I shall try to put it in a slightly formal way. Let us look at the problem, we have a sequence of curves f n (x)  which, in the limiting case look like a given curve g(x)  . The precise statement of 'looks like" is f n (x)→g(x)  as n tends to ∞  ........(1) Well, with this we expect the lengths to be equal. However, lengths of a curves are ∫f ′ n (x) 2 +1 − − − − − − − −  √ dx  and the length of the given curve is ∫g ′ (x) 2 +1 − − − − − − − −  √ dx  These two would have been equal if f ′ n (x)→g ′ (x)  as n tends to ∞  , which does not follow from (1). In fact, f ′ n (x)  takes only two values, 0 and ∞  , alternatively, and is undefined at some points. Hence there is no reason for the curves to be of nearly equal lengths, just because they nearly "look like" each other. What can be certainly claimed is that the areas under them are equal, since area is ∫g(x)dx  , which depends only on g(x). In fact, we could use the area to estimate the value of π  . Calculate the areas of the sequence of curves, and equate the limit to the area of the circle. Updated 14 Oct 2012 • View Upvotes
