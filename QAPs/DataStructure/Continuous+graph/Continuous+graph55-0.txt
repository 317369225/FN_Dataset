Is there any combinatorics research done in sets with continuous domains/ranges?
Most combinatorics is not concerned with such sets, but some combinatorics problems do fall under this description.  For instance, consider the following problem: Let G be the graph whose underlying set is the real plane R 2   , such that two points in the plane are connected by an edge if their distance is 1.  What is the chromatic number of this graph? While it is possible to give reasonable lower and upper bounds for the answer of this question, the exact answer is currently unknown.  By a "compactness" principle, this question reduces to a question about finite subgraphs of the unit distance plane, and so it truly is a "combinatorial" and not an "analytic" question, even though it apparently involves continuous objects.
