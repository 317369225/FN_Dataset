What is the antiderivative of sin(x 2 )  ?
∫sinx 2 dx  is a nonelementary integral. That means there is no antiderivative of  sinx 2   that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. The antiderivative does exist, however, since sinx 2   is continuous. Here's its graph. One way to deal with nonelementary integrals is to express them as power series.  The power series for sinx  is well known:     sinx=x−x 3 3! +x 5 5! −x 7 7! +x 9 9! −⋯  Substitute x 2   for x  to get the power series for sinx 2   :     sinx 2 =x 2 −x 6 3! +x 10 5! −x 14 7! +x 18 9! −⋯  If you only take the terms shown before the ellipsis, you'll get a 18th degree polynomial that's a very good approximation for numbers x  between −1  and 1  , but diverges from sinx 2   for x  beyond ±2  . It's graphed in red below. You can integrate power series term by term, and that means it's easy to find their integrals.     ∫sinx 2 dx=x 3 3 −x 7 7(3!) +x 11 11(5!) −x 15 15(7!) +x 19 19(9!) −⋯  The 19th degree polynomial is a very good approximation for the antiderivative for numbers x  between −1  and 1  . For numbers beyond that range, you would need more terms of the series.
