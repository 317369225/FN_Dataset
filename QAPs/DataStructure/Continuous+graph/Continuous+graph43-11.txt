What is a great way to learn math and computer science concurrently (ideally with one helping another)?Or learning how to program and thinking mathematically at the same time. Engage math in learning how to code and vice versa. I love coding. I feel like I'll be much better at math if I use math a lot in coding. I'm interested in both programming and computer science. I'm looking for solutions when all of it is explicitly tied together.
Calculus and Matrix lectures can be taken from youtube. KhanAcademy will be enough resource for these two. Probability is key for every computer scientist and you can start and improve your skills with a book called 'Probability and Statistics for engineers' by Walpole,Myers,Ye. Then you can continue with online courses from Coursera on algorithms to learn discrete math, graph theory etc. And a quick note, math is the key which makes computer programs beautiful :)
