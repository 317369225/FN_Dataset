How do the conditions for continuity differ from the conditions for differentiability for mathematical functions?Thank you!
In order to be differentiable, a function must be continuous AND must not contain a sharp turn or oscillate at that point. For example, consider the functions f(x)=|2x| and g(x)=sin(1/x) F(x) makes a sharp turn at x=0. It is still continuous at that point, but it is not differentiable, as you could draw several different tangent lines at that point. G(x) oscillates near the origin, and so it is not defferentiable at x=0 even though the function is continuous at that point.
