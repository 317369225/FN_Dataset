What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
Cauchy's Integral Formula : From wiki Cauchy's integral formula Suppose U is an open subset of the complex plane C, f : U → C is a holomorphic function and the closed disk D = { z : | z − z0| ≤ r} is completely contained in U. Let be the circle forming the boundary of D. Then for every a in the interior of D: where the contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. A number of non-intuitive results can be derived such as ∫ inf 0 sin(x 2 )=∫ inf 0 cos(x 2 )=2π  √ 4   ∫ inf 0 sinxx =π2 ]  Complex numbers are very useful Complex numbers are like ghosts; if you assume they exist, it becomes much easier to explain some very unusual things that happens :-). Although it is not a mathematical result per se, yet I find complex numbers as one of the most counter-intuitive mathematical objects.  Complex numbers have aided to our understanding of a number of things such as Fourier transform, signal processing, information theory, electrical machines, wave equations, quantum mechanics (including above integral formula ) i.e. almost all of modern science. However, to explain any thign using complex numbers is almost as good as saying,  here is a ghost with all these properties, you can't see him, you can't touch him, he doesn't have a shape or size and yeah, he caused that amazing phenomenon and went away.
