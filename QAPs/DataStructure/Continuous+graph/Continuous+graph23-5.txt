What is any number raise to the power of infinity? What is any number divided by infinity?
Well, there are a few things to consider here: If the number is positive and greater than one, then as we raise it to higher and higher positive powers, the result keeps on increasing and tends to infinity as the power tends to infinity. If the number is raised to lower and lower powers tending to negative infinity,  the result tends to zero If the number is positive and lesser than one, the opposite happens: result tends to zero as the power tends to positive infinity and the result tends to positive infinity as the power tends to negative infinity If the numbr is negative, nothing can be said with certainty. You don't get a continuous graph which will help you predict anything If any number is divided progressively by larger and larger positive numbers,  or smaller and smaller negative numbers, so that the denominator tends to positive or negative infinity,  the result approaches zero "Dividing by infinity" is a wrong concept. You can never get your hands on an infinite number. You can only approach negative or positive infinity,  but you can never really get there
