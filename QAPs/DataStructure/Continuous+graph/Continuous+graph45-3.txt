Why is f(x)=xsin(1x )  continuous but nondifferentiable at x=0  ?I found this question in a course. I've tried to explain it using the quotient rule but it didn't work. Is there a way to prove it with the quotient rule or does the quotient rule get you nowhere?
By theory, a function can be continuous but not differentiable. Simply put, Continuity of a function is expressed 'whether you had to lift your pen at some point while drawing the entire graph'....if you could plot the entire function in its domain in one single go, it is continuous. Whereas, Differentiability is the measure of gradient or curve. Simply put, 'the change in the direction of curve should be smooth,ie,defined at every single point.' Consider yourself driving a car, you have to measure directions with a compass. In reality, however sharp turns you take, you will always be able to measure a direction at some pt of time. Now, imagine a triangular apex, If you could hypothetically, turn exactly at the apex, forming a V,Your direction at the apex would be not defined! You will still be on the road( continuous) but at some pt you will not be able to tell your direction ( gradient not defined ) ! By mathematics,On Differentiating we get... Sin(1/x) -Cos(1/x)/x At x =0 or rather we should say as x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity. Sin(infinity) is not defined as it oscillates b/w 1 and -1.. Hence, differential does not exist.
