Does Twitter continue with its "entire-graph-on-one-machine" design for the WTF (Whom to Follow) service?
To expand on Reza's answer and presented by me in a couple of talks, it was an intentional decision to go the route of an "entire-graph-in-one-machine" architecture for version one of the who-to-follow system. We knew when this was going to run out of steam and planned well in advance to evolve into Hadoop-based version two. To answer the second part of your question, a completely in-memory solution is unquestionably way more efficient (in money, resources, time) than a distributed solution, provided a single-memory solution works for your problem size. Hadoop (MapReduce) in particular is known to be pretty bad at complex graph computations. Current crop of solutions (such as Giraph, GraphLab, etc.) were much less mature at the time we moved to Hadoop for our second version.
