What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
∫ 1 0 x 3 −1lnx dx  When I first saw this, I was flummoxed. How do I go about solving this? Do I go at it by parts? Tried by parts for an hour, progressively getting messier each time. And getting more frustrated every time. I gave no more thought to it until one day, while reading "Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman", I came across: That book also showed how to differentiate parameters under the integral sign— it's a certain operation. It turns out that's not taught very much in the  universities; they don't emphasize it. But I caught on how to use that  method, and I used that one damn tool again and again. So because I was self-taught using that book, I had peculiar methods of doing integrals. I don't know why I thought back to that problem at this point. But it was just a burst of exhilaration when I realised that the 3 (in x 3   ) could be replaced by a general variable (say p) and the integral could be treated as a function of p (say F(p)) which could then be differentiated wrt p under the integral sign. That would get rid of the annoying ln(x) in the denominator! And so I proceeded to find F ′ (p)=1p+1   . So, F(p)=ln(p+1)+C  . All I needed now was C, which I saw could be found by putting p = 0 in the the original integral. So, F(0) = 0. This gave me C = 0. Now, I just needed to put p = 3 and I was done! It was fucking amazing! Updated 31 May 2014 • View Upvotes
