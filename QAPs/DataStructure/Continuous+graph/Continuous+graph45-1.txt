Why is f(x)=xsin(1x )  continuous but nondifferentiable at x=0  ?I found this question in a course. I've tried to explain it using the quotient rule but it didn't work. Is there a way to prove it with the quotient rule or does the quotient rule get you nowhere?
Let me explain in general way: Reason for continuity "Continuity of a function is expressed 'whether you had to lift your pen at some point while drawing the entire graph'....if you could plot the entire function in its domain in one single go, it is continuous."(As Vibhor Sharma mentioned ) Reason of non differentiability :This function can be defined and nice, but it wiggles so much as to have no derivative. So, the graph of f(x) = x * sin(1/x) continuous but non differentiable at x = 0. P.S. This explanation is not purely based on mathematics. P.S.S. These funde ( tricks) I learnt during my JEE preparation. P.S.S.S. Try at x=.05
