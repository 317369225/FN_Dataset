Without looking at the graph, how does one know x=0 is the only possible discontinuity for |x|?
If course the absolute value function is continuous everywhere, but the question is "how do you know"? If you know that polynomials are continuous, then you know both x  and −x  are continuous everywhere.  In particular x  is continuous on the interval (0,∞)  , and |x|=x  on (0,∞)  , so |x|  is continuous on (0,∞)  . Using the continuity of −x  on the interval (−∞,0)  , you can show |x|  is also continuous there. That leaves only continuity of |x|  at 0  in question. Second question: How is "|0|=0" a reason for proving the continuity at x=0  by showing the limit is 0? First show that the limit as x→0  from the right is 0, then show the limit as x→0  from the left is 0, and since the two limits are the same as the value of |x|  at x=0  , therefore |x|  is continuous there. (There's another way to see |x|  is continuous at 0.  It's right continuous since it agrees with x  which is right continuous, and it's left continuous since it agrees with −x  which is left continuous. Therefore it's continuous.)
