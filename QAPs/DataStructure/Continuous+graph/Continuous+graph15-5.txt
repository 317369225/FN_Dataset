Assuming a straight graph, if the current growth of atheism in the West continues, versus the decline in practicing Christian believers, how long until the religion as we know it is wiped out?By the Christian religion as we know it I mean Sunday church attendance, an influence on law, being listed as the majority religion in national censuses, that sort of thing. Having said that I'd be interested to know if anyone thinks it will ever go the way of the ancient religions and disappear entirely as a serious faith, given over to the increase of scientific discovery.
