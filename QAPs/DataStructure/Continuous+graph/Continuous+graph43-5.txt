What is a great way to learn math and computer science concurrently (ideally with one helping another)?Or learning how to program and thinking mathematically at the same time. Engage math in learning how to code and vice versa. I love coding. I feel like I'll be much better at math if I use math a lot in coding. I'm interested in both programming and computer science. I'm looking for solutions when all of it is explicitly tied together.
I agree with Andrea Ferro that functional programming is an excellent discipline that teaches one to think in a way that is simultaneously mathematical and computational.  I'd like to throw in an excellent article by Dijkstra on  Programming as a discipline of mathematical nature (EWD 361). His description of the relationship between mathematics and programming is excellent, and though written in 1973, I think it is highly relevant now for the future of math education.
