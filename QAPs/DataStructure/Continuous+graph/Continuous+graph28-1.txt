Is it normal for weather to repeat daily patterns?Centre of an average size island.
In the Philippines during rainy season this is very possible. 3 years ago in Manila it rained almost every day in July for nearly a month. One day of sun in that month. I thought I was going to commit suicide, good thing my girlfriend moved in with me so I had someone to complain to.
