If f(x)  is a continuous function satisfying f(x)=f(2x)  for all real x  , then is it necessarily a constant function?If so, how do we prove it? And if not, any counter examples?
EDIT: It turns out that I severely over-complicated my answer! That's what I get for trying to do math during the night... Although it does not create regularly shaped cosine periods, the following function is much more simple and is actually differentiable when x does not equal zero. f(x)=cos(2πln|x|/ln2)  The reason that the above function works is because trig functions overflow in the sense that the cos(x)=cos(x+2nπ)  for all integers n  . The function I derived below does extra work in ensuring that cosine's input is in the range [0,2π]  , among other unnecessary additions. ... No, f(x)=f(2x)  does not necessarily have to be a constant function IF you allow f  to be discontinuous at x=0  . Keep reading for a further explanation. If f(x)=f(2x)  , that also means that f(2x)=f(4x)  . It logically follows that f(x)=f(2 n ⋅x)  . By this definition, we realize that we just need to write a periodic function such that the length of each period is twice the length of the last. The function below fits this definition, although it is not continuous: Let's call the above function g(x)  . If we can somehow manipulate g(x)  to be continuous, then we must be able to write a continuous function f(x)  because g(x)=g(2x)  . One of the simplest ways to make g(x)  continuous is by the use of a trig function. If we make the height of each period of g(x)  range from [0,2π]  , then we can simply take the cosine the transformed function to make it continuous. (We could take the sine of the function instead because the entire data set is positive, but it makes more sense to use cosine because it is an even function.) f(x)=g(cos(2πx))  Now we have a continuous (though not differentiable) function satisfying the requirement that f(x)=f(2x)  . Now, the remaining question is how to derive g(x)  . Notice that g(x)  is simply composed of many lines, starting with a height of 0  at x=2 n   and ending with a height of 1  at x=2 n+1   for all integer values of n  . To be more precise, the value of the function g(x)  approaches 1  at x=2 n+1   , but never reaches it because, to be a function, g(x)  must equal 0  at x=2 n+1   . n+1  is simply another integer value of n  . The function of g(x)  must follow the general format g(x)=slope⋅displacement  . Now, lets solve for each portion of the equation. The slope  along any period of g(x)  must be equal to the rise of g  over the length of the period. The rise is always equal to 1  , but the run differs based on the period. slope=1period   We can define the length of any period to be 2 n+1 −2 n   for any period n  . With this definition of period length, our expression indicating the slope  becomes the following: slope=12 n+1 −2 n    Now that we've defined the slope  (at least in terms of n  ), we must define the displacement  . This must be equal to x−2 n   because we want to transform the line to the right enough so that the period begins with a height of 0. With this addition, we have almost fully defined g(x)  . All that is left to define is the value of n  , which is an integer referring to the period number, in terms of x  . g(x)=(12 n+1 −2 n  )⋅(x−2 n )  We want n  to refer to the period of the graph such that the period ranging from [1,2]  is the zeroth period. As we move right on the graph, the periods should double in length as we approach infinity. As we move left, the periods should halve in length as we approach zero. This clearly resembles the properties of a logarithmic function, specifically one of base 2. To ensure a constant reported period length, we must apply the floor function (also known as the greatest integer function) to the value of the logarithm. n=⌊log 2 x⌋  As you can see, the period maintains its index number for the entire length of the period. One question that may come up is why must [1,2]  be defined as n=0  . Using our previous length equation, we can show that the length of this range equals 1  , as it should, when n=0  , so ⌊log 2 x⌋  must equal 0  when x∈[1,2]  . Substituting the value of n  into our previous equation of g(x)  , we get the following: g(x)=(12 ⌊log 2 x⌋+1 −2 ⌊log 2 x⌋  )⋅(x−2 ⌊log 2 x⌋ )  Notice that, because of the use of logarithms in the equation, g(x)  is not defined for any negative real numbers. To fix this, we will replace all occurrences of x  with |x|  , the absolute value of x. g(x)=(12 ⌊log 2 |x|⌋+1 −2 ⌊log 2 |x|⌋  )⋅(|x|−2 ⌊log 2 |x|⌋ )  We have finally arrived at the original function of g(x)  which we were attempting to derive, in which g(x)=g(2x)  . If we plus our new definition of g(x)  into f(x)=g(cos(2πx))  , we get the following: f(x)=cos((2π2 (⌊log 2 |x|⌋)+1 −2 ⌊log 2 |x|⌋  )  ⋅(|x|−2 ⌊log 2 |x|⌋ ))  While that definition of f(x)  satisfies the requirements of f(x)=f(2x)  , there are surely many other possible equations that do this too. As long as the function is periodic with increasing period lengths (at the correct rate of course), it will satisfy the requirement f(x)=f(2x)  . Though this does seem to answer the question, it was pointed out by Ben Zax that my answer is not defined at x=0  because the logarithm of zero is undefined. We can modify the function to define zero as cos(0)  , which would seemingly make the graph continuous (after all, it is basically just a cosine function), but Ben Zax pointed out that "there are points arbitrarily close to 0 which have values significantly different from 1, "indicating that you cannot say that the value of the function approaches 1 as x approaches zero. So while this does not completely fulfill the requirements as a continuous function, I does come very close if you simply disregard the fact that it is undefined at x=0  . Even though it does not completely fix the problem, I would like to try to modify this function so it is defined at x=0  , even if just to make x defined for all real number. To prevent f  from being undefined at x=0  , we must somehow detect when x=0  and modify the input into the logarithms. When x=0  we want x  to act is it was some other multiple of 2 n   , where n  is an integer. As I said earlier, we are sort of arbitrarily defining zero to be cos(0)  because the limit, as x approaches zero, is undefined. For this reason, defining zero does not make it truly continuous. We must define x to equal some other multiple of 2 n   when x is supposed to equal zero, and we can arbitrarily choose any value of 2 n   because every value of n should result in the same value of f  . In this case, I'll choose n=0  such that 2 n =2 0 =1  . z(x)={x,1, if x≠0if x=0   By replacing all instances of x in our equation with z(x), we eliminate the problem of an undefined zero. Rather than using a piecewise function, however, I would like to define z(x)  another way. To create a non-piecewise function of z  , we must first create a function that returns a value of 1 if and only if x=0. To do this, we can manipulate an c x   function. In this case, I'll just choose Euler's number, e  , although its not particularly important. If we notice ⌊e x ⌋  returns zero for all negative numbers, we can manipulate it to form ⌊e −|x| ⌋  , which returns zero for all values of x in which x≠0  . Utilizing this, we can form the following function, which returns results identical to our piecewise definition of z  . z(x)=⌊e −|x| ⌋+x  Because ⌊e −|x| ⌋  is always positive, the absolute value of z  is simply the absolute value of the second term, x  , of z  . |z(x)|=⌊e −|x| ⌋+|x|  From here, we simply plug this definition of |z|  into f  in place of any |x|  . f(x)=cos(2π/  (2 ⌊log 2 (⌊e −|x| ⌋+|x|)⌋+1 −2 ⌊log 2 (⌊e −|x| ⌋+|x|)⌋ ))  ⋅(⌊e −|x| ⌋+|x|−2 ⌊log 2 (⌊e −|x| ⌋+|x|)⌋ ))  It might not be the most elegant solution, but it works! Again, I'd like to reiterate that simply defining x=0  does not make this function continuous because the limit as the function approaches zero is undefined (because of the ever increasing frequency of the wave). Nevertheless, a function similar to the one above is as close as you're going to get to a continuous function that fits the parameter f(x)=f(2x)  . Updated 12 May 2013 • View Upvotes
