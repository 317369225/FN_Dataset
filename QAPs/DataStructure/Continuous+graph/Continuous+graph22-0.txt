My academic grades have fallen continuously. I had a 90% in X, an 80% in XII and then a 67% in BTech. How can I justify this situation to my interviewer when asked about such a deteriorating graph?
Imagine you meet me on the street and I suddenly remember you from Quora(although you've asked this question anonymously) and invite you to grab a drink in a pub. We're at our 4th drink and I couldn't stop talking about myself, so I realize that and I ask you how is your life. You hesitate for a moment and are ready to tell me the same crappy story 'I'm fine, doing this, doing that', but then you decide to take a shot and tell me about your problem. I want to interrupt you, because after all, you started to tell a crappy story, because this is not your life, this is just a small matter, but something tells me that is important to you, so I'm going to sit there quiet and listen to what you have to say. You start your story and suddenly you're starting to become full of shit and I'm like 'wtf!? what is this crap!? tell me what happened, man!'. Now, the difference between me, the interviewer and me, the random guy from the street, is that the interviewer will nod along and let you finish your story. The random guy on the other hand, will stop you right there and will tell you that he doesn't need to hear another lie today, so he'll pay his drink and get the hell out of there! The guy who just left is mad because you decided to lie to yourself! Stop doing that! Ever! It is a reason why this happened! Analyze your situation by yourself and repeat that untill you come up with an explanation. But, it HAS to be true! C'mon, I can't believe I'm telling someone what once, when this someone was little, another one told him/her that he/she should not lie. Grow a pair and be straight! And have gooood luck!!
