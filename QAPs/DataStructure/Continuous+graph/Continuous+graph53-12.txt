What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
It took me a while to realize that what mathematicians mean by "beauty" is what I had been calling "awesomeness". It happened when was a third-year university student taking abstract algebra. I was doing a very standard homework assignment to prove that the group of rotational symmetries of a square was isomorphic to the group {1, i, -1, -i} under complex number multiplication. I made out an operation table for the rotational group and another for the complex number group and I saw the isomorphism in the tables -- where 1 was in one group, the nonmotion was in the other group; where i was in one group, the 90-degree rotation was in the other, and so on. It was right then that it hit me what this mathematics business was all about, at least from the standpoint of algebra. While these two groups looked totally different, in the ways that mattered they were exactly the same. And if we can identify those similarities, we can begin to work with all such groups, all at the same time with a single theorem. And the beauty of mathematics is that it sees beyond the superficial to the heart of the matter, finding and making precise those connections between sometimes wildly different constructions and concepts and providing a unified approach to understanding them. That is awesome both in the slang sense and the literal sense.
