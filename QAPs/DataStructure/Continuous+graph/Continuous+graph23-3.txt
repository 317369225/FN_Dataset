What is any number raise to the power of infinity? What is any number divided by infinity?
To a mathematician your question does not make sense. Infinity is not actually a number so you can't divide by it or raise to the power of it. Infinity is the size of the set of allÂ  natural numbers which is of course infinite. Think about dividing some number by a very much larger one, the result will be a very small number,but it won't be quite zero. You can as close to zero as you wish just by making the number you divide by big enough. That is what mathematicians call a limit. You can can get as close as you wish to the limit, in this case zero, but you won't get to exactly zero. If you raise a number by bigger and bigger powers there is no limit as the result gets bigger and bigger without bound. There is no number that you can get as close to as you wish as you could in the division example.
