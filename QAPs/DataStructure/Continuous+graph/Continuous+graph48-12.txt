Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: What are some of the best studying techniques?Most of the answers provide an exhaustive list of effective studying techniques to be used. I would like to add one technique which I have discovered to be quite productive through personal experience. It's called the the "Feynman Technique" after the Nobel laureate Richard Feynman. The whole concept behind the Feynman technique is that : "If you really understand something, you should be able to explain it to a layman using simple examples and analogies". As depicted in the video, the crucial step in this technique is to make detailed notes on any topic as if you are teaching the concept to someone who doesn't understand it at all!
