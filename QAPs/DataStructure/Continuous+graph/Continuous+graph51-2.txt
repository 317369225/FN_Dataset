What are the best examples of roles where actors underwent significant physical transformations to play the part?Some examples that come to mind are Christian Bale (The Machinist and The Fighter), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Natalie Portman (Black Swan).
Tom Hanks lost something like 50 lbs. for the last half of Cast Away. But when you watch the film, it's nearly as shocking as something like Christian Bale's weight loss. http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entert...
