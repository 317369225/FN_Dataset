What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
I like Simpson's Paradox, for it's simplicity.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim... Here's an example: We'll try out two kinds of bread in sandwiches and see how many customers return for another sandwich tomorrow.  First, we'll try it with men: Wheat: 9/10 customers (90%) return tomorrow. Rye: 60/100 customers (60%) return tomorrow. So we can say that men prefer wheat. Now we'll do it again, with women: Wheat: 30/100 customers (30%) return tomorrow. Rye: 1/10 customers (10%) return tomorrow. So we can say that women prefer wheat. Let's look at the overall results though: Wheat: 39/110 customers (35%) return tomorrow. Rye: 61/110 customers (55%) return tomorrow. The result is that men prefer  wheat. Women prefer wheat. But people prefer rye. (See the Wikipedia page for some real examples.)
