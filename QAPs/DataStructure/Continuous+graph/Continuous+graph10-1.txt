Why must the base of a logarithm be positive?I'm confused by the following line in Tim Wilson's answer to How do you determine the domain and range of a logarithmic function? f 3 (x)=logx∈R  only if x∈(0,∞)  .
Having a negative base can create ambiguity. Like log 4 to base (-2) is 2( I am assuming existence of negative base) will be theoretically equal to 2. But similarly log 4 to base 2 will provide the same result that is 2. This is true for all even number solutions for the log. This ambiguity can further lead to problems when calculating the antilog also. This can be couple of reasons I can think of for why we dont use negative log bases. And the reason for range of x being positive real numbers including zero given by Robert is apt. P.S: Base of log is not always 10. It can be any positive real number except 1. Updated 27 Jul 2013
