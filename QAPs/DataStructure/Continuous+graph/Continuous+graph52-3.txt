For how long must escape velocity be maintained to escape from Earth?
In ideal conditions, Only once. If you impart escape velocity to object once, it will not return to earth because that kinetic energy is enough for that object to escape earth's gravity. But in actual things like air resistance causes the object to lose energy in the form of heat. hence the object need consistent energy pumping to it.
