What are the best examples of roles where actors underwent significant physical transformations to play the part?Some examples that come to mind are Christian Bale (The Machinist and The Fighter), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Natalie Portman (Black Swan).
Originally Answered: What actor has changed their appearance the most radically for an acting role?I agree that Christian Bale has put himself through quite a lot to embody his roles in terms of gaining and losing weight.  So did Robert DiNiro for both Raging Bull and The Untouchables.  However, changing one's self to inhabit a character also involves losing the actor so much that the character becomes foremost.  So that would include not only the ability to manipulate one's weight, but the ability to use motion, gesture, expression, speech, makeup and costumes to immerse oneself into a role.  Two masters at that kind of uncanny transformation are Dustin Hoffman and Daniel Day-Lewis.
