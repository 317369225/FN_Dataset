What is applied fuzzy logic?
The question does not really make sense. Just like conventional set theory and mathematics, Fuzzy Logic is also a mathematical discipline. Both conventional mathematics and fuzzy logic address disparate problems.           For example: Let's consider accidents taking place on NH1 highway - Conventional Mathematics : Probability of occurring of an accident Fuzzy Logic : Degree of an accident - fatality of the accident. Fuzzy Logic can be applied to specific problems - Situations where a mathematical model does not exist - eg: Go fast, there is no equation for this, i.e there is no equation/mathematical construct to program a robot to go fast. In this case conventional mathematics fails to address the problem, whereas using Fuzzy Logic, you could construct a membership function for fast using human intuition. Situations where accuracy is not required and some deviation may be accepted. This makes the system highly economical. Situations where binary logic does not produce best results. eg: Sigmoid neuron gives better results than conventional neuron in neural networks.So asking what is applied fuzzy logic is similar to asking what is applied probability, there is nothing as such, Fuzzy logic can be applied from computer science to civil engineering to electronics........ the list goes on. To have a strong fundamentals in fuzzy logic, I suggest first two chapters of- Fuzzy Logic with Engineering Applications by Timothy J Ross.
