Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: How can I study more effectively in a non-time-consuming way?I have found that using flashcards really flattened my learning curve. There are several studies that show that through scheduled repetition you retain a lot more information than just reading the same thing over and over. Sadly it doesn't work for everything, but if history is your main concern it will work just fine. About flashcards: A free and outstanding option is Anki (or Ankidroid), you can download from here:Â  Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards. The way it works is simple, you create or download a deck of cards, each one containing a question and on the "back" of the card an answer, e.g. if your studying about WWII you can write on one side "D day" and on the back the date of d day, strategies or any other fact. You should read the guide featured in the site I provided, it clearly explains how flashcards work.
