Why must the base of a logarithm be positive?I'm confused by the following line in Tim Wilson's answer to How do you determine the domain and range of a logarithmic function? f 3 (x)=logx∈R  only if x∈(0,∞)  .
In the question the  x  is wrongly mentioned as base while it is exponent assuming the question is about base. The reason is a^x when a<0 is not a continuous graph for odd integers it is negative and for even integers it is positive and for rational numbers with denominators having even power it is not real (-1^0.5=i) but complex and for odd power depends on whether  numerator is even or odd and respectively be positive and negative (-8^(1/3)=-2, -8^(2/3)=4) and for irrational numbers it is ill defined -2^e is  not defined. So what we get is a discontinuous graph while for positive a it is a continuous graph and logarithm which is inverse of function y=f(x)=a^x cannot have valid inverse.
