What are some fancy terms describing simple things in science?Like saying Markov chains to say data depend on their previous values or using Poisson processes to say I used a random number generator.
I think a more apt example, and the first one that comes to my mind, is the Kronecker delta δ  . It's a very simple concept: if i=j  , then δ ij =1  . Otherwise, δ ij =0  . It seems so trivial that it's hard to imagine that it's even got somebody's name on it. And yet it turns out to be immensely useful: it lets you define a lot of things more elegantly than if you had to break your problem into a lot of cases with "if... unless...". And when you go from discrete cases to continuous cases, it generalizes very nicely to the (far less obvious) Dirac delta. I suppose that the name "Kronecker delta" isn't all that complicated, but at least in my experience it's not familiar from commonly-taken math classes. Things named after people are generally more recent and more complex; notations without names are often older and simpler. But it's an elegant and powerful notation for a concept which isn't quite as simple as it first appears.
