What is discrete mathematics? Where is it useful? How is it relevant to IT?
Discrete Mathematics is one in which the entities are 'discrete' and not continuous. A 'Graph'Â  or a 'Tree' is discrete but a 'curve' or a 'circle' is not. Usefulness: 1) Ever used Google Maps to find the distance between two places? Even though google has not disclosed the algorithm yet, but you can think of Discrete Mathematics -> Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate shorted distance between two points in a graph. 2) Networking: Routers determine the number of links to be established based on Handshaking lemma. And there are many more....
