What's the best way to proceed if you have 30 days to become a better competitive programmer from being a beginner?
Thanks for A2A First of all you already qualified for google code jam twice, it means you having good knowledge how to write programs with basic logic. In google code jam it is performs off line judge on our solutions it means we are submitting output file and code. But not evaluating code when we submitted. So you java solution works here. But Java codes are very slower than C or C++ codes. It is required to write fully optimized code using java. I preferably suggest you use C++ to write code for problem solutions.Â  C++ also having some containers to deal with data. (vectors, set, map, queue, stack, priority_queue, etc). You are saying you have 30 days to better at competitive programming.. Set a daily goal for all 30 days and you should reach that goal. Solve as much problems as you can and parallelly start learning algorithms and data structures and solve different kind of problems using algorithms and data structures. Finally don't wait for any thing, do what u like to do, be stick to what u are interested in so, start learning algorithms and data structures.
