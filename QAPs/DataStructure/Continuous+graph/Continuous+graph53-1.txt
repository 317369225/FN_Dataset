What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
This probably isn't a great answer, but I found it hilarious as a kid. I was, as a kid, always fascinated about playing with numbers. I was dividing 50 by 7 once. The answer started coming out - 7→7.14→7.1428→7.142857→  OH NO! It seemed so beautiful until then, every number doubling. But 57 broke the pattern. But then, I thought, what if the extra 1 comes from hundredth place of 112? 14  0028  000056  00000112  0000000224  000000000448  00000000000896  0000000000001792  000000000000003584  -------------------------------------------- 142857142857142784  And as I kept adding more and more terms, it matched the division result more perfectly. Wow! I thought I was some sort of a genius. It also made me see that such addition, with seemingly no connection to repetition, lead to repeated digits. Later discovered the cyclic property too. I also came across - 1/99→0.01→0.0101→0.010101  →0.01010101  1/98→0.01→0.0102→0.010204→  0.01020408  →0.0102040816→0.010204081632  →0.01020408163265  1/97→0.01→0.0103→0.010309  →0.01030927  →0.0103092783  But now I knew why the pattern was being broken, and I also knew that it wasn't really being broken. Today, these results don't seem exciting but in those days, it sure made me certain that there was a magic to numbers. Updated 10 Oct 2013 • View Upvotes
