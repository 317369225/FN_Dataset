Assuming a straight graph, if the current growth of atheism in the West continues, versus the decline in practicing Christian believers, how long until the religion as we know it is wiped out?By the Christian religion as we know it I mean Sunday church attendance, an influence on law, being listed as the majority religion in national censuses, that sort of thing. Having said that I'd be interested to know if anyone thinks it will ever go the way of the ancient religions and disappear entirely as a serious faith, given over to the increase of scientific discovery.
Atheism is growing in the west, and Christianity is declining in the west, but the problem is, the west itself is declining. Westerners simply do not reproduce at a very high rate. The global south is expanding demographically and is even infiltrating the west due to immigration. These immigrants are Muslim and Christian. Islam and Christianity are still exploding in the global south. So unless atheism starts growing in countries like China, Brazil, and India, religion will probably never be wiped out... at least not in the foreseeable future.
