Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: How would you study smart, not hard?I tell my freshmen, it is very strange that you will spend four years learning all this information and not spend ten minutes thinking about how you learn best. You would not use a complex instrument without reading the owner's manual, but we do this with our own brains. Take some time to experiment and to determine how you best study by learning about your body. Some people study better at night; others in the morning. Some people study better in total quiet, others with music, others in a bar, others in a park, others while exercising. Coffee helps some people to study, and hurts others. Do you study better with a full stomach, or does this make you sleepy? Do you study better in short bursts, or can you concentrate fine for a given number of hours? Do you study better alone or in a small group? After some time, when you have learned what works best for your body, you will find that you can study more efficiently and retain more.
