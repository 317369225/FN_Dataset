What are your views on the possibility and concept of an infinite amount of elements on the periodic table?
In general, infinite (at sensible) means that we could nominate or limit somewhat greater than or likely different than the proposition we're heading of. Therefore I believe that it 's somehow possible to be happened as that; Why am I mull & argue like that? It's as of that we're confronting a continuous flowing of knowledge in science and natural sciences and now, the philosophy of science is based on standard arguments and assumes but if the manner would be changed all will be upgraded. Someone could say that the truth will not be changed; but it will definitely be updated since the process of gaining knowledge is continuous forever and in addition to that we are at a point on that continuous graph. Somewhat would comment that I'm in an imaginary world but I would like to remember them all that Science is originated to satisfy requirements and imaginations and it will not be limited to your range of thinking at all times.
