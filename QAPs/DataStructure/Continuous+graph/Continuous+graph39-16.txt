What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
If you draw a loop on a piece of paper such that the curve does not cross itself at any point, then there always exists four points on this curve that form vertices of a rectangle. In fact, it is believed (not completely proved that) If you draw a loop on a piece of paper such that the curve does not cross itself at any point, then there always exists four points on this curve that form vertices of a square. There are several other similar results documented here [1]. I find them quite counter-intuitive. [1] The Inscribed Squares Problem
