What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
I was amazed by the way in which results in topology could be used to demonstrate non-trivial phenomenon in real world. 1) Browers fixed point theorem: Every continuous function from a closed disk to itself has a fixed point. Real world illustration: If you place a map of a city on a table in that city, there will always be a "You are here" point on the map which exactly represents that same point in the city. 2) Borsuk-Ulam theorem: Every continuous function from n-sphere to n-dimensional Euclidean space has some pair of antipodal points mapped to the same point Real world illustration: There will always be two antipodal (exactly opposite ) points on Earth's surface with equal temperature and equal atmospheric pressure. 3)Intermediate value theorem: Suppose f is a real valued continuous function on a closed interval [a,b], and c is a number between f(a) and f(b), then there exists a number x in [a,b] such that f(x)=c. Real world illustration: There will always exist a pair of antipodal points on the equator, that have same temperature. 4) Hairy ball theorem: There is no continuous tangent field on an even n-sphere. Real world illustration: You cannot comb a hairy ball without creating a cowlick. 5)Stoneâ€“Tukey theorem: Given n measurable sets of finite measure in a n-dimensional space, it is possible to divide them in half using n-1 dimensional hyperplane. Real world illustration: Sandwich problem: Given a chunk of ham and two chunks of bread, it can be divided into two equal parts by just one single cut.
