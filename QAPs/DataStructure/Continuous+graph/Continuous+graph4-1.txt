Intuitively and on the graph, why if a function is differentiable then its continuous?
I think in this instance you refering to differentiable on every point- and then there is answer to that question. Think about what differerentiable function means, you have a picture of a graph, and on any random point of that graph there exist a point slope. meaning for a very small delta the (dela of y/delta of x)=change of y/change of x exists and has some kind of value. ibecause it is true for EVERY X on ghe graph in Reals it means we can make an extension from one point to the next and continue the function forward, aka Continuose without an interaption. sort of like skiing off the hill if you add slightly more speed, you will continue skiing forward even if the slope is no longer steep. In the picture you can see clearly at the different end points we can't extend the line, in the same place it wouldn't be differentiable or continues. While in sin function it is completly continues and differentiable. for all x.
