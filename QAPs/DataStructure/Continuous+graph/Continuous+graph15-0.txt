Assuming a straight graph, if the current growth of atheism in the West continues, versus the decline in practicing Christian believers, how long until the religion as we know it is wiped out?By the Christian religion as we know it I mean Sunday church attendance, an influence on law, being listed as the majority religion in national censuses, that sort of thing. Having said that I'd be interested to know if anyone thinks it will ever go the way of the ancient religions and disappear entirely as a serious faith, given over to the increase of scientific discovery.
Assuming a straight line graph, (which is a huge assumption but let's go with it in the spirit of answering your question the way you want it answered) the slope of decreasing belief over time can be found using the results of the following gallop poll: In 2005, atheism was 9% globally and was at 13% in 2012 [1]. So if it's a straight line graph, the slope would be 4%/7yrs. Extrapolating to 100% atheist you get 154 years. Just for kicks, that would mean that there were 1% atheists in 1991, and would have been at 0% around 1989ish. I was in grade 9 at the time and definitely knew my neighbors were atheists so... Ya not accurate. But I hope you understand that this was just for fun! Of course this graph is far from linear! [1] http://www.patheos.com/blogs/fri...
