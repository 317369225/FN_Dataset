What is any number raise to the power of infinity? What is any number divided by infinity?
Okay - so Quora suggested me to answer this one. And I am going to route to another answer as the logic is same. I am not sure what Quora's best practices are - so anyone who has better awareness should feel free to act. Anish Betawadkar's answer to Why can't zero divided by zero be one? Infinity is not a number - so the question isn't appropriate. It's like asking - If I give you infinite apples, and take away 5 from you, how many you are left with! Infinity is to express something that is beyond countable. Updated 4 May
