He was strict. P2 - Middle aged guy. He was the silent guy, mostly quiet but asked a few questions in the end. He seemed to be lenient but was trying to act strict P3 - Old guy. He seemed to be the technical expert. He was the one who asked questions on academics and work experience. He was a little strict too.I reached the center well in advance, but I had not worn my blazer for a long time. The documents were verified one by one according to different panels. During verification they asked me to sign in front of a number. I signed at a wrong place. They said you should have good listening skills. After that, in some time the panel came and announced their candidates in order or interview. They asked us all to assemble in front of the respective panel with our files. They had probably asked to send in the first candidate as well, but I had not listened properly. I hurriedly wore my blazer, put my documents back in my bag and waited in front of the hall. P1 came out and asked me to come inside the hall for the interview. It all happened in such a hurry, I didn't wish the panelists good morning. Anyway.. Questions and answers: P1 - So Vibhor, where are you from? Where is it? Me - Chandrapur. Sir, it's in the Vidarbha region. P1 - Oh, Vidarbha..I see..so there are droughts there always? Me - Sir, not so much in my district. Generally, the western Vidarbha region is the drought-prone region. P1 - Which are those districts in the western Vidarbha region? Me - Yavatmal, Washim, Akola etc. P1 - OK. (With a face as if I am an extremely obnoxious person) So you have mentioned in your form that you are doing some business and some marketing activities in your current job? What is the difference between the two? Me - Sir, Marketing activities are those related specifically to that function like selling, promotion , branding etc. and business activities are those that are part of the day to day running of the business. Tried to give him an example and explained a project that I had prepared about sub-branding in one of our products, but he did not seem much interested. (Did not probably handle this question extremely well) P1 - What is the meaning of budget? Me - Sir, in simply put, budget is where we have all the expenses and sources of revenues listed and then we allocate the money to the various expense heads. P1 - On what basis do you allocate them? Me - Sir, depends on the priority which we allocate to them. Like,  operating expenses are the expenses that are more or less indispensable, whereas, advertising expenses are lesser important and fall lower in the priority list. P1 - (with that weird face again) OK, you have done Chemical Engineering, then worked as a business analyst and now working in the family business for about 6 months, and now suddenly you want to go for an MBA. What exactly are you trying to do in life? (Why MBA?) Me - I explained to him my standard answer. Told him reasons for every career decision I took, however, his expressions didn't change too much. I also probably got a little baffled after listening to his intimidating tone and didn't probably give the ideal structured answer that I normally do, but I tried to show that I was extremely calm. Difficult to say if he was entirely satisfied though. P3 - (Took out my final year mark-sheet from the file) So Vibhor, I can see that you scored some 61% in your graduation. Me - Sir, that is just the final year marks. My aggregate is 67.64% P3 - OK, so what was your rank like? Me - Sir, out of a class of 90, i was somewhere in the middle in the 40s. P3 - OK, I can see a subject called 'Instrumentation and Process Control' here (It's not a core chemical engineering subject). Can you draw the entire process flow diagram of an controlled process? Me - Sir, I am not in touch with my technical subjects too much, as I haven't applied it in any of my work experience. P3 - Okay then, what about your final year project? What was it about? Me - Sir, my project was about converting 1000 tonnes per day of fatty oils to Green (Renewable) Diesel. P3 - Okay, so you did a project on that, so why are we not manufacturing the same in India? Me - Sir, it was an non-viable project..and the reason for that was the extremely high requirement of Hydrogen in the process which was too expensive for the project being non-viable. P3 - When do you say that a project is viable? Me - If the costs are too high and break-even cannot be achieved by selling the product at the market price even after a few years, it is a non-viable project. P3 - What do you mean by break-even? Me - Break-even is the point in time in the project life cycle when there is of no profit, no loss P3 - Fine. So you said that you are selling a cheaper variety of one of your products? Aren't you selling adulterated products then? (This was regarding the project that I had described as part of my work in my family business. We are a company in the food processing industry) Me - No sir.. P3 - But you said so.. Me - Sir, I probably didn't put it across properly. What I meant was that we have two varieties of our product. Both meet the Food safety standards, however, certain buyers prefer the cheaper variety over the other. There are both types of customers who are happy with each variety. P2 - So you have written that you used to play the Tabla and side drum. Do you still play them? Me - Sir, I used to play Tabla quite often during my school days. Side drum too I played for my school band. Nowadays, I don't play Tabla that often. P3 - You have passed any exam in Tabla? Me - Yes Sir, I have passed the 4th level exam. P2 - OK. You are working in the food processing industry. So what do you think about the problems that the food industry is facing in India? Me - Sir, I think one of the biggest problems that the food industry in India is facing is that of leakage and food wastage. Our supply chains and logistics systems are not efficient, leading to wastage. P2 - So, what is the solution? Me - Sir, our supply chains have to improve. It will be a slow process but the Government has come up with the Food Mega Park initiative that will at least partially try and address this problem. P2 - What exactly is it? Me - Explained fully the three different stages of the proposed Food Mega Parks. Procurement, Primary Processing and Central processing and what it will have in detail. P2 - So who will fund them? Me - Sir, it will be the PPP model where Govt as well as food processing companies and other stakeholders will come forward to fund these mega parks. Told them examples of Tumkur and Chittoor where such mega parks are already operational. P2 - OK. You said that you write? Me - Yes sir, I write articles on cricket for a couple of popular sports websites. I also write blogs. (I had a few articles in my file. Showed them) P2 - What do you write about? Me - Sir, my first published article last year was about NZ's chances of winning the WC2015. After that I have written about different topics as mentioned in the file. P2 - What do you think are India's chances for the WC? Me - Sir, I think India will reach the semis for sure. After that it will be tough. I want India to do well, but I feel it will be difficult. (This was before the tournament) P2 - OK. What do you think has been the impact of IPL on cricket? Has it been good or bad? What is your opinion? Me - Sir, from the players' point of view I think it's been good. They have become more financially secure, especially the fringe players who don't play for India regularly or even those uncapped players who have never got the opportunity to play for India. For owners and office bearers of course, it's a big money spinner. But I feel in the long run, it's not good for Test cricket. People coming through the ranks don't pay much attention to technique and Indian Test cricket will suffer in the long run. Players will be encouraged to play explosive cricket without paying much attention to the technique in the quest of getting a good IPL contract. That won't be good. P3 - OK. That's all. Thank you. You may have a chocolate before you leave. (Took an eclairs) Me - Thank you so much Sir. Was not too sure how it was. Probably above average. Not any question on current affairs or GK, which are generally my strong points to talk in an interview Verdict - Converted the call :-) Edit: As someone asked me in the comments, I am providing the links to some of my articles here: Could New Zealand win the ICC World Cup?
