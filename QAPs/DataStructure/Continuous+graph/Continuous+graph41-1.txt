What are some fancy terms describing simple things in science?Like saying Markov chains to say data depend on their previous values or using Poisson processes to say I used a random number generator.
The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation - basically completing the square, but in reverse. The Renormalization Group - well, I am interested in the low-energy physics, so let's find a way to throw out the high energy parts! (duh!) "...the correlation length goes to infinity..." - basically means that the phenomena you are studying in not anymore localized, but affects the whole system. Abelian / Nonabelian - basically means AB equal / is not equal to BA, respectively. Faddeev - Popov procedure - a procedure for field quantization based on the functional integral; this basically involves inserting a fancy expression for the identity under the integral for the action. Caveat: all the above from the condensed matter physics POV, so I have surely bulldozed my way through reams of subtleties here. Apologies in advance. More information on all these topics can be found on Wikipedia. Caveat II: Thinking about it a bit more, I think mine are "answers" in the way Joshua Engel's are: they are simply named after people who thought of them first (except for correlation length) and do not connote any "fanciness" in of themselves. For an answer that technically fulfills this criterion I think Hongwan Liu's and Michael Omidi's are the best.
