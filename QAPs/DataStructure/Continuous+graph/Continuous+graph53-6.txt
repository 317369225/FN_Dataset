What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
Morley's triangle enchanted me at first sight - around grade 9 or 10. Basically: for any arbitrary triangle, the intersections of its trisectors (1/3 divisors of its angles) will make up an equilateral triangle, the Morley's Triangle. This theorem could be extended much more, creating squares, pentagons by the angle divisors of arbitrary shapes. Well, equilateral triangle is like a symbol of perfect symmetry in the world of triangles, like square among quadrilaterals, so on. To me at the time, the theory was like an assertion that: within any ordinary thing, there is a hidden perfect beauty. Quite sentimental it sounds now, but that's what I thought back then.
