Why is f(x)=xsin(1x )  continuous but nondifferentiable at x=0  ?I found this question in a course. I've tried to explain it using the quotient rule but it didn't work. Is there a way to prove it with the quotient rule or does the quotient rule get you nowhere?
There is a simple fact: if a function at a point is differentiable, then at that point, it must be continuous. The inverse statement of it is not correct. The reason is quite simple. Just follow the definition of continuity and differentiability. The continuity just requires that the value of left-continuity and the value of right-continuity should be same. But, differentiability requires more. The slope of the function at a given point from left or from right should be equal.
