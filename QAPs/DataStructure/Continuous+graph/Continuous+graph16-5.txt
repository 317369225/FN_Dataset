Mathematical Fallacies: How does one explain the “π = 4” proof regarding a square reduced to a circle?
First let us start with a simple rule of triangles: The length of a side is always less than the sum of two sides in a triangle.   When we proceed in the way you mentioned, we end up at one Little triangle when the part of the circle Looks like the Hypotenuse of a right angled triangle (triangle is too small). Therefore the Perimeter of the circle would be the sum of all 'c' values of the small infinitesimal triangles. Whereas you have used the a+b values of all the trianlges ending up in getting a higher value 4.
