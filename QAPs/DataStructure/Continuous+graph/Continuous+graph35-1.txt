Is it possible to have a function which is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere?A basic calculus question.
Yes Weierstrass functions are famous for being continuous everywhere, but differentiable "nowhere". Here is an example of one: w(x)=∑ ∞ n=0 12 n  sin(2 n x)  =sinx+12 sin2x+14 sin4x+...  It is not hard to show that this series converges for all x. It can be shown that the function is continuous everywhere, yet is differentiable at no values of x. Here's a graph of the function. It is periodic with period 2π. The animation at the top of this answer zooms into the graph at x=1, and you can see that it does not become smooth, or linear, as a differentiable function does. However, at the last frame, the graph looks rather smooth due to computational limits of the software used, but theoretically one could zoom in forever and it would never become smooth or linear: For more, visit http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Wei...
