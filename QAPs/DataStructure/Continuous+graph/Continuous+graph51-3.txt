What are the best examples of roles where actors underwent significant physical transformations to play the part?Some examples that come to mind are Christian Bale (The Machinist and The Fighter), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Natalie Portman (Black Swan).
Originally Answered: What actor has changed their appearance the most radically for an acting role?Woohoo! Got here before everyone answered "Christian Bale"! Although I have immense respect for the way Mr. Bale finds his characters, I think the top prize actually might go to actor/singer Jared Leto. Middle two are him normally. Left one is him, up almost 70 pounds to play John Lennon's assassin (Chapter 27). Right one is him, down 30 pounds to play a transsexual woman battling AIDs (Dallas Buyers Club). So on the left, he's 213 pounds. And on the right, he's 116. That's ridiculous.
