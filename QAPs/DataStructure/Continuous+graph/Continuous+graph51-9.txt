What are the best examples of roles where actors underwent significant physical transformations to play the part?Some examples that come to mind are Christian Bale (The Machinist and The Fighter), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Natalie Portman (Black Swan).
Though not as dramatic as the others, Will Smith bulked up for his role as Muhammad Ali.  I read somewhere he trained for something like six hours a day in preparation for this movie.  His weight went from ~185 to ~220 lbs. Then for I, Robot, he cut his body fat to about 8% to create a more ripped look, again through vigorous exercise and diet. I can't find a "before" (shirt off) picture of him, but remember him as being pretty skinny in his earlier films and the Fresh Prince TV series. Updated 12 Nov • View Upvotes
