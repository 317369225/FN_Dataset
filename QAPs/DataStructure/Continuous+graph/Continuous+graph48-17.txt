Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: What are some great study tips, for those who feel they do not study properly?Do Rubber duck debugging. I know, you're not a programmer. The idea still applies. Get a rubber duck, teddy bear or other appropriate animal mimic. Study your material. Explain it slowly to your teddy bear in such a way that a teddy bear would understand. It sounds stupid. I know. Do it anyways. If you do this religiously, you'll get straight A's.
