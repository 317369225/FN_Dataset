For how long must escape velocity be maintained to escape from Earth?
Escape velocity is the velocity at which an object can overpower gravity.  The speed at which the kinetic energy of an object is equal to its gravitational potential energy is: 1/2mv^2 = GMm/r as distance from Earth increases (r), the escape velocity decreases.  The graph looks like this (although this graph is for the sun): The vertical axis is velocity (v), the horizontal is distance (r).  The object will continually decelerate. The idea is that we are assuming a system absent of other forces.  If the only decelerating factor is the Earth's gravity, then as long as the initial velocity is in excess of the escape velocity, the object will escape.
