Why don't more young professionals buy into a Wine Clubs? What is appealing/unappealing about a wine subscription?Wine clubs are designed to provide customers with a series of wine bottles on a monthly or quarterly basis that they would otherwise have to find and purchase on their own.
I can't get into wine clubs, personally. Seems to take a bit of the fun out of the wine experience. I prefer strolling down to K&L Wines and chatting it up with the staff to get a recommendation.
