If f(x)  is a continuous function satisfying f(x)=f(2x)  for all real x  , then is it necessarily a constant function?If so, how do we prove it? And if not, any counter examples?
There was an answer here that gave f(x)=cos(2πlog 2 (x))  as an example of a continuous non-constant function that satisfies f(x)=f(2x)  , but it seems to have vanished.  That's a good example because it's very simple and it shows that continuity at zero is really what you need to guarantee that the function is constant.  If you can knock zero out of your domain, you don't have to worry about that.  I wish I could remember who came up with this, but I'll just have to thank whomever they are instead.
