What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
How many ways can you give 8 apples to 4 people? Not everyone has to receive the same number of apples, and someone could even receive no apples. Sounds pretty simple... there couldn't be that many different ways, right? Let's give the people names: Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave. So you could give Alice 8 apples, or you could give her 7 apples and give someone else 1 apple, or you could give Alice 6 apples and then... OK, maybe this is more complicated than we thought. Let's just start listing examples at random and see if we can find a pattern. Apples given to (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave): (8, 0, 0, 0) (7, 1, 0, 0) (7, 0, 1, 0) (6, 2, 0, 0) (2, 2, 2, 2) (5, 1, 0, 2) So what's going on? We really just need to pick four whole numbers that add up to 8. But how many ways can we do that? Hmm, let's try representing the apples with stars instead. Same examples as before: Alice | Bob | Carol | Dave ******** | | | ******* | * | | ******* | | * | ****** | ** | | ** | ** | ** | ** ***** | * | | ** But wait. What if we squished down each of the rows? It just becomes a sequence of stars and dividers: Alice|Bob|Carol|Dave ********||| *******|*|| *******||*| ******|**|| **|**|**|** *****|*||** So now these are sequences of 11 symbols that always contain 8 *'s and 3 |'s. But can we get any sequence like this? ... Yes, any sequence with 8 *'s and 3 |'s can be turned uniquely into a way to divide up the apples. Just count the number of stars between dividers. What about the other way around? Does every way to divide the apples give a different sequence? Yes, that's true too. So we have a 1-to-1 correspondence, also called a bijection. That means the number of ways to divide up the apples is the exact same as the number of 11-symbol sequences that have 8 *'s and 3 |'s. But that number is simple. It's exactly 11 choose 3, or the number of ways to get from the top of Pascal's triangle to row 11, entry 3. So we know the answer is (113)=11⋅10⋅93⋅2⋅1 =165.  When math is no longer just a homework assignment telling you exactly what formula to use, it becomes a puzzle, an exploration. Sometimes seemingly unrelated concepts can link together. Sometimes we can put together things that we know in order to solve a problem that looks like something we could never know. And sometimes we can learn something new along the way. That's what math has taught me. Updated 27 Oct 2013 • View Upvotes
