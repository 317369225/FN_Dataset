What's the best way to proceed if you have 30 days to become a better competitive programmer from being a beginner?
Well, let me tell you that there is nothing more tempting that a competitive programming to a programmer. I love them! Since you have been doing it on and off and are immensely interested in it, do not wait. Java is just fine. Or you can move to another language if you want. That is your choice. What matters is that you know the algorithms well. Learn data structures. And learn them in such a way that you see them everywhere. Absorb the beauty of Object Oriented Programming. And do not stop coding. Learnt a new data structure? Code it right away. Do not try to read everything in just 30 days. Get into the details of the programming language, learn how the datatypes and the data structures work. Play around with them.
