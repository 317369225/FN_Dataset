What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
When I was in middle school, I read the wonderful little book Flatland by Edwin A. Abbott. The story is narrated by a square in a two-dimensional world who encounters a sphere from the third dimension. At first, the square cannot conceive of a world with higher dimensions, until the sphere uses simple mathematical reasoning to help the square imagine a cube. For the sake of clarity, I will retell the story from the point of view of someone trying to explain what a four-dimensional cube looks like to us. If we say that a cube is a three-dimensional square, then we might also imagine that a one-dimensional square is a line segment and a zero-dimensional square is a point. Now, we can count how many points are required to draw each of these figures: The pattern is simple: 1, 2, 4, 8, … Therefore, we can guess that if there was a four-dimensional cube, it should be made up of 16 points. Similarly, we can count the number of boundary regions that enclose each of these figures: Here, the pattern is 0, 2, 4, 6, … So we should guess that if there was a four-dimensional cube, it should have 8 cubes that enclose its boundary. This four-dimensional cube is also called a hypercube, and it has many different visual representations: What I found fascinating is that no human being has ever seen a hypercube. Yet the beauty of mathematics is that it allows us to describe worlds outside of our experience. For Abbott’s original narrative, see chapters 16 and 19 from Flatland, available online here: A romance of many dimensions.
