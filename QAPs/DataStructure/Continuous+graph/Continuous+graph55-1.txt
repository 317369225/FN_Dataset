Is there any combinatorics research done in sets with continuous domains/ranges?
A permutation is a one-to-one, onto mapping of a set to itself, although the word "permutation" is usually reserved to the finite setting. Put differently, a permutation is an automorphism of a set preserving no additional structure. Automorphisms are part and parcel of mathematics in numerous contexts, so the most reasonable answer to the question in the title would be "yes, of course" - people look at mappings and automorphisms of infinite sets, "continuous" or not, all the time, although most if this type of work wouldn't normally be categorized as "combinatorics". I could not make sense of the second paragraph. Why would the set of probability distributions be countable? Even the set of probability distributions on a 2-element set is uncountable. And there's no meaning I'm aware of to say that a probability distribution is or is not countable, so the last sentence seems meaningless.
