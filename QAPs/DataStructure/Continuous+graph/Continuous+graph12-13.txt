With no clue of what was happening in the world and with one call from IIM Indore with a 96 percentile I entered the interview hall with hardly any expectation. Life for me had been around creating java objects and running multi-threaded programs and I did that well , just that the urge to so something else had brought me in this place. The interview started on a bad note with the interviewer asking about GDP and the import/export gap. When he was done harassing me with economics and making me realize that I knew nothing the other guy kicked in with this electronic genius. Starting with diodes and then coming to transistors he made sure I felt ashamed of my science background. With no hope of making a comeback I had given up when the the previous guy made a statement(with some Hindi, don't remember exactly) and asked my opinion : " Log bolte hain , Sardars are more about muscles than brains, What do you think ?" . My Reply : " Sir, Kamaal kee baat hai , Log to ye bhi bolte hain , CAT tough hai , and then sardars are cracking it ". And then after that bhai hamara palra bhari ho gaya and I got a call in the end. Prepare well but then Luck also matters and remember not everyone who makes into IIMs is a genius , there are people like me too :). PS: I am a sardar.
