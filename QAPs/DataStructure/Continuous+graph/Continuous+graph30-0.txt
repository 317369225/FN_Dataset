Which mathematics courses may be useful for a Computer Science student ?
CS is broad. For machine learning, it depends on the kind of models you intend to work on, but in general: Statistics: useful to explore the data, build models potentially and assess models' performances. Probabilities: since most data is noisy, we need them. Linear algebra, especially eigenvectors, eigenvalues and SVD/PCA/ICA. MOOC: [edX: Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers][1]. Also useful to vectorize your formulas and implementations (GPUs can be pretty useful). Calculus, mostly being able to compute gradients (ubiquitous in machine learning). To a lesser extent, integration, especially when handling continuous probabilities. Graph theory: knowing the basic terms is useful when thinking about graphical models. Logic: mostly GOFAI but still good to know. Computational complexity theory, since one key issue in machine learning is the computational time. In addition to [Ng's excellent course][3], if you want to focus on a more theoretical approach, I advise to look at the [Caltech MOOC on machine learning][2] which is pretty awesome too.   [1]: UTAustinX: UT.5.01x: Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers   [2]: Learning From Data - Online Course (MOOC)   [3]: https://www.coursera.org/course/ml
