What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
When I was younger I used to define success as being able to figure out how to fit a round peg in a square hole.  (Now my wife and I define success as getting the kids to sleep early enough that we actually have a couple hours to ourselves before going to bed). One day I was sitting in class staring at the equation that defines a circle: r 2 =x 2 +y 2   And just for fun I plotted it: So then I thought, what happens if we change that 2 to a 4?  I had a pretty good idea what the result would be, and I wasn't disappointed: Okay, the story has a point, I promise.  I continued increasing the exponent and plotting the graph until I got this: And then it hit me, a circle is really just a special case of the expression r 2p =x 2p +y 2p   and as p increases to infinity, lim p→∞ r 2p =x 2p +y 2p   the shape that is described by the formula is a square.  So there it was, proof that I could use math to fit a round peg (even if it's just a theoretical one) into a square hole.  Maybe the chart isn't the most beautiful thing I had ever seen, but it certainly helped me to realize how powerful a tool math can be.
