What are your views on the possibility and concept of an infinite amount of elements on the periodic table?
An infinite number? Impossible. That would mean there's an element that contains an infinite number of protons and neutrons, a logical and physical impossibility Even if you ignore that, at some point the size of the nucleus would become large enough with enough protons and neutrons as to make electron orbitals at the very least unstable if not impossible. Even if that doesn't happen, at some point the mass of the nucleus would become so great as to collapse into a black hole and then you have no more element. Who knows what you'd have then?
