How do you read histograms?
histogram is a mapping of pixel values of your image. pixel values against the number of pixels of that value. on the x-axis is your pixel value, on the y-axis is the number of pixels. on the x-axis , to the left-most is 0 value, to the right most is 255 (this pixel value corresponds to 8-bit colours. 2^8 is 256, that means a pixel value from 0 to 255). once all the pixel values are collected, they are plotted againts their number, and a continuous graph is obtained. Inferences you can derive from the graph: Its pretty simple. If your graph is more towards the left side, that means your image has more darker pixel value, basically your image is 'under-exposed'. If your graph is more towards right, it has more lighter pixel value, meaning 'over-exposed' Properly exposed image? One which has an inverted bell-shaped graph. The maximum number of pixels will be at a mid value (around 100-150). That's your properly exposed image. Once you understand how the histogram works, enhancing the contrast is a piece of cake :) Happy experimenting :)
