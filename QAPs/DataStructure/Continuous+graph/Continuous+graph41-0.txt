What are some fancy terms describing simple things in science?Like saying Markov chains to say data depend on their previous values or using Poisson processes to say I used a random number generator.
orthostatic hypotension (medicine) -- feeling light-headed from standing up too quickly. linear regression (statistics) -- find a straight line that passes through a set of points. Why not "line fitting" instead of "linear regression"? null hypothesis (statistics) -- the default assumption that nothing happens. This seems confusing because it literally means the proposal of nothing, which is not a proposal at all. Updated 11 Dec 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
