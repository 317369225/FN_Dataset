Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between topper student study method and common student study method?HARDWORK, DAILY REVISION AND PRACTICE What makes a guy topper : Being  a topper doesn't mean that he/she is a genius or more intelligent than  the other students. Difference between topper & common student lies  between how much he/she keeps on revising/practicing topics on a daily  basis. The Thinking : Everybody wants to  be a  topper, but the truth is that only some  students in a class manage to score really well in exams. But then, what  about the rest of the class? Does it mean that only few students are  blessed with all the luck and others are just ,well..Average? The truth  is that almost everybody can become toppers ,if only they want to.A very  strange but true fact is that average students think that they can score  good marks with even very less amounts of studying, which leads to the down fall. Hardwork : Toppers deserve the spot they are in because they have worked really  hard for it. Nothing can be achieved without hardwork because there are  no shortcuts to success. ONE MORE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THIS ONE NIGHT BEFORE EXAMS : 1) Toppers Sleep By 12 AM. 2) Others Do Night Out.                                        Photo : Proud To Be An NITian I Hope This Was Helpful.
