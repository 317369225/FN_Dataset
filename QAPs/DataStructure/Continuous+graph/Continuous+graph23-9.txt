What is any number raise to the power of infinity? What is any number divided by infinity?
A number raised to the power of infinity is to multiply a number by itself an infinite number of time. You will get infinity if your number is positive and large. You will get 1 ifÂ  your number is 1. You will get zero if your number is between -1 and 1. And you will get nothing if your number was negative larger that 1 in absolute value (in facts you will have a number which is at the same time positive and negative, which is not possible as it is not zero). If you divide a number by infinity, your are looking for a number such that when you add it to itself an infinite number of time you get the starting number. Now, the looked for number must be 0. Otherwise, by adding it to itself an infinite number of time you will be infinite. That is: a number divided by infinity is zero. Exercise: translate the above in old-babylonian.
