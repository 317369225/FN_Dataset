What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
There exist functions that are continuous nowhere, but whose absolute values are continuous everywhere: A sphere that can pass through itself can be turned inside out without creasing (I'd recommending watching the more in-depth videos too): A series is said to converge conditionally if exists and is a finite number (not ∞ or −∞), but A classic example is given by (wikipedia) The Riemann series theorem says that a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to any value, even rearranged to diverge. For instance, the series above converges to ln(2) but rearrange it as such and you get a series that converges to (1/2)ln(2).
