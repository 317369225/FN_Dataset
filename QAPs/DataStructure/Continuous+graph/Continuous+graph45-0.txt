Why is f(x)=xsin(1x )  continuous but nondifferentiable at x=0  ?I found this question in a course. I've tried to explain it using the quotient rule but it didn't work. Is there a way to prove it with the quotient rule or does the quotient rule get you nowhere?
Well, first of all, that function isn't continuous at x = 0.  It's not even defined at x = 0, so it can't possibly be continuous. However, take a look at the graph: (Graph courtesy WolframAlpha) It's clear that it approaches zero as x approaches zero, and this is easy to prove using the squeeze theorem.  So if we define the function g(x)=⎧ ⎩ ⎨ xsin(1/x)0  if x≠0, otherwise,   then g(x) will be continuous.  However, it still shouldn't have a derivative at zero; just look at the picture -- what would the tangent line be? Also, since you specifically mention the quotient rule, note that the quotient rule says nothing about this situation either way.  You're using it to find the derivative of 1/x.  Recall the statement of the quotient rule: If f(x) and g(x) are differentiable functions and g(x) is nonzero, then [f(x)g(x) ] ′ =f ′ (x)g(x)−f(x)g ′ (x)g(x) 2    Since the denominator of 1/x is zero when x = 0, the quotient rule by itself gives us no information either way about the derivative of g(x) at zero.
