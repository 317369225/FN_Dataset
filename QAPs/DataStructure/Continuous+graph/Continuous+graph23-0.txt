What is any number raise to the power of infinity? What is any number divided by infinity?
Infinity isn't a number, so you can't carry out mathematical operation with it in any normal sense. You can take limits, however, and that why infinity and zero are the normal answers to your question. Here's something for you to ponder. If you have a set S of n elements, the number of subsets of set S is 2^n. So how many subsets are there of the set of natural numbers N, {0,1,2,3...}? That would be one answer to your question of what's 2^infinity. Mathematicians have assigned names to these "transfinite numbers: and say that there are "aleph-null" natural numbers ("countably infinite), but that the cardinality of the set of real numbers (cardinality of the continuum) is 2^{aleph-null}= aleph-one. This is greater than aleph-null since the real numbers are "uncountable": they can't be put into 1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers. So mathematicians distinguish between different orders of infinity. Source: 1)What is any number to the power of infinity 2) and any number divided by infinity? - Yahoo Answers :p
