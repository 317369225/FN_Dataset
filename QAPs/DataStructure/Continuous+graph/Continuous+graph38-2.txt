What's the best way to proceed if you have 30 days to become a better competitive programmer from being a beginner?
For your level, best way to utilize 30 days to become a better competitive programmer, is to solve 30 Topcoder High School SRM (TCHS) contests. That's 1 contest for each day. Each contest has 3 problems. If you are stuck at any problem, read editorial. If any of the contests feel easy or takes less time than usual, solve more than one contest that day. Remember, it is important to write code for all the problems. Believe me, you will feel the difference after 30 days. I have seen it happen. Several times.
