Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: What is the best or effective method for self study? Books: Read reviews on amazon and get the best book on the subject. Also know what prerequisite knowledge is required to learn from that book. Work schedule: If you are going to self-study, more than anything you need discipline and self control. Plan at night all that you are going to study the next day. Work in blocks of time. Study method: Read analytically, not passively. Before learning something, write on a paper all that you know about the subject and ask yourself questions about all the stuff you want to know about the study material. After reading every section, close the book and summarize all that you understand in your own words. Don't paraphrase. Form a mental image of the concept you've read and make sure everything makes sense. After you end your study session, sit back and relax for 15 minutes. Close your eyes and think about what you've read. Testing and revision: Test all that you've learnt on daily/weekly basis and keep review sheets/flash cards handy. Other resources: You can refer to wikipedia or join free online courses on http://edx.org or Coursera.
