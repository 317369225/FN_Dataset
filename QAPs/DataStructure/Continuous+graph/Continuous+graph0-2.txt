Will the social graph continue this path of consolidation over Facebook, or will it reverse its course and be fragmented over a few different social networks?
Personal opinion only: I doubt Facebook will last a lot longer. The project is great, but security issues and privacy concerns will eventually move people to other platforms. I see Diaspora as a serious contender now.
