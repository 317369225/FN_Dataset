How do the conditions for continuity differ from the conditions for differentiability for mathematical functions?Thank you!
Intuitively, a function is continuous if its graph is "unbroken", whereas it is differentiable if, when you zoom in closely at a given point, it looks like a line. It is easy to come up with functions that are continuous but not differentiable at a given point. |x|Â  is a good example: the graph is unbroken, but no matter how far you zoom in on the origin, it will always look like a corner. It is harder to come up with functions that are continuous but not differentiable anywhere. Justin Rising's example of the Weierstrass function is the classic demonstration that this is possible.
