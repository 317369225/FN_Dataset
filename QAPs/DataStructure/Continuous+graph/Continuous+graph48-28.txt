Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: What is the most efficient and effective way to study?You may want to explore the use of the seemingly popular SQ5R reading/studying strategy, and Cornell Notes. Go to the net to download information on: 1) SQ5R reading/studying strategy; It's  a structured system, but it equips you with efficient and effective  ways to navigate academic materials, especially the  intellectually-intense ones, with ease and expediency. 2) Cornell Notes; It's a far more superior system that the conventional outline method, known to most students in schools, college and universities. It's latent power comes from its simple and yet elegant three-column spatial configuration for taking notes and making notes. The  "cue" column is the most powerful system I have ever known, as it  facilitates - and expedites - your  memory retention/recall via  self-testing. If you think you have an artistic streak in you, you may even want to explore the multitudinous graphical methods of note-taking and note-making, like idea mapping, cluster diagramming, and other graphic organisers and visual tools. Enjoy your exploration of superb tools and your academic journey!
