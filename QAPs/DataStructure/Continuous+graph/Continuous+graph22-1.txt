My academic grades have fallen continuously. I had a 90% in X, an 80% in XII and then a 67% in BTech. How can I justify this situation to my interviewer when asked about such a deteriorating graph?
you should have some increment  in some other field to explain : you could say that as my interest toward practical knowledge increased my theoretical knowledge  didn't remain consistent..
