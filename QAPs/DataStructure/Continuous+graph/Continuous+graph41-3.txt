What are some fancy terms describing simple things in science?Like saying Markov chains to say data depend on their previous values or using Poisson processes to say I used a random number generator.
Instead of saying "Also make sure the numbers themselves are small, as measured by the sum of their absolute values", scientists say: Apply LASSO regularization, which uses the constraint that , the L1-norm of the parameter vector, is no greater than a given value. In a Bayesian context, this is equivalent to placing a zero-mean Laplace prior distribution on the parameter vector. Updated 30 Nov 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
