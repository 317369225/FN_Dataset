What is any number raise to the power of infinity? What is any number divided by infinity?
Infinity is not a number, but a concept. So strictly speaking, your question does not make sense. The concept is the following: suppose I tell you that I will give you a large sum of money (I never will). You tell me that you will give me back ten times more than what I gave you. I say that I will give you back ten times more than that, and you say the same thing, and I say the same thing and you and then me and then you then me, you, me, you, me, you, me... See the point? However larger a number you speak of, I can speak of a number larger than that. This concept is called "infinity." Now if I rephrase your questions in the following way: Q 1) What is any number raised to a very large number? Answer: Case 1: the number you are talking about is zero. Then the answer is zero, since no matter ho many times you multiply zero with itself, you will get zero. Case 2: the number lies between zero and unity. Then the answer approaches zero. Take any number, let's say 0.9, and raise to it powers of 10, let's say. You will see how small it is. Now imagine raising it 1000. It's even closer to zero. Case 3: the number is unity. Then you can easily see that the answer is one. Case 4: the number is greater than unity. It will of course become larger and larger as you take higher and higher powers. In this sense, it is "infinite." Q 2) What if I divide a number by larger and larger numbers? Answer: Following the same logic, if you divide a number (no matter how large) by larger and larger numbers, the quotient will become smaller and smaller, and approach zero. P.S. It is in this sense (what happens in a limiting case?) that "limits" are defined.
