What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
Until 10th standard (that is until I was about 14-15 years old), mathematics for me, was one of the subjects which I was good at. I liked it because I was good at it. However, beyond that I don't think I had much interest whatsoever. However, in 10th, I found a site called NRICH [1] which has a discussion board called AskNRICH [2]. The first post I saw there was from a person called Brad Rodgers. He had a question (which I don't recall right now) and I did not have a clue what it was about :-). My reply to his post was "Is this mathematics? Which field does it come from?" (this is paraphrased of course, I don't remember the exact words). To which he replied that it was a question from number theory. That was my introduction to number theory. I started looking around and found some more problems from number theory and I even started learning modular arithmetic. And one day, it happened, I came across the following: If p  is a prime, then for any integer a  , a p ≡a(modp)  I remember staring at this for several hours. I don't know why, but I thought that was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I guess that was the first time I thought Math was beautiful. And it has been that way ever since then. P.S. Here is a proud moment of mine, when I solved one of the number theory problems on my own and submitted to NRICH and got accepted :-) [3] [1] Home Page : nrich.maths.org [2] Topics - Ask NRICH [3] http://nrich.maths.org/377/solution
