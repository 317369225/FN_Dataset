What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
Most beautiful things in mathematics: 1) Irrational numbers: The concept of rational and irrational number (non recurring non-terminating numbers) intrigued me. I wondered how a number could exist that could not be expressed in the form of p/q (fractions). But more shocking part came when I learned even though you can't express it in form of p/q you could represent it on a number line. You can't write it (1.4142135....) but you can draw it. 2) Behold:  When you talk about beauty in mathematics there has to be a mention of some beautiful proofs in geometry and trigonometry. The most beautiful proof I came across was the proof of Pythagoras' theorem by Bhāskara II. Area of the entire square = (x+y)^2 Area of all the triangles = 4*(1/2)x*y Therefore, Area of the inner square = (x+y)^2-2xy = x^2+y^2=r^2 I know proving Pythagoras theorem wasn't the most challenging things, but the beauty and simplicity of the proof is such that you have got to fall in love with mathematics after this.
