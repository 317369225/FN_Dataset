What are the best examples of roles where actors underwent significant physical transformations to play the part?Some examples that come to mind are Christian Bale (The Machinist and The Fighter), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Natalie Portman (Black Swan).
Not only did De Niro's role as Jake La Motta popularize the notion of an actor's physical transformation for a movie, it was exemplary dedication on De Niro's part since the heavier La Motta had very little on-screen time per the original script. Here's the before / after transformation pics.   After Raging Bull was also De Niro's obsession who insisted on Scorcese directing, who basically did this as a gift to his "brother" Bob.
