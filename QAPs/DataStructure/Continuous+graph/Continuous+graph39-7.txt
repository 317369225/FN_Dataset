What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
The convergence of Goodstein sequences: Goodstein's theorem. In short, the sequence a_n output by the recurrent algorithm: - start with any positive number a_2 - for all n, write a_n in basis n (including the powers, the powers in the powers etc.) - exchange n with n+1 in this scripture - subtract 1 to get a_(n+1) ... converges towards 0. What's maybe even more counterintuitive, is that it can't be proven in ZFC! However a simple proof using ordinals exist. Updated 23 Apr â€¢ View Upvotes
