Here's my IIM A interview in a nutshell: Background: Class X: 96.4% Class XII: 96.6% Undergrad: IIT Bombay CGPA (in IITB): 9.27 (out of 10) CAT Percentile: 99.95 (CAT 2012) Work-ex: 0 (fresh graduate) Other things of note: I enjoy public speaking and creative writing. Dabble in stand-up comedy and football journalism. Interview: Two profs- both of whom I have gotten to know quite well now. P1: "So Abhishek.. good day so far?" Me: "More or less, though I think the next 20 minutes might have something to say" *both chuckle meekly* *I chuckle meekly* P2: "Football blogger who has written for ESPN? You think you're a football expert eh?" Me: "Everything except playing the actual game sir" P2: "You don't play?" Me: "I do as long as the word "play" has an extremely broad definition" *both chuckle again* *this time I don't chuckle* *mixing things up* P1: "So you don't play?" Me: "No sir. I write. I'm a vicarious exploiter of the joy of the beautiful game" P2: "Where are Swansea City in the Premier League Table?" Me (slightly stunned): "Umm.. 8th?" P2: "Umm? You're not sure?" Me: "8th. Definitely 8th" P2: "Definitely 8th?" Me: "Definitely" P2: "6th.. here see" *shows me laptop* Me: "I'd like to go back to talking about how well I play the game if that's alright?" *both laugh* P1: "Abhishek why do you want to do management? You have excellent grades- just do research no?" Me: "I can't be a football presenter if I do research" P1: "Football presenter? That's your life goal?" Me: "Yes sir" P2: "But we don't produce sports presenters. We produce managers" Me: "I have no doubt. But that doesn't change the fact that I can't be a football presenter by doing research" *both smile* P1: "Tell me about Biosynth (Project I worked for in IITB)" Me: *insert gyan about Biosynth* *some more questioning about that* *some more answers* (it got technical here hence glossing over details) Finally, P2: "Abhishek I love math. I'm going to give you a math problem. If the volume of a cylinder is fixed, derive the radius and height that will maximize the surface area" Me: *do the problem* *make calculation mistake* (realized later) *prof doesn't notice or care about answer* (phew!) P1: "Okay. Thanks Abhishek. Have a toffee" Me: "Thank you for your time" *takes an abnormally large amount of time to pick the toffee* P1: "We have other candidates Abhishek" *we all laugh*
