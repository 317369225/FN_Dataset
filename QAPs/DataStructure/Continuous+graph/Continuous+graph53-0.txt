What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
There is a non-recursive formula for the Fibonacci Series My Sophomore year of high school, my friend Jennifer introduced me to Berkeley Math Circle. That month, Bjorn Poonen gave a talk about Linear Recursive Sequences (e.g. the Fibonacci Sequence). [1] He began to use the characteristic polynomial to solve a linear recurrence, and ultimately ended up with Binet's Formula, a non-recursive formula for the Fibonacci Sequence. F n =15  √  [(1+5  √ 2 ) n −(1−5  √ 2 ) n ]  or [2] F n =ϕ n −(−ϕ) −n 5  √    My notion that the Fibonacci sequence could only be expressed recursively was shattered. I was absolutely blown away. I played with polynomials, sequences, and the golden ratio all individually, but nothing could have prepared me for this. This was a beautiful thread connecting polynomials, my favorite sequence, and the golden ratio. I read a lot of recreational math books and did lots of math competitions prior to Junior year, but only then had been introduced to Math Circles. That month changed my life. I began attending all three math circles around the Bay Area (Stanford, Berkeley, San Jose). I couldn't get enough. Each time, I would learn something beautiful. Sometimes things that blew my mind. This one was the first of many. :) [1] - Notes from the talk Page on Berkeley [2] Note that as a direct result, as Anunay points out in his answer! Updated 14 Nov 2013 • View Upvotes
