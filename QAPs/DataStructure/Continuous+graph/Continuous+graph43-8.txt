What is a great way to learn math and computer science concurrently (ideally with one helping another)?Or learning how to program and thinking mathematically at the same time. Engage math in learning how to code and vice versa. I love coding. I feel like I'll be much better at math if I use math a lot in coding. I'm interested in both programming and computer science. I'm looking for solutions when all of it is explicitly tied together.
I would only answer only Computer Science(CS) part as I have hands-on experience with it. I have learned basics of CS and Software Engineering by enrolling into MOOCs. Harvard's CS50 course is pretty decent one, that covers bunch of valuable topics that you might encounter in your future. Btw, it is the most popular course in the Harvard by far, 818 students have taken this course in fall 2014 semester. Here is the link for that MOOC: Courses! Good luck!
