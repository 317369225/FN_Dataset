Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: What are the best ways to study?Surprised no one has answered this question yet. Anyways, There are many great ways to study. 1. By location: - go to a cafe - go to a library - go to a park - lock yourself in your room - visit a museum and study on one of their benches - go wild and study in a forest or desert or another natural scene 2. By music: People have different tastes in music, but generally, people prefer calm and wordless music to study to - unless you have only a small amount of time to do your assignment, then war-like music is sometimes employed :) - Western classical music: Vivaldi, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Debussy - Lounge music - Chillwave - Indian classical music - sitars, flutes, and tablas - Jazz 3. With other people. Studying can be downright boring - it is better to bring along someone. You got to know how to choose the right study partner, though. 4. Food and drinks. - Green tea/herbal - mixed juice drinks - stay off the coffee unless really necessary - scones (makes you feel all proper and such) - loads of water - granola bars 5. While watching a film or a TV show. Actually this is a bad way to study. But if you are really bored and can't seem to study at all, this method is better than not doing anything.
