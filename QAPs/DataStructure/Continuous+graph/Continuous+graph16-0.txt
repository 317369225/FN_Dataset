Mathematical Fallacies: How does one explain the “π = 4” proof regarding a square reduced to a circle?
Originally Answered: Is π=4  ?This is an old problem known at least to Leibniz and probably to the Greeks. The problem doesn't have anything to do with π  , or with circles. You can see the same problem with a straight line: The length of the diagonal is 2  √   , but by the same logic, the black, red, green and blue lines are all of length 2  , which is bigger. There are several ways of looking at the paradox.  The simplest is to simply note that the red line is not, in fact, a better approximation to the diagonal than the black ones are.  It has only one additional point on the line, and an infinite number of ones off it. You can repeat the operation indefinitely, adding more points, but there will always be more points off the line than on, for the same reason that there are more real numbers than integers.  Formulated as a limit, the variable controlling the number of steps is an integer, while the length of the line is given by a real number.  Thus, the set of steps is, even in the limit case, longer than the diagonal. We can ask ourselves, then, why does Archimedes approximation to π  work?  The answer is that Archimedes was trying to approximate a curve with a line, and the curve, unlike the steps, really does look flatter and flatter as you get closer and closer.  The steps will always be steps, but a smaller and smaller approximation to a curve resembles a line.  The limit case of a polygon really is a circle, while steps are always just steps.
