Assuming a straight graph, if the current growth of atheism in the West continues, versus the decline in practicing Christian believers, how long until the religion as we know it is wiped out?By the Christian religion as we know it I mean Sunday church attendance, an influence on law, being listed as the majority religion in national censuses, that sort of thing. Having said that I'd be interested to know if anyone thinks it will ever go the way of the ancient religions and disappear entirely as a serious faith, given over to the increase of scientific discovery.
I think it's a heavily idealistic idea that religion will be completely eliminated from human society. It's an idea that we'll know everything about what we can't explain, or altogether stop worrying about it. In fact, a world where there's no speculation or curiosity about a higher purpose sounds like a dystopia to me. On that note, I highly doubt Christianity will ever be completely eliminated. Throughout history, Christianity seems like it's about to be crushed, only to re-emerge stronger than before. The church uses the crucifixion as the first example of this, where the Jews thought they killed Jesus, ending his teaching, only for him to return, stronger than ever.
