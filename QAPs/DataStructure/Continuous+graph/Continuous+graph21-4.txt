What are your views on the possibility and concept of an infinite amount of elements on the periodic table?
I try not to entertain this possibility any more frequently than necessary. It has no impact, whatsoever, in my day to day life. But it is an awesome question, nonetheless - that I commend you for posing. I guess, if pressed, I will entertain theÂ  possibility of a few more elements - but I am a pretty small thinker.
