How do I solve continuity and differentiability problems using graphs?
@Continuity: If the graph of a function is without any breaks then its a continuous function. Example 1: f: R --> R and is given by f(x) =2 Note: R is real line The graph of f(x)  is a horizontal line without any breaks. Hence, its continuous Now,lets look at another example: Example 2 : g: R --> R and is given by g(x) = 2 for all x not equal to 2 g(x) = 0 for x= 2 The graph of g(x) has a jump at x= 2 and we cannot plot it without lifting our pen. Hence, g(x) is not continuous at x= 2 Lets check for " Differentiability" Differentiability means you can draw only one tanget at a point. Therefore , if the graph has kink at any point then, we can draw multiple tangets at that point implying not differentiable. Example 3: h: R --> R and is given by h(x) = |x|  i.e taking absolute value of x The graph of h(x) has a kink at x= 0. Hence, its not differentiable. Hope it helps!
