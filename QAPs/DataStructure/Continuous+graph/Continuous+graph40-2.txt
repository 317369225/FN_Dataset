What is discrete mathematics? Where is it useful? How is it relevant to IT?
Hey i just passed that subject at university. It lets you understand math in a different way. Its beautiful honestly, and i really enjoyed it. Also you will gain some conceptual tools for proofs. Here are the chapters of my course: -Axioms and some small proofs like why (-1)(-1)=1 or why is 0 unique. -Induction method to proof theorems for all natural numbers. -Strong induction problems. -Principle of order. -Counting all kinds of possibilities and combinations. -Divisibility. -Prime numbers. -Congruency. -Graphs. My english might not be accurate tho. Greetings.
