Maxima and minima application problems are difficult. I got stuck on how to begin. What should be the approach and line of thinking to be followed?
First start with basic problems. You can refer to R.D.Sharma or any JEE preparation book for the same. Second, after you have read a question try solving it on your own and give atleast 2-3 attempts. If you are not successful then go through the solved example and try to figure out why you were not successful. Try attempting the same question again on next day and see whether you are able to solve that question completely. After doing this exercise from one book, try attempting unsolved questions from some other book / exam papers. You will see a remarkable improvement in your ability to solve the questions.
