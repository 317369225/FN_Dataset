What is the antiderivative of sin(x 2 )  ?
The integral of sin(x²) is non-elementary, i.e., it cannot be expressed in terms of polynomials, fractions, exponentials and logarithms. However, it has a name:  it's called the Fresnel integral.  The integral of sin(x²) that takes the value zero at x = 0 is noted S(x).  The Fresnel integral arises in optics (hence the name). This integral is also related to the error function (erf), which itseld can be defined as an integral of the exponential of a degree-2 polynomial. Given that the sine function can be expressed using the exponential function via complex numbers, the given integral can be expressed in closed form when the error function is admitted, also via complex numbers.
