How was your IIM interview experience?Please do mention your profile, which gives an idea about your past academic records and likewise.
This happened with a friend of mine in her IIM Calcutta interview (a girl who is exceptionally talented, but is not very beautiful in traditional Indian sense). She entered the interview room - before even she could take her seat, one interviewer snapped at her - "I don't like your face, get out of the room". She was super-shocked (as anyone would be at such a quip), but she was able to keep her composure, and replied back saying - "Sir, with all due respect, if you can explain me how my average looks would prevent me from being a good manager, I would happily walk out of the room". The interviewer gave her a smile and told her to take the seat. The interview post that lasted for barely 5-10 more minutes (mostly on very general stuff). She got selected (obviously!) Later, when she did accept the offer, the interviewer called her to his office, gave a personal apology and admitted to her that they had unanimously selected her the moment she responded back to his quip. Weird ways to find true stars indeed!
