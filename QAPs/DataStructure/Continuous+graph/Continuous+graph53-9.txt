What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
There are/ were many instances but I distinctly remember one. I was 10-11 back then, learning and loving geometry. One day, my teacher asked me to solve a problem.. He asked me to draw a triangle. Given parameters : Perimeter of the triangle The two base angles I, with my meager knowledge, was confused. But my teacher seemed to be fairly confident that I could solve it. So.. after surrender (I probably can't do it), trial (ok let's give it a try!), confusion (what am I missing?!) and determination (Come on.. I can do this!), came the solution! Pretty trivial when I think about it now, but back then, when I first solved it, the unfathomable joy I got, was nonpareil. Here's the problem and the solution : The following parameters are given : 1. Perimeter of the triangle 2. The two base angles Let us suppose they are as follows: (X units is the perimeter) Draw a straight line equal to the length of the perimeter. (X units) Draw the base angles at each side of the perimeter. (P and Q) Bisect the base angles. Let the bisector of the two angles meet at A. So, we have a huge triangle AMN, with base equal to X units and the base angles equal to P/2 and Q/2 respectively. Now, taking AM as base, draw an angle equal to P/2 at point A. Draw the angle, produce the side, so as to meet MN at point B. Similarly, taking AN as base, draw an angle equal to Q/2 at point A. Draw the angle, produce the side, so as to meet MN at point C. This triangle formed now, Triangle ABC, is the required triangle. P.S. : Please ignore my horrible paintjob. Updated 14 Nov 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
