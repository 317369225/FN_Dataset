Mathematical Fallacies: How does one explain the “π = 4” proof regarding a square reduced to a circle?
Originally Answered: What's wrong in this?There is nothing wrong in this!!! Pi is indeed 4 here. But what happened is you have increased the tolerance for approximation. In some systems 99 might be taken as equal to 100 but in other system even 99.98 may not be accepted as 100. It depends on how accurately you can measure your system and here you are dividing the difference in perimeters of square and circle into so many negligibly small values, there by affecting the accuracy with which you can measure your system to such levels that pi becomes approximately equal to 4. This is what has happened here: The difference between the length of the square and length of the arc of the circle it encloses always reminds the same (4 - 3.14= ) and is .86. Initially there are 4 lines of .215 units each. Then you start doing the above procedure for the first time and it now becomes 8 lines of .1075 units each. Now after each iteration this halves and after quite number of iterations become negligibly small enough for you to ignore them. But what you dont realise that there are actually large number of such lines of negligible length which is not apparent from the picture and when you sum them all it comes to .86. To give you an analogy, you try to measure quantity of water in a room, but you simply took say a bowl of water from the room and splashed it on the floor and then simply ignored the tiny water droplets. Then you measured amount of water in the room without including the bowl of water. So you simply have compromised on accuracy of your system.
