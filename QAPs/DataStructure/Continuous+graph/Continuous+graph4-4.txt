Intuitively and on the graph, why if a function is differentiable then its continuous?
For a function f  being continuous at the point x∈R  means that  if  x,y  are close then  f(x)    and f(y)  are close too. f  is differentiable the point x∈R  means that you can approximate the graph of  f    at x  by the line segment. That is,  if  x,y  are close then  f(y)−f(x)    and k(y−x)  are close  for  k=f ′ (x)∈R,    the slope of the line. Now if  x,y  are close and f(y)−f(x)    and k(y−x)  are close, follows that  f(y)−f(x)    is close to zero, so f(x)  and f(y)  are close to each other.
