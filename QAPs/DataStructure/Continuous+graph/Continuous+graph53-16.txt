What is the first little bit of math that made you realize that math is beautiful?
That we seemingly finite beings can PROVE that there are an INFINITE number of primes. (There's no a priori reason this has to be, but it turns out be so.) And that this can be proved in moments! Ready, here we go: Let's assume for the sake of argument that there are a finite number of primes, and let's call the largest prime P. Now, let's take P and all the primes smaller than P, multiply all of them together and add 1. This number is indivisible and, thus, a prime. But . . . this number is larger than P, which contradicts that P is the largest prime. Which means our initial assumption was wrong, and the number of primes is infinite!Â  (Or another way to think about it: If anyone ever claims to find the largest prime you can always call that P, repeat the procedure above, and find a larger prime.) It's beautiful that the human mind can prove things about infinities. The proof above is ancient, but one modern mathematician that really pushed our knowledge of infinities to the next level was Georg Cantor. Georg Cantor - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
