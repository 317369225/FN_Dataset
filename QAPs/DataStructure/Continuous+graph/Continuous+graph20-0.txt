Has any stock market index ever been rebased to a lower value?
Many indexes involve a multiplier to avoid this happening. The only exception to this is changing the multiplier is to change the dollar value for e.g. futures because the minimum contract becomes too expensive (e.g. E-mini S&P). Many ETFs and index funds will also typically trade at some multiple of the index (e.g. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust trades 10x lower in price). Otherwise, the index actual price is meaningless except on a basis that remains relevant over time, so changing the price on an index really benefits no actual traders. Of course, when index components change, much hot air is devoted to the arbitrage opportunities and price differentials between the "old" and "new" index composition (e.g. changes in the Historical components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average- Kodak was in the index from 1930 to 2003 but is zero today.) In the long long run, all stock prices go to zero, just as Valar Morghulis. An index is a synthetic entity which attempts to create a fictional but immortal entity so that long term comparisons can be made, and should be a continuous graph, always differentiable from moment to moment.
