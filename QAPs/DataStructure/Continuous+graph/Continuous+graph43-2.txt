What is a great way to learn math and computer science concurrently (ideally with one helping another)?Or learning how to program and thinking mathematically at the same time. Engage math in learning how to code and vice versa. I love coding. I feel like I'll be much better at math if I use math a lot in coding. I'm interested in both programming and computer science. I'm looking for solutions when all of it is explicitly tied together.
This, of course, is an opinion answer. Learn Calculus and Intro to CS and EE from MIT OpenCourseWare Electrical Engineering and Computer Science While learning Computer Science take rigorous courses like Princeton's Algorithms course at Coursera Algorithms Learn about Computational Investing  (requires a lot of CS background, well not requires but extremely difficult without it) Computational Investing Some people say Algorithms and Data Structures make a good programmer, not knowing arcane programming ideas.  Algorithms are basically programming and math at the same time.  Calculus and Intro to CS and EE is required courses at MIT that are taken together, just the coursework is put on the web for anyone.  Computational Investing is very interesting from a math and programming perspective, because you program investing strategies using math and finance.  Though, as I mentioned, it's a difficult course and you need Investing knowledge and Computer Science knowledge at the same time.
