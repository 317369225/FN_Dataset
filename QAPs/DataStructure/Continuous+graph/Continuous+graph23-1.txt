What is any number raise to the power of infinity? What is any number divided by infinity?
Infinity is not a defined quantity, it's a concept. it is something which is very vast and one can't even visualise how vast it is. you may think like a number with say 1000 digits is infinity but it's not. its far far vast than that. Coming to the First question. when you say a^x, it implies you have to multiply a with a, x number of times to get a^x. So, when you raise a number to the power infinity (which itself is unknown), you don't know how many times you have to multiply the number to itself. however for sure you know that, doesn't matter how many ever times you multiply, you are never reaching an end. and lets not forget that the more you multiply a number, the higher the product goes (not true in case of fractions). so the ultimate result of this multiplication will also going to be very very vast. i.e. INFINITY. Coming to the Second question. as you have the concept of Infinity by now, this should be straight forward. when you divide a number with something larger than itself, the result will be less than 1. however, its not exactly zero either, so by when will it become zero?. the answer is, higher the difference between numerator and denominator the faster the value approaches zero. for example consider, 7/10 = 0.7 7/100 = 0.07 7/1000 = 0.007 So we can arrive at the conclusion that, when a known number when divided by a very very vast quantity (i.e. the difference between these too is very vast), the division will result in zero.
