What's the best way to proceed if you have 30 days to become a better competitive programmer from being a beginner?
Language is secondary, algorithm is primary. Â Start learning about data structures first. You can then learn advanced data structures. Half the problem is mostly solved while choosing a appropriate data structure for the job. This can easily take you 2 weeks for a basic idea at least. The next 2 weeks start with understanding algorithms. Sorting is the place to start. Then go with algorithms on the data structures you have learnt. After this you will get more knowledge and skill. Continue with graph based algorithms and solve more problems on your choice of online judge. Participate in ACM ICPC and hopefully you can go to world finals one day. That could be your aim. For a language suggestion, I ask you to choose python basically because its much smaller code.
