Intuitively and on the graph, why if a function is differentiable then its continuous?
Since you're asking for an intuitive explanation, I won't go into mathematical rigor here like the other responses. Qualitatively, if a function is continuous at a point x, it means its graph could be drawn without lifting the pencil. In other words, it doesn't jump around; it is an unbroken curve. Qualitatively, if a function is differentiable at a point x, it means that the function doesn't have behavior that makes it not well approximated by a straight line. Roughly, this can happen in two ways, (a) the mild case, where the function is still continuous, but has a corner, or kink at x, so the function looks like a line both to the left and right of x, but not the same line, or (b) the severe case, where the curve isn't even continuous, so you definitely can't approximate it as a straight line. It is because of this second case that a discontinuous function cannot be differentiable. If the graph is a broken curve, you can't possibly expect it to look locally like an unbroken line.
