What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
That it's possible to increase the average of two groups (of whatever) by moving one or more members of one group to the other.  (This was once used to say that when a certain co-worker went back to her team, she raised the average IQ in both places.) Say you have a bunch of bags of sand with an average weight of 12 pounds, and another bunch with an average weight of 10 pounds.  You move one of the lighter bags from the first group (say, an 11-pounder) to the second group. The average goes up in the first group -- it no longer has the lightweight bringing down the average.  The average also goes up in the second group -- it has a heavyweight bringing up the average. There's an ever odder one (sorry!) involving two groups, where the members of each average higher (in whatever) than their counterparts in the other group, but I don't recall it well enough to give an example. Or maybe I do. Two teams in a bowling league on average have higher averages than their counterparts on the other team.  The Pinheads have a lot of left-handed bowlers, and the Brass Bowlers have more right-handed members.  The left-handed Pinheads have high averages.  So do the right-handed Brass Bowlers.  Overall, the teams have about the same average. The average left-handed Pinhead has a higher average than the average left-handed Brass Bowler.  There are more of them than right-handed Pinheads, so the average edge is higher for the Pinheads. Similarly, the average right-handed Brass Bowler has a higher average than the average right-handed Pinhead, and so the average edge higher for the Brass Bowlers. There are other sorts of inter-group comparisons of comparable members of subgroups, but they have political implications, so I'm going to omit them.  (I'm trying to encourage thinking, here, not impede it.)  (Plus, I don't like being called dirty names.)
