What are your views on the possibility and concept of an infinite amount of elements on the periodic table?
There are currently 115 known elements with the highest atomic number being 118.  The three missing are sure to exist.  They just haven't been detected yet.  There are likely to be one or two dozen more that will eventually be found. I don't think we'll ever get to 1000 elements.  At this time even 200 seems unlikely.  An infinite number of distinct elements can't exist in any universe even nearly like ours since the total number of protons in the observably universe isn't much greater than 10^80.
