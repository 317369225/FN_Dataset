What are your views on the possibility and concept of an infinite amount of elements on the periodic table?
This premise is completely irrational.  Infinite implies no end to the size of the atom since to have a new element you have to add protons and electrons.  If this were true, there would already be an atom of a super heavy element that would be the size of galaxies, or several galaxies or even the universe itself and still not reach close to the infinite end... since it is infinite.  This strikes me as a question asked by liberal arts majors when high.
