What are the properties of continuous functions?
You asked about the properties of continuous functions.  Here are some properties. The Intermediate Value Theorem.  If a function is continuous on an  interval, and it takes on two values in that interval, then it takes on all intermediate values.  Symbolically, if  f  is continuous on [a,b], and y is between  f(a) and  f(b), there there is some x in [a,b] such that  f(x) = y. The Extremal Value Theorem.  If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then it takes on a maximum value and a minimum value.  Symbolically, if  f  is continuous on [a,b], then there is some c in [a,b] such that  f(c) ≥ f(x) for all x in [a,b].  Likewise, there is some d in [a,b] such that  f(d) ≤ f(x) for all x in [a,b]. The sum, difference, and product of two continuous functions are each continuous functions.   All polynomial functions are continuous. The quotient of two continuous functions is continuous where it is defined. (It won't be defined when the denominator is continuous.  All rational functions (quotients of two polynomials) are continuous where they're defined. The composition of two continuous functions is continuous.  So, for example, the square root function is continuous, so the square root of a continuous function is another continuous function. Functions inverse to continuous functions are continuous. If a function  f  is integrable on [a,b], then its integral  F(x)=∫ x a f    is a continuous function.Because of these properties, all the functions that have formulas (not including those defined by cases) are continuous.
