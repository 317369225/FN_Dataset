Is it possible to have a function which is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere?A basic calculus question.
Not only is this possible - in a certain precise sense, within the universe of continuous functions, the set of nowhere-differentiable ones is overwhelmingly larger than the set of those that are differentiable-somewhere. Look up "Baire Category Theorem". http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~m...
