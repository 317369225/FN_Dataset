Originally Answered: What actor has changed their appearance the most radically for an acting role?There are some actors who are so much dedicated to their work that they can go to any extent to fit into the shoes of the character. A couple of such mentionable performances are - 1. Emile Hirsch for the movie "Into the Wild" - Emile lost 41 pounds during the shooting to play the part. At the end of the movie he was almost a skeletal. This was, according to him, his best performance ever. 2. Rooney Mara for the movie "The girl with a Dragon tattoo" (american adaption) - To fit into the character's dark persona. Mara pierced her lips, nose, ears and nipples. She cut her hair short and if you have seen this young actress only as Lisbeth Salander in "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" then there are a lot of chances that you will not be able to recognize her in real life. She was nominated for the best actress' award at 2012 Oscars.
