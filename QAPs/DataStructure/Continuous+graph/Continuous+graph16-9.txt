Mathematical Fallacies: How does one explain the “π = 4” proof regarding a square reduced to a circle?
Originally Answered: What's wrong in this?The step mentioned here ( cutting of corners ) even if repeated infinitely will not result in a circle because a circle is a curve whose slope changes gradually. By this procedure , the result will only be alternate horizontal and vertical segments of decreasing length (their frequency increasing with each step). It is wrong because , the assumed premise that this will result in a circle is itself wrong. Good way to confuse unsuspecting population though. :) Updated 20 Oct 2013 • View Upvotes
