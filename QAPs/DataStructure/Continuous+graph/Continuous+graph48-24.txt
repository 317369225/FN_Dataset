Studies and Studying: What are the most effective methods for studying?
Originally Answered: Some study tips?This is what I do when I really want to retain material. Literature: I keep the book open on the left and my note book open on the right. As I read I'm scanning for important details and themes. Anytime I find a new theme (The type of statement I could write an essay on later) I'll write that down in the notebook and not the page #. Every passage I find that supports the commentaries I've developed will also be noted. Once I find a good thematic focus, non-relevant parts of the book can be skimmed. Math/Physics: Practice problems. If you just read about the concepts or watch other people solve problems the information is very hard to retain. So I do practice problems. Notes should be as efficient as possible, listing relevant formulas and derivations. Try to think of applications in the real world you could apply the concepts to. Programming Languages: You'll learn way more trying to code something and Googleing the info/looking up solutions in your book as you go than you will trying to memorize the book. Well organized notes with code snippets are awesome references later when you've forgotten syntax. Basically whatever you are studying it is important that you go one step beyond memorization. Take the material, process it, and produce something new. That's the point of learning.
