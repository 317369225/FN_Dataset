For how long must escape velocity be maintained to escape from Earth?
If there is no air/friction, a particle starting off with escape velocity will escape out  As the at any position the final velocity ( considering losses due to gravity ) will be equal to escape velocity at that position. Now adding atmospheric resistance to the equation, we need to offset the energy dissipated and maintain a velocity equal to the escape velocity at that position, ( or shoot off with speed higher to compensate dissipation to start with ) Reference: Escape velocity This  explains why, if a particle starts off with escape velocity, it continues to maintain an escape velocity at future positions in absence of external friction.
