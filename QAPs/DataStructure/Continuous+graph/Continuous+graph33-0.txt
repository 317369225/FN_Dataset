If f(x)  is a continuous function satisfying f(x)=f(2x)  for all real x  , then is it necessarily a constant function?If so, how do we prove it? And if not, any counter examples?
First, here's the standard proof.  All we need to assume is that f(x)  is continuous at 0.  For then if x  is any real number, the sequence x⋅2 −n   converges to 0 as n→∞  , and so by the definition of continuity of f  at 0 f(x)=lim n→∞ f(x)=lim n→∞ f(x⋅2 −n )  =f(lim n→∞ x⋅2 −n )=f(0).  We conclude f(x)=f(0)  for all x  , so f  is constant. Here's another interesting proof that uses a bit of point-set topology.  Consider the real line with an equivalence relation defined by x∼y  iff x=y⋅2 n   for some integer n  .  Then you can form the quotient space X=R/∼  , whose points are equivalence classes of numbers under this equivalence relation.  The topology on this quotient space is a bit funky, though:  the only open set which contains the equivalence class of 0 is the whole space X  !  A continuous function f:R→R  satisfying f(x)=f(2x)  induces a continuous function f ′ :X→R  .  But then if I⊂R  is any open interval which contains the point f(0)  , then (f ′ ) −1 (I)  must be an open set in X  which contains 0; it must therefore be all of X  .  This is true no matter what interval we chose, so letting this interval shrink shows that (f ′ ) −1 (f(0))=X  , and the only continuous functions X→R  are the constants. If you decide you don't really care about continuity at 0  , then the previous topological construction becomes much nicer: if we impose the same equivalence relation on R−{0}  , then the quotient space X 0 =(R−{0})/∼  is precisely two copies of the circle S 1 ∐S 1 ,  (one from equivalence classes of positive numbers, and one from equivalence classes of negative numbers) and a continuous function R−{0}→R  satisfying the functional equation corresponds precisely to a pair of continuous functions S 1 →R.  , or equivalently a continuous function S 1 ∐S 1 →R  .  If you pick your favorite such function (of which pairs of trig functions provide many--and in a precise sense, the only--examples) you'll get a function which satisfies the functional equation but is necessarily discontinuous at 0 unless it is constant. The space X  itself is just S 1 ∐S 1   with a single extra point, where the open sets are precisely the open sets of S 1 ∐S 1   together with a single additional open set given by the whole space. Here's a schematic diagram of the two spaces X 0 ,X  .  In X  there is a single fuzzy point where the only open set containing it is the whole space.  (Note that this point is still closed, however.) Finally, again assuming we don't care about continuity at 0  , we can use the last observation to specify the form of every continuous function R−{0}→R  which satisfies the functional equation.  Viewing S 1   as the unit circle in the complex plane, points of the disjoint union S 1 ∐S 1   look like (z,+)  or (z,−)  , with the second "sign" variable indexing which circle the points lie on.  The quotient map q:R−{0}→S 1 ∐S 1   is given by q(x)=⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ (e 2πilog 2 x ,+)(e 2πilog 2 (−x) ,−) x>0x<0   Then if g(x)  is any continuous function S 1 ∐S 1 →R,  (which again, is just a pair of continuous functions S 1 →R  ) the composition g∘q:R−{0}→S 1 ∐S 1 →R  is continuous and satisfies the functional equation.  Conversely, every continuous function R−{0}→R  satisfying the functional equation is of the form g∘q  for some continuous g:S 1 ∐S 1 →R  . The fact that the quotient space has two circles in it reveals another kind of example that other answers have  not pointed out.  For instance, the continuous function f:R−{0}→R  given by f(x)=⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 53 x>0x<0   satisfies the functional equation.  On the other hand, the example in Jaden Geller's answer corresponds to choosing g(z)=R(z)  on both copies of the circle; in this case we have f=g∘q=R(e 2πilog 2 |x| )=cos(2πlog 2 |x|)  .
