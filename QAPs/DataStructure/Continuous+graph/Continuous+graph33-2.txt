If f(x)  is a continuous function satisfying f(x)=f(2x)  for all real x  , then is it necessarily a constant function?If so, how do we prove it? And if not, any counter examples?
A function is continuous if the preimage of every open set is an open set.  This is equivalent to requiring that the preimage of every closed set be closed (the things that get mapped to the complement of your open set, are exactly the complement of the things that got mapped to your open set). With this in mind, suppose ∃x:f(x)≠f(0)  .  Then f −1 ({f(x)})⊃{x,x/2,x/4,x/8,…}  but it does not contain 0.  So the closed set {f(x)}  does not have a closed preimage, and the function is not continuous. If you don't require the function to be defined at 0, then there are plenty of nonconstant functions which work, as Jaden Geller points out.
