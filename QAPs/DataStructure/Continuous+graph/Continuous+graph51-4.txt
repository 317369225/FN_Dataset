What are the best examples of roles where actors underwent significant physical transformations to play the part?Some examples that come to mind are Christian Bale (The Machinist and The Fighter), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Natalie Portman (Black Swan).
Anne Hathaway This is how she normally looks and this is what she looked like after losing 10 pounds before the filming of les miserables and 15 pounds during the shoot, Transforming to that extent for a woman is truly remarkable that too in such a short time. All was not in vain though Anne won the academy award for best actress in a supporting role that year followed by a string of many such awards and critical acclaim. #Respect
