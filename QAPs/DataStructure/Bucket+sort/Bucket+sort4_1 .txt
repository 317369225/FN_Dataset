What are the uses of different sorting algorithms like bubble, selection, insertion, shell, merge, heap, quick, tree, radix, counting and bucket sort in real-life scenarios?See these sorting algorithms have different run times. So, as per requirement, they use different sorting algorithms. Normally they go with the quickest one which if I remember correctly is bucket sort or merge sort. But if you have to sort an array going with bucket is waste. So, that's where others like quick sort are used.
