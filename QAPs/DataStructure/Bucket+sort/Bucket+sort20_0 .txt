Solution: perform one iteration of bucket sort with 2n buckets of equal width, then iterate through the buckets from left to right. The maximum difference between two elements in the same bucket is 1/2n, or 1/2 across all adjacent pairs of elements. The worst-case total difference between buckets is 5/4 (if every second bucket had the maximum element on the left and minimum element on the right. Thus, the sum of distances is ≤7/4.
