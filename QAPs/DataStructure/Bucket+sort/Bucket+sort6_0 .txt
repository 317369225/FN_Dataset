Can shell sort, heap sort and bucket sort be used to sort/order contacts in a telephone directory as well as words in an electronic dictionary?Shell sort and heap sort is comparison based sort. As long as your keys (names or word in your case) comparable you can use them to sort your keys. Bucket sort works by portioning your keys into buckets. Like you can create one bucket for each letter of the alphabet and put your words in corresponding bucket, then sort each non-empty bucket and then go through each of them and collect them in sorted order. Sorting algorithms generally can be used for sorting anything you can represent on a computer memory. The choice depends on how fast it can do the sorting based on situation, how much memory it takes (can you fit all your data in memory?) and type of input medium (can you read them randomly or you need to read sequentially?), how your data set looks (is it almost sorted? are there many duplicates? ). If you want to sort strings Bucket sort or Radix sort may be good candidates. You may consider Trie as your data structure. Sometimes a combination of sorting algorithms may make sorting faster if you know the characteristics of the input set.
