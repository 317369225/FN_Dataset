It probably depends on how big the integers are, on what distribution they're drawn from, and on what architecture you're running on. If they're, say, 32-bit integers drawn iid at random, then some sort of bucket sort is probably going to be very fast. If they're chosen adversarially, you might want a radix sort. The size of the buckets probably depends on your cache hierarchy. Edit: note that a good bucket-sort-based algorithm will probably use a different method to sort the buckets.
