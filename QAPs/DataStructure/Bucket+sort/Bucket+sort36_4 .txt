In the early 80's I was assigned to speed up sorting of a symbol table. I used a combination of bucket sort and insertion sort. This resulted in a major speed improvement over Singleton Quicksort. Sort time went from 30 minutes(due to the use of MidString function by the original QuickSort code, to 10 minutes by removing MidString and finally to less than 3 minutes using the new method. All was coded in Basic+II on a DEC 10. I later returned to the problem on a home computer and achieved even better results using C and pointers.
