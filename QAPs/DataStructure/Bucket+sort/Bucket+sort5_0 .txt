How do I calculate the optimized number of buckets when implementing bucket sort followed by insertion sort?I'm thinking the easiest way of picking the number of buckets would be to use the square root of the number of items, i.e. . On average, then, each of the b buckets will also have b items in them. Insertion sort, run on each of the buckets, will be . That means that the process of sorting all the buckets is . That step dominates the computational complexity, as the scatter and gather phases are each . Hat tip: Erez Yalon for the A2A, and "winston@stdout.org" for the LaTeX cheat sheet I used to get the math right.
