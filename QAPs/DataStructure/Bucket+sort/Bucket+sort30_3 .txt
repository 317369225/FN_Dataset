I am using c++ -------------------- In this case you should not care. Simply go with std::sort. To the extent of my knowledge, major compiler have a pretty decent speed on sorting, and with inline, there will be no different in speed than writing the sort algorithm by hand. Instead of spending time trying to compete a hybrid sorting algorithm optimized by some brilliant programmer, you can do better by optimizing other algorithm. Also, when it comes to special case, as Adam Helps said, radix sort/bucket sort might work better. Keep an eye on them if you can!
