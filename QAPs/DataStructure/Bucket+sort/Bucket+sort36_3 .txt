I believe that the easiest way to sort a stack of papers for humans is using bucket sort with two buckets and repeating the sequence for each bucket until there are between 5 and ten elements left in each bucket. Then using "hand" sort, this is holding the pages in one hand and using the other to introduce each new element in between those already sorted.
