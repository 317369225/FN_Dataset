What are the uses of different sorting algorithms like bubble, selection, insertion, shell, merge, heap, quick, tree, radix, counting and bucket sort in real-life scenarios?Refer this site for running time of different sorting algorithms. Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet Now let me point you the difference between some algorithms. If you are having a class with 100 students, and want to sort their names, then bubble sort will be an efficient pick, than the others. Now, if you are building a website that stores names of people from different places.Sure this list goes huge.Now you cant pick bubble sort,since it consumes more time to sort the list.Hence your site may become slow for rapid queries(if it is based on the result of sorting). In this case merge sort or quick sort works well.here also there exists a difference.Merge sort consumes an additional n amount of space, while quick sort needs no extra memory. Like this way different algorithms fit in different places. But the most used ones are merge and quick sort, because of their time efficiency.
