The divide and conquer flavors of sorts are most clearly described recursively. Bucket sort or radix srt certainly is not naturally thought of in recursive terms. Punch card sorting machines were most definitely iterative. Insertion sort needs an outer loop to be a reasonable O(N*N) sort implementation. Stack space for a typical O(NlnN) sort is not typically large so if N is at all substantial, I'd definitely suggest opting for an O(NlnN) algorithm over an O(N*N) algorithm. For small values of N, I certainly wouldn't feel bad if you opted for a simple solution. I've done that myself.
