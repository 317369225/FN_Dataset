Any difference between bucket sort and radix sort for integers?You can think of radix sort as 10-buckets bucket sort. It iterates over integers digit by digit , sorting them based on the current "place" being examined. while bucket sort consider the integers as a number between some range of a bucket Further more, Radix sort is O(nk) while k is the number of digits in the biggest number , Bucket sort is O(n^2)
