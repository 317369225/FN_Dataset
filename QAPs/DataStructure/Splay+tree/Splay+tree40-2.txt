How should I prepare for an onsite SDE interview at Microsoft?
I recently received an offer from MS for an SDET position.Â  Sorry for answering this anonymously, because I still havent told my current employer that I'm moving to Microsoft :) My interview time frame was 1 month and this is how I prepared: Spent 2-3 hours a day solving MS/Google/Amazon/Apple problems from Careercup Bought a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview and solved all the practice problems (The best book for interview prep so far) on paper Read few chapters from Introduction to Algorithms (book), mainly Binary Trees, Dynamic Programming and Graph Algorithms Approximately 40% of the questions I was asked, I had already seen on CareerCup. Since you have only 2 weeks left, I would highly recommend solving as many problems as you can from the book, as well as from the website. One thing I cannot emphasize enough is your approach to solving a problem. Dont be intimidated if the solution doesn't strike you at once. Have a structured approach and be sure to ask any clarifying questions you have (Do not assume anything). In many cases, they purposely omit details to see if you ask questions.
