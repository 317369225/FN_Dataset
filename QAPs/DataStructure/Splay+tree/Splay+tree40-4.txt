How should I prepare for an onsite SDE interview at Microsoft?
All SDE interviews have similar pattern to prepare, and once you make it, you made a big time. First of all, no matter how many time left for you to prepare, data structure and basic algorithms are always the #1 thing you should keep in mind as all SDE interviews are based on these basic stuffs. If you fail to get a good grasp of those basic data structures you learnt at school, you just failed the whole interview. I'm not exaggerating, once you've been thru several technical interviews, you'll realize how important it is. Books about data structure and algorithm are everywhere, do make sure you are very clear about basic stuffs like binary tree, queue, stack, linked list and so on. Since you said you have only 2 months left, then I'd suggest you skip everything else (except the 1st tip) and delve into real interview questions from the company you aim at. Do a little Google search and I promise there're tons of these questions from past interviewers (like http://www.glassdoor.com). Don't expect to have the same interview question you prepared (though it's possible), but practicing with real interview questions will help you be aware of the difficulty, style of each company and what they really care about. If you still have time left (maybe for the last week), you can try mock interviews. You can do this with your friends, classmates, that's awesome. If you can't find someone, try site like http://www.gainlo.co where you can have mock interview with people working at Microsoft, Google etc.. Within 2 weeks, there are a lot you can change. It's never too late to start preparing and do keep in mind, data structure and algorithm are always the #1 thing you should be familiar with.
