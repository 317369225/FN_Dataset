What are some useful but lesser known data structures?
Bloom filters are amazingly useful to test probabilistic set membership. There are lots of variants. Check out the Mitzenmacher paper for a survey of different variants and their applications. Along the same lines, there are fast and memory efficient set cardinality counters like hyperloglogs etc. Treaps are pretty cool fast access data structures... Rabin fingerprints are probabilistic fingerprints, which are quite handy...
