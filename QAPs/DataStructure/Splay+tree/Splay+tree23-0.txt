Who are considered the biggest star faculty members at Princeton?
My vote is for Elliott Lieb (Elliott H. Lieb), he is one of the best mathematical (condensed matter statistical physics) physicists around. His explanations of the second law of thermodynamics are simply beautiful. He has authored at least 20 papers that have been cited more than 500 times. (Elliott Lieb - Google Scholar Citations)
