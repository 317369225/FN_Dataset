Why don't we have binary tree, AVL tree, Splay tree, Tries, or suffix tree implementation in Java collection API?
1. All these are are not a type of collection they are implementation. Sets, graph, list, array, map they are are present. 2. We have java.util.TreeMap, it is not general though. As tree is a data structure to hold collection of entities. 3. No general purpose tree is possible which would cover a wide range of use cases. 4. You have mentioned 4 trees, there are plenty others. Where do you stop? 5. Newer versions now have treetraverser, treeMap, etc. But they are implemented by Map and Set. Therefore the overhead to make it general reduces performance.
