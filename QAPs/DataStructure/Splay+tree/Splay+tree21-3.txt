What are the real world applications of some advanced data structures?
Special trees, special lists and probabilistic data structures - Skiplist: Used by Redis datastore for the implementation of ordered sets. Used in nessDB. Bloom filter: Used by Cassandra to check which SSTables mostly contains the key. Hbase also uses it to optimize the reads. Splay Tree: Used in caches. Suffix tree: Genomic sequencing. LSM trees: Used by Cassandra(SSTables), Big table for storage. Merkle tree: Used by various eventually consistent datastores like Dynamo, Cassandra for anti-entropy mechanism.
