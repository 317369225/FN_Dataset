How do I calculate amortized cost of half splay trees?
*A2A* What you are describing seems to be semi-splaying [1] I am assuming that you know how to do amortization analysis of a normal splay tree. If not, go through this paper [1]. I will be using the notations from this paper, so I won't be defining them again here. First a simple lemma, Lemma (Log-Convexity): If [math]x > 0, y > 0, z \geq x + y[/math], then [math]\log x + \log y \leq 2 \log z - 2[/math]. Proof: Left as an exercise. It is quite easy to prove. Now, for half splay trees, there are three cases to consider (Figure 13 from [1]): 1] 2] 3] In case 1, the amortized cost is given by, [math]1 + r'(z) + r'(x) - r(z) - r(x)[/math] [math]= r'(z) + r(z) - r(z) - r(x) + 1[/math] .. [since [math]r'(x) = r(z)[/math]] [math]\leq r(z) - r(x) + 1[/math] .. [since [math]r'(z) \leq r(z)[/math]] In case 2, the amortized cost is given by, [math]1 + r'(y) + r'(z) - r(y) - r(z)[/math] [math]= r'(z) - r(y) + 1[/math] ... [note that [math]r'(y) = r(z)[/math]] [math]\leq 2r(z) - 2 - r(x) - r(y) + 1[/math] .. [2] [math]\leq 2r(z) - 2 - 2r(x) + 1[/math] .. [since [math]r(x) \leq r(y)[/math]] [math]= 2(r(z) - r(x)) - 1[/math] In case 3, the amortized cost is given by, [math]2 + r'(x) + r'(y) + r'(z) - r(x) - r(y) - r(z)[/math] [math]= r'(y) + r'(z) - r(x) - r(y) + 2[/math] ... [note that [math]r'(x) = r(z)[/math]] [math]\leq 2r(z) - 2 - r(x) - r(y) + 2[/math] .. [3] [math]\leq 2r(z) - 2 - 2r(x) + 2[/math] .. [since [math]r(x) \leq r(y)[/math]] [math]= 2(r(z) - r(x))[/math] So, now we can give an analog to Access Lemma from [1], as follows: Lemma (Access Lemma): The amortized time to splay a tree with root [math]t[/math] at a node [math]x[/math] is at most, [math]2(r(t) - r(x)) + 1[/math]. Excerpt from [1] about semi-splaying: If we measure the cost of a semi-splaying operation by the depth of the accessed node, then Lemma 1 holds for semi-splaying with a reduced constant factor of two in place of three. This is also what our analysis above is also showing. [1] https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/... [2] Since [math]s(x) + s'(z) = s(z)[/math], using Log-Convexity Lemma we can show that [math]r(x) + r'(z) \leq 2r(z) - 2[/math]. [3] Since [math]s'(y) + s'(z) \leq s(z)[/math], using Log-Convexity Lemma we can show that [math]r'(y) + r'(z) \leq 2r(z) - 2[/math].
