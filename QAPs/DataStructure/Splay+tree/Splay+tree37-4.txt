What are some algorithms and data structures which should definitely be included in one's ACM ICPC team notebook?
I would like to add to Jonathan's reply. It is important that you know how each thing in the notebook works. During the contest, if you try figuring out how something works, you are going to have a bad time. We've made that mistake more than once during the regionals (luckily not during World Finals). We took a code which had the KMP algorithm and used it for a question which needed some manipulation of the preprocessed array. It turned out that the code correctly does string matching but does not compute the array the way we thought it would. We ended up not solving the problem.
