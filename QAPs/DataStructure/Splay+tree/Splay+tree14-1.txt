How would the CLRS authors fare in TopCoder against people like Gennady Korotkevich (competitive programmer)?
As one of the authors of CLRS, I can give an authoritative answer. Tourist would wipe the floor with me. I write code only a few days per year.  I write code when developing new assignments for programming-based courses that I teach at Dartmouth, and sometimes I write code to shake out an algorithmic idea for my research.  I also coded up all the new content in the third edition of CLRS.  I've been programming since 1973, and although I enjoy the moments in which I write code, I wouldn't enjoy it as much if I coded all the time.  In fact, I was a professional software engineer for six years (1978 to 1984), and I got a bit tired of writing code all the time. Furthermore, I'm not a particularly fast coder.  So, yeah, Gennady would leave me in the dust.
