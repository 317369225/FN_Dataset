What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?
An ingenious algorithm to me is Bill Gosper's HASHLIFE. When you think you have your optimized, bitboard simulation of Conway's Game of Life, Gosper shows up with exponential speedup in running the algorithm, so in the blink of an eye, you can witness the Game after billions or trillions of generations. He uses quad-trees and caching in a remarkably novel way. Probably even more important, also due to Gosper, is his procedure for indefinite hypergeometric summation. This kind of problem was formerly difficult and ad hocâ€”akin to doing integrals as a college freshman. But he made an infallible algorithm that will return the closed-form sum if it exists, or return with certainty that it doesn't. It was a major step in the field of computer algebra, and is the reason why programs like Mathematica, Wolfram|Alpha, Maxima (the algorithm was first implemented in Macsyma!), and the rest can do your sums. It was also the basis for Doron Zeilberger's algorithm for definite summation.
