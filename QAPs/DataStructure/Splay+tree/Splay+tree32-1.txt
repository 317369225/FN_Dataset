What is the most beautiful/significant data structure and why?
Tries Tries allow O(L) lookups from Strings to values, with L = length of the string being looked up.  They are basically restricted finite state machines.  Trie Zippers Not a data structure pre-se, but Zippers are a beautiful way to represent linked data structures in purely functional programming languages.  Even more awesome is how Conor McBride showed that Zippers for a data structure can be automatically derived from the original data structure by an operation analogous to differentiation in ordinary, real number calculus.
