How extensively are advanced data structures like red-black trees used in professional arena?
That depends on what you define as advanced. (Technically, a complex database could be considered an advanced data structure.) Red-black trees are occasionally used in industry although generally from a standard library implementation (e.g. STL set in C++, TreeSet in Java, etc) where the implementation details are abstracted away. Few if any engineers in their right mind would implement a red-black tree from scratch unless they had a very good reason. (Splay trees are also used fairly often in industry.) Typically engineers in industry try to reuse existing implementations and keep implementation details abstracted away if possible, however.
