How can Range Queries be answered with Skip Lists?
It is possible to perform range queries by augmenting each of the 'skips', which connect one node to the next, with additional precomputed values. For example, if you are looking for range minimums, you would augment each skip with an additional range minimum value. Of course, there are some implementation details you have to consider when doing this. In order to update an element, the augmented value must be propagated and recalculated up the structure. Next, in order to query a range between node A and node B, you have to travel up the skip list and then down. In total, however, there should still only be expected O(logn) movements. Thus, they can almost be considered dynamic segment trees. They support insertion, deletion, range queries, and range updates, though the last two are somewhat tricky to implement. A more powerful (and arguably easier to implement) data structure is the splay tree, which can perform other fancy operations (such as merges, splits, and range reversals).
