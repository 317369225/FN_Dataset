What are some algorithms and data structures which should definitely be included in one's ACM ICPC team notebook?
Note: The notebook isn't designed to be a silver bullet that stores information which trivializes a problem. The notebook should be designed to contain code which saves you time in coding up a solution. As a general rule of thumb, anything that you aren't 99% confident you can code from scratch should be stored in the notebook. Especially in high-pressure situations, if there's any doubt that you might screw up, you should probably add it. The Stanford notebook last year had a number of implementations of network flow, geometry subroutines, number theory subroutines, FFT, suffix arrays, BITs, and KMP. We didn't use our notebook at all during World Finals (nor do we think that having adding anything would have helped greatly). Updated 167w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
