What is the best way to Implement a LRU Cache?
There could be multiple ways depending on what exactly your memory contains. Say your data is indexed using numbers you might need a hashtable in additon to your primary data structure for implementing the LRU. One of the simplest means of implementing an LRU, where your data is of a single type or can be categorised under a single type (say structure or an array) you can use a Splay Tree. A Splay tree keeps the last recently used data closest to the root the tree and the least recently used data farthest from the root ( a leaf).
