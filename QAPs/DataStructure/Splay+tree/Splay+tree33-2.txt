Should I rather study CLRS or "cracking the coding interview" in my free time in university?
As already mentioned in some answers, both the books serve completely different purposes. So, mix both will be best, as per your requirement. For solving questions, I would suggest this site : Sign In for Coding Interview Preparation at InterviewBit, similarly for understanding topics and implimentation you may go to : GeeksforGeeks | A computer science portal for geeks , and if you have enough free time and interest you should try Competitive Programming.
