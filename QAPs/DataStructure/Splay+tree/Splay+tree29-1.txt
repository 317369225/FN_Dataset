What are some useful but lesser known data structures?
Priority queues are very useful for implementing search algorithms, scheduling and many other classes of problems. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pri...) Access order sorted hash maps (e.g. Java's LinkedHashMap -- http://download.oracle.com/javas...) are very useful for implementing O(1) least-recently-used caches in just a few lines. k-d trees are really useful for making spatial indexing problems almost as easy to deal with as single value indexing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd-...) Prefix trees or tries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) are a little difficult to understand, but they are incredibly compact representations for any and all operations related to strings -- approximate string matching, document search, word competion. Ever wondered how the word completion on your old 90s phone worked with 1MB of RAM? This is how.
