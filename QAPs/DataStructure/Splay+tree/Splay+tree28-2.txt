How extensively are advanced data structures like red-black trees used in professional arena?
Every time that you use the Internet it is almost certain that you have used a red-black tree.  The most common DNS (Domain Name System) server on the planet is the Internet Software Consortium's BIND 9 server.   Even if it isn't the server used by your own organization, it is doubtless that your servers talk to some others that are running BIND.  The DNS is used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses, among other tasks.  One feature of modern DNS is data security in the form of being able to positively assert that the answer you got came from the server that is supposed to be authoritative for the hostname that is being looked up.  Called DNSSEC, these security extensions are not only validating "positive" answers, that is an answer where the hostname has an IP address, they also need to be able to handle negative answers, an assertion that the hostname or its IP address do not exist at all. To handle the negative condition, there must be a sense of the ordering of records in a zone, and this is handled by BIND 9 by keeping the zone data stored in a red-black tree.  I wrote the original implementation for ISC.  While there are other data structures possible, red-black trees were the clear choice at the time that we wrote BIND 9.
