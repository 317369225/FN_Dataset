Should I rather study CLRS or "cracking the coding interview" in my free time in university?
Introduction to Algorithms (aka CLRS) and Cracking the Code Interview (CTCI) serve completely different purposes. CTCI won't teach you computer science. I see CTCI as resource to use before doing interviews, whereas CLRS allows you to work on your algorithms and data structures knowledge. In a nutshell, if your algorithms and data structures background is already solid, you probably don't need to work your way through CLRS. If in doubt, read a couple of chapters to make sure you're really comfortable with the concepts (sorting and hashing come to mind).
