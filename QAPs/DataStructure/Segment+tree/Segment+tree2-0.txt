Who invented the segment tree?
The citation I seem to be able to find is this one, suggesting that it was invented in 1977 by Jon Bentley, the same Jon Bentley that authored Programming Pearls: Bentley, Jon L. (1977), Algorithms for Klee's rectangle problems, Unpublished notes, Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University. I haven't been able to retrieve the actual paper. The original problem Bentley was solving seems to be Klee's measure problem. It's not hard to see how this problem can be solved in O(n log n) by the use of a one-dimensional segment tree. I imagine the original formulation of a segment tree would have most likely looked like an augmented binary tree construction, but an array-based construction can be derived from there by applying coordinate compression.
