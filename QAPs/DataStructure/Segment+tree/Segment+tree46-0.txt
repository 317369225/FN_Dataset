What are some of the best sources to learn and practice segment trees and binary index trees?
The first thing that I would like to advice everyone is to try to understand what these two are and where they can be used. BIT is faster to code but I personally prefer using Segment tree over BIT because I found its concept to be comparatively easy and hence easier to modify it . Moreover most ( if not all ) of the BIT problem can be solved using Segment tree in same complexity. To know more about BIT :- Algorithm Tutorials To understand Segment tree :- Let us code: Segment Trees As far as qns are concerned , here's some of the questions SPOJ.com - Problem BRCKTS SPOJ.com - Problem GSS3 SPOJ.com - Problem HORRIBLE SPOJ.com - Problem IOPC1207 SPOJ.com - Problem GSS2 SPOJ.com - Problem SEGSQRSS SPOJ.com - Problem ORDERSET SPOJ.com - Problem HELPR2D2 SPOJ.com - Problem TEMPLEQ You can find more questions on A2 Online JudgeÂ  Once you will be comfortable with basic questions , then read about topics like lazy propagation and much more variations which you would explore while seeing new questions. 1 thing I found among most of the coders is that they reuse seg tree/BIT tutorial code in contest or in practice problem . But I would urge everyone to code (atleast) these algo from scratch every time you are attempting any qns on this. The benefit of this would be that its concept would be crystal clear to you and you can modify seg tree / BIT according to your needs ( as most of the contest won't ask you simply to find min/max/sum in range). If you find any of these tutorials tough, then I would love to answer your queries.
