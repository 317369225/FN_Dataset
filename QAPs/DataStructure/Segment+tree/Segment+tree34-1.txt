What is the difference between a segment tree and a Fenwick tree (binary index tree)?
Segment tree A segment tree is a tree data structure for storing intervals or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point. It is, in principle, a static structure; that is, its structure cannot be modified once it is built. A similar data structure is the interval tree. A segment tree for a set I of n intervals uses O(n log n) storage and can be built in O(n log n) time. Segment trees support searching for all the intervals that contain a query point in O(log n + k), k being the number of retrieved intervals or segments. Applications of the segment tree are in the areas of computational geometry, and geographic information system. Fenwick tree Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree is a data structure providing efficient methods for calculation and manipulation of the prefix sums of a table of values.Fenwick trees are used to implement the arithmetic coding algorithm. Development of operations it supports were primarily motivated by use in that case. Using a Fenwick tree it is very easy to generate the cumulative sum table. From this cumulative sum table it is possible to calculate the summation of the frequencies in a certain range in order of
