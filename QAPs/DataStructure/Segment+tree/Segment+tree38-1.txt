How do you solve this SPOJ problem using both BIT and a segment tree?
The idea is to treat the [math]a_i[/math], [math]b_i[/math] and [math]c_i[/math] asymmetrically. The BIT/segment tree supports minimum queries for key intervals starting at [math]1[/math]. We use [math]c_i[/math] as values and [math]b_i[/math] as keys. Those are inserted in the order of increasing [math]a_i[/math]. This way, for each [math]a_i[/math] in turn, the data structure allows queries for the smallest value of [math]c_j[/math] (possibly [math]\infty[/math]) for [math]b_j[/math] in [math][1..b_i)[/math] and [math]a_j < a_i[/math]. We have [math]c_j < c_i[/math] if and only if contestant [math]i[/math] is not excellent. Updated 36w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
