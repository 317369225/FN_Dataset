How can I solve with a Segment tree UVa problem ID:1232 Skyline?
This is kind of tricky segment tree problem if you have only solved typical segment tree problems. To solve this problem, you actually need two segment trees. We will call them mintree and maxtree. They will store the minimum and the maximum height respectively of an interval. For each building, we will make a query to calculate the overlap, and then update the segment trees. In each query, if we need to find an interval [L, R) such that our height is equal or greater than the maximum height in that interval (maxtree value), then we know that there is an overlap equal to the length of our building inside that interval. If the minimum height is more than our height (mintree value), then the overlap in that interval is 0. If the minimum height is less or equal than our height, and the maximum is more than our height, we have to make the query to the sub intervals [L, (L+R)/2), [(L+R)/2, R), typical of segment trees queries, and return the sum of those values. To make the update, you will also make the typical recursive calls of a segment tree. In each interval you are, you always update the maxtree value if your height is greater. If your building covers all the interval, then you can also update the mintree value. If your building does not cover all the interval, then you make the recursive call to the sub intervals as showed above, and update the mintree value based on the new values of those sub intervals. You don't need to update the maxtree value here as we have updated it before. Updated 72w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
