Is it possible to make a Segment Tree on 2D with Lazy Propagation?
Yes. It would work no differently from how lazy propagation works in 1-D. A 2-D segment tree just means that you first compute a segment tree over the x-dimension for each y-coordinate, and then for each segment range, build a segment tree for that segment over the y-dimension. For lazy propagation, when you make a change, it applies to O (log x) different x segments, so that's O (log x) different segment trees that get marked with lazy updates in O (log y) time, making the marking operation O (log x log y). For propagating the update, we propagate it the same way as in 1-D segment trees.
