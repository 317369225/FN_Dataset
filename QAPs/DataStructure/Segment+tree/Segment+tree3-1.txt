What is a segment tree and what are its applications?
I read Segment Trees for the first time while solving the problem on Range Minima. I followed the topcoder tutorial : Algorithm Tutorials , it has explained it very nicely. There are some good blogs which explains this concept beautifully Let us code . You will get to know it's application once you understand it nicely (By term nicely, I do not mean the coding part. I mean to understand the data structure properly). I would encourage you to read BIT also. This is again an equally powerful as compared to Segment Trees. I would recommend you to read BIT from Algorithm TutorialsÂ  and Binary Indexed Trees with some Solved Example. (written by me :D ) .
