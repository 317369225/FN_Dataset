What is the approach for solving GSS1 and GSS3 on SPOJ using segment trees?
Assuming you know how to create and use a basic segment tree. Here main thing to focus is what should be stored in intermediate nodes of Segment Tree. For that, maintain 5 values for each node. 1. Total - sum of all elements under this node 2. Left - maximum sum of elements which are contiguous from left end. i.e. max(Left of left child, Total of left child + Left of right child) 3. Right - maximum sum of elements which are contiguous from right end. i.e. max(Right of right child, Total of right child + Right of left child) 4. RightOfLeftPlusLeftOfRight - maximum sum of elements which are contiguous and form right part of the left node and left part of the right node. 5. MaxValue - max value among these 4 and MaxValue of left and right children. While constructing the tree fill up all these values for the new node using values of its left and right children. Even while searching you need to create nodes on the fly (for the queried range) and fill these details to get the required value. Hope this helps.
