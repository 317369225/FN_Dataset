Segment Trees:Â What is the difference between Sqrt-decomposition and Segment tree?
They are interchangeable for some problems, but not all. Some reasons why you might use one rather than the other: A problem can be solved using either one, but square root decomposition is easier and fast enough to pass. (Segment Tree Problem - Codeforces) You need to compute a function that is not additive, so you can't use a segment tree solution. (How to solve problem "Powerful Array" - Codeforces) I didn't find an example of a problem where a segment tree would work but square root decomposition would not.
