What are good tutorials for learning segment tree and BIT structure for ICPC? And what are good problems for practice?
You may find some of the problems for BIT on CodeChef here: http://www.codechef.com/tags/pro... The editorials of the problems will contain resources to learn BIT as well. Similarly you can find problems with other topics using this tag feature. Hope that helps.
