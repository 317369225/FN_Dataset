What is the approach for solving GSS1 and GSS3 on SPOJ using segment trees?
In these types of problems, the whole solution depends upon how you combine two nodes to form a higher level node. Other operations such as initialization, query & update remain unchanged throughout almost all segment tree problems. Here, you are asked to find the largest subarray sum between any two given indices in an array. So, for a segment tree node, you need to maintain 4 fields: left,right, sum & best. Left: the best sum you can obtain provided the subarray starts from the leftmost index in the interval. Right: the best sum you can obtain provided the subarray ends at the rightmost index in the interval. Best: The largest subarray sum you can have in an interval. Sum: Sum of all elements in the interval. The values of these fields at the leaf nodes are trivial. Try to find the values of these fields at higher level node by trying to extend the left sum, the right sum & devising the best sum from the available values.
