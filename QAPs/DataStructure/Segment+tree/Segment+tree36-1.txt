What should be the maximum size of segment tree built on an array on 100,000 elements?
The nearest power of 2 to 100,000 is 131072 (2^17). So when a segment tree is built we need to have atleast 2^17 leaf nodes in the tree representing each element but of course there will be a lot of nodes not actually having any value in them.             If you are building an array based segment tree where array[node] is the parent for array[2*node] and array[2*node+1] then a brute force implementation will have 2^18 nodes - 31072 nodes(to remove the unused ones)= 231072 nodes
