What are the advantage of binary indexed tree (BIT or fenwick tree) over segment tree?
A BIT is a specific version of the Segment tree which mostly helps to find out the cumulative frequency or so, but the segment tree is used to perform various operations like finding min, max, lcm, etc. of a given array over an interval. So a Segment tree is basically a superset of BIT. However when it comes to BIT, it's fast, easy to code and uses less memory compared to a generic version of Segment tree. However codes like: Efficient and easy segment trees - Codeforces, show that even segment tree can use less memory, easy to code and be as fast as BIT. I would suggest u to just master segment tree (like the one given above), and then u wouldn't need to even use BIT ever.
