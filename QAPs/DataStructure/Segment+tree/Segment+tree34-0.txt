What is the difference between a segment tree and a Fenwick tree (binary index tree)?
Generally, segment tree is more powerful than binary index tree. You can use segment tree to do range maximum/minimum query(RMQ, query the max or min element in range i..j for example). And with Segment Trees and lazy propagation  all range operation like update a range to a value, add a same value to a range can be implement in segment tree with time complexity of O(logN), while only range sum query can be done in binary index tree with the same time complexity  using a trick in described in What is the difference between a binary indexed tree and a segment tree? - Codeforces  .
