Why are there only 12 pitch notes (C, C#, ..., B) in the world?I learned that pitch is determined by frequency of the sound waves. I know that each note has specific frequency Hz. For example, C3 is 130.8Hz and C#3 is 138.6. So what the heck is between those two pitch notes? If there are so many pitches between these half-step notes, how come it feels like almost all pitches in the world can be identified as one of the 12 pitch notes?
It is true that the western system has only 12 semitones in notation and they are equally tempered (separated with an equal pitch). But if you listen closely to the violin or vocals you’d realize that frequencies in between the semitones are present too. They were pianos that were in production earlier with special pedals that could vary the pitch of the notes so that you could obtain microtones (tones in between 2 semitones). But this made music highly complex, and most ears were not accustomed to this special addition to the piano.   If you look at music around the world, you do find music in which an octave is divided into more or less than 12 notes. In the Chinese system you have the 5, 7 and 12 note octaves which of equal temperament. The Indian classical music system uses a moveable seven-note scale with intervals smaller or greater than a semitone.   The tuning of musical instruments to A440, which is tuning the A note to a frequency of 440Hz came into practice only after the standardization of pitch. Earlier in time, the A note was tuned to a wide frequency around 440Hz and a lot of instruments were tuned to 435 Hz, which was then recommended by the Austrian government.    If you have the opportunity to ever come across pianos or other instruments that are quite old, (150 years or more) you’d realize that the A note is tuned to a slightly different pitch. These instruments were not usually upgraded to the A440 convention as the frame of the instrument would generally not be able to handle the additional stress.
