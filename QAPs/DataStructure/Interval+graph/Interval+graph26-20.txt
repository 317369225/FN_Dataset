What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
Not a psychologist or neuro-scientist by any standards, but I do know from one of my psychologist teacher that saying something out-loud over and over again (10-20 times) that's simple, before going to bed will result in it happening. More specifically, before you go to bed tonight, if you were to say: "I will wake up at 7:30" you will. It's a trick he said he's used before, and that I have also done with much success. You can also do it with something like bed-wetting or sleepless nights to try and curb it. Although for it to become a fully-fledged habit, you must repeat it. Updated 3 Dec 2012 â€¢ View Upvotes
