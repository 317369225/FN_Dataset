What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
I'm going to steer clear of the Realm of Topological/Set-Theoretic Insanity and present a fairly counterintuitive result well within the bounds of high-school mathematics. Here goes: There exists a polynomial in two variables with real coefficients, P:R×R→R  , whose range is the unbounded open interval (0,∞)  . This is clearly impossible for a polynomial in one variable, as the absolute value of the evaluations of such polynomials increases without bound as we let the argument go to ±∞  . So, real numbers can't be mapped to real numbers arbitrarily close to zero without zero itself being attained. This is however not the case for polynomials in two variables and here's an explicit construction to demonstrate this fact. P(x,y)=(xy−1) 2 +x 2   Firstly, note that since P(x,y)  is the sum of the squares of two reals, it has to be non-negative. Secondly, for the above to be equal to zero, we must have xy=1  and x=0  , which cannot both hold simultaneously. Thirdly, given any positive real α  , we have P(α  √ ,1/α  √ )=α  . Hence, the range is (0,∞)  as claimed. Updated 8 Jul 2013 • View Upvotes
