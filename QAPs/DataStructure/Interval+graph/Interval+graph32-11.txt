What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
If by "you don't say" you mean "WOW, is that really true??", then I'm always impressed by Liouville's theorem in complex analysis: if a function is entire (differentiable everywhere) and bounded, then it must be constant! Of course, this only holds if the function is differentiable in the entire COMPLEX plane, and not just on the real number line. This is used in many different theorems, including a (almost) one-line proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra: "If p(z) has no roots, then 1/p(z) must be bounded, and hence constant."
