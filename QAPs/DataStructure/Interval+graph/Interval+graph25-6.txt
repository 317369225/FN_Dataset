Here's a disturbing and underrated one: Hausdorff's paradox It's a precursor to the infamous Banach-Tarski paradox. It states that there exists a certain countable subset N  of the usual sphere S 2   , such that if you throw that subset away, the remainder S 2 −N  can be partitioned into three congruent, disjoint subsets A,B,C  , with B∪C  also being congruent to A,B,  and C  . It may take a few reads and some thought for how bad that is to fully sink in. Remember that throwing away countably many points from an uncountable manifold like a sphere doesn't change its measure or how it looks. So this is effectively saying there are three disjoint subsets of the sphere, all congruent and whose union is essentially the whole sphere (and thus all having area 1/3  that of the sphere), but with the property that if you consider two of them lumped together at once, that also has total area 1/3  the sphere instead of 2/3  as expected. Complete nonsense. It demonstrates that finite additivity of measure can't be achieved on arbitrary subsets of the sphere - the subsets A,B,C  are in fact nonmeasurable. The Banach-Tarski paradox takes the ideas of this result further to give the whole pea-into-sun nightmare. I think the Hausdorff paradox is equally disturbing, on an even more basic level.
