Why are there only 12 pitch notes (C, C#, ..., B) in the world?I learned that pitch is determined by frequency of the sound waves. I know that each note has specific frequency Hz. For example, C3 is 130.8Hz and C#3 is 138.6. So what the heck is between those two pitch notes? If there are so many pitches between these half-step notes, how come it feels like almost all pitches in the world can be identified as one of the 12 pitch notes?
a great question! there is a fascinating section on the musical scale in P. D. Ouspensky's book In Search of the Miraculous. excerpt 1: The seven tone scale is the formula of a cosmic law which was worked out by ancient schools and applied to music. it mentions ratios that are uneven (not equal temperament) thus: 1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1, from C(n) to C(n+1). the differences are: 1/8, 1/8, 1/12, 1/6, 1/6, 5/24, 1/8 moreover the book also mentions that each octave contains inner octaves, suggesting that there are 7 notes between all of these seven notes. and so on for those inner octaves ad infinitum. links: Inner Octaves and Eastern Music Fourth Way enneagram music is indeed sublime!
