What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
Benford's law, which states that the first digit of a list of real-life naturally occurring set of numbers follows a specific non-uniform distribution, given by the following mathematical formula: P(d)=log b (d+1)/d  where d is the digit and b is the base of the number system. One of the consequences of this amazing law is that the number 1 would occur as the first digit more often than any other number in a naturally occurring data set. Updated 4 Nov • View Upvotes
