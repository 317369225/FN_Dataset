What approaches should one follow when solving a problem be it a puzzle, riddle, programming or a real life problem?Also what are the different ways (strategies or methodologies) to attack problems? Please provide an algorithmic approach. If multiple methods or strategiesÂ  exists depending on different scenarios then mention them as well. Also it'll be helpful if one can give examples on how to apply it to a problem.
I can prove that there is no single algorithm to solve any problem or puzzle. Ever heard of undecidability. There is a theorem which states that there is no turing machine which can decide any language which means there is no correct algorithm for your question because it can't exist mathematically. :)
