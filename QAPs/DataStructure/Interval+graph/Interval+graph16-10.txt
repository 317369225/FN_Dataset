What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
1. Dynamic Programming : For one obvious reason - "Being Greedy doesn't necessarily work!" 2. Sorting algorithm : Unless the efficiency matters, anyone will do! 3. Search algorithm : I prefer binary search, but for most cases anything will do as long as it does it's job. 4. Dijkstra's algorithm : Well, being greedy sometimes work! 5. A* algorithms : A special case of best-first search. Very helpful in AI problems. 6. Backtracking : "Never forget where you came from". 7. Hash search or Hashing : Sometimes you do get bored of using binary search. 8. RSA/DSA : Some security.. finally! 9. Bellman-Ford : Just in case if the weights are negative! 10. Minimum Spanning Tree : It's the last one and actually you can live without this one!
