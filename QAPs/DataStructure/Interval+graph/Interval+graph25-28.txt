What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
Ant on a rubber rope Straight from Wikipedia, an ant starts to crawl along a taut rubber rope 1 km long at a speed of 1 cm per second (relative to the rubber it is crawling on). At the same time, the rope starts to stretch uniformly by 1 km per second, so that after 1 second it is 2 km long, after 2 seconds it is 3 km long, etc. Will the ant ever reach the end of the rope? And, what do you know, it does! I, for one, have a hard time explaining the solution to people, let alone myself. But that's not all: whatever the length of the rope and the relative speeds of the ant and the stretching, providing the ant's speed and the stretching remain steady, the ant will always be able to reach the end given sufficient time! Edit: I recently came across the Identity theorem and thought I should add this to my answer: if two complex-valued, holomorphic functions defined on a simply connected domain D  are equal for a non-empty subset of D  , no matter how small, then the two functions are equal throughout the domain!
