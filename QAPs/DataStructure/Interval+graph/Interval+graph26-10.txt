What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
Assuming you're after more practical things, here's one that I've used. Telling people that they're "free to choose" after a request makes them far more likely to conduct your request. As  part of a French study, researchers wanted to know if they could change  how much money people gave to a total stranger using just a few  specially encoded words. They discovered a technique so simple and  effective it doubled how much people gave. The  turn of phrase has been shown to not only increase how much bus fare  people give, but was also effective in boosting charitable donations and  participation in voluntary surveys. In fact, a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies involving over 22,000 participants concluded that these  few words, placed at the end of a request, are a highly effective way to  gain compliance, doubling the likelihood of people saying “yes.” What were the magic words the researchers discovered? The phrase, “but you are free to accept or refuse.” The  “but you are free” technique demonstrates how we are more likely to be  persuaded when our ability to choose is reaffirmed. The effect was  observed not only during face-to-face interactions, but also over email.  Though the research did not directly look at how products and services  might use the technique, the study provides several practical insights  for how companies can influence customer behavior.
