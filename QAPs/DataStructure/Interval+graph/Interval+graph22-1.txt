What is the intuition behind distributions without means?Where mean doesn't converge such as Cauchy distribution. What kind of implication does this have on physics? Certain quantities such as temperature are defined as mean in physics.
In the mathematical, theoretical sense, there is no reason why a distribution should necessarily have a mean.  We're conditioned to treat the mean as "holy," since it is used so often that we take it for granted.  But really it is an artificial concept, and again that implies that some distributions will have means and some won't.  Any density that declines slowly to 0 will be like this, e.g. the density 1/t on (1,infinity).  But the real answer is that there is NO intuition needed here, in any applied sense.  In the real world, there are no unbounded distributions (and no continuous ones, for that matter).  They are all bounded, and thus all have means.  We may model a bounded, discrete distribution by an unbounded, continuous one, but that is just an approximation, and often a poor one at that. But again in an applied sense, there is nothing holy about the mean even if it does exist.  Most statistical methodology is based on it, but that is mainly for historical reasons.
