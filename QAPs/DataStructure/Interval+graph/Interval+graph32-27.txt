What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
Hello, Well personally, I think there is no such mathematical theorem. What I am saying is, always give a second thought to a statement even if it sounds obvious at first. For example, let f(x)  be a real valued continuous function and x∈R,  such that, 1. f(x)→a,x→∞  . Does it imply that f^' (x) \rightarrow 0, \, x \rightarrow \infty ? 2. f^' (x) \rightarrow 0, \, x \rightarrow \infty . Does this imply f(x)→b,x→∞  ? where a  and b  are two real constants. At first 'yes' was a pretty obvious answer to me in both cases, but I was wrong, because of Barbalat's Lemma. Thank You
