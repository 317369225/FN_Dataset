What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
Neurofeedback. I stumbled upon this when researching brain entrainment. There is still a lot of controversy regarding the legitimacy in entrainment's efficacy (many scientists are on both sides of the fence), however this research has uncovered benefits in the realm of neurofeedback. See, brain entrainment is essentially where you use either audio (in the form of isochronic tones or binaural beats) or visual stimulation to trick your brain into a specific brainwave state. Then, theoretically, you should be able to reap the benefits of that state. There is research supporting the effectiveness of entrainment, but the subject still remains a point of contention among researchers, however, another method is learning to control your bodily processes so that you can slip into brainwave states at will. The way neurofeedback works is by monitoring your EEG (electroencephalogram) output (in Hertz). This allows you to learn to control that output through concentration. The reason this is such an area of interest for research is because it has been shown that when the brain is in an alpha brainwave state (8 - 12 Hz) both hemispheres of the brain tend to communicate better. This is known as hemispheric synchronization. It was found that in elite athletes, before performing at peak levels, EEG scans showed these athletes' brains gave off a spike of alpha waves. http://ijr.cgpublisher.com/produ... So now there is a basis for believing that neurofeedback and brainwave states can help increase performance levels physically. As research has continued, it has also been uncovered that this same procedure can increase working memory in healthy individuals. http://www.sciencedirect.com/sci... It is even being used to treat depression (something that a few PhD's had already discovered they could do with entrainment). http://www.sciencedirect.com/sci...
