Y axis and x axis must have different graduations? Like the x-axis can be like 10,20,30...etc but y-axis can't have the same intervals. Is this true in Standard Scientific graph plotting?
They can have the same scale. There is no reason why they could not have the same gradations. We normally choose the most appropriate scale to show the best level of detail. It rarely is the case that, of all possible scales, both axes show the same scale. I suspect that is why you were led to believe that this might not be allowed.
