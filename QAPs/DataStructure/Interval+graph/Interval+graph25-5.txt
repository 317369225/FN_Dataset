What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
You can turn a sphere inside out without poking any holes in it. (Smale's paradox) Something can have an infinite perimeter and a finite surface area (Koch snowflake), a finite volume and an infinite surface area (Gabriel's Horn), or even zero volume and an infinite surface area (Menger sponge). A surface can have a single side (MÃ¶bius strip and Klein bottle) If you take an infinitely long random walk in one or two dimensions, you will return to your starting point with probability 1. If you take a random walk in 3 or more dimensions, the probability of making it back to the starting point is significantly less than 1. At least one of these results is counterintuitive, and deciding which one is left as an exercise to the reader. (Random walks in higher dimensions) Finally, this is more unintuitive than counterintuitive, but I've always found Ramanujan's formula for pi to be fascinating. How the heck did someone figure out that both sides of that equation are equal??
