Is there a function where the derivative at a point is zero, but it is monotonically increasing at that point?
Perhaps, the confusion here is that if rate of change of the function at any point is zero, how can it increase immediately next to that point? But, you are asking for monotonically increasing function, which can also be referenced to a non-decreasing function, which means the value of the function should increase as we go in the positive direction of the x-axis, or just stay constant, but it should never decrease. So, a function like y=x 3   , is monotonically increasing. The question remains, whether it is a strictly increasing function. If there are horizontal lines in the graph of a function, it is not strictly increasing. But, there are no horizontal lines in the graph of x 3   . If there is anything in it, it is the point of inflection at x = 0. So, a function like y=x 3   is monotonically as well as strictly increasing function even if there exists a point in its domain where the derivative is zero.
