Would society be better off if everyone had a basic understanding of differential and integral calculus?
No. Learning even basic calculus is quite difficult, especially if you are not motivated to do it. That means it would take up a great deal of time (remember, a lot of people never understand the prerequisites well enough to start learning calculus, so you would need to teach those first). Since it probably isn't feasible to increase the amount of time people spend in education, that means people would have to learn calculus at the expense of learning other things. Calculus is a very useful subject. It has applications in a very broad range of jobs (almost anything involving science, engineering or finance, as well as various others). However, most people don't do those kinds of jobs. Calculus isn't particularly useful in everyday life outside of work, so most people rarely if ever need to know any calculus. That means the benefit from making them learn it is minimal (and they would soon forget it, since they don't use it). If you are pretty certain you won't end up in a job that requires calculus (which, by the time you have reached the point of needing to decide whether to learn calculus, a lot of people will be), then there are far more useful things to spend your time learning.
