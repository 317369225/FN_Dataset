How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Originally Answered: Which programming languages should I know to get an internship or job at a top-notch company like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?Adam Hupp is right on the mark as far as Facebook is concerned. Let me add that I let interviewees choose the language when coding, and I never set out to ask about language subtleties. I'm interested in the candidate being able to implement an algorithm in a language. Updated 7 Sep 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
