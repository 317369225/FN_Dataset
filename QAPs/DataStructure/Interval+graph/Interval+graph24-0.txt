What are the algorithms required to solve all problems (using C++) in any competitive coding contest?
Here is my helper list. It lists most of needed algorithms/concepts.Some elements are not algorithms (e.g. Fake, States/Concerns) and little repetitions. But 1 final advice: Initially, Given great attention to thinking skills rather than the knowledge. This is helpful for both competitions and your future. To do so, make sure you are so good in adhocks, where no algorithms are required, just pure thinking. One way to do so, is to focus with TC Div2 and CodeForces Div2. In each one, move in problem level by level. E.g. Master Div2-250, then move to Div2-500
