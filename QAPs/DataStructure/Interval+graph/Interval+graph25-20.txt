Probability theory Suppose you need to choose a number uniformly from the set [0,1]. What is the probability of choosing 0.5? It's 0. Exactly zero. This can be argued by seeing that the area under the curve of the probability density function at point 0.5 is a line, which by definition has zero area. So, probability of picking any specific point is exactly zero. Yet, when you randomly pick a number, you get some number. Convergence of series Consider the series: ∑ ∞ n=1 1n p    . If p is large, then the terms converge to zero very fast, and the series is convergent. If p is small, then the terms converge to zero relatively slowly, and the series is divergent. The threshold is at 1. For any p>1, the series converges. For p at most 1, it diverges. Now it isn't intuitive why p=1+ϵ  converges, while p=1 doesn't. Another interesting related fact is that for p=1, the series diverges extremely slowly: The sum of first 10 43   terms is less than 100. Harmonic series (mathematics) Cycloid A cycloid is a curve that looks like the red curve below: Now, if you have a path that is in the form of a cycloid, and you leave a ball to roll on that curve from rest (as shown), then irrespective of the initial position of the ball, it takes a fixed amount of time to reach the bottom of the curve.
