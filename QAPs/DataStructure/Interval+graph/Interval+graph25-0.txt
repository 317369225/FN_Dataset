What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
I echo Alon's sentiment that there are too many results to really put in a Quora answer. However, I'll try my hand at naming a few of my favorite odd results. I'll add some more as I get more time Brownian Motion produces continuous everywhere, differentiable nowhere paths, almost surely In other words, we get things like this, almost always: In Physics terms, this means that particles placed in liquids do not have a well-defined velocity. More formally, this is stated as [0]: Lemma: Let W  be the Wiener measure on C(R)  , the set of continuous real-valued functions. Then: W(C(R))=1,W(C k (R))=0,∀k>0  where C k (R)  is the set of functions whose j  th derivatives are continuous, for all j<k  . One can think of Brownian motion on R  as a machine that generates a path γ:R→R  such that the variance of where γ(t)  grows linearly in t  . What's counterintuitive as first (as Alon Amit mentioned) is that it almost surely produces paths that are jagged and absolutely not smooth. Another associated and weird fact is that W(H\"older(α))=0  if α>1/2  and W(H\"older(α))>0  if α<1/2  [1] The Uniform Distribution on the n  -sphere tends to Brownian Motion In other words, if I sample vectors from a really high-dimensional sphere, its almost as if I'm generating a Brownian path. Note that this is distinct from the usual concentration of measure facts that people state about spheres. More formally the statement is the following: Theorem (Wiener Sphere): Let μ S n    be the uniform measure on the unit n  -sphere S n ={(x 1 ,…,x n+1 ):x 2 1 +⋯+x 2 n+1 =1}  . Then μ S n  →W t   weakly, where W t   is the Wiener measure (Brownian motion) on C([0,1])  . [2] One might in fact argue that this is a somewhat intuitive result, because this is what guided Wiener to the proof of existence of the Wiener measure. This result is highly counterintuitive, to me at least, because the uniform distribution on a sphere is such a 'nice' object.  The history of this result is quite interesting, because it was not fully proved until 1993 and it required the use of Robinson's non-standard analysis. However, Poincaré discovered something very similar to this result in the early 1900s, namely that if one picks an interval (a,b)  , then the projection of the uniform measure on an n  -sphere onto (a,b)  on any axis in R n+1   is 'almost Gaussian'. That is, as n↑∞  , this projection becomes Gaussian. The pseudo-intuition for this is roughly the following. Suppose that I draw a vector (uniformly) on the n  -sphere, v ⃗ =(v 1 ,…,v n+1 ),v ⃗ ⋅v ⃗ =1  . Then for each k∈{0,…,n+1}  , defined a 'point path' Q(v ⃗ ,kn+1 )=∑ k i=1 v i   . Extend this to a continuous path Q(v ⃗ ,t)  by linearly interpolating between the n+2  points. A picture of what this might look like is: The claim is that the path Q(v ⃗ ,t)  converges a.s. to a path generated by the Wiener measure. All real division algebras are isomorphic to R,R 2 ,R 4   and R 8   . As such the only parallelizable spheres are those in dimensions 1,3  and 7  This is just a ridiculous result because it took Topological K-theory [3] to prove (it is in fact somewhat related to the Freedman's exotic spheres that Mikael Bengtsson referred to).
