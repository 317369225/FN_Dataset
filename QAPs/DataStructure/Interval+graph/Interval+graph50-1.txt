How can I create a graph that has an uneven X-axis interval? It is also necessary to have vertical lines at the end points (left and right). I would also like to have a small gap between the left value to the vertical axis. The graph below is what I would like to create using my Excel.
if anyone could advise how to set the graph (I tried both Line and scatter) on my excel but it couldn't give the desired spacing I was looking for. Much less to mention the specific values that I wanted to display too.
