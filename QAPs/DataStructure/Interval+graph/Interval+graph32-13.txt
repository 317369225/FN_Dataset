What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
I have a couple of theorems that I initially thought to be obviously true, but are actually quite non-trivial. First is the comparability principle for sets, which says that given sets A  and B  , then either |A|≤|B|  or |B|≤|A|  (in words, given two sets, either one is smaller than the other or they are the same size). This statement seems really innocuous and trivial, but, as it turns out, the statement is equivalent (in ZF) to the ever-controversial Axiom of Choice. Second, is Gödel's completeness theorem, which states that a first-order theory proves a statement if and only if it holds in every model of that theory (equivalently, a first order theory proves a contradiction if and only if the theory has no models, or every consistent theory can be expanded to a consistent theory that contains either φ  or ¬φ  for every first order sentence φ  ). One way to interpret such a theorem is to say that logic works in the way that we want it to; that every true consequence of a theory can proven to be a consequence of that theory. However, it turns out that completeness is something that second-order logic does not have, and it doesn't have it in a really strong sense. As a consequence of Gödel's incompleteness theorems, there is no finitely describable deductive system for second-order logic that will allow you to prove every consequence of a second-order theory. What a bummer.
