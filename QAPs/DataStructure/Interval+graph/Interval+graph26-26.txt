What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
TDCS - Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation has been studied by numerous scientists and in university labs, primarily in the U.S., U.K. & Australia. The process involves attaching 1 positive and 1 negative electrode to specific areas of the cranium, and sending very low electrical current to stimulate or relax certain areas of brain that control specific functions. TDCS is getting attention from gamers wanting to increase their speed of thought and action. TDCS double-blind studies have also shown promise with depression, ADHD, memory function, insomnia and a host of other conditions.
