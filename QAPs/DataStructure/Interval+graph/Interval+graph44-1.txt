Would society be better off if everyone had a basic understanding of differential and integral calculus?
A basic understanding shouldn't require much.  The rules of differentiation and integration go beyond basic. What's in a basic understanding?  How about these four points? If you have a changing quantity, not only is there a value to the quantity at any time, but there's a rate of change of that quantity.  For example, if the quantity is the distance you've travelled while driving on the highway, then the rate of change of that distance is your velocity as shown on the car's speedometer. If you know the quantity at any given time, then the rate of change of that quantity is the slope of a line tangent to the graph. When the rate of change is constant, such as when you're driving on the highway and your speedometer always shows you the same speed, then the distance you travel over a time interval is equal to the rate times the elapsed time. When the rate of change is not constant, such as when you're speeding up or slowing down, then you can still determine the distance travelled from the rate.  Graph the rate of change, and the distance travelled is the area between that graph and the x-axis.  (The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)
