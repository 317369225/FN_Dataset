What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
This is actually perhaps a non-answer, since it's not really a theorem... just "obviously" true. Let A i∈I   be an arbitrary collection of nonempty sets. Then × i∈I A i ≠∅  . It seems obviously true. Except... it's not a theorem. In fact, it's independent of the Zermelo-Frankel axioms of set theory. It's the Axiom of Choice, and you can have a consistent mathematics with or without it, although both alternatives have counterintuitive implications. If the Axiom is false, we must allow that, even though finite Cartesian products are invariably bigger than the sets in the product, that infinite Cartesian products somehow get smaller. It's akin to multiplying an infinite list of non-zero numbers and getting zero... it doesn't seem to make sense. On the other hand, if you accept it, you end up with non-measurable sets, meaning that events can be described that are not impossible but have no meaningful probability, and that a sphere could theoretically be decomposed into five pieces that, after being moved through space (rigid motions) could be reassembled into two spheres of that size. In other words, volume is not conserved. As with the Continuum Hypothesis, mathematics allows you the choice between two consistent realities, but both are counterintuitive.
