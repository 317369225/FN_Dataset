What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
Wave-particle duality. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav... If I read enough about it, it kinda starts to make sense. But, as soon as I stop reading, I start to lose it. Five minutes later, it makes no sense to me at all. Some famous person once said that he only had one question for God: "Why turbulence?"  And that's a really great question, but first I want to know, "Why the duality?"
