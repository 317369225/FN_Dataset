What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
Quantum physics, infinity, the size of the universe, my own non-existence... none of these are as tantalizingly unfathomable as... A tesseract A four-dimensional cube. Really, it shouldn't be that difficult. Connect up two points and you have a line, two lines and you have a square, two squares and you have a cube, two cubes and you have a tesseract. You can see one spinning, turning... and apparently folding and unfolding through itself: They're not just impossible to grasp, they seem to be just out of reach. It's frustrating.
