How many graphs can you name that should be known by calc I and II?
Probably the last time I had to graph a function was in multivariable calculus during the first semester of college. Strictly speaking, the graph isn't necessary for solving the problem, but having a picture helps with setting up the correct limits for the 3d integrals. For all subsequent physics and math classes such as recursive function theory, linear algebra, quantum, e&m, analytic mechanics,..., I can't remember any particular use of graphs.   Of course, it helps to know how common functions like log a (x)  or ax 3 +bx 2 +c  behaves, however at this point you probably already have a very good numeric intuition (e.g. "log(x) goes to -infty as it approaches the vertical axis from the right"), so there's not much use for graphs later on in math. On the other hand I didn't take complex analysis, so perhaps graphs are somewhat useful there for visualizing the mapping C→C  .
