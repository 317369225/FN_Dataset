How could we better imagine infinity?
If you're talking about the infinity that's larger than any real number, there's a way to bring it down to size.  You can do that if you shrink all the real numbers down to an open interval of numbers, and there are lots of ways to do that. Take the real numbers to be the horizontal green line below, and draw a tangent circle below the origin.  Image a line drawn from a point on the green line to the center of the circle. It meets the circle in a point on the upper half of the circle.  That gives you a correspondence between the infinite line and the finite semicircle. The points on the circle can be thought of as angles between –90° to +90°, where 0° corresponds to the tangent point.  Note that the angles –90° to +90° actually don't correspond to points on the line.  They would correspond to –∞ and +∞. What you're doing here is taking the arctangent of a number to get an angle.  Usually that's done in radians rather than degrees.  The graph of the arctangent function is illustrated below. Thus, the arctangent function gives a correspondence between real numbers and the numbers in the open interval  (–π/2,+π/2).  So all the numbers can be shrunk to an open interval, and then you can imagine ±∞ as being the endpoints of that interval. (There are lots of other functions besides arctangent that do this, but it's nice to be able to illustrate the correspondence between a tangent line and the points on a semicircle, and that correspondence describes the arctangent function.)
