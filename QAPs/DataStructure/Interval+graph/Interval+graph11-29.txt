As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
I think you could cover more breadth and introduce emerging areas in algorithms. Some topics I will suggest: 1. Online algorithms (competitive ratio, potential function) 2. Quantum computation (small introduction with may be Shor's Algorithm). 3. Approximation Algorithms (Christofides algorithm for TSP, it is simple and improving it is the biggest open problem in Approx Algo, Some LP Duality may be using set cover) 4. Randomized Algorithm (Karger's mincut, mention of Markov, Chebyshev, Chernoff's bound in math appendix) 5. Parallel and Distributed Algorithm. (basic introduction) 6. Fixed parameter Algorithm. (basic introduction) I find two much stress is given on the data structures. You could split the book into two parts: 1. Algorithms and 2. Data Structures.
