What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
State-specific memory.  It is easier to remember a thing when you are in the same 'state' in which you learned it.  'State' is a pretty loose term, it can refer to where you are or what your body is doing or what sort of stimuli are present.  As a student this can be very useful: if you are going to take a test in a particular room, do some of your studying in that room.  It will make it easier to remember the material.
