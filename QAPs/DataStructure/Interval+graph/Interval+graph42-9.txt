Why are there only 12 pitch notes (C, C#, ..., B) in the world?I learned that pitch is determined by frequency of the sound waves. I know that each note has specific frequency Hz. For example, C3 is 130.8Hz and C#3 is 138.6. So what the heck is between those two pitch notes? If there are so many pitches between these half-step notes, how come it feels like almost all pitches in the world can be identified as one of the 12 pitch notes?
Although Tim Converse's answer holds an interesting story on how equal-tempered tuning came into being, I feel that it doesn't necessarily answer the question why we identify all pitches we hear on this 12-tone scale. I'd say that this is purely for cultural reasons. In the Western world we are used to dividing an octave in 12 semi-tones, but in other parts of the world, such as Iran and the Arab world, they make a lot of use of quarter tones [1] in their music, and musicians from those parts are also trained to hear the difference between quarter-tones. Interestingly, such music cannot be reproduced on all instruments that are prevalent in Western music, because some instruments are closely tied to the 12 semi-tone system (such as a piano). Playing quarter tones requires the instrument to be able to produce pitches on a continuous scale. One more interesting tidbit about equal-tempered tuning: one reason it was invented, is that by adhering to pure mathematical ratios, it becomes impossible to transpose a piece of music to any key. This makes it hard for instance, for a singer to sing a song that - in its original key - is too high or low to reach, because you can't just transpose it. This was especially noticeable on organs, because they are built with these exact mathematical ratios in mind (pipes' lengths are related to each other). When you transpose a piece of music in this old "mathematical" tuning, it sounds increasingly "out of tune", in certain keys. Equal-temperament solves this problem. [1] Quarter tone
