What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
I've always found the restrictions on differentiable functions in complex analysis when compared to the varied properties of differentiable functions in real analysis to be amazing and counterintuitive. This is using the exact same definition of differentiable, just using a different field. In particular you have that if a function is differentiable about a point a∈C  then it is analytic about that point. That is if it has a first derivative at a point then all derivatives at that point exist.  But there are many counter examples in the R  ; eg x 2 ×sgn(x)  . See Analyticity of holomorphic functions on wikipedia. And similarly there is Liouville's theorem in complex analysis which states that if a complex function is everywhere differentiable and bounded then it must be constant. Where as in R  you have sin(x)  and 11+x 2    . Bonus: I can't resist adding in modular arithmetic n m 1  ≡n m 2    modulo p if m 1 ≡m 2   modulo (p-1) for p prime and n,m 1 ,m 2 ∈Z  . Why (p-1) for this operation but p in every other case?
