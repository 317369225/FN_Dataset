What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
A lot of people have come up with things like Bolzano's Theorem.  However Bolzano's Theorem is NOT true over the rationals but IS true over the reals.  e.g if f(x)=(x^2)-2 then f(1)=-1, f(2)=2, but there is no rational x for which f(x)=0.  So if you can come up with a proof of Bolzano's Theorem over the reals, it helps to show that the fundamental structure of the reals is different from the rationals in some way that is important.  So I think the exercise of proving it--and likewise things like the Jordan Curve Theorem--is important.  It helps to establish that the structure of the mathematical system one is using is sound.
