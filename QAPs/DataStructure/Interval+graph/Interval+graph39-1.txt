How many graphs can you name that should be known by calc I and II?
I believe that graph-sketching is (i) important (ii) useful (iii) often surprisingly easy and (iv) fun. For example, take y=1x 2 +1   . We know that y=x 2 +1  is a parabola with its vertex at the point (0,1). Taking the reciprocal makes big things small and small things big. So, when x is large and negative x 2 +1  is large and positive, so 1x 2 +1   is small and positive, i.e. the graph asymptotes towards the x-axis. When x = 0, x 2 +1=1  , so 1x 2 +1 =11 =1  . 1  is the smallest value of x 2 +1  so 11 =1  will be the largest value of 1x 2 +1   , i.e. there is a maximum at (0,1). And when x is large and positive x 2 +1  is large and positive, so 1x 2 +1   is small and positive, i.e. the graph once again asymptotes towards the x-axis. Join up the dots, and you get a pretty decent graph of y=1x 2 +1   . In general, looking at x = large and negative, x = 0 and x = large and positive, gets you a surprisingly long way.
