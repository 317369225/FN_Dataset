What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
People's dependency of other people's opinions. When you leave a person to do whatever he enjoys doing, and just give him a good nod about it, then he/she will go about doing it to the best of his ability, without much stress, and being happy whilst doing it. When you heap upon expectation upon expectation, and then criticize that person for their choice, they become insecure and make decisions in their lives that they always regret, for example jobs,Â  spouses, etc. How can a person truly understand another person's situation? any 'advice' or 'opinion' is just projection of their own insecurities. So in conclusion, people need to STFU more.
