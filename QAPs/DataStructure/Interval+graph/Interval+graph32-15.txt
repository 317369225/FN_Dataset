What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
One can actually prove that 1>0 by using field axioms of reals. Check this: https://answers.yahoo.com/questi... Here, it is proved from field axioms that: 1) For any non zero a, a^2 >0. 2) 1 is not 0. 3) Finally,1>0. (I learnt this during a course on basic real analysis) I guess this was the most 'you don't say' theorem to me. Edit: As one of the users pointed out that the referred yahoo link might go down some day, I am quoting from that link here: 1 is not actually defined to be greater than zero, it can be proven.   The real numbers are an ordered field (technically, a complete ordered  field, but completeness is not needed in this proof).  If you are  unfamiliar with the field axioms and the definition of a total ordering,  you should look those up first.  In fact, since there are different  ways of defining a total ordering, I'll just give you the definition  I'll be using: If S is a set, define a subset P (called the positive set) by the following three conditions: 1.)  Elements of P are closed under addition 2.)  Elements of P are closed under multiplication 3.)  If x is an element of S, then one and only one of the following are true:  a is in P, -a is in P, a = 0 The third condition is called the law of trichotomy.  -a is defined to  be the additive inverse of a and 0 is defined to be the additive  identity.  We define the order relation > by a > b if and only if a - b is an element of P. Now, before proving this, I have to start with a lemma.  I need to prove  that if a is a non-zero real number, then a^2 > 0 (meaning it's in  the positive set). Suppose a is a non-zero real number.  By the law of trichotomy, either a  > 0 or a < 0.  If a > 0, then by closure of multiplication in  the positive set, a^2 > 0.  If a < 0, then -a > 0.  So, a^2 = aa = (-a)(-a) = (-a)^2, which is in the positive set, again by  closure.  Thus, a^2 > 0 in all cases where a is not equal to zero. Note that I didn't justify the step aa = (-a)(-a).  This can be proven  as well, but this is taking long enough as it is, so I'll let you figure  it out (it's not that hard if you use the distributivity axiom).  Now,  onto the proof. We first want to show that 1 is not equal to zero (bear in mind that 1  is defined to be the multiplicative identity).  We'll do this by  assuming the opposite and arriving at a contradiction.  Suppose that 1 =  0.  If a is a non-zero real number, we have a = a*1 = a*0 = 0, which is  a contradiction (because we assumed a was non-zero).  Note that the  step a*0 = 0 was also unjustified.  Again, this isn't difficult to prove  using the field axioms, but I'd rather not get any more off track. So, since 1 is not equal to zero, then the law of trichotomy says that  either 1 > 0 or 1 < 0.  Now, by the definition of multiplicative  identity, 1^2 = 1*1 = 1.  However, our lemma says that given any  non-zero real number a, a^2 > 0.  Thus, 1 > 0.
