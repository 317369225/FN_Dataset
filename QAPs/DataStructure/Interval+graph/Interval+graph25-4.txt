What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
No one has mentioned the famous Arrow's impossibility theorem in social choice theory, which basically states (in simplistic terms) that when voters have at least three candidates who they must rank according to their preference, as long as the voting rules obey some simple 'democracy axioms', there must be an individual, called a dictator who's preference supersedes all other individuals regardless of what the other individuals do! This is probably the most counter-intuitive result I have ever come across, and I don't think anyone can compete with it :) By the way, arrow's contribution landed him the nobel prize later on.
