What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
The fact that some people can believe that out of all of the infinite probabilities of the universe, only the ones that they can muster up through their own philosophies and religions are true. We all have our own beliefs. That's fine. I just don't see the benefit in being militant about them when they're like ants compared to the rest of time and space. People aren't comfortable not knowing the answers. So they invent them...I could go on but i'm going to stop myself.
