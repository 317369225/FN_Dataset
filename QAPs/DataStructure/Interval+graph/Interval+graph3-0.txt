Facebook Graph API: Is there a way to retrieve a user's events within a date interval?For example, say you want to retrieve all of a person's events in the upcoming week - is there a modifier to the graph API request you can use?
Answering my own question. ;-) Looks like you can use the modifiers "since" and "until" along with a UNIX-like datestamp - e.g. https://graph.facebook.com/me/events?since=2010-11-01T00:00:00%2B0000&until=2010-11-07T00:00:00%2B0000&access_token=...
