What is a cool mathematical thing I can do on the back of a notebook?
Junk mail and used envolopes are breeding grounds for my scribble.  Usually it's last night's (hyperbolic or higher dimensional) geometry problem, or some outrageous thing in physics, but it could be something menial as calculations in base 22, 70 or 120.  105 gets a bit of a lookin too. But generally, notebook covers are more not the standing on the sholders of giants, but that little step when you stand on your tip-toes to see just a little more.  It's good for stupid ideas, because you don't have to write them up, and you can deal with them when someone else pokes them at you.
