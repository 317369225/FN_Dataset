What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
Birthday Paradox How many people are required in a set so that there is at least 50% chance that two people share birthdays, The answer is surprisingly only 23 , because even with with only 23 peoples there are 253 possible pairs . This graph shows the variation in probability of any two persons having same birthday with change in size of the set . Another variation of this famous "Birthday Problem" Suppose we have to randomly pick a number uniformly at random from 1 to 1000. What are the chances that we land on the number 42 , its 1/1000 or in other words a 0.1% chance of hitting the right number Now if modify this a little , Now we will choose 2 numbers from the range  1 - 1000  say a, b  what is the probability of  |a - b|  being 42 there are 2*958 possible values of 'a' and 'b' for which  the difference is 42 . If we treat  a - b as our number there is (2*958)/(1000*1000)  which is nearly 1/500 a significant improvement over the last one . Here is a python program that tests this by generating random numbers in range [1,1000]  in which variable first stores the number of times the first method hits upon the number second stores the number of times second method hits upon the randomly generated number def test(N): first=0 second=0 for j in range(1,N): for i in range(0,10000): n=random.randint(1,500) a=random.randint(1,1000) b=random.randint(1,1000) if(a==n): first+=1 break if(a-b==n or b-a==n): second+=1 break print(first) print(second) It will always be observed that the value of second is always greater than first the in the final results . This result with lots of modifications is used in  Pollard-rho factorization algorithm.
