What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
Self-sabotage. More specifically, I always hear something along the lines of "maybe you're too afraid of the thought of finally being happy, that you sabotage yourself to make sure you remain miserable". What?! I've never understood why anyone would do that. But I am very open about it and would admit to perhaps unconsciously doing it myself. Could someone offer an explanation? I would be more than glad to listen/read.
