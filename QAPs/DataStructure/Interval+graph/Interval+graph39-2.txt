How many graphs can you name that should be known by calc I and II?
Easy Six asside from polynominals and trig function 1. Exponential functions e^(something) 2. Logarithmic functions ln(of something) or log(of something) 3. Hyperbola 4. Circle x^2+y^2=c 5. Elipse (x^2)/a+y^2/b=c 6. Quotient function polynomial/polynomial( as mentioned by the athor of the question) ex: 1/(x^2+1) P.S. Trig: sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, ctn Polynomials: linear, quadratic, cubic, ....
