Let f(x)=min {tan x, cot x} where x belongs to the set of real numbers. What is the range, fundamental period, points of discontinuity and points of non-differentiability of f(x)?
While you draw the graph for min{tanx,cotx}, fundamental period can be found by looking for minimum interval after which graph is repeating. Points of discontinuity where graph breaks or reaches infinity. Points of non -differentiability where you will be able to draw two tangents. Typically points where you see sharp edges. You will find the common point or (solution of tanx=cotx)of graph of tanx and cotx will come under this. You canÂ  post another question ,if you want to know how to draw the graph of min{tanx,cotx}
