What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
Meditation. I don't know about neuroscientists, but Buddhist monks have been working on "brain hacks" for a long time-- like, thousands of years. Richard Davidson and his neuroscientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are currently looking at the effect of meditation on the mind at their new Center for Healthy Minds. He's a brilliant, compassionate man doing amazing work for the betterment of all. Some related work: http://healthland.time.com/2012/...
