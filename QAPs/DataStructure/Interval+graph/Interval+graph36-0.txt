Is there a function where the derivative at a point is zero, but it is monotonically increasing at that point?
The function f(x)=x 3   has a zero derivative at x=0  but is monotonically increasing everywhere. Addendum. The definition of an increasing function depends only on its values.  A function f  is said to be increasing (sometimes called strictly increasing) on an interval if for every pair of numbers x  and y  in that interval with x<y  it is the case that f(x)<f(y)  .  The function f(x)=x 3   satisfies that on the entire real line. Example. The derivative of the function f(x)=x 3   is f ′ (x)=3x 2   . Its derivative at 0 is 0, but its derivative everywhere else is positive.  The function f(x)=x 3   is increasing everywhere.  The graph y=x 3   has an infection point at x=0  .  Updated 9 Oct • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Kalash Pai
