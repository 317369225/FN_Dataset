Dichotomy paradox: That which is in locomotion must arrive at the half-way stage before it arrives at the goal.– as recounted by Aristotle, Physics VI:9, 239b10 Suppose Homer wants to catch a stationary bus. Before he can get  there, he must get halfway there. Before he can get halfway there, he  must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, he must  travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on. The resulting sequence can be represented as: This description requires one to complete an infinite number of tasks, which Zeno(Since its one of several Zeno's paradoxes) maintains is an impossibility.
