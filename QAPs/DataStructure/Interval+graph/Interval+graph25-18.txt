What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
In many data sets, there are about six times more numbers starting with the digit 1 than with the digit 9. Known as Benford's Law( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben...), it seemed counter-intuitive at first. More detailed explanation about this phenomenon is given here: Why is it that, in many data sets, there are about six times more numbers starting with the digit 1 than with the digit 9?
