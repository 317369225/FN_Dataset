If f(f(x))=x 2 −1  , what is f(x)  ?Obviously there are an infinite many solutions, but just one will suffice :P
There is no such function, f  , at least no f:R→R  I thought there would be an easy question, and so I played with some possible, simple functions. I also attempted a few substitutions. Then, I thought this might have been asked before. Indeed, a very similar question was posed on Stack Exchange: Find $f(x)$ such that $f(f(x)) = x^2 - 2$. Below is the theorem used to prove the nonexistence of the f  in that case. But, your question can be solved in the same way. In this case, Δ(g)=0−4(1)(−1)=4>1  Hence, there exists no iterative roots, i.e. there are no functions that satisfy the functional equation. For more on why this works, I suggest you either read the article linked on Stack Exchange or read the user's (san) explanation. I won't lie and say I've looked into all the details. (I will try to later, but I cannot guarantee I will understand them.) However, it seems legitimate, and I see no counter examples, at least no well-defined f  .
