Trigonometry (mathematics): How does one graph and transform a cosecant function?
graph the transformed cosecant graph Graph the transformed reciprocal function. Look first at the function The rules to transforming a sine function tell you to first factor out the 2 and get It has a horizontal shrink of 2, a horizontal shift of to the right, and a vertical shift of up 1. The figure shows the transformed sine graph. Sketch the asymptotes of the reciprocal function. The sinusoidal axis that runs through the middle of the sine function is the line y = 1. Therefore, an asymptote of the cosecant graph exists everywhere the transformed sine function crosses this line. The asymptotes of the graph involving cosecant are at Figure out what happens to the graph between each asymptote. You can use the transformed graph of the sine function to determine where the cosecant graph is positive and negative. Because the graph of the transformed sine function is positive in between the cosecant graph is positive as well and extends up when getting closer to the asymptotes. Similarly, because the graph of the transformed sine function is negative in between the cosecant is also negative in this interval. The graph alternates between positive and negative in equal intervals forever in both directions. The figure shows the transformed cosecant graph. State the new domain and range. Just as with the transformed graph of the secant function, you may be asked to state the new domain and range for the cosecant function. The domain of the transformed cosecant function is all values of x except for the values that are asymptotes. From the graph, you can see that the domain is all values of x, where where x is an integer. The range of the transformed cosecant function is also split up into two intervals:
