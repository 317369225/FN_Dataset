What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
The Banach-Tarski theorem (paradox)! This one is a highly counter-intuitive and remarkable theorem in the area of set-theoretic geometry. Statement : Given a 3-D ball, there exists a decomposition of the ball into finite number of disjoint subsets, which, then can be put back together in a different way to give two identical copies of the original ball. Here the pieces are not "solids" in the usual sense, but are infinite scattering of points. The rearrangment consists of only rotating and moving the pieces and not changing the shape or size. The reason the Banachâ€“Tarski theorem is called a paradox is that it contradicts basic geometric intuition. "Doubling the ball" by dividing it into parts and moving them around by rotations and translations, without any stretching, bending, or adding new points, seems to be impossible, since all these operations ought to, intuitively speaking, preserve the volume, but they don't necessarily all do that, and the volume is doubled in the end.
