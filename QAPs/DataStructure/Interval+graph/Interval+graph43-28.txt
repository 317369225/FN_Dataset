How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Originally Answered: What should one do and how can one prepare for a Google/Microsoft software developer interview with 10 years of Java development experience?I will talk about Google interviews as I made an onsite interview with them before.. 1. Solve as much problems as you can -> Try LeetCode and Glassdoor â€“ an inside look at jobs & companies 2. Read about architecture problems .. they will ask you to design a whole system 3. Read about DB scalability, Cloud and Distributed systems as much as you can 4. I was asked parallel computing questions and low level architecture problems 5. Sometimes you may be given code and find issues in it e.g., design issues, security issues, requirements issues, and the most important synchronization issues. 6. Again solve as much problems as you can :D
