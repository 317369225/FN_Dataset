How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Originally Answered: Which programming languages should I know to get an internship or job at a top-notch company like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?C++ is the most frequently used language at Google, and I know people who ask C-related questions during an interview. So that'll help you get through the first interview stage. For second "project matching" stage, it's useful to have specific interest or skill. For instance, someone who liked CUDA and got a project to develop CUDA matrix library, someone who did a project on testing tools got into testing team, etc
