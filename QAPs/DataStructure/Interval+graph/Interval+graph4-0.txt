Is it possible to get data within a specified date interval using Facebook graph API?I would like to get data for one of my page for the last six months for example.
Yes, just pass parameters of since and/or until to your API call.Â  There's a few different ways of formatting the date that are possible. http://developers.facebook.com/d... and go down to "Paging"
