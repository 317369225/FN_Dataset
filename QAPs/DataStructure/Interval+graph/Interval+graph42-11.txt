Why are there only 12 pitch notes (C, C#, ..., B) in the world?I learned that pitch is determined by frequency of the sound waves. I know that each note has specific frequency Hz. For example, C3 is 130.8Hz and C#3 is 138.6. So what the heck is between those two pitch notes? If there are so many pitches between these half-step notes, how come it feels like almost all pitches in the world can be identified as one of the 12 pitch notes?
There are other pitches of other frequencies in the World. "Eastern" music on "Esatern instruments have notes and scales characteristic to their "songs". The pitches we are accustomed to, evolved with a Weatern, if not European cultures and instruments were constructed for our "do, re, mi..." Pattern. Some 20th Century compositions forces a Western instruments to make sounds inbetween our notes. Electric guitar rock artist slide around in these "spaces" (frequencies). I have two sons; each have Master's of Music Degrees; one from Boston Conservatory, the other from Peabody Inst JounsHopkins. Teachers and composers.
