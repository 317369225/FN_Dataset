What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
I am not a math geek but my nomination will be Pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. 1st this theorem described using sorting of pigeon in pigeonhole. Here there are n = 10 pigeons in m = 9 holes. Since 10 is greater than 9, the pigeonhole principle says that at least one hole has more than one pigeon. Seriously ? I mean anybody thought any answer other than this one? :) If all the theorems of math are as obvious as this one no body going to hate maths.
