What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
Can't believe nobody mentioned Godel's incompleteness theorem. See it in plain english - "Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete." Wikipedia article @GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems. The first theorem sank logicism(@Logicism) and raised serious debate on the ability of human intelligence to mechanically construct (by computing or other means) a finite system of axioms/rules that can answer/solve/prove any question however precisely stated (human like artificial intelligence). Second theorem is even more unsettling - if a theory has some basic arithmetic truths and rules about provability, that theory is essentially inconsistent if it includes statements about it's own consistency, unless there exists another theory to prove former theory's consistency. Ad infinitum. There are so many interpretations to both of these over decades. But my favorite one, based on experience, is how closely both theorems suggest the existence of layered consciousness purported in ancient texts the The Gita @Bhagavad-Gita: Chapter 07. Nothing to do with philosophy or religion. How else would you explain ability to recite and remember entire text of an Upanishad for the rest of your life heard from a mendicant in dream? (and many such, too off topic)
