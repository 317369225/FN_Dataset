What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
Visualize a small house. Imagine a mailbox with a rooster on it, a waist level white picket fence composed of fifty picket boards, twenty five on each side of the gate. two trees in the yard and a flag pole with the American flag flying. Four steps up to a covered porch which has two rocking chairs and a porch swing. An old bloodhound is sleeping near the porch swing. The front door has a window and is made of oak. Inside, to the right is a table with a drawer and five pegs on the wall for hats. To the left, a small table with a lamp. It too has a drawer.  Across the small fourier is a set of five shelves on the wall and a set of five key hooks on the wall. To the right is a den. It has a desk with six drawers and a wall with five shelves. There are pictures on the wall of your loved ones. Complete this empty house and memorize it including startling, funny and loved objects. This is called a mnemonic device. When you want to remember something and never forget it. Put it in the house somewhere and make the memory a passionate one (not fear, the mind protects itself against fear by forgetting it.). If this information is important, visualize its benefit to you as you lovingly place it on a shelf, hook or drawer. Maybe you would place it under the dog's nose for protection.  Never change the device and use it until it becomes second nature.  I have a favorite pair of coveralls with many pockets in my memory and I inevitably forget what's in the pockets until I start looking through them.
