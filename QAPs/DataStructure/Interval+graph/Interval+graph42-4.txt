Why are there only 12 pitch notes (C, C#, ..., B) in the world?I learned that pitch is determined by frequency of the sound waves. I know that each note has specific frequency Hz. For example, C3 is 130.8Hz and C#3 is 138.6. So what the heck is between those two pitch notes? If there are so many pitches between these half-step notes, how come it feels like almost all pitches in the world can be identified as one of the 12 pitch notes?
As others have suggested, the premise of your question is incorrect.  In Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Indian music, there are well-developed systems of more than 12 notes in an octave.  If you want to know why there are 12 notes to the octave in Western music, the Tim Converse's answer above is a good one as to how that became the consensus on a practical limit.  Two caveats: even in Western music, there are many more pitches used, it is only the equal-tempered instruments that are restricted to 12 pitch classes.  There are many more than 12 pitch names (A#, Bb, D#, Eb, F#, Gb, Fx, Abb, etc), and for good reasons.  This hints at the fact that the 12 pitches are a convention that is arrived at for practical reasons (it is impractical to have 40 keys or frets per octave), not for any inherent musical reason.  On an instrument with more or less continuously variable pitch, one is not restricted to 12 pitches and may well play a Gb as a distinct pitch from an F#.
