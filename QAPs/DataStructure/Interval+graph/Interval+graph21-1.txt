Why does a derivative for the infinite power tower x^x^x^... exist?
The first thing to ask is "why does the value of the infinite power tower exist at all?" Once you answer that its derivative is just a corollary. In standard analysis, you're never actually looking at the whole power tower at once. You're looking at the sequence of functions f 1 (x)=x  , f 2 (x)=x x   , f 3 (x)=x x x    etc. The first thing to ask is whether lim n→∞ f n (x)  exists at all! I find it surprising that it does, but aspects of it are explained here: Power Tower -- from Wolfram MathWorld. Since your question isn't very specific, the cheaty answer is, "because the limit function is −W(−ln(x))/ln(x)  on the interval where it converges, and that's a composition of differentiable functions and so is differentiable."
