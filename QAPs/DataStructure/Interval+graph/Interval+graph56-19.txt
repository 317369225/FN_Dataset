What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
That how cruel the so called humans could be... - The Holocaust Excess of 5 million dead - Genghis Khan Genocides Tens of millions deaths - Bengal Genocide, British India Couple of million deaths - Chinese Cultural Revolution Deaths millions dead And many many more genocides... I cannot believe how human beings could resort to such systematic form of violence, as if those killed are no better than animals. Updated 24 Oct 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
