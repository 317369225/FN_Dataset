What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
Jensen's inequality Simple..yet elegant.. derivable..yet mind blowing and utterly useful So what is this inequality then.. ( if u are mathematically challenged, then skip the incoming few lines..) Suppose f(x) is a twice differentiable function on an interval [a,b] and f''(x)>0 ( that is graph is concave upwards) ,,,then for every +ve integer  X1,X2,X3....in [a.b]..we have f(X1+X2+X3...Xm/m)≤   f(X1)+f(X2)+f(X3)..f(Xm)/m ...still seems difficult??   I think this ought to clear it up.. Basically it states that if you have a continuous curve which is concave upwards in a particular range, and u draw a line between the values of the function at extreme ends, then the line is above the curve!! now tell me..if u needed a theorem to say that the line would be above the curve( in the given image) !!!!! same can be thought of if f''(x)<0 i.e , the graph is concave downwards ..in the range..then the sign of equality reverses..or i.e..then the line would be bellow the curve..
