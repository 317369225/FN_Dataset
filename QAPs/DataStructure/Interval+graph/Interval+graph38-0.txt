What is the importance of integration?
Integration is the general method to find the whole change when you know infinitesimal changes.  "Integrate" is comes from the Latin and it means "make whole". (1).  If you know the rate of change of a quantity, you can integrate that rate of change to get the whole change over the interval.  (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus):                   ∫ b a f ′ (x)dx=f(b)−f(a)  (2).  The integral of a positive function  f  between  x = a  and  x = b  is the area under the graph   y = f(x), above the x-axis, and between those two vertical lines.  This is a special case of (1) when the quantity under consideration is the area under the graph between a and x.
