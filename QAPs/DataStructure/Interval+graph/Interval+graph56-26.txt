What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
Cheating. In school, if you want good grades, study. In a relationship, if you want to out, go. In competition, if you want to win, train. But maintain your ethics and your honor. Otherwise you have a grade or a lover or a prize, but it means exactly nothing - because you didn't do the work. You cheated.
