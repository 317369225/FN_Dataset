What is the significance of the area under a line for graphs?I know it depends on the units for x and y but is there a general meaning to it?
To get a sense of the "general meaning", consider what happens when the line is horizontal, e.g., y(x)=c  for some constant c  . Say you want the area under this line over some interval with width Δx  . That area is then A=cΔx  . In short: the area is like multiplication between the y  value and the x  interval. In cases where y  isn't constant, it's still taking that same product, but using the average value of y  (over the relevant interval). Or, to put it another way: whenever you have some quantity that can accumulate (e.g., distance traveled), you can put the rate of accumulation (e.g., speed) on the y  axis, and the area under the curve will be the total amount accumulated over that interval.
