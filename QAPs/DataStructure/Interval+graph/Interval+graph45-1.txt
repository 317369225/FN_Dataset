What approaches should one follow when solving a problem be it a puzzle, riddle, programming or a real life problem?Also what are the different ways (strategies or methodologies) to attack problems? Please provide an algorithmic approach. If multiple methods or strategiesÂ  exists depending on different scenarios then mention them as well. Also it'll be helpful if one can give examples on how to apply it to a problem.
Investigate the PIBEA genetic algorithm. It is one of the closest to what you want. It still won't give you a single answer. The more complex a problem the greater the number of solutions. PIBEA will give you a set of answers that have the best overall efficiency.
