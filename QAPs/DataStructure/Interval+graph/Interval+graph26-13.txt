What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
There's an excellent book on this exact topic: Brain Rules by John Medina. I highly recommend it as he relies only on very credible science (published in peer reviewed journals and replicated by multiple researchers). His 12 rules (that have practical implications for work, education and life) are: exercise boosts brain power (so do it) the human brain evolved (and our most 'human' characteristic is being able to estimate others' mind/emotion states) every brain is wired differently (and it's an ongoing wiring process) we don't pay attention to (emotionally) boring things (inc. that there's no such thing as multi-tasking) repeat to remember (lots of great stuff on retaining memories) remember to repeat (inc. why not to trust your long term memory too much) sleep well, think well (inc. the importance of afternoon naps) stressed brains don't learn the same way (inc. the importance of marriage quality to learning outcomes of children) stimulate more of the senses (to aid learning) vision trumps all other senses (and why not to trust it completely) male and female brains are different (but not in the way popular books would have you believe) we are powerful and natural explorers (inc. the importance of continuing this into old age).
