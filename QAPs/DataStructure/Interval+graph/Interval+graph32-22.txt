What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
I would not say it is the MOST "you don't say" theorem, but Zermelo's Theorem is a great one nevertheless. It says: In any finite two-person game of perfect information in which the players move alternately and in which chance does not affect the decision making process, if the game cannot end in a draw, then one of the two players must have a winning strategy. Applying it to the game of chess we get: Either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw.
