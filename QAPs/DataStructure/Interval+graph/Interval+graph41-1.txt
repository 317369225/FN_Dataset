History of Mathematics: Was calculus already developed before Newton and Leibniz?
"Kerala school of mathematics" (a group of mathematicians in southern part of India) developed initial theory of calculus before 14th century. Their main discovery was integral of  x^n. More details can be seen in Page on ucla.edu Early results were attributed to Madhava. His students and their students  like Prameshwara, Nilaknta, Jyeshtadeva, etc continued the work. Of course their work never spread, mainly because Portuguese reached Kerala in 1498 and their attacks started a political turmoil in Kingdom of Calicut (which was patron to most of these mathematicians). It was forgotten until c.1820 when C.M.Whish learned Malayalam, collected palm leaf  manuscripts from Kerala and found, to his astonishment, a “complete system of fluxions”. Springer has published that manuscript written by Jyeshtadeva -  Ganita-Yukti-Bhāṣā (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyeṣṭhadeva - Volume I: Mathematics
