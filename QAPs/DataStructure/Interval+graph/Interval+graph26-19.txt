What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
Intelligence is not a fixed quotient. Neuroplasticity: Learning Physically Changes the Brain When you believe you can learn something new it becomes easier. There are good and bad ways to give praise. Saying "good job" or "you're very smart" is either meaningless or makes the student believe that they do something because they are smart not because they put in the effort to learn. Instead praise the hard work, learning and effort put forth and the students will continue to put forth that effort, realizing that even if something doesn't come easily or naturally doesn't mean you are not intelligent enough to learn it. ie... saying I'm good (or bad) at math is wrong.
