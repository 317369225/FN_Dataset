What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
Short Answer: NONE. Explanation - Euclid's and such seeming "you don't say" theories are the only ones that come to rescue when things go beyond your imagination. There is a beginning point from where you start off with strong rigorous basics. It is a big responsibility - you have to go a great deal to ensure things don't go wrong when things go very very complicated. If you feel they are obvious, it is because you have come to know of them that way. If you challenge that conditioning of your mind you might appreciate their work. #nooffencemeant
