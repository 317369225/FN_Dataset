What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
I found Gabriel's Horn result most counter - intuitive result in math, where a surface can have Infinite surface area but finite surface volume. 3D illustration of Gabriel's horn: Gabriel's horn is formed by taking the graph of f(x) = 1/x with x>= 1 and if you rotate that curve around it's axis 360 degree you may find this type of surface. And the volume of this surface can be found very easily from x = 1 to x= a (a > 1)  i.e. V = pi*(1- 1/a) surface area is as follows : S  = 2*pi*ln(a) Now we can actually see that P.S. Proof of surface area and volume can be found
