What is a cool mathematical thing I can do on the back of a notebook?
Here's a "game" of sorts involving fractals which I found (on Wikipedia) called the Chaos Game. You can play with paper and a lot of patience (and maybe a die). Draw three points on a piece of paper. These will be the vertices of a triangle. The farther apart they are, the more complex your fractal will be. Number the points 1, 2, and 3. Draw a point within the triangle bounded by the three vertices. Randomly select a point (1, 2, or 3) and draw a point exactly halfway between your previously drawn point and the vertex. The vertex can be randomly selected, but if you want true randomness then roll the die and select point 1 if you roll a 1/2, point 2 if you roll a 3/4, and point 3 if you roll a 5/6. Repeat this several hundred times, each time going from the point you last drew. As I said, lots of patience. Eventually, the dots will begin to form the shape of a Sierpinski triangle!
