What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
Modern Art: Call me unimaginative, but some of the most iconic Modern Art paintings that are considered 'masterpieces', have never held much appeal with me. Whatever happened to the detailed, beautiful and enigmatic paintings of the Renaissance times? It baffles me how the likes of The Weeping Woman and The Scream can even be remotely termed as masterpieces. Abstract Expressionism serves as the perfect example to show that human stupidity has no limits. Consider the two paintings below: (No. 5, 1948 - the second costliest painting to be sold at $140 million. And all for a few random strokes of different coloured paint?) (Woman III - the third costliest painting to be sold at $137.5 million. Again, my five-year old sister can draw a better image of a woman. With her eyes closed!) I have tried many-a-time to try and understand what makes people buy and appreciate these pathetic excuses for art and although there exist verbose, hyperbole-filled explanations which try to give it some value, they've always escaped my understanding.
