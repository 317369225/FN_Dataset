Why does the slope of this derivative change on the given interval pictured in the graph?I'm having trouble understanding why f' changes from positive slope to negative slope in the interval (shaded blue) even though in f that same interval remains to have a positive slope (shown by the red arrow).
If you look at the graph of f' in the given interval, you see that it is positive throughout. Note that we're not talking about the slope of f', we're talking about the value. When f' is positive, f has a positive slope. When f' has a positive slope, f is concave upwards. To answer the specific question you asked: f' changes from positive slope to negative slope in the interval because f switches from an upwards concavity to a downwards concavity. The slope of f' doesn't concern the slope of f, the value of f' concerns the slope of f. If you are having a more specific issue beyond this, do tell in the comments!
