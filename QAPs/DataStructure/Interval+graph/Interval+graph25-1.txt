What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
So many intuition-defying results, so little time. Here are a few. Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Definition: A curve is a continuous image of the unit interval [0,1]. Example: a circle, a helix, a sine wave and a squiggly line are all curves. Theorem: any compact, connected and locally connected subset of space is a curve. Example: a solid ball, a chair and a sponge full of holes are also curves. Robertson-Seymour Definition: a minor of a graph is obtained by removing and contracting some edges. Theorem: if you have infinitely many graphs, one of them is guaranteed to be a minor of another. Besicovitch / Kakeya Needle Problem Question: what is the smallest area of a parking lot in which you can have a needle of length 1 turn around 180 degrees and return to its starting position, pointing in the other direction? Answer: There is no smallest area. There's such a region in the plane of area 0.01, and there's one with area 0.00001, and so on. Differentiability Fact: there exist functions that are continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. Fact: in fact, most functions that are continuous everywhere are differentiable nowhere. Fact: You can have a car stand still for hours and then start moving at noon, but its speed, acceleration, meta-acceleration (the rate of change of acceleration), meta-meta-acceleration and so forth were all 0 at noon. How did it then start moving? Miracle. Fact: if you switch from real variables to complex variables, being differentiable once implies being differentiable twice, thrice, or as many times as you like (in fact it implies even more - being analytic). From the "WTF" department ∫ ∞ 0 sin(x)x dx=π2   ∫ ∞ 0 sin(x)x sin(x/3)x/3 dx=π2   ∫ ∞ 0 sin(x)x sin(x/3)x/3 sin(x/5)x/5 dx=π2   . . . ∫ ∞ 0 sin(x)x sin(x/3)x/3 sin(x/5)x/5   ⋯sin(x/13)x/13 dx=π2   BUT ∫ ∞ 0 sin(x)x sin(x/3)x/3 sin(x/5)x/5   ⋯sin(x/13)x/13 sin(x/15)x/15 dx=Qπ  where Q  is a rational number with numerator and denominator having like 35 digits.
