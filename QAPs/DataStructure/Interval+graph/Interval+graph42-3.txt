Why are there only 12 pitch notes (C, C#, ..., B) in the world?I learned that pitch is determined by frequency of the sound waves. I know that each note has specific frequency Hz. For example, C3 is 130.8Hz and C#3 is 138.6. So what the heck is between those two pitch notes? If there are so many pitches between these half-step notes, how come it feels like almost all pitches in the world can be identified as one of the 12 pitch notes?
North Indian (Hindustani) Classical music has evolved over the years to include 12 notes per "Saptak" (octave). This includes soft notes of rishabh, gandhar, dhaivat, and nishad; plusÂ  hard madhyam, along with the seven "pure" notes. But south of the Vindhyas, music had already evolved beyond 12 notes per octave, and indeed 22 shrutis (notes) per octave is the norm there. Even in Hindustani music, in some of the raagas, there is a rule about taking the higher one of the madhyam. Or a lower one of the Komal Rushabh, that corresponds to the shrutis. So, 22 tones per octave seems to me the thinnest granularization so far. Not 12.
