What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
1. Whether what I see as a specific color is the same as what someone else sees when they look at that same color. Someone who is colorblind, for example, perceives a world that looks totally different than the world perceived by a "normal" person. It is also possible that what I perceive when I see red is what everyone else perceives when they see green. Since I have always seen colors the same way, I would really have no way of knowing. It really gets down to the philosophical question of whether there is some objective reality to how stuff looks, sounds, etc. or whether what we perceive is totally subjective. It seems pretty likely that everyone perceives everything differently, at least to a degree, which is quite difficult to fathom or understand (no matter how hard I try). 2. That not only is the universe expanding (into what?) but that it is expanding at an accelerating rate. (Physics Nobel Explainer: Why Is Expanding Universe Accelerating?)
