As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
Add Probabilistic data structures: Bloom filter, Locality sensitive hashing, Minhash, Skip lists Optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing, k-means clustering, nearest neighbor Distributed algorithms and Map-Reduce Distributed data structures such as Big table and sparse matrix Adjancy list, Nested sets, Scapgoat trees R-Trees/Quadtrees, Kd-trees and Interval trees. May be BSP trees, Hash trees and Fenwick trees may be good as exercise. Introduction to purely functional data structures such as Finger Trees String Matching (Chapter 32): Trie and BK trees Basic graph algorithms (Chapter 22): A*, Sub graph isomorphism, Transitive closure Expand Akra-Bazzi method Maximum Flow with Hungarian algorithm, Stable marriage algorithm Computation Geometry (Chapter 33) with finding point in polygon Perfect Hashing with Minimal Perfect Hashing Contract Medians and Order Statistics Red-Black Trees (please don't remove!) Augmenting Data Structures Greedy algorithms (pp 423-428 and Matroids) van Emde Boas Trees Remove Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication Fibonacci heaps Matrix operations FFT Number theoretic algorithms
