What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
PIGEONHOLE THEOREM It states that "if there are 'n' items to be stored in 'm' containers, such that n>m, then at least one container must contain more than one item". If you are wondering that why Pigeonhole? here is the answer - When this theorem was stated, it was not generalized with the use of term 'item'. However, the theorem was somewhat like this - "If there are 'n' Pigeons to be stored in 'm' Pigeonholes, such that n>m, then at least one Pigeonhole must contain more than one Pigeon". This theorem is one the most fundamental theorems in Combinatorics. There are many applications of this theorem, few are listed on Wikipedia page (Pigeonhole principle) Thanks Michal Fori≈°ek, for correcting me on the point I made that the statement was originally stated with 'Pigeons'. This theorem is also and popularly known Dirichlet's drawer principle or simply Dirichlet's principle.
