Would society be better off if everyone had a basic understanding of differential and integral calculus?
No, but I think you are bringing up a bigger point altogether. I think if people were more educated in general about not just academic subjects but about subjects we face in life: health, developing in demand workplace skills, personal finance (savings/investment), personal growth, how to communicate at work and with others, how to develop character, how to be self-sufficient, how to help others that would help society in general
