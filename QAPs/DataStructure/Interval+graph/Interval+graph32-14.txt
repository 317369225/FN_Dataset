What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
The empty set is unique. Empty Set is Unique Let ∅ and ∅′ both be empty sets. From Empty Set is Subset of All Sets, ∅⊆∅′, because ∅ is empty. Likewise, we have ∅′⊆∅, since ∅′ is empty. Together, by the definition of set equality, this implies that ∅=∅′. Thus there is only one empty set. Or possibly, since it was used in the above proof: Empty Set is Subset of All Sets "There are no elements of ∅, from the definition of the empty set. Therefore ∅ has no elements that are not also in any other set. Thus, from the above, all elements of ∅ are all (vacuously) in every other set." Or possibly, No set is a proper subset of itself, and every set is a subset of itself. Definition: If A and B are sets and every element of A is also an element of B, then: A is a subset of (or is included in) B, denoted by ,or equivalently B is a superset of (or includes) A, denoted by If A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B (i.e. there exists at least one element of B which is not an element of A), then A is also a proper (or strict) subset of B; this is written as or equivalently B is a proper superset of A; this is written as For any set S, the inclusion relation ⊆ is a partial order on the set of all subsets of S (the power set of S). When quantified, A ⊆ B is represented as: ∀x{x∈A → x∈B}.[1] Examining the contents of any set shows that all meet the above criteria for being subsets of themselves and that none meet the criteria for being proper subsets of themselves. Philosophically, there may or may not be more than one way to exist, but it seems more likely that there is only one way to not exist.... LOL
