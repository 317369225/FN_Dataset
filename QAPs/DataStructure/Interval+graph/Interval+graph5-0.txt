How do I find the intervals where a graph is increasing/ decreasing and concave up/down?
Don't stress the fact that a  is not given. You can do all of your calculations in terms of a  . When you go to plot the curve you can draw where a  is on your axes and use that as a reference to plot from. To find the points where the function is increasing/decreasing you need to set the derivative equal to zero and find the critical points (you will notice that the x  values will be independent of a  ). Once you have those you can evaluate the derivative on each interval you find to see if the function is increasing or decreasing on it. You will also be able to find the extrema with this information (e.g. if the function goes from increasing to decreasing then you know that you've found a maximum point) You do the same procedure on the second derivative to get information on concavity and inflection points. Asymptotes are typically vertical or horizontal. Vertical asymptotes occur when denominators approach zero and horizontal asymptotes can be found by checking the behaviour of the function as x  approaches ±∞  . All of this give you plenty of qualitative information to sketch out what the graph of the function looks like. Be sure to label the extrema and points of inflection (in terms of a  ) on the graph.
