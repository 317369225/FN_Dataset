What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
That every set has an interior, exterior, and boundary, which are pairwise disjoint and the universe is the union of all 3. Duh, right? What makes this nontrivial is defining the interior, exterior, and boundary of arbitrary sets. Definitions: - the interior of S  is the union of all open subsets of S  - the exterior of S  is, not surprisingly, the interior of the complement of S  - the boundary of S  is S ¯ ¯ ¯  ∩S c  ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯    , where S ¯ ¯ ¯    is called the closure of S  , meaning the intersection of all closed sets containing S  . With these definitions (which are super-general - they apply to all metric spaces) - it's non-obvious that the boundary is disjoint from the interior and exterior, and that together the three sets cover everything - this requires a proof. Sidenote: the most interesting thing about these results, to me, is that they match what are intuition would tell us for simple cases and extend to sets were our intuition is useless.  E.g., for Q  (the set of rational numbers) and universe R  (the reals): the rationals contain no open sets of reals, so has an empty interior; the irrationals contain no open sets, so the exterior is also empty; thus the boundary of Q  is R  .
