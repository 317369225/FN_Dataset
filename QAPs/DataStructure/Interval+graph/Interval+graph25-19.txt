How about the well known birthday problem? The question is how many people are required in a room so that there is a 50% chance that two people share birthdays, and the answer to it is 23. From wikipedia: By the pigeonhole pinciple, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are 366 possible birthdays, including February 29).
