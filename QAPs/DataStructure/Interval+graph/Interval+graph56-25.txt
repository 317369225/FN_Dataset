What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
Whilst I concur with those who mentioned God(s), the universe and infinity, one thing that continually escapes my understanding is dreams. I get that some dreams can be manifestations of the days experiences, and help our minds to assimilate information; but what purpose do nightmares or dreams that invoke people and places that don't exist serve? Since childhood I have had recurring dreams or nightmares, and have always had vivid and pseudo-real dreams whereby they are so normal that in my waking hours, I confuse events within them, for reality. Considering how prolific my dreaming is, and how much I remember of them throughout the days and weeks that follow; I find it very hard to grasp the reasons why some people say they don't dream? It is a subject that both fascinates and frustrates me in equal measure and I yearn for the science fiction of recording or viewing a persons dreams.
