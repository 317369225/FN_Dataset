What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
That my father who did not want children and could not afford them, had six of them.  All because he believed the Catholic Church when it told him that it was wrong to use birth control. I am one of those six, born to a life of hunger and need.  While my mother was pregnant with number four he bought a one bedroom home.  It stayed a one bedroom house for over ten years, with six children.  The basement was the garage. We children slept in a small unfinished attic.  He had 'his food' and 'his candy' and 'his rules'.  Because he made the money, and we were just children.  The Church said he had to create them, not love them. In my late teens I found condoms in his car.  He was cheating on my mother and didn't want an 'unplanned pregnancy'.  Um, excuse me, but wasn't that what brought about all the joy and fun in my childhood?  The "every sperm is sacred, every sperm divine" crap?  Did the Church suddenly change that rule? Oh yeah, and what about that rule about adultery?  Was the Church having a BOGO? No longer Catholic-love the nuns.  But am frustrated by too many problems within-especially the American bishops.  Left someone to play with his condoms and moved away.  He is still active in the Church. Now I have children, and I may have 'my candy'. . . But they have their own.
