What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
I can not remotely grasp how some people seem to feel they can bring honour to their families by murdering their sister or daughter. The immorality of murder (even more so the murder of women and children) is one of the few absolutes of human morality accepted everywhere by everyone. How can this utterly dishonourable act bring honour? It's impossible. And yet so-called 'honour killings' continue at a rate approaching 20,000 a year.
