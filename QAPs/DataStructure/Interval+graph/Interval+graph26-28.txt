What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
Just heard this really interesting neuroscience piece on NPR the other day. The scientist said that when we recall memories, we are not actually recalling the event itself, but our last recollection of that memory. So if the last time we recalled an event something in that memory shifted slightly, then the next time we recall that event our memory will contain that shift and will not be purely true to the event that occurred. I hope that makes sense. Welcome to the bottom of the rabbit hole. : )
