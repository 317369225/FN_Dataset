If f(f(x))=x 2 −1  , what is f(x)  ?Obviously there are an infinite many solutions, but just one will suffice :P
Suppose we have a ring R  for which f(f(x))=x∗x−1  . Using the same logic as @Alon Amit's answer we must have a cycle of distinct elements f(0)=a  , f(a)=−1  , f(−1)=a∗a−1  , f(a∗a−1)=0  , leading to a(a+1)(a∗a−a−1)=0  .   None of these three factors can be zero, but R  may have zero divisors, in which case we could have a(a+1)=0  a(a∗a−a−1)=0  or (a+1)(a∗a−a−1)=0  Let's try Z 12   , that lets us fit the first case to 3∗4=0  .  The four-cycle is: f(0) = 3 f(3) = 11 f(11) = 8 f(8) = 0 Luckily, Z 12   has exactly four quadratic residues (0, 1, 4, and 9, one more than these values.)  That means can find values for all the other numbers. f(f(1)) = 0, so f(1) = 8 f(f(2)) = 3, so f(2) = 0 f(f(4)) = 3, so f(4) = 0 f(f(5)) = 0, so f(5) = 8 f(f(6)) = 11, so f(6) = 3 f(f(7)) = 0, so f(7) = 8 f(f(9)) = 8, so f(9) = 11 f(f(10)) = 3, so f(10) = 0 I'm not sure whether we can find a solution in any ring with exactly four quadratic residues or not.
