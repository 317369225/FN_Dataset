What are some of the most counterintuitive mathematical results?Like cantor's results on infinities, the rearrangement theorem in analysis
Hadwiger–Nelson problem. This problem is about finding the minimum number of colors required to color the plane such that no two points at a distance of one unit from each other receive the same color. The answer is 4, 5, 6, or 7. The counterintuitive thing is that the exact answer depends on what axioms we choose to base set theory on!! This is to say that if you choose a certain set of axioms for set theory you may get the answer as 4 and for a different set of axioms the answer may be 5. Isn't that amazing? Another very counterintuitive arena is the domain of non Archimedean geometry. In a non archimedean space you can have two line segments a  and b  such that a+a+a+...+a  (summation taken n  times) is less than b  no matter what the value of n  is. In fact any kind of non Euclidean geometry is highly counterintuitive. You can have more than one line passing through a given point and parallel to a given line in case of hyperbolic geometry and you have no lines passing through a given point and parallel to a given line in case of Elliptic geometry.
