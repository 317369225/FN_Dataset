What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
This one might not be so "you don't say" but it was to me. I had real analysis last year and we studied a very important theorem, called the Intermediate value theorem. This theorem states that if a function f(x)  is continuous within it's domain (a,b)  and that it has opposite signs at a  and b  then there lies a root of the function within the domain (a,b)  . Or in simpler terms - The function f(x)  is continuous in (a,b)  such that f(a)  is positve(/negative) and f(b)  is negative(/positive). Then there lies a point between (a,b)  where f(x)=0  . Here's a sample graph - It was very apparent to me when I read it for the first time. I mean, obviously it passes through the x-axis at some point if it is a continuous curve! Obviously it has a root somewhere between a and b! But it wasn't really that obvious to all my friends. I thought it must be a pretty useless theorem that exists because it can. Turns out it has a great deal of applications in numerical methods, particularly the Bisection method for finding roots of an equation.
