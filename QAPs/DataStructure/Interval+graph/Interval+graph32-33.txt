What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
Some mathematical concepts may appear obvious to you because a) You are a genius b) You are overlooking some possibilities c) You are familiar with these concepts for a long time d) Some mathematical theories are just corollaries/effects of other results, but a concise retelling is incredibly more useful. Mathematics relies on rigour. That is what makes mathematics exceptional. Russel and Whitehead famously took 200 pages in Principia Mathematica to prove concept of arithmetic addition and thus 1+1=2 . (See a blog post on proof here The Universe of Discourse : 1+1=2). Yet this was absolutely important for development of mathematical logic. So summing up there will be a perfectly valid reason for a "obvious looking" mathematical concept to exist.
