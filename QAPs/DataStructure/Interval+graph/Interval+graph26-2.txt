What are some brain hacks that a neuroscientist or a psychologist knows that most people don't?
From clinical psychology: Exposure-based treatment is the best treatment for anxiety disorders. I'm not speaking against drugs or other approaches, but exposure-based therapy is the best first thing to try, particularly because it doesn't involve drug side effects. Some notes: Patients (clients) must face their fears, so it's not easy to undertake It's often not easy to find You could try this Find-a-therapist tool and ask therapists whether they use exposure in their treatment It's often called cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or behavior therapy By anxiety disorders, I mean severe, life-impairing problems due to social anxiety, phobias, excessive worrying, posttraumatic stress, panic attacks, or obsessions and compulsions. They can be seen as brain issues (hence belonging under this quora question) or mind issues; these perspectives need not conflict Many people outside of clinical psychology think medication is best for serious problems, and there should be no stigma to using medication. Yet, research (most importantly from randomized controlled trials) shows that psychotherapy--I favor the CBT family of therapies--is at least equally helpful for many common problems (like anxiety, depression, and insomnia). Researchers (including me) are testing some novel computer and smartphone treatments, which I predict will be reliable someday, but they aren't yet. Self-help or "internet-based" CBT is promising and somewhat more established (for anxiety and depression). (I'm a PhD student, not a licensed psychologist, so this isn't professional or health advice. Obviously, the above is opinion, not fact. But I have no financial interests in any of this, at present or in the past.)
