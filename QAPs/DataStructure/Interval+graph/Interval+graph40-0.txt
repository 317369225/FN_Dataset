What are the rules and the concept of ARCTAN(X)?
Arctangent is defined as the function inverse to the tangent function when the domain of the tangent function is restricted to the interval (−π2 ,π2 )  .  Tangent has to be restricted to that interval to make it a one-to-one function. The arctangent function can be denoted either arctanx  or tan −1 x  , but I prefer the first because the second is so easily confused the the reciprocal of tangent. The image of the arctangent function is the domain of the restricted tangent function,  (−π2 ,π2 )  , while the domain of the arctangent function is all of the real numbers.  Its graph y=arctanx  is the red curve below. The curve is asymptotic to the horizontal lines y=±π2   drawn in blue. All the properties of the arctangent function follow from properties of the tangent function. For example, arctan0=0  because tan0=0  . Also arctangent is an odd function because tangent is an odd function. The sum and difference formulas for tangent imply that there are corresponding sum and difference formulas for arctangent.  They are            arctanx+arctany=arctanx+y1−xy   and            arctanx−arctany=arctanx−y1+xy   In calculus the derivative of arctangent is important since it's used to integrate rational functions.  Its derivative is            (arctanx) ′ =11+x 2    which implies that            ∫11+x 2  dx=arctanx+C  Arctangent has the power series            arctanx=x−x 3 3! +x 5 5! −x 7 7! +⋯  on the interval [−1,1]  .
