What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
Given all our early training in the three Rs (reading, writing, and arithmetic), I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned:      1+1=2  which Russell and Whitehead famously didn't prove until around page 300 of Principia Mathematica. That fact still inspires questions on Quora: Do you need 300 pages to prove that 1+1=2? Nevertheless the result is, in my opinion, more obvious than even the Pigeonhole Principle or the Jordan Curve Theorem, both of which will have definitional problems for young children. Ask any young child however what one plus one is, especially when it's related to candy or sweets, and see what happens...
