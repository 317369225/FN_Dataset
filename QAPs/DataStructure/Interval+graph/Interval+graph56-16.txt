What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
Is there free will or not? Do we have choice in our next actions? As much as I understand laws of mathematics, physics (and other applied sciences), universal laws, constants and quantum uncertainty rules the world. Where is place for my action? Every if predestined (to the extent of quantum uncertainty which I cannot influence). So there is no free will. But we do feel free will. I can chose to complete this answer or not or delete or burn my laptop. Is that all predestined? If no, is it worth trying to affect future? May be my trying or not is predestined too. So do I ignore above understanding (that there is no free will) and act like there is, even though there isn't because my acting like is also predestined. What is going on? Should I try to better my future or not?
