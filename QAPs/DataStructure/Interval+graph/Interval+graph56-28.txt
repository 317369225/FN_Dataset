What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
The possible nature of the universe that may result in it warping back in on itself.  That is, in three dimensions, no matter which direction you travel, if you travel far enough and long enough, you'll eventually end up back where you started.  If true, I just cannot comprehend how this works in three dimensions.  Our brains are so limited.  This is little more than a hypothesis right now, but if true, then my little monkey brain cannot understand how.
