How do you show the steps to find an interval for 4x^2-e^x=2, without graphing?
Rewrite as 4x^2 = e^x + 2. The exponential on the right side is a strictly increasing, continuous function whose range on the interval -infinity < x <= 0 is (2, 3]. The parabola on the left side covers this entire range of values as a subset of the range of values, [0, 4] that it takes on the interval -1 <= x <= 0, so there is exactly one solution in this interval, with 2 < y < 3. Equating the quadratic with these boundaries yields -sqrt(3)/2 < x < -sqrt(2)/2. Now observe that the exponential passes through the point (0, 3), the parabola passes through (0, 0), and both are strictly increasing on 0 < x < infinity. Therefore the parabola can only hope to catch up to the exponential once it has reached 3, so x > sqrt(3)/2. Now rely on the inequality 8/3 < e < 11/4. Even at x = 1, the parabola is at 4 while the exponential is at e + 2, which is greater than 14/3. At x = 2, the parabola is at 16 while the exponential is at e^2 + 2, which is less than 153/16. Thus the parabola has overtaken the exponential somewhere in the interval 1 < x < 2. Now recall that the nth order Maclaurin polynomial approximation of e^x is the sum, 0 to n, of (x^n)/(n!). The second degree polynomial of e^x + 2 is 3 + x + (x^2)/2, a convenient choice to equate with the parabola. The quadratic equation shows that the parabola 4x^2 intersects the approximating parabola at (1-sqrt(43))/7 and (1+sqrt(43))/7. The approximating parabola is strictly greater than e^x + 2 for all x < 0 and less than e^x + 2 for all x > 0, so both of these values are underestimates of the true values of the first two solutions, further restricting both intervals. The first two x values are contained in the intervals (1-sqrt(43))/7 < x < -sqrt(2)/2 and (1+sqrt(43))/7 < x < 2, respectively. Since the exponential grows faster than any polynomial as x tends to infinity, there is yet another solution in the direction of positive infinity at which the exponential overtakes the parabola for good. To find an interval for this final value, use the inequality 8/3 < e < 11/4 and trial and error for comparing 4x^2 to e^2 + 2 at various integer values of x.
