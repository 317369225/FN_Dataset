What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
Surprised nobody has yet mentioned Tarski's deduction theorem, which is so "obvious" that every math student has used it implicitly without even realizing that it needs to be proven. Loosely speaking, here is what the theorem states. If we want to prove the statement A⟹B  (read: "A implies B") from a set of assumptions Δ  , then it is enough to assume Δ  and A  together, and then show that B  is true. That is, Δ∪{A}⊢B  implies Δ⊢(A⟹B)  . You use this theorem basically whenever you are asked to prove that A  implies B  and you begin your proof with "assume A  ..." In fact, it might be so obvious that you wonder why it even needs a proof at all, even now that the statement of the theorem has been pointed out to you. Intuitively, the statement A⟹B  gives a relationship between A  and B  , but if you assume A  plus Δ  at the beginning and then freely use the combined set of assumptions in order to show B  , you have not directly established this relationship between A  and B  . The theorem justifies the intuitive concept that this is still, however, enough to establish the desired implication.
