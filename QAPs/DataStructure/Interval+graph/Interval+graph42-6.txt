Why are there only 12 pitch notes (C, C#, ..., B) in the world?I learned that pitch is determined by frequency of the sound waves. I know that each note has specific frequency Hz. For example, C3 is 130.8Hz and C#3 is 138.6. So what the heck is between those two pitch notes? If there are so many pitches between these half-step notes, how come it feels like almost all pitches in the world can be identified as one of the 12 pitch notes?
The simplest answer is that there aren't! There is a lot of microtonal music in the world, and it's very sad to me that people think music is limited to 12ET. Of course there are very good reasons behind 12ET and it's a brilliant system, but it is not at all the only one in the world. 24ET and 53ET are common in maqam music, and they both yield some absolutely wonderful sounds. There's western microtonal music that can use 72ET and more. There is non-equal-tempered music, of course, especially historically. There are instruments that aren't equal-tempered. There is a lot outside of modern western music in this regard.
