Why are there only 12 pitch notes (C, C#, ..., B) in the world?I learned that pitch is determined by frequency of the sound waves. I know that each note has specific frequency Hz. For example, C3 is 130.8Hz and C#3 is 138.6. So what the heck is between those two pitch notes? If there are so many pitches between these half-step notes, how come it feels like almost all pitches in the world can be identified as one of the 12 pitch notes?
You are right in that there are infinite pitches. SImply whistle and steadily increase the pitch, or listen to a trombone glissando and you hear all of them. However, music becomes much simpler to write and notate if we apply some limits. Throughout the renaissance, people developed different tuning systems for this purpose before one, known as Equal Temperament, was almost universally adopted in the Western World. In Equal Temperament, 12 pitches are established from the octave, each with an equal (perceived) distance. Thus the amount of these half-steps defines the interval (two is M2, three is m3, four is M3, and so on). Just look at a piano and you will see this. There exists a note between the half-step known as the quarter tone. It has its own notation, and is used sparingly in Western music. The only example I can think of is in blues, where a vocal effect bends the pitch of the third degree of the scale down a quarter-tone. Eastern musical scales, however, are loaded with strategically placed quarter tones, giving them a characteristic flavor. In general, the difference between semitone and quarter-tone is not firmly established in the ear so they are infrequent outside of avant-garde and eastern music.
