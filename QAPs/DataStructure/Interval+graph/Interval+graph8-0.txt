Let there be an undirected complete graph on n vertices where length of each edge is selected uniformly randomly and independently in the interval [0,1].   What will be the expected distance between any two vertices in the graph?
Deriving an exact answer is difficult, but it looks like the asymptotics are discussed in Shortest paths in random weighted graphs. Edit: this paper looks much more relevant.  The shortest path between vertices is almost surely O(log(n)n )  , so that's a reasonable estimate of the expected value as long as n  isn't small.
