What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?Personally, I feel that Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.
The Jordan curve theorem says that a simple closed curve (a continuous curve starting and ending at the same point with no self intersections) divides the plane into two regions (an "interior" region and an "exterior" region). Proving it isn't easy.
