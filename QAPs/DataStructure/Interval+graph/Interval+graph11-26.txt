As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
My vote would be to add the following : Binary indexed trees Bloom filter Cache oblivious algorithms Combinatorial algorithms And Not to remove "Red Black Trees" Also adding Genetic Algorithms and discussing about the genetic operators would help. Any evolutionary algorithm would be fine to start with.
