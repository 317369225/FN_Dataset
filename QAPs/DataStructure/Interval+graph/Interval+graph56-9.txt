What can you not fathom, understand, or reconcile no matter how hard you try?
Our neglect of fundamental truths Our society has the uncanny ability to disguise fundamental truths as radicalism or absurdities.  Through the short term fulfillment of affiliating with the status quo, we all (in some capacity) willfully neglect what is real.  For example, the truth of the "oneness" of humankind which acknowledges that we are all connected as beings of this planet is accepted as a universal law.  However, our ability to create layers of separation supersedes our oneness.  Culture, country boarders, phenotypic traits, our monetary system, our military-industrial complex all are pervasive concepts that are mistaken with truth.  Those concepts don't have to exists however in many ways, we reinforce them into existence even if they often erode the fabiric of our society.  What I don't get is how collectively, we can be powerfully stuck by truth, and still neglect it.  Visionaries and leaders like MLK and Gandhi shared the truth with the masses, and society received their message as so.  However, the truth is typically not fully upheld and we are left to conform.  Why do we conform, why do we retreat?  This I don't get.
