How can something finite contain something infinite?
There are two kinds of "infinite:" countable infinity and uncountable infinity. Countable infinity is a type of infinity where it is possible to list all the members of an infinite set, assuming the list itself is infinitely long. An example of countable infinity is the set of integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... You could make a list of all the integers, and that list would be infinitely long. Uncountable infinity is a type of infinity where you can't itemize the elements of an infinite set. No list, not even an infinitely long list, can enumerate all the elements of the infinite set. An example of an uncountable infinity is all the real numbers. You can not make a list of all the real numbers, no matter how long that list is, not even if the list itself is infinite. (There's a really clever demonstration of this. Imagine you have an infinitely long list that you believe contains all the real numbers. Now imagine constructing a new number by taking the first digit of the first number of the list and adding 1 to it, taking the second digit of the second element of the list and adding 1 to it, taking the third digit of the third element of the list and adding 1 to it, and so on, and writing down these numbers to create a new number. This new number is nowhere on your list, even if your list is infinitely long! It is not the first element because the first digit is different, not the second element because the second digit is different, not the nth element for any n because the nth digit is different.) An uncountable infinity can be bounded in a finite space. There is, for example, an infinite number of real numbers between 0 and 1. The domain from 0 to 1 is finite, but the number of real numbers within that space is infinite.
