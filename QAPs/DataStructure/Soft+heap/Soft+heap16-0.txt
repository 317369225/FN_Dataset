The story of Aitzaz Hassan. A 16 years old Pakistani boy who saved lives of about 2,000 school children in Pakistan. ​ On the bright morning of  January 6, 2014, Aitzaz along with two of his friends reached the gate of Government High School, Ibrahimzai in North West Pakistan (the school is attended by around 2,000 students). He was not allowed to enter the school on account of being a few minutes late. Right at this moment a man aged between 20-25 approached the school gate and told the guard that he wants to go inside to "take admission" to this school. At this point, Aitzaz and his friends spotted a detonating device protruding out of this man's jacket. Horrified, Aitzaz's friends ran inside the school to save their lives. Aitzaz on the other hand hustled to the bomber and confronted him while he was trying to force his way through the school gate. The bomber tried his best to run inside but could not escape Aitzaz's iron grip. Upon failure he detonated his suicide vest killing both Aitzaz and himself. No other school student was injured. Less than one year and 100 miles later, this happened: ​ ​ On this occasion, terrorists managed to enter another school building and killed around 140 school students. This time sadly, there was no Aitzaz around to stop them. For his bravery and courage, Aitzaz was declared Herald's Person of the Year for 2014 and his school was renamed Aitzaz Hasan Shaheed High School. Updated 3w ago • View Upvotes
