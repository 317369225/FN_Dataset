How does garbage collection work in Android 4.2 Jelly Bean Dalvik? - please see the comment
In Android Dalvik, every process runs in its own virtual machine and every application has its own process and heap. Also, every application has own Garbage collector, even if it is sharing memory with other applications. Dalvik Garbage Collector uses Mark and Sweep approach. Here is how it works - 1. Maintain a free list that contains all the heap memory blocks that are free. 2. If a process requests a free block and the free list is empty, then invoke the Garbage Collector which works as follows -     a. Mark the bits for objects that are in use and hence should not be garbage collected. These mark bits are stored separate from other heap memory.     b.Sweep and collect all unmarked heap blocks and put them back to the free list. You can refer to the following link for more details on Mark and Sweep - Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collection
