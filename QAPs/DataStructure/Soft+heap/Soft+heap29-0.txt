Conspiracy Theories: Was General George S. Patton assassinated?
Accident. It is a relatively unknown fact that there are many accidental deaths in war. I am not talking about friendly fire or disease, but accidents.  Like trucks rolling over, tank to truck 'car accidents', fuel explosions, ammo explosions, gun misfires, pedestrian accidents, machine repair accidents, electrocution, falls etc. It may become clearer is you think simply of the number of people involved.  If there are millions of men and women doing ANYTHING together, it is quite natural that there will be many accidental injuries and deaths. Patton's road accident is only one example.
