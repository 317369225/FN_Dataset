What are the most creative poems you ever read?
Coloured When I born, I black When I grow up, I black When I go in sun, I black When I scared, I black When I sick, I black And when I die, I still black And you white people When you born, you pink When you grow up, you white When you go in sun, you red When you cold, you blue When you scared, you yellow When you sick, you green And when you die, you grey And you calling me coloured? I couldn't ignore the way the writer has brought out his/her pain so creatively. Edit: 1. There has been some concern about the source of this poem in the comments section. I have searched through the internet to find the same but couldn't find a reliable one.  If someone finds it, please share. It would be highly appreciated. 2. Some people are finding this poem racist. Well, yes it talks about colour. But when I read it, all I could imagine was someone who has suffered being called "coloured" just for the skin tone he/she has  saying "Dude, I don't even fall in the category of "coloured" by nature and facts, let alone human demarkations and discriminations". However, we all are free to interpret it whichever way we like.
