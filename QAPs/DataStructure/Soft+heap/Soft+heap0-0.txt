Data Structures: What is an intuitive explanation of a soft heap?
Disclaimer: It's been a few years and the following is not how it was explained to me.  In addition, my understanding of the different topics presented is more cursory than exact. I might compare a soft heap to approximate computing: providing better bounds and faster amortized operations than other heap-like data structures at the cost of having an exact answer.  Basically, there is an error parameter for how "corrupted" the heap is, where a corrupted element is one that is represented by an upper bound (for a min heap) of its value as opposed to its inserted value. The exact specifics of a soft heap escapes me right now, though the wikipedia article (Soft heap) is fairly informative.
