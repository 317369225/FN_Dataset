What are some good recipes using Garbanzo beans other than Hummus?
Falafel!!! here is my recipe:   http://litman.com/food/falafel.htm INGREDIENTS: 2 cups of Chick peas - one part Chana Dal, and 2 parts of dry standard Chick peas 1 Tablespoon of Cumin 1.5 Tablespoons of ground Coriander 5 Cloves of Garlic 1 Small onion 1 Bunch of Cilantro or Parsley (or a mix of the two). 1 Tablespoon of Salt 1 teaspoon of hot paprika PARATION: Soak the chick peas in water for 12 hours (until you can bite into a big kernel and it is soft through and through). Drain the peas and let them sit for a while until all the water drained, and they are almost dry. Runs the peas and all other ingredients through a meat grinder (onion, garlic, herbs and all) Add salt, spices Mix all very well until the mixture is uniform Heat up vegetables oil to 350f (remember, we are deep frying, deep!) Take on heaping tablespoon of the mixture and form a ball (1.25" or so in diameter), but be careful not to pack it down too much, try to keep it as fluffy as you can without it falling apart. Drop one ball into the oil and fry it until it is dark gold in color Now the fun part: eat it! does it need more salt? More cumin? adjust and try again, Now go ahead fry the rest.
