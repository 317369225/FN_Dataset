Was Samwise Gamgee the real 'hero' of the Lord of the Rings story?
There wasn't really one "real" hero. Sam began as a gardener, then a cook and general assistant, and Frodo was the hero. But at the end Sam was the one who saved the day, holding off Gollum long enough for Frodo to get all the way in the Sammath Naur. He summoned up courage that he didn't know he had. Yet he remained, even after they returned, still Frodo's servant. Tolkien was a strict social conservative of his time, believing that people should know their place and not try to get above it. Sam fits this description perfectly.
