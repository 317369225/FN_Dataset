History of Europe:Â Who won the Thirty Years' War?
Nobody really won the Thirty years war. What do you expect from a conflict that started with the defenstration of Prague when a bunch of diplomats got pushed out of a window onto a nice soft dung heap beneath and ended in the damp squib of the treaty of Westephalia. It has to be said that despite the death in battle of Gustav Adolphus that Sweden came out pretty well and was set on course for its expansion. European protestantism despite the setbacks of state certification survived pretty well as well.
