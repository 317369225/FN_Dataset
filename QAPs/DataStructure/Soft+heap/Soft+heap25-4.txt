Was Samwise Gamgee the real 'hero' of the Lord of the Rings story?
He is one of the heroes of Lord of the Rings. I would argue that there are several in the book. It is clear that both the real writer (Tolkien) and the in-universe writer (Frodo) consider Sam integral to the completion of the quest, and a hero. So do the other characters in the book. After all, both Sam and Frodo are praised on the Field of Cormallen after they are rescued from Mordor. It is also clear, though, that they consider Frodo equally a hero. As readers, we are given the gift of thinking what we wish about the characters. So in my opinion, Frodo and Sam are heroes, but so are Eowyn, Faramir, and Aragorn, to name my favorites. So too there are multiple villains: Saruman, Sauron, Denethor, Grima, the Sackville-Bagginses, and you can decide which are truly villains and which are tragically misunderstood. There is a lot to learn from Sam's character, and if you as the reader identify most with him and like him the best, then more power to you. Hooray for Tolkien's writing and story that allow you to find so many characters to admire!
