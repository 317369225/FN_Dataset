What is the fastest way to find the median of an unsorted array of n integers?
Yes, Quickselect.Â  The C++ std::nth_element() library function implements this. (edit: oops, STL implementations can be expected to be the hybrid Introselect algorithm mentioned by Michal, rather than straight Quickselect.)
