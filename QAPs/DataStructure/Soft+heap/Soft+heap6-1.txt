History of Europe: Who won the Thirty Years' War?
No one really won it.  After immense suffering and loss, things were much the same at the end of the war as they had been at the beginning.   It did establish that Protestantism would survive in Germany, and that Germany would not be pulled together as a single modern kingdom.  You could call it a limited victory for the local rulers, "princes", though most of them had some lesser title than "prince".  It was a contrast to France, where local autonomy was successfully destroyed under Louis 14th.   There is an odd notion among Political Scientists that the idea of sovereign states originated with the Peace of Westphalia.  But historians don't see it so.  It only applied to the "Holy Roman Empire", which was really the Kingdom of Germany, but nominally ruled by an Emperor.  Most of Europe consisted of sovereign states when politics settled down after the fall of the Roman Empire.
