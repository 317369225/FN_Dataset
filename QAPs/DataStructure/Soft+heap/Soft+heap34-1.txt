What are some of the witty remarks made by the commentators during a cricket match?
This took place between Rahul Dravid and Nasser Hussain during the Cricket World Cup 2015 Quarter-Final between India and Bangladesh on March 19, 2015. Nasser: Have your boys peaked too early, Rahul? Rahul: Better to peak early than not peak at all. You have to peak early to make the quarters actually. That's sort of the rule of the tournament. Shane Warne, who was also in the commentary box, joined them Warne: You expected that answer, didn't you Nasser ? Nasser: From you maybe, not from the nicest manÂ  in world cricket. Rahul: I was sledged all along in the last commentary stint in about 2007, just itching to give it back. Sorry Nasser.
