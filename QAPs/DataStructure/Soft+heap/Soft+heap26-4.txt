What is it like to work at McKinsey?
It is definitely more exciting than any other job because you solve real problems and you have a diversity of different types of work. You can't really get bored. But you will get very very tired and sometimes depressed because of all the very long hours, excessive travel, continuous stress and cut-throat evaluation. If you're that type go for it.
