Why are Illinois politicians so unusually corrupt?

Illinois has produced politicians who were national symbols of honesty. What is certain is that the population of Illinois are uncommonly honest, especially outside of Chicago, and very involved in politics. Politicians from Delaware are notorious for being in the pocket of the banking industry, politicians from Oklahoma are spokesmen for the medical industry ( while medical care in Oklahoma is worse), politicians from Nevada represent the gaming industry.These facts are notorious, have been true for a long time, and no investigation is likely. Politics in Illinois is a free-for-all, it is a genuinely democratic participatory sport. There is less hidden in Illinois that in Oklahoma. For one thing Illinois has always had good newspapers and good investigative reporting.
