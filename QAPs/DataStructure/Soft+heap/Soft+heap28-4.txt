Why are Illinois politicians so unusually corrupt?
A major contributing factor is the overabundance of overlapping jurisdictions and the positions of power that each of these jurisdictions add to the bureaucratic administration. For example, if you live within the city limits, you will likely be under the overlapping jurisdictions of the City of Chicago, Cook County, and the State of Illinois for various governmental services.  Add to that jurisdictions of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (covering most of Chicago and large parts of Cook County).  Again, add the Cook County Forest Preserve, which administers land both within and outside of the city limits.  If you live in the suburbs, your school / library / water districts may not be coterminous with your village / township.  And so on... Each of these layers of government has within it highly contested centers of power which individuals have historically used to their own advantage once elected.  This tradition has been with the city since its founding and our Byzantine political structure has evolved around this principle.  Compare this to a state like Virginia in which incorporated cities are autonomous.  This is to say that each city is its own independent entity which does not fall under the jurisdiction of a county administration.  This lessens the number of political positions which can be abused and hopefully curtails opportunities for corruption. Another interesting example would be the city of Indianapolis, which merged its city government with the surrounding county government to form the Unigov. Updated 140w ago • View Upvotes
