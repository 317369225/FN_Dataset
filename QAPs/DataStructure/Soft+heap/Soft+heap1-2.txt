What is the most efficient algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an array having n unordered elements?
There are couple of ways to do it, depending upon the memory availability you can choose one. First is using quick sort where based on the pivot position after each iteration, we know how many elements are smaller than pivot and are greater than it. Based on position of pivot, we look in left or right of pivot for kth smallest element. This method works when we can bring all elements in memory at a time.

Create a max heap of K elements and after that check each element, if that is greater than root of heap, pop root and add new element to the heap. Once we are done with all elements, we will be left with k smallest elements. Â Heaps : Find K smallest element from a given array
