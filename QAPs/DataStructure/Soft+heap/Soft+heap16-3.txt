The Phone Call Can I use your mobile phone? asked the old man. Sure said Jai. The train was moving fast and most passengers were preparing to sleep. The old man made a quick call, returned the phone and prepared to leave. He got down at the next station. After an hour or so, Jai was woken up from sleep, his phone was ringing. The voice on the other end was troubled and enquiring about the person who had called an hour back. Jai listened carefully, it was the wife of the old man who had used his phone a while ago. He informed her that the man had already disembarked at an earlier station. The woman on the other end explained that her husband was forgetful, and he had disembarked at wrong station, since she was waiting at the correct station, and train hadn't reached yet! Situation seemed desperate. Jai promised to meet the old woman at the next station. As the train slowed down at the next station, Jai spotted her. She explained that her husband was carrying money for treatment of their daughter, and the matter couldn't wait. After a quick thought, Jai offered her some money, enough to begin the treatment. Just Rs 4000. And then, Jai continued with the train journey. He forgot all about it until a week later, a lady called him enquiring about his well being. This was the same girl, for whom Jai had provided a small amount for treatment at a railway station! She thanked him, and insisted on transferring the loaned amount to his bank account. Jai said it was Rs 2000 plus massive interest! And they laughed. Next day Rs 4000 was credited to his bank account with the message: Thank-you traveller. May you never stop.
