History of Europe:Â Who won the Thirty Years' War?
The more important question is not who won the war, but who had lost. Long story short, the party who lost was that of the House of Habsburg. The Habsburgs ruled as Kings of Spain, Naples, and Sicily, and Dukes of Burgundy and Milan (Spanish branch) as well as Emperors of Holy Roman Empire, Kings of Bohemia and Hungary (Austrian branch). Two lines of conflict directed the course of the war Spanish Habsburgs against the Dutch Republic (1621 - 1648) and France (1635 - 1659) Austrian Habsburgs against the Protestant States of Holy Roman Empire (Bohemia, Palatinate etc. [1618 - 1625]), Denmark (1625 - 1629) Sweden (1632 - 1648), and France (1636 - 1648) The aims of the Spanish Habsburgs was the submission of Dutch Republic, a former hereditary territory of their house, as well as the defense of their European and overseas territories from the depredations of the Dutch and the French. They failed on both accounts - the Dutch maintained their independence and impressed it on the international scene, while the French re-entered European stage with style - by conquering a number of Spanish-held territories. The ravages of war also caused a revolt in Catalonia and Portugal. It took the crown almost twenty years to reconquer the former, but the latter maintained its independence to this day. The Austrian Habsburgs, who emerged victorious from the conflicts with Bohemian rebels, Calvinist Palatinate, and the Danes, fared better. They lost no territories outright, but the title of Holy Roman Emperor lost much of its prestige. Protestantism was pushed back but not defeated. Lutheran Kings of Sweden and Calvinist Margraves of Brandenburg both gained considerable territories, with the former continuing to intervene in German affairs for the next 50 years. Switzerland, the ancient homeland of Habsburgs, was lost to them forever.
