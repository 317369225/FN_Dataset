What are some nice, beautiful stories?
I was finally getting around to cleaning up my desk, and I found a piece of paper. It was a "To Do List" that I wrote just before our six-year-old Ellie passed away. The items on the list relate to buying Ellie's cello, setting up the kids swim meet, and getting the address to pay Nathan (Ellie's cello teacher). Ellie must have seen the list, and she added an important item at the end. I feel like she's still loving me today when I find these treasures. ------------------------ Learn more about Ellie's Way.
