How do I apply various checks on my code for time-limit, memory-limit, etc irrespective of my programming language?
Assuming your server runs on Linux, you can use the timeout and time command. Note the time command I am using here is not the bash built in but a separate package which you might need to install separately (the package is named time in repos for Arch Linux). Anyway, running a command with a 3 second time limit looks something like this. The * prefixed parts are what I think should matter to you according to the question. Look more into the man pages of these commands to get a finer control over this. $ /usr/bin/time -v timeout 3 ./a.outCommand being timed: "timeout 3 ./a.out"	User time (seconds): 0.05	System time (seconds): 0.01	Percent of CPU this job got: 30%*Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:00.22	Average shared text size (kbytes): 0	Average unshared data size (kbytes): 0	Average stack size (kbytes): 0	Average total size (kbytes): 0*Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 4532	Average resident set size (kbytes): 0	Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 3	Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 8470	Voluntary context switches: 76	Involuntary context switches: 48	Swaps: 0	File system inputs: 288	File system outputs: 8	Socket messages sent: 0	Socket messages received: 0	Signals delivered: 0	Page size (bytes): 4096*Exit status: 0
