Which is a better place to live: Mumbai or Bangalore?
Both the cities have their pros and cons Having lived in both the cities this is what I have to stay Mumbai Pros : Commute- Locals are the best to make long distance travel, autos are less notorious than Bangalore Culture - More cross culture as people from all walks of life in different industries ,rather than the regular IT crowd of Bangalore Night Life- Much better than any other city, not only for partying but late night food , travel all options are open. Bangalore seems dead post 11pm Sea Side- Best place to relax after daily work Cons : Accommodation is costly, rented or otherwise. For a middle class man ,probably his life's entire earning would go for buying a flat Eating out is costlier compared to bangalore Less tech savy city than bangalore . In Bangalore u can roam about the city, eat out have fun just with a paytm wallet. Bangalore Pros: Weather- The best in the country, rains often, neither very hot in summer neither chilling in winter Accommodation- Cheaper compared to Mumbai and Pune. From buying perspective cheaper then NCR as well. Also flat hunt in Bangalore is much easier thanks to technology Availability of food- Lots and lots of eateries in every lane and bylane Health- A more health concious city in my opinion. Not an uncommon sight to see office executives travelling on bicycle Technology- As mentioned above, u have an app for everything in bangalore, mumbai also has it, but infrastructure to support those app based initiatives are stronger in bangalore Parks- If mumbai has its beach bangalore has its parks and lots of them Cons: Commute- If u dont have ur own vehicle ,life is gonna be very tough in Bangalore Airport- 40 kms out of city, eats up a lot of ur time, can never catch an early morning cheap flight Language- People from the lower socio-economic strata mostly speak in Kannada and negotiations with them becomes tricky
