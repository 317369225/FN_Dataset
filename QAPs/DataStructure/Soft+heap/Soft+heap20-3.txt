Dominique Ansel (NYC bakery):Â What is it like to obtain and eat a cronut?
It was a fantastic day. One of my friends is friends with Dominique and his wife(?). The bakery was having its 2nd anniversary party which coincided with my friend's birthday. We stopped by the store, and I got to meet them which was a massive treat for me. They were both so nice. After spending some time in the garden with some birthday mousse cake (delicious I might add), my friend gave me one of the Cronuts that Dominique had set aside for him. I was elated!!! I actually did a happy dance and clicked my heels. My other friend told me to keep it together. I then proceeded to order $20 of other pastries. Unfortunately, my boyfriend had thrown out his knee, but I really wanted to share the Cronut with him. It was the longest subway ride ever. ... Finally, I arrived home and I showed my boyfriend a gold box and asked him to guess what was inside! I don't even know if I gave him a chance to answer, but I remember springing open the box and hearing cherubim singing in my head. He let me take the first bite, and I thought it was... AMAZING. Soft, chewy, flaky, sweet, creamy. So many wonderful layers and dimensions of deliciousness. The current flavor is salted dulce de leche, which is a gorgeous combination of sweet and salty. He tasted it next, and we both marveled at how good it was. Heaps better than the imposter "Crumbnut" we had tried a few weeks prior. We took turns taking bites of the Cronut, savoring each bite. The other pastries were also amazing. Dominique is a really genius with desserts. I even tweeted about it all, and Dominique favorited it which is just about the coolest thing I could hope for! It's been a couple of days since we had our Cronut. We are still regaling our friends with how good it was and wishing we could go back and get more goodies...
