What are the most creative poems you ever read?
Creative Flow by Christy Ann Martine “Words swim inside my head  as I drift into a lyrical sea Emotions flow into rhythmic waves  as diluted thoughts flood the pages Paper drenched in melodic verse,  passion surges and I’m submerged, Drowning in inspiration as ink drips from my pen" Masks by Shel Silverstein “She had blue skin, And so did he. He kept it hid And so did she. They searched for blue Their whole life through, Then passed right by- And never knew.”
