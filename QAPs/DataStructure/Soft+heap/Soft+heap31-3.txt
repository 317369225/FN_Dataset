What is your favorite local dish that includes cheese?
My favourite cheese based dish is tartiflette. It is made in France, in the haute-savoie (in the alps). The cheese used is reblochon, and the recipe was invented to sell reblochon a little better ï¿¼ The ingredients are potatoes, lardons (it is like bacon but cut in cubes), onions and cheese. It is a great winter dish!
