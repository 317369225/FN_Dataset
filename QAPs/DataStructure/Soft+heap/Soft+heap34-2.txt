What are some of the witty remarks made by the commentators during a cricket match?
1. 2. This incident happened in the recently concluded World cup match between  India vs Bangladesh ( 03/19/2015 ) when Nasser Hussain, Rahul Dravid and Shane Warne were in the commentary box.  The  context of this discussion: Since India have been playing so well until  now, Nasser Hussain was unsure whether they would  be able to emulate  their performance in the semi-final against  Australia, a much difficult  opponent.  Nasser: Have your boys peaked too early, Rahul? Rahul: Better to peak early than not peak at all. You have to peak  early to  make the quarters actually. That's sort of the rule of the   tournament(referring to England's first round exit).  Warne: You didn't expect that, did you Nass? Nasser: From you maybe, not from the nicest man  in world cricket. Rahul: Sorry, I've been coping with it since 2007, wanted to give it back to someone. Shane Warne Bursts out in Laughter...! 3. Nasser Hussain: When can I see India in FIFA world cup? Saurav Ganguly : If India had Played Football for 50 years, then we would have qualified for the finals at least once. P.S: Will add more in the future. Updated 44w ago • View Upvotes
