What are some cool words used in your language, with their meaning?
English Defenestration : The act of throwing a person or thing out of a window. Flibbertigibbet: A whimsical, silly or flighty person. Spoonerism: Transposing the syllables of one word to another which is 'nucking futs' sounding when it happens. These are my three favorite words other than Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. The roots of the word have been defined as follows: super- "above", cali- "beauty", fragilistic- "delicate", expiali- "to atone", and -docious "educable", with the sum of these parts signifying roughly "Atoning for educability through delicate beauty." According to the film, it is defined as "something to say when you have nothing to say". Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious was first added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1986
