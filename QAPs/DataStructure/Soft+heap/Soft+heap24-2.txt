What are some examples of no bake cakes recipe?
There are none -- assuming you do not use pre-baked goods as ingredients -- [ I am being very literal on purpose -- and am assuming you want to start from scratch. ] I simply would not call a "cake" something that has not been baked at some point. Of course, you can prepare a dessert without baking, for example by using ingredients that have been baked previously.Â  Tiramisu immediately comes to mind. But baking was involved.
