What are some examples of no bake cakes recipe?
My grandmother and then my mother made what they called chocolate pudding cake. They layered graham crackers, sliced bananas, and freshly prepared hot chocolate pudding in a rectangular of square pan (I've used a loaf pan). I think they made two layers of each, ending with the pudding. Refrigerate it until it's cold. The hot pudding softens the crackers--it's really good. Another is the classic icebox cake: 2 cups heavy whipping cream                                               2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar                                     1 teaspoon vanilla extract                                               1 package (9 ounces) chocolate wafers chocolate curls, optional                                                In  a large bowl, beat cream until soft peaks form. Add sugar and vanilla;  beat until stiff. Spread heaping teaspoonfuls on the cookies. Make six  stacks of cookies; turn stacks on edge and place on a serving platter,  forming a 14-in.-long cake.                                                 Frost top and sides with remaining whipped cream. Garnish with  chocolate curls if desired. Refrigerate for 4-6 hours before serving.                                                        Yield: 10-12 servings.                                                 (picture and recipe from Icebox Cake) The cream will soften the cookies and make them taste like cake. When you cut it, slice it at an angle--it's prettier.
