What are some examples of no bake cakes recipe?
This recipe was my favourite as a small child. It's great for children's parties and adults like it too. Uncooked Chocolate Cake 1lb Biscuit crumbs (Lincoln) ½lb Butter ¼lb Bournville Chocolate 2tbsp Sugar 2tbsp Golden syrup 4tbsp Chocolate powder Beat butter, sugar and chocolate powder to a cream. Add melted syrup and crumbs and stir in. Pour mixture into well-greased small cake tin with spring-loaded sides and press down with a weight after covering with buttered paper. Keep overnight until set. Turn out and ice with melted chocolate mixed with 1tbsp water. Decorate. (Lincoln biscuits are almost impossible to get now but a 50/50 mixture of Rich Tea and shortbread finger biscuits gives a roughly equivalent crumb. Decoration is good with Smarties or M&Ms. Smarties are not sold in the US. Golden syrup may be hard to get in the US but it is available made by Tate & Lyle.)
