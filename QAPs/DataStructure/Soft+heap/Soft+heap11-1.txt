What all things do I need to know about Garbage collector in Java for a tech interview?
Garbage Collection is the process that prevents memory leaks by reclaiming the memory which has lost all references. Before reclaiming the object memory and putting it to memory pool, java calls object finalize method. An object memory is treated unreferenced when the last handler has been assigned another object. Assigning last reference to null doesn't mark it illegible for Garbage Collection. System.gc() can be used for invoking Garbage collection but it doesn't necessarily invoke the GC immediately. Its upto JVM when to invoke the garbage collection. More at - Java - Interview Questions and Answers on Garbage Collection Updated 76w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
