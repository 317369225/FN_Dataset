Dominique Ansel (NYC bakery): What is it like to obtain and eat a cronut?
I agree with Sheila Christine Lee.  I queued on July 2nd because I hate to miss out on new food experiences and I happened to be in New York from London. I actually woke up before my alarm so decided to go anyway.  I took a book (should have taken a better one) and met some nice people in the queue once it started moving.  I wish I'd had someone offer to buy my second cronut because I didn't really want to eat two and it didn't travel well! It does take a long time to get in once the queue starts moving but in Summer not a big deal to wait. I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't rush to have it again.  I found it kind of greasy.  I also bought the salted lemon tart, chocolate cookie and the canelle.  By far the canelle was the nicest thing, though the tart was excellent too. Dominique is definitely a talented baker (and a nice guy) but I'd sooner have a doughnut from Dough and a croissant from Gail's or Sketch in London or Pierre Herme in Paris (get the Ispahan one!).
