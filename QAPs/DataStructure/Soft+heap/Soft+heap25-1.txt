Was Samwise Gamgee the real 'hero' of the Lord of the Rings story?
In The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, #131 to Milton Waldman, Tolkien refers to Sam as “the chief hero”. So certainly in the author’s own opinion, this was the case. More broadly, Sam represents the more typical hobbit—which is to say, the Middle-earth version of the solid, rustic Englishman as Tolkien saw him. Frodo was of course central to the plot, but he was an aberration as a hobbit—“high-minded”, as Tolkien put it in his letters, and (hence, he said) less relatable: learned, a friend to elves. Other than a rustic Englishman representing the countryside that Tolkien so dearly loved, Sam also represented the loyal batman. Tolkien fought and suffered in the trenches of the Great War—and escaped alive perhaps only because he caught trench fever and was too sick to stay on the battlefield: later, when someone suggested that LotR was an allegory for WW2, he pointed out that the first World War was just as brutal for the people fighting in it, and that by 1918, all but one of his close friends had been killed. It seems he came away with a tremendous respect and fondness for the common British ‘Tommy’, and the sense I get is that he feels that though the officer (or Frodo) may have been more aware of the grander strategies and purposes, it was the grit and loyalty and common English decency of the Tommies (or Sam) that really helped them come out on top.
