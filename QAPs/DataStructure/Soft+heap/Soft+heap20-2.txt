Dominique Ansel (NYC bakery):Â What is it like to obtain and eat a cronut?
I used TaskRabbit recently to get two cronuts from Dominque Ansel. In response to this two-part question: Obtaining the cronuts. The TaskRabbit experience was excellent. Rather than get up at 5am and wait in line for two hours, someone else did it for me. The TaskRabbit person was great. Showed up on-time, cronuts in-hand. Eating the cronut. Honestly, I thought it was overrated. I suspect that you have to be a foodie / lover of fine food to truly appreciate the cronut. It was too complicated for me. I prefer a simpler taste in desserts -- like a Krispy Kreme jelly donut.
