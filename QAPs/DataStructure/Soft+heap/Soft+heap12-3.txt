How should I prepare for a software engineer interview at Facebook?
When I was preparing for my interview (and for a handful of internships before) I would start with a copy of  Programming Interviews Exposed by Mongan for a broad overview / reminder of topics. For diving deeper into any topic I would also review Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen. I practiced writing code by hand and talking through solutions. This was not in an effort to memorize possible questions or answers, but rather to make sure I was comfortable writing code by hand on a whiteboard and verbalizing my thought process. I also had a friend who was interviewing at the time and we were able to practice together. It's good to decide ahead of time what language you want to use, and make sure you are comfortable with the finer points of the language and the common data structures.  We don't expect you to be an expert in every language, but it would be nice to be solid in your language of choice. I was using C++ the most at the time and remember reviewing The C++ Resources Network. (Also check out this post: Get that job at Facebook)
