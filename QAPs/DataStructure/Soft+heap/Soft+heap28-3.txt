Why are Illinois politicians so unusually corrupt?
It's not just Chicago, and Wisconsin doesn't really compare.  In my lifetime, no less than four Illinois governors have gone to jail for corruption: Otto Kerner, Dan Walker, George Ryan, and Rod Blagojevich.  Of the four, only two were tied to the Chicago machine (Kerner and Blagojevich, both by marrying into it).  Dan Walker grew up in California and made his name as an anti-machine reformer after he went to law school at Northwestern and settled in Chicago.  George Ryan was a downstate Republican.  These four don't have any political culture in common, so either it's just a coincidence, or it has to do with the structure of Illinois politics. And it's the latter.  Money makes the political carousel go around in Springfield no less than in Chicago.  Legal impediments to thinly-veiled bribery are weak in Illinois, and federal prosecution (all four governors went to jail in federal charges, not state charges) hasn't deterred what is common practice.  If you want to become governor, you can either rely on the Chicago machine (which works less and less well these days), build your own warchest (frequently while occupying the Secretary of State's office - George Ryan's path), or by mounting an outsider's campaign (the rarest, but it's the way Walker did it.  It's also how the current governor, Pat Quinn, got to be Lt. Gov. while Blagojevich was in office).  Stuff enough money under an outsider's nose, unfortunately, and most of them turn out to be eminently corruptible. Now think about money in politics and Citizens United.  De te fabula narratur folks.
