Sir Nicholas Winton organized a rescue operation that saved the lives of 669 Czechoslovak Jewish children from the concentration camps, by transferring them to safe in England in the years 1938-1939. After the war, his efforts remained unknown until 1988 when his wife found a book from 1939 with the full list of names and photos of children. This is an excerpt of the video featuring Nicholas Winton, unknowingly sitting among those same Jews that he had saved 50 years earlier, being revealed the identity of the crowd around him.
