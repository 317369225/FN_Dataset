What are some cool words used in your language, with their meaning?
My mother tongue is Tamil but I speak Malayalam more often. Some words I love to use are : 1. അനന്തം  (anantham)-  that which is endless, sky, the Supreme Soul, salvation. 2. മ്ലേച്ഛം (mlechcham) - something deemed unfit/unworthy. I love the way it comes off the tongue. Mla-ech-cham. 3. ഐതിഹ്യം ( aitihyam) - a legend/ story passed down generations 4. അജഗജാന്തരം ( Ajagajaantharam)- Aja(refers to goat-like) and gaja(elephant-like). So Ajagajantharam refers to the size difference between an elephant or a goat or in other words, a huge difference. 5.തൂവാനത്തുമ്പികൾ(Thoovaanathumbikal) - Dragonflies in the spraying rain. This is also the name of a much acclaimed Malayalam film. Here are some  other words which are not deep-rooted but commonly used in daily life, especially among the youth. Credits to All Things Malayali  for these images : 6.Puli - Describes a geek/ accomplished man/tiger. " Ivan puli aanu" means " He is an awesome/accomplished/badass guy". EDIT : Puli means panther in Malayalam. The pic says Tiger( which is Kaduva) 7. Shashi - As per the textbook, it means the moon but has come to take a different meaning off late. 8. Post- An English word, post has come to occupy a very important place in the lexicon of the young Malayali. And then there are some commonly used English words which find extremely long Malayalam translations as per their functionality. 1. Switch becomes Vaidyuti Aagamana Nirgamana Niyanthrithopakarana Yantram ( electricity arrival and departure  control device) 2. Engineer becomes Yanthravidhagdan/vidhagda(male/female engineer) ( someone who designs/constructs machinery). 3. Silverscreen becomes Vellithira 4. Higher Education Centre becomes Uparipadana Kendram 5. Two-wheelers become Iru Chakra Vahanam 6. Bicycle is dwi-chakra-patha-bramitha-shakadam Nobody uses these words in common parlance. The English substitutes are used. Updated 86w ago • View Upvotes
