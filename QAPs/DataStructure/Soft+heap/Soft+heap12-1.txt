How should I prepare for a software engineer interview at Facebook?
First of all, don't believe a lot of the hyped up articles - even (especially?) the ones you see on Business Insider and the Wall Street Journal. They're perpetuating the same silly myths to get eyeballs, but it's all BS. Now for some advice: Prepare with actual interview questions that candidates have been asked (that is, don't read "top 10 lists" or news articles about interview questions - they're usually overhyped, and sometimes outright lies). CareerCup.com has thousands of software engineering questions asked at major companies. Practice by writing code on paper (NOT on a computer). Make your code perfect - every last semicolon should be there. Test your code by hand as well. Only once you've done everything possible to perfect your code, then type it into a compiler and see how you did. Don't worry too much about fancy algorithms like Dijkstra's. Complex algorithms rarely come up because, frankly, your interviewers probably don't remember them too well. Again, look at actual interview questions and see how often this stuff comes up. If you find that you're missing some knowledge required to solve interview questions, then read up on it. Most people with a strong background in CS will not need to re-learn many things. In your interview, write as close as possible to fully complete, correct. No pseudocode (note: it's fine to start with pseudocode, if that helps you, but you can't only write pseudocode). Again, every last semi-colon (although your interviewer will probably overlook missing a few semi-colons :)). Once you're done writing code in your interview, test it. You wouldn't submit code at work without testing it, so why do it in your interview? Think out loud. Show your interviewer how you're thinking about the problem. Don't be afraid to throw out a brute force solution in the beginning, but you should try to improve your solution as well. Think about the time and space complexity and see if you can improve those.You should also check out my book, Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Answers (http://www.amazon.com/dp/098478280X).
