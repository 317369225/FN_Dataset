What are the most creative poems you ever read?
There are many inspirational poems, but this one touched my heart. I read it in my class 6,It teach us one of the most important lesson, "Never Give Up". Tis a lesson you should heed, If at first you don't succeed, Try, try and try again; Then your courage should appear, For if you will persevere, You will conquer, never fear Try, try and try again; Once or twice, though you should fail, If you would at last prevail, Try, try and try again; If we strive, 'tis no disgrace Though we do not win the race; What should you do in the case? Try, try and try again If you find your task is hard, Time will bring you your reward, Try, try and try again All that other folks can do, Why, with patience, should not you? Only keep this rule in view: Try, try and try again.
