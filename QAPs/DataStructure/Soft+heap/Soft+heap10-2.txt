What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
This question deserves a lengthy answer beyond the scope of Quora. Let me know if it gets annoying. Send me edits to reduce the content. Better way to change directory: If you are a command-line user, autojump is a must have package. You can change directory by just specifying a part of directory name (without subdirs). You can also use jumpstat to get a statistics of your directory jumps. $ j  log /var/log $ j ard /home/ab/work/arduino Free up disk space: bleachbit is a neat utility to find and remove files based on application specific knowledge. Few more useful tools: localepurge, deborphan/orphaner, computer-janitor-gtk. Undelete for console: Save frustration. libtrash provides trashcan/recycle-bin like functionality for console users. Also look at e2undel, recover, recoverjpeg tools. Sys-admin friendly relatively unknown tools: dstat, htop, iotop ethtool, mii-tool dmidecode lsof, netstat -nt freeipmi Run level editor: Save some boot time. rcconf: Cursed based tool for Debian, Ubuntu and clones ntsysv: Curses based tool for Red Hat and clones chkconfig: Command line tool for Red Hat and clones systemctl: Newer command line tool for Red Hat and clones update-rc.d: Command line tool for Debian, Ubuntu and clones Package search: Find which package this path/file belongs to: dpkg -S /path/to/file rpm -qf /path/to/file rpm -qa, apt-file are additional useful commands to take a look at. X Windows - Launch Application as other user: $ xhost +local: $ su - otheruser $ export DISPLAY=:0.0 $ xeyes Email Backup: offlineimap for imap users. Display blanking: Blank display: $ xset -display :0 dpms force standbyEnable / Disable screen sleep: xset s on; xset +dpms xset s off; xset -dpms Manual CPU Frequency Scaling Add these aliases to your .bashrc alias cpupowersave='sudo cpupower frequency-set -g powersave' alias cpuconservative='sudo cpupower frequency-set -g conservative' alias cpuondemand='sudo cpupower frequency-set -g ondemand' alias cpuperformance='sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance' alias freqinfo='cpupower frequency-info' alias freqlist='cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors' cputemperature(){ awk '{ print("Temperature: "$2"°F");}' < /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal; } Lenovo / Thinkpad Manual FAN Control To enable manual fan control, run this command once. $ echo "options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1" >  /etc/modprobe.d/thinkpad_acpi.conf                                   $ rmmod thinkpad_acpi; modprobe thinkpad_acpi Then add these aliases to your .bashrc. "fan-disengaged" command will unleash  the fan to max speed. I use it to rapidly cool down my CPU when it gets too hot watching video or caught inside my blanket.                                                  alias fan-off='sudo bash -c "echo level 0 > /proc/acpi/ibm/fan"' alias fan-low='sudo bash -c "echo level 2 > /proc/acpi/ibm/fan"' alias fan-med='sudo bash -c "echo level 4 > /proc/acpi/ibm/fan"' alias fan-max='sudo bash -c "echo level 7 > /proc/acpi/ibm/fan"' alias fan-auto='sudo bash -c "echo level auto > /proc/acpi/ibm/fan"'                                 alias fan-disengaged='sudo bash -c "echo level disengaged > /proc/acpi/ibm/fan"' ## disengaging may damage your fan over frequent use Mute / Unmute Sound: $ amixer set Master on|off Wireless network listing: $iwlist INTERFACE scanEg. $ iwlist wlan0 scan | grep ESSID Replace strings across multiple files: sed -i 's/OLD/NEW/g'  *.txtIf you are allergic to regex, you can use less powerful 'replaceit' tool. Reverse SSH: It is useful, when you want to let some one from outside world to SSH into your firewall protected local network (with no public IP). Use it with caution. SSH from local laptop to remote host: $ ssh -C -g -R :$REM-PORT:127.0.0.1:22 $REM-HOSTNow from any where, if you ssh to REMOTE-HOST:REMOTE-PORT, you will get connected to the local network (say from office to your laptop connected to home network). $ ssh $REM-HOST -p $REM-PORT Directory commands for console users: pushd .  push current dir to stack. You can push multiple dirs. popd     chdir to top of stack. cd -       chdir to previous dir.Also take a look at wcd and autojump, You can change to dir based on file names, matching patterns or bookmarks. Editing with Readline keys: Readline library provides GNU Emacs or Vi like key bindings. Number of packages such as GNU bash and ncftp uses libreadline for CLI and auto-completion. You can do amazing stunts with readline interface if you remember few GNU Emacs of Vi key strokes. I am only going to list GNU Emacs key strokes here.. Vi mode will probably slow you down. No vi bashing ;) Basic: Ctrl+a   Go to beginning of line. Ctrl+e   Go to end of line Ctrl+f   Go right one character. Ctrl+b   Go left one character. Ctrl+p   Go to previous line ("up") (only works in multiline text areas). Ctrl+n   Go to next line ("down") (only works in multiline text areas). Ctrl+k   Delete to end of line Ctrl+y    pastes from buffer. Ctrl+u  Delete entire line Ctrl+w Delete word, left. Ctrl+h  Delete character, left (backspace). Ctrl+d  Delete character, right. Ctrl+_   Undo. Ctrl+t    Char swap. Ctrl+c   Cancel Advanced Key Strokes: Alt+.       Last word of previous command. You can hit multiple times. Alt+u/d/c    Up case / Down case / Capitalize. Ctrl+r      Reverse history search. Alt+{      Auto complete wild-card expr of current dir contents Alt+</>  (<) Beginning,  (>)end of history. Alt+NUM   Repeat command. Eg: Alt+13 followed by 'e' prints 13 'e's. You can prefix commands too. Alt+4, Ctr+d deletes 4 chars forward. Alt+4, Ctrl+h deletes 4 chars backwards. Fun part is, you can use negative numbers. Alt+-4, Ctrl+d  deletes 4 chars backwards (negative commands). Also uncomment the following in your .bashrc. It will enable context sensitive auto-completion if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then    . /etc/bash_completionfi Add these lines to your ~/.bashrc for pdfinvert command. Rotates PDF documents in place to 180 degrees. You must have installed pdftk package. pdfinvert() {     if [ -z "$1" ]; then         echo "Usage: pdfinvert FILE.PDF"     else         pdftk "$1" cat 1-endD output "$1.bak" && \             mv -f "$1.bak" "$1"     fi } Readline even has a startup file. It is pretty powerful. Follow the URL: http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/c... Readline for Gnome / GTK based applications: If you are using Gnome desktop, try this command. All GTK+ applications will respond to your GNU Emacs key strokes. gconftool-2 permanently adds this setting to your Gnome configuration database (registry). Changes are applied instantly without requiring any application restart. $ gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme Emacs --type string Readline for Python Interpreter: You can activate readline inside python interpreter and  tab-complete function calls. You can also try "bpython" or "ipython" alternatively. $ python >>> import rlcompleter, readline >>> readline.parse_and_bind('tab: complete') Readline for GNU Guile Interpreter: You can activate readline inside guile interpreter and  tab-complete function calls. $ guile guile> (use-modules (ice-9 readline)) guile> (activate-readline) Readline for Ruby Interpreter: You can activate readline inside Ruby interpreter and  tab-complete function calls. $ irb irb(main):001:0> require 'irb/completion' => true Readline for APT package management: Install readline capable interactive APT shell on Debian, Ubuntu and clones. $ apt-get install aptsh $ aptsh Relatively Unknown GNU Emacs Tricks: GNU Emacs is an operating system on its own. Listing emacs treasures will be endless. Rectangular cut-copy: C-DEL - mark region, C-x r k - cut rectangular region, C-x r y - insert rectangular region. C-h b - describe key bindings and its functions specific to current mode. ANY-PARTIAL-KEY-BINDINGS, C-h - Describes possible completions. For example try, C-x r, C-h. C-h f - describe emacs function. M-x apropos-command - List config options for commands matching approximately.  C-x C-e - evaluate expression preceding point within a buffer. C-M-x - evaluate expression at point.  Try evaluating this string '(+ 99 24 444)'   M-x flyspell-buffer - on the fly spell checking. M-x global-font-lock-mode - toggle syntax coloring. M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode - When you are in directory listing mode, try this command. You will be able to edit file and dir names like text. Even find and replace them. When you are done, simply C-x C-s to apply changes. I use this feature to bulk edit music file names in combination with id3tool.  .emacs startup file: following variables let Emacs manage backup files under a custom directory. (custom-set-variables '(backup-by-copying t) '(backup-by-copying-when-linked t) '(backup-directory-alist (quote ((".*" . "~/.emacs-backup")))) '(delete-old-versions t)) (menu-bar-mode nil) ;; saves menu bar space (display-time-mode) ;; displays time always in status bar If nothing works, at least remember C-x, C-c to gracefully shutdown GNU Emacs ;-).
