What are good progressive rock and post-rock bands that I should listen to?
Welcome to the two most beautiful genres of music, ever! I have explored prog rock pretty well and I am exploring post rock these days, hence I think I can answer your question. You have a good start with Porcupine Tree, since it is one of the best prog rock bands in the world. Today's definition of prog is changing. Djent is the new prog (and it sucks, except a couple of really good bands). Here are some paths you can follow to develop your taste: (I'm categorizing them by styles and increasing heaviness) Porcupine Tree > No Man > Blackfield > Steven Wilson - All lead/produced/performed on by Steven Wilson Dream Theater > Lemur Voice > Suncaged > Opeth > Cynic > Meshuggah - Progressive metal to Progressive Death Metal Spock's Beard > The Flower Kings > Kaipa > Transatlantic > Explorer's Club - Symphonic Progressive Rock Tool (you cannot skip this band!) > Three > Coheed and Cambria > The Mars Volta - Progressive Alternative rock Genesis > Yes > King Crimson > Rush > ELP > Gentle Giant - Classic Progressive Rock. Gordian Knot > Liquid Tension Experiment >Behold the Arctopus - Instrumental prog Additionally you can check out bands like Oceansize, Circus Maximus, Dali's Dilemma etc. Since I'm a newbie with Post Rock, I'll suggest a couple of good bands which I enjoy: Jakob, Explosions in the Sky, Lights Out Asia (electronic post rock), *shels, This will destroy you, GY! BE, Joy Wants Eternity, Mogwai, Sigur Ros, The All Star Project. Post Metal - Isis, Cult of Luna, Jesu, Rosetta, The Ocean, Hopesfall, Pelican etc.
