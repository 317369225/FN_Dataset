How should I prepare for a software engineer interview at Facebook?
At Facebook, Google, and the likes, interviews are usually on your aptitude and fundamental data structure/ algorithmic skills. * If an interviewer asks you about polymorphism or uses technical jargon, they want a software developer and not a software engineer and you're in the wrong place or are being interviewed for the wrong role. * Go to TopCoder, start with minimum point questions and move to the harder ones. Be hands on! * CLR (Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al). You do not need anything except this book, really! If you understand the fundamentals of every chapter in CLR, interviewing will be a breeze. * Did I say be hands on?
