Why are Illinois politicians so unusually corrupt?
Some thoughts:   The political machines which ran American cities are still in place to a degree in NE Illinois, and especially the Chicagoland area. By controlling local politics, those machines bred (and breed) corruption and they both insulate and isolate their members from reality. Chicago is essentially an island away from the rest of the US. Because of this isolation, many things occur here which couldn't and wouldn't be accepted in NE-DC corridor. The local populace benefited (to a small extent) from the corruption. Whether it was getting your child a job, having your street cleared of snow or getting a little extra police presence, the ability to have "clout" with someone in Chicago was (and in some areas still IS) a highly prized possession. This is something which often poorly understood by people in other areas of the nation. Chicago was always "soft" on organized criminal activity. That led to the criminals bribing city officials, who in turn, began to expect bribes and inducements to simply do their jobs. Crime in Chicago assist in maintaining the status quo as far as corruption. Relatively low pay for civil service work - People hate to admit this, but they no qualms in heaping as much work on civil servants (or more) than people with considerably less responsibility in the private sector. They also want to do this for compensation amounts far lower than the private sector would offer. Since your best & brightest are going to avoid civil service for this reason (among others) Chicago and many areas around it have to either satisfy themselves with "lesser lights (which attracts corruption). Or they will have to consider that the few world-beaters who take civil service jobs may view the job as a means to enrich themselves at the public's expense. Updated 29w ago • View Upvotes
