What are the advantages of Erlang over other programming languages?
I'm just getting into Erlang. While I am slightly put off by the syntax (I might look at LFE later), I am mostly comfortable with single value assignment (excellent recursion/tail recursion support easily compensates for lack of mutable variables; if mutable state is needed, there are process dictionaries and NIFs). While others did a great job of mentioning distributed features, hot code swapping, concurrency model et al., I'd like to mention the platform. Erlang has an excellent platform that rivals and in some cases, exceeds, the JVM. The BEAM VM is excellent. Since processes have a per-process heap, garbage collection pauses are greatly reduced compared to HotSpot. The library contains support for operational functionality like exposing SNMP traps and gauges. A well tested garbage collector (acceptable "soft real time" performance) and the operational features make Erlang an excellent platform for long running services (as opposed to short running services, such as web application request handlers running as pre-spawned processes with mod_php/mod_perl/mod_python under Apache).
