What are some of the witty remarks made by the commentators during a cricket match?
During the India vs Australia warm up match before the world cup, when Gavaskar and Shane Warne were discussing about the dooshra Gavaskar: Saqlain Mustaq started calling his "second one" the dooshra. From then on, the pakistani close in fielders had started shouting in Hindi "Ball pandhra daldhiya" (meaning bowl Ball no 14th, 15 th ...) and thereby making an impression that Saqlain has a huge number of mystery balls  and making batsmen unnecessarily fear about the balls that doesn't even exist. Warne: Well, it didn't work on me even once....... I never understood what they said. Video for the piece of commentary.

Seems the star sports editorial team also picked this as something worthwhile to highlight. Updated 51w ago • View Upvotes
