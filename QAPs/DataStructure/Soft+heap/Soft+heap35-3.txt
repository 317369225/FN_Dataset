Alternate Histories (Hypothetical Historical Scenarios): What would happen if the US became truly imperialistic?
The US is truly imperialistic, although not in the 19th-century-territory-conquering model.   Our corporations extort resources all over the world, often by, e.g., driving the local currency down, wrecking the economy, then calling in the largely American controlled IMF and World Bank to force the now-debtor country to privatize its public service (like water supply) allowing corporations to swoop in, buy these assets at distress-sale precises, and then run up the cash register.   For a wonderfully readable, economic treatise on this, see American Imperialism: The New World Order and its Systematic Ideology of War.
