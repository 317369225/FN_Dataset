What are some cool words used in your language, with their meaning?
जुगाड़ (jugaad) :D Pictures definitely say more than words and it is quite true if you want to understand what jugaad is. Refer to Aditya Dixit's answer to JUGAAD: What are the best examples of India's Jugaad, used to solve everyday problems? To put it simply, "jugaad" is equivalent of "hack". The term is used collquially in Hindi language. Jugaad is something we are quite good at naturally and a form of innovation encouraged since our childhood since every household needs it. You'll know what I mean if you have read Aditya's answer. I love using this term, even during informal talks at my office and am definitely gonna use it in comments next time I do some "jugaad" in my code. ;)
