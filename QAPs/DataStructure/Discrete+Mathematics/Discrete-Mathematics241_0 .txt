For any string w = w1w2   wn, the reverse of w, written wR, is the string w in reverse order, wn   w2w1. If language A is regular, is AR?For any language A, let AR ={wR| w E A}. Show that if A is regular, so is AR.Yes, if a language is regular, then the language containing the reverse of every string is also regular. Suppose that you have a DFA that accepts a language A. How might you construct an NFA that accepts the reverse of A? Hint: Think about what happens when you flip the direction for every transition. 359 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
