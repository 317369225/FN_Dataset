What is discrete mathematics and why is it so important for computer science?I am only a highschool student so excuse my ignorance. I see discrete mathematics almost in all Computer Science programs, so what is it exactly? And why is it specifically so important for Computer Science?Originally Answered: What is the role of discrete mathematics in computer science? The fields of computer science corresponding to their respective fields of discrete math depend on, of course, what areas of discrete math you're looking at. We can break up discrete math into several subfields, and look at the consequential CS topics: Logic Logic is used heavily in computer architecture design (logic gates). Logical deduction is used everywhere, from AI (All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal), to control theory, and everywhere else where inferences must be made. Graph theory The first CS-related thing that comes to mind for me is social networks, e.g. Twitter, Facebook. A large part of graph theory is looking at connections between nodes. Ever use Facebook's "suggested friends" tool? This is based on graph theory. The number of mutual friends between you and someone else is the number of nodes (people) that have edges connected to both of you (friends with both of you). 457 Views  View Upvotes
