How can we prove the implication rule of logic?If P implies q, why is it logically equivalent to “not p or q”? It makes no sense to me at all.Let’s give an example: P  P = “It is raining.” Q  Q = “It is cloudy.” P→Q  P→Q would thus be “If it is raining, then it is cloudy.” Now, clearly, right now, it is either not raining or it is raining. (¬P∨P  ¬P∨P is true.) In the second case, the statement P→Q  P→Q allows us to infer Q  Q . Thus, either it is not raining (¬P  ¬P ) or it is cloudy (Q  Q ), and this can be written as ¬P∨Q  ¬P∨Q . This illustrates why P→Q  P→Q and ¬P∨Q  ¬P∨Q are equivalent. 352 Views · View Upvotes
