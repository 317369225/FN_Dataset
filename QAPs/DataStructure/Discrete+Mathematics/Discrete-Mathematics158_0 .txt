Can you prove the following assumption?Given a circle with diameter 3, there are number of smaller circles inside of it. The sum of the diameters of the smaller circles is equal to 25. Prove that for each line p of the circle's plane, there is a line q parallel to p such that q passes trough at least 9 of the smaller circles.This is not rigorous, but could be transformed into a rigorous proof by someone who cares. There must be at least 9 circles, because the circumferences of 8 circles each one epsilon smaller than the main circle would still total less than 25. You can visually see, and trivially prove with geometry, that if there are only 9 circles, they are so big that they must overlap (even if it is eight larges and one fairly small). Now try replacing any circle with two smaller circles having the same total circumference. Because their diameters add up to the original diameter of their parent, the two smaller circles must either 1) stay within the parent circle's area, but overlap each other, increasing the total number of circles a line passes through at the point of their intersection, compared to when it was just a parent; or 2) one leaves the parent area, increasing the total number of circles by a line that was outside of the parent circle. You could use induction to show that subdividing circles strictly increases the number of circles on the best line parallel to a given line, and that without subdivision there are 9, and so there must be 9 circles on at least one line. 191 Views
