Which is relevant to data science: continuous mathematics or discrete mathematics?Both. It's not a choice or a preference. I think both continuous and discrete math is equally necessary. Discrete math is necessary because of the computer science factor in data science. Not only that, many of the core mathematics and statistical methods that data scientists deal with are based on discrete math. Also, continuous math is necessary to understand statistical / probability distribution. No one can learn the statistics and probability without continuous mathematics like integrals, differential equations etc. 228 Views  View Upvotes
