How do you identify hypotheses and conclusions in conditional statements?Most conditional statements are written "if a, then b." For instance, "if it is raining, then the pavement is wet." In this case, "it is raining" (not "if it is raining") is the hypothesis. "The pavement is wet" (not "then the pavement is wet") is the conclusion. Basically, the point is, if a is true, then b is true. Another equally valid way to say it is "b if a." For instance, "the pavement is wet if it is raining." Again, if a is satisfied, then b is satisfied. This can be written symbolically as a→b  a→b and can be read as a implies b. It's important not to mix these up.  If I said, "if the pavement is wet, then it is raining," that would be incorrect. For instance, somebody could've missed while watering their garden. In short, you know that if the hypothesis is true, then the conlusion must be true. If you still are confused, then try drawing an Euler diagram. You can mix this up only in if and only if (written "iff") statements. For instance, "a point is the midpoint of a line segment iff it divides the segment into two equal parts." In this one you can say, "if a point is the midpoint of a line segment, then it divides the segment into two equal parts," as well as, "if it divides a segment into two equal parts, then the point is the midpoint of a line segment." Both are equally valid, because not only does a imply b here, but b implies a. In iff statements there really isn't a hypothesis or conclusion, so you don't need to worry about that. 166 Views
