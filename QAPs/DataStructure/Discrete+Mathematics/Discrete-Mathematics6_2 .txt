How can we prove the implication rule of logic?If P implies q, why is it logically equivalent to “not p or q”? It makes no sense to me at all.You cannot prove this. It is a matter of deciding what you want “p implies q” to mean. And, conventionally, we decide that “p implies q” means (not p) or q. That is p q “p implies q” TT ……..T TF ………F FT ………T FF ………T Why is this? Because intuitively, the only combination of T/F values that really make a conditional statement “p implies q” false is when the premise p is true and the conclusion q is false. If this is not the case, then the statement is true. So “p implies q” is false is the same as ((p and (not q)). And, “p implies q” is true is the same not ((p and (not q)) = (not p) or q 157 Views · Answer requested by Charles Alexander
