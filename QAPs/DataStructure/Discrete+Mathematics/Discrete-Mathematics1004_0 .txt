What is the intuitive explanation for p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r)  p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r) ?There are two things to show: the left side implies the right side, and the right side implies the left side. Suppose that you know the left side of the equivalence, p∨q→r  p∨q→r . How can you conclude the right side, (p→r)∧(q→r)  (p→r)∧(q→r) ? Suppose p  p , then all the more so p∨q  p∨q , and since p∨q→r  p∨q→r , then r  r . Therefore p→r  p→r . Now suppose q  q , then all the more so p∨q  p∨q , and since p∨q→r  p∨q→r , then r  r . Therefore q→r  q→r . Thus, both p→r  p→r and q→r  q→r , that is, (p→r)∧(q→r)  (p→r)∧(q→r) . Next, suppose that you know the right side of the equivalence, (p→r)∧(q→r)  (p→r)∧(q→r) . How can you conclude the left side, p∨q→r  p∨q→r ? Note that since (p→r)∧(q→r)  (p→r)∧(q→r) , therefore both (p→r)  (p→r) and (q→r)  (q→r) Suppose p∨q  p∨q . That happens in one of two cases, p  p or q  q . In the first case p  p , since (p→r)  (p→r) , therefore r  r . In the second case q  q , since (q→r)  (q→r) , therefore r  r . Since in either case, r  r , therefore p∨q→r  p∨q→r . 1.1k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Raj Kumar
