Can you prove that k k divides (knn) (knn) with n,k>0 n,k>0 ?It is quite simple really, there is a binomial identity which is easily shown** (ab)=ab (a−1b−1)  (ab)=ab(a−1b−1) Use this for a=nk  a=nk and b=n  b=n (nkn)=nkn (nk−1n−1)  (nkn)=nkn(nk−1n−1) =k(kn−1n−1)■  =k(kn−1n−1)◼ which is divisible by k  k for n,k>0  n,k>0 . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ **We can see that we may choose a team of b  b people from a  a people and then a leader from the b  b team members in (ab)b  (ab)b ways, alternatively choose a leader from a  a people and b−1  b−1 remaining team members from a−1  a−1 people in a(a−1b−1)  a(a−1b−1) ways. Hence (ab)b=a(a−1b−1)  (ab)b=a(a−1b−1) . You can also use the binomial formula to show this (ab)=a!b!(a−b)! =ab (a−1)!(b−1)!(a−b)! =ab (a−1b−1)  (ab)=a!b!(a−b)!=ab(a−1)!(b−1)!(a−b)!=ab(a−1b−1) but it is less fun. 74 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Jared León
