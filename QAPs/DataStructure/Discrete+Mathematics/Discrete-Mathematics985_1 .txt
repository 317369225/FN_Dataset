How can I draw a complete graph of six vertices with the least amount of crossings and how do I prove it is the least?You can do it with three crossings as follows. 1  3 4 5 6 2 Connect 1 and 2 with straight lines to each other and to each of 3,4,5,6. Connect 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 via a straight 3-path. It remains to link {3,5}, {3,6}, {4,6}. {3,5}: Connect 3 to 5 via an arc, going upwards around vertex 4, crossing the edge {1,4}. {4,6}: Connect 4 to 6 via an arc, going downwards around vertex 5, crossing the edge {2,5}. {3,6}: Connect 3 to 6 via a long arc that goes to the left out of vertex 3, across edge {1,2}, and bends clockwise up around vertex 1 and on rightwards to vertex 6. To verify that this is minimal, it would suffice to confirm the following: - If you draw K5 with only one crossing, then every face is incident to at most three vertices, meaning that placing a sixth vertex in one of the faces will necessitate two more crossings. (Can be shown using the fact that, up to homeomorphism, there is only one crossing-free embedding of K4 on the 2-sphere, and it's massively symmetric.) - If you draw K5 in such a way that all five vertices are incident to a common face (so that a sixth can be inserted and connected without creating more crossings), then it has at least three crossings. (Actually, is the pentagram, with its five crossings, minimal for this?) 109 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
