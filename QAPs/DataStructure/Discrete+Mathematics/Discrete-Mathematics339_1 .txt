What is combinatorics in discrete mathematics?Combinatorics is a fancy name for 'counting'. And it refers to counting that can be done using logic and mathematics. So counting the number of cars in a parking lot is not part of combinatorics. Here are some combinatorics questions that are useful and require not very difficult math: 1) How many 8-character passwords are that are allowed to have upper and lowercase letters, the digits from 0 to 9, and 5 special characters? 2) In a state lottery, a person picks 6 different numbers from 1 to 60, and the order they pick the numbers doesn't matter. What are the chances of picking the winning ticket? 3) Computers using the Internet must have an Internet address. In the current version, IPv4, an address has 32 bits. How many addresses is this? 4) In the newer version, IPv6, Internet addresses have 128 bits. How many addresses is this? 5) A deck of cards has 52 different cards. If you shuffle the deck you'll get one arrangement. How many possible arrangements are there? By the way, the answer to the last question is 52! which is about 81067 81067 , which is about 80,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion. If someone randomly shuffles a deck, the chances are overwhelming that no one else will ever randomly shuffle a deck and get the same arrangement. As a matter of fact if every star in the known universe had a planet around it with 10 billion 'people' all shuffling a deck of cards once every second since the universe began some 13.8 billion years ago, the chances are still overwhelmingly against two people getting the same arrangement. Combinatorics can lead to some non-intuitive results. 121 Views  View Upvotes
