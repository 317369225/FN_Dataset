What is the meaning of diagraphs in graph theory?Thank you for asking the question. Digraph A digraph (or a directed graph) is a graph in which the edges are directed. (Formally: a digraph is a (usually finite) set of vertices V and set of ordered pairs (a,b) (where a, b are in V) called edges. The vertex a is the initial vertex of the edge and b the terminal vertex. Degree sequence The degree sequence of a directed graph is the list of its indegree and outdegree pairs; for the above example we have degree sequence ((2, 0), (2, 2), (0, 2), (1, 1)). The degree sequence is a directed graph invariant so isomorphic directed graphs have the same degree sequence. However, the degree sequence does not, in general, uniquely identify a directed graph; in some cases, non-isomorphic digraphs have the same degree sequence. The directed graph realization problem is the problem of finding a directed graph with the degree sequence a given sequence of positive integer pairs. (Trailing pairs of zeros may be ignored since they are trivially realized by adding an appropriate number of isolated vertices to the directed graph.) A sequence which is the degree sequence of some directed graph, i.e. for which the directed graph realization problem has a solution, is called a directed graphic or directed graphical sequence. Hope this answers your question! 290 Views
