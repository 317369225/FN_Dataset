On a 2-d grid, how many 2n  2n -move paths can be made that begin and end at (0,0)  (0,0) and also pass through (k,n−k)  (k,n−k) ?Constraint: 0≤k≤n  0≤k≤n .Assuming we can only move parallel to the x and y axes, at each point we have the options of either moving ±1 in the x direction, or ±1 in the y direction. Notice how the "distance" we must travel using only these such steps from (0,0) to (k, n - k), or vice versa, is k + n - k = n. This is because in our path, we must ultimately move up k spaces parallel to the y axis, and right n-k spaces parallel to the x axis. Now, we need exactly 2n of these such steps along our chosen path.  Therefore, we must travel along this exact route: - (0,0) -> (k, n - k) [n steps] - (k, n - k) -> (0,0) [n steps] for a total of n + n = 2n steps, as desired. Let's try to find the number of ways we can go from (0,0) to (k, n - k) in n steps. After some trial and error, it becomes clear that we can only move +1 in the y axis or +1 in the x axis, or else we'll run over our limit of n steps. Thus, we need k "+1 x steps", let's call each of these 'X', and n - k "+1 y steps", let's call each of these 'Y'. Our total path must therefore be a permutation of: X...XY...Y, a total of n characters consisting of k X's and n - k Y's. We know this to be n!k!(n−k)!   n!k!(n−k)! , otherwise known as (nk)  (nk) . By a similar argument, the number of n-step paths from (k, n - k) to (0,0) is also (nk)  (nk) . We thus have a total of (nk)  (nk) ways to get from point A to point B, and then another (n choose k) ways to get from point B back to point A, giving us an ultimate total of (nk)∗(nk)=(nk) 2   (nk)∗(nk)=(nk)2 paths. 138 Views · View Upvotes
