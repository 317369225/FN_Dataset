What is the intuitive explanation for p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r)  p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r) ?Many other answers here, while valid, seem unnecessarily high-tech. Isn't this the same as the set theoretical (p∪q)⊆r⇔(p⊆r) and (q⊆r)  (p∪q)⊆r⇔(p⊆r) and (q⊆r) ? The left side says there's nothing in p∪q  p∪q that's not in r  r ; the right side says there's nothing in p  p , or in q  q , that's not in r  r . 112 Views
