Why can't I express syllogism about Socrates using propositional logic?You can represent the syllogism propositionally in the manner you suggest. The problem is that your symbolization is not a theorem of propositional logic. It is merely a sentence of the form (p & q) -> r which happens to be true on the intended interpretation. Without the additional logical structure of the quantifiers, there is no way to present the syllogism as logically valid. 99 Views  View Upvotes
