Why can formulas without common variables be equivalent?Well, in intuitionistic and classical logics all tautologies are equivalent to one another as well as all contradictory formulas are equivalent to one another regardless of their atoms. This is due to the definition of an equivalence formula: it is true iff its both parts have the same value. In order to test whether a given formula is a tautology in a propositional logic you can build a truth table (you can do it, for example, here: Truth Table Generator). First order logic is semi-decidable, which means that you cannot prove that an arbitrary given formula is a falsifiable one. However, you can prove that your formula is a tautology via method of analytic tableaux. However, in relevance logic you cannot have a relevant equivalence between two formulas without common atom. 75 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
