What is line graph? What are the advantages?A line graph of a graph G=(V,E)  G=(V,E) is a graph G ′   G′ , whose vertex set V ′   V′ constitutes of all edges E  E of G  G , with two vertices v e 1    ve1 and v e 2    ve2 of G ′   G′ connected, if and only e 1   e1 and e 2   e2 are distinct in G  G and share a common vertex. In my research and studies I haven’t used line graphs in any way, but one straightforward application which comes to my mind is the following: If you are trying to find graph/graphs satisfying some properties, you can ask what does these properties means for a line graph of that graph/graphs. So instead of searching for graphs with your properties, you can search for their line graphs with transformed properties, and it might be easier to find them (and the you just transform line graphs back to original graphs). 173 Views
