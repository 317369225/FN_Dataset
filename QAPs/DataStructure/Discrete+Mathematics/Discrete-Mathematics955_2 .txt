Why can formulas without common variables be equivalent?How do you test logical equivalence for two formulas X and Y that contain the same set of atoms? By building a truth table for the atoms and verifying that X and Y always have the same value. Now do the same for X and Y using the union of their atoms. If X and Y always have the same value, they are still equivalent. In what cases would this occur? In situations where the value of Y did not actually depend on any atom absent in X, or vice versa. For example, X and Y could both be tautologies, always true for any value of their atoms. 65 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
