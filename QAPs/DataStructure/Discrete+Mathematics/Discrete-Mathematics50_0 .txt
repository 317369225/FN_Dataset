What is difference between continuous and discrete control system?I’m answering this in a subjective manner, which won’t help you to answer in exams, but surely help to break the ice and clear the concept. Continuous control systems are real, they can’t be realized with computers. Traditional pneumatic control systems are continuous control systems. Discrete Control Systems consider the process values in two ways- Discretized amplitude of signal and Discretized time scale. So basically, if you see it’s graph, it has steps on X (time) and Y (amplitude) both axes, whereas continuous signal will have smooth curve. Discrete cs are easier to implement with electronics and computer. They are slow, but realizable. Some C like programming can be used to sequence the actions. 87 Views · View Upvotes
