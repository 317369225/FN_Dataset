How can I create a phrase-structure grammar that generates only strings consisting of a 0 followed by an even number of 1s?Would any of these work? 1.) S -> 0A,  A -> 11A, A -> λ  λ 2.) S -> 1A,  A -> 1B, B -> 1 3.) S ->, 0A, A -> 1B, B -> 1A 4.) S -> 11A, A -> 00B, B -> 11A, B -> 11Number 1 above is the one that almost works. You'd have to change the last production to A -> epsilon where epsilon is the empty string. Otherwise, you'd never terminate. 47 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Chris Purrone
