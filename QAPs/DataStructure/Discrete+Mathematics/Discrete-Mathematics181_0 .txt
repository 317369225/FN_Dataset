How many numbers between 1 and 21million are divisible by 2,3, or 5 but not 7?(1 - (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)) * (1 - 1/7) * 21 million = 13.2 million. [We can do this clean calculation because 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all distinct primes, with 21 million divisible by all of them, so that divisibility by each can be thought of as probabilistically independent from the rest. ] 815 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
