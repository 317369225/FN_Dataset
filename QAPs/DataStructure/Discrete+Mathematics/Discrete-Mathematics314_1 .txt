In an infinite array of random integers can I find an infinite sequence of the same integer?Suppose you have, say an infinite sequence of bit-strings {0,1}^inf or an infinite array of random integers. You can clearly find any finite sequence of consecutive 1's and 0's but can you find also an infinite sequence of 1's (or 0's) or would that fall under Russell's paradox?I'll gloss over the fact that having an infinite sequence, S, of random positive integers is difficult to define and may not be possible to construct. Let's simplify this a bit by looking at real numbers between 0 and 1. So let's assume that such a sequence does exist. You are correct to say that we could find any finite sequence in S. Furthermore, this finite sequence would have to occur an infinite number of times. If it were a 3-digit sequence such as 538, it would occur an infinite number of times and as often as any other 3-digit sequence. But finding an infinite sequence with the same number repeated consecutively an infinite number of times is not going to happen. First, how would you know there were an infinite sequence of 5’s if the digits are random? And even if it did, the sequence would have to end in an infinite number of 5’s, so it wouldn’t be random. Even if you had a ‘normal’ number, in which every finite sequence of digits of length n occurs equally as often as any other finite sequence of length n, there would still be no sequences with an infinite number of 5’s, for example. 265 Views · View Upvotes
