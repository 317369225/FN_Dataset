How can I prove that there's no bipartite graph with δ(G)>n2   δ(G)>n2 ?Let G  G be a bipartite graph of order n  n . How can I prove that there's no G  G with δ(G)>n2   δ(G)>n2 ?A bipartite graph has two subsets, each of which has no internal edges.  Call their sizes m 1   m1 and m 2   m2 .  Assume WOLOG m 1 ≤m 2   m1≤m2 ; thus m 1 ≤n/2  m1≤n/2 .  So there are at least m_2 nodes with degree ≤n/2  ≤n/2 , and the minimum degree is certainly also ≤n/2  ≤n/2 . Note to the anonymous asker:  this question probably went unanswered for so long because it is too easy to be of any interest.  I only stumbled into answering it because I know nothing about graph theory, so I looked up the meaning of δ(G)  δ(G) , and then of course I knew the answer.  So it's disturbing that you felt it necessary to ask Quora.  Perhaps mathematics is not for you. 105 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
