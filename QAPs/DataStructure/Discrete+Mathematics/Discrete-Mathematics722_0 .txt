Can calculus be proven from axioms in discrete mathematics?It really depends on what you mean with “prove” and “axioms in discrete mathematics” and also “calculus” (I’ve seen discrete calculus in some books but you might be talking about differential and integral calculus). But assume there that discrete mathematics has combinatorics in it, then there is Infinitary combinatorics in which according to the article, has given us “ recent developments on the combinatorics of the continuum”. I’ve tried to read Halbeisen’s: Combinatorial Set Theory in the past. But I found it so hard that I could barely understand the color of the cover, it seems that they can build the natural numbers but it also seems that It is the typical ZFC axioms + Several combinatorial techniques and results so I’m not sure if that would count as “axioms in discrete mathematics”. 134 Views
