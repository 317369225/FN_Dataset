What are unlabeled graphs in discrete mathematics?May I define them as classes of isomorphism of graphs?Unlabeled graphs g∈UG  g∈UG are any universal invariant for the category of labeled graphs. This could indeed be the set of all isomorphism classes of graphs, but more commonly UG  UG is taken to be a set of unique representatives, with one from each of these classes. For example, the following is a set of non-isomorphic representatives of all unlabeled connected graphs on four vertices. 13,24,35,45 14,25,35,45 15,25,35,45 12,13,24,35,45 12,25,34,35,45 14,25,34,35,45 15,23,24,35,45 15,25,34,35,45 12,14,25,34,35,45 12,15,25,34,35,45 13,14,23,24,35,45 13,24,25,34,35,45 15,24,25,34,35,45 12,13,24,25,34,35,45 13,15,24,25,34,35,45 14,15,24,25,34,35,45 15,23,24,25,34,35,45 12,13,15,24,25,34,35,45 14,15,23,24,25,34,35,45 13,14,15,23,24,25,34,35,45 12,13,14,15,23,24,25,34,35,45 Notice that this is only a set of sets of sets [edges are two-element sets of vertices], which is considerably more manageable than isomorphism classes, which would be a set of sets of sets of sets. In practice, it is often ideal to represent unlabeled graphs as visually distinct diagrams. You don’t necessarily need to label the vertices at all here, but doing so suggests that these are normal simple graphs, rather than the unlabeled simple graphs they represent. 261 Views
