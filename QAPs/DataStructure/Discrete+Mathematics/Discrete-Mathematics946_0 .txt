How can I define bijection between (0,1) and (0,1]?There are lots of them, but none of them will be continuous. The  the interval (0,1)  (0,1) is the disjoint union of the intervals       (0,12 ],(12 ,23 ],(23 ,34 ],…  (0,12],(12,23],(23,34],… while the interval (0,1]  (0,1] is the disjoint union of the intervals       (12 ,1],(13 ,12 ],(14 ,13 ],…  (12,1],(13,12],(14,13],… Just match them up in the order listed. The corresponding intervals have the same length, so translations will do. 2.7k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Angelina Atamaniuk
