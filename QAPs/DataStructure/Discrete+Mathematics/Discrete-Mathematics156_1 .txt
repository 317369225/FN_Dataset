What equivalence relations can be created from {0, 1, 2, 3} ?Is (0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3) (0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3) the only one?A Relation 'R' on a set 'A' is said to be equivalence relation on 'A' if 'R' is 1)Reflexive relation 2)Symmetric relation 3)Transitive relation Now Considering A={0,1,2,3} {0,1,2,3} Is (0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3) (0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3) the only one? No , in fact it is not equivalence relation since it is not reflexive. The smallest equivalence relation that can be formed is{(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)}. {(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)}. The largest equivalence relation isAA. AA. The number of equivalence relation can be found using Bell number  , for n=4 B4=15. B4=15. 74 Views
