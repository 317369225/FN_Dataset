What are some good examples and analogies for discrete mathematics?As a CS undergrad, I have to take this class (and am looking forward to it). Thanks in advance.First of all, let’s talk about what ‘discrete’ mathematics means. Let’s look at a mathematical formulae or proof as a description of a process. Now, this process can go on all the time, or just a part of the time. The first type of process is what we call a continuous process, and the second type is a discrete one. Practically, this means that discrete mathematics is any kind of mathematics which deals with solely the integers! There’s none of that real-number, complex-number stuff going on in here. However, it also means that it’s an extremely broad subject. A good course in discrete mathematics will start with explaining what mathematics really and truly is, and that is a method of proving the truthfulness of statements. Think of an intersection between lawmanship and philosophy - but with no possibility of ambiguities. Once you’ve managed this, then you’ll dive into the building blocks of mathematics: processes themselves (functions) and the data that processes involve (sets). Since by now you understand what a process is and what it works on, the next step is to take a look at some! I hope you enjoy gambling, because you should be doing some in class. You’ll look at how a single set of data can yield multiple subsets, which is known as combinatorics. You’ll play around with card shuffles, coin tosses and dice rolls, and by the time you finish it, you’ll be a master at gaming. There’s plenty more to learn, and I don’t know where your course will head. But, I do encourage you to crack open a book and take a look yourself! If you do not speak Russian (which is the language of mathematics), then take a look at Rosen’s Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications. Best of luck and do feel free to ask any further questions! 207 Views · View Upvotes
