Why is Rubik's cube considered to be the best illustration of Group Theory?I don’t know that it is. If you are trying to describe what a group is to a layperson, a Rubik’s cube is probably a good choice, because many people are familiar with it. It also gives an immediate, tangible connection to the real world, which can sometimes help get people interested. However, I think the first example that a student of group theory should probably see is something like the symmetry group of the square. It is small enough that you write down every element and see what is going on explicitly; it is also large enough to be non-trivial. 548 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Bayan Kh
