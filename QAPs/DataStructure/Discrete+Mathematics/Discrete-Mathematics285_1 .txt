Permutations and Combinations: How many ways can 10 men and 7 women sit at a round table so that no 2 women are next to each other?Here's a way to approach this, assuming there are 17 chairs. 1) First, compute how many ways 7 chairs can be chosen so that no two chairs are adjacent. 2) Then 7 compute how many ways the 7 women can be seated in those chairs. 3) That leaves 10 chairs left for the men. So compute how many ways the 10 men can be seated in those chairs. The first part is the hardest. I'll solve the first part assuming that they are seated in a row, since I don't know if the chairs are numbered or not. You can them take this answer and modify it for being around a table. I've used this recurrence relation to solve the first part. Let w = number of women, and c = number of chairs. Let S( w, c ) = the number of ways w women can sit in c chairs with no women together. Then S( w, c ) = c if w = 1  S( w, c ) = 0 if c = 0  S( w, c ) = 0 if c <= w <= 2  S( w, c ) = S( w-1, c-2 ) + S( w, c-1 ) Solving this isn't trivial but you can write a program to iterate through it. The way to think of the recursive line is this: if you want to seat w women in c chairs with n women next to each other, then either the first chair has a woman or a man. If the first chair has a woman, the next chair must have a man, and there are w-1 women left to seat with c-2 chairs to seat them. If the first chair has a man, then there are w women left to seat with c-1 chairs to seat them. Computing S( 7, 17 ) = 330. Now you just need to figure out how this would change if they were around a table. 280 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Abubakar Ahmad Abdullahi
