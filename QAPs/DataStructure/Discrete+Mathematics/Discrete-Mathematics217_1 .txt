Can you solve the equation x 2 −1=2(y+z)+y 2 −12z   x2−1=2(y+z)+y2−12z over the positive integers?The given equation is x^2-1=2(y+z)+(y^2-1)/2z Expanding the equation we get 2z (x^2-1)=4yz+4z^2+y^2-1 2x^2z-2z=4yz+4z^2+y^2-1 Rearranging all z terms to one side we get 2x^2z-2z-4yz-4z^2=y^2-1 Taking 2z common on left hand side 2z (x^2-2y-2z)=y^2-1 Now given the conditions that all x,y,z are positive integers consider y=1 Then right hand side becomes 0 Therefore 2z (x^2-2y-2z)=0 As already assumed y=1 The equation becomes 2z (x^2-2z-2)=0 Z cannot be 0 because of the condition that we should consider all positive integers Hence X^2-2z-2=0 x^2=2+2z So z takes all the values of 1,7,17,31,49,.......... And x takes the values of 2,4,6,8,......... for the respective values of z And y=1 Now let us assume y is not equal to 1 Then Z (x^2-2y-z) =(y^2-1)/2 Given that x,y,z are all positive integers clearly the left hand side gives an integer but (y^2-1)/2 to be integer y should be even number If y is even integer Then x cannot be integer for any integer value of z 103 Views
