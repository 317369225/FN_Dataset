What's the difference between concrete and discrete mathematics?As far as I can tell, "concrete mathematics" is not a recognized sub-discipline of mathematics, but rather the title of a book. I haven't read this book, but according to the linked Wiki article, it is "a blend of CONtinuous and disCRETE mathematics." Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical objects that are, well, discrete. They do not vary smoothly; they take on distinct values and are usually countable. At the undergraduate level, a course in discrete math usually covers (the very basics of) topics such as sets, number theory, counting, probability, relations, and graphs. It also serves as preparation for higher math by giving an introduction to logic and proofs. 177 Views  View Upvotes
