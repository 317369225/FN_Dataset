What is a bijective function ℕ → ℚ?A one-to-one correspondence with no repeats. (p.s. please don't use really complex maths i don't have any advanced knowledge).A Bijective function is a function whichis injective and surjective. What is injective and surjective? Injective: A function f(x) is said to be injective if f(a) = f(b) => a = b, for all a and b belonging to domain of f(x). Meaning there is a one-to-one correspondence as you mentioned. It passes the horizontal line test. Surjective: A function f(x) is said to be surjective, if for every value y in the range there exists at least one x in the domain such that f(x) = y. Put in simpler words, every value in the range is ‘hit’ by at least one value in the domain. There can be elements in the domain which are not hitting on every range though. 97 Views
