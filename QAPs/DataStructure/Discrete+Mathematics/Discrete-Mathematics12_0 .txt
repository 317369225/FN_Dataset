What does cryptography have to do with graph theory?They are not closely connected, but there are occasional connections at approximately the same rate that you’d see connections between any two arbitrary fields of mathematics, like between algebraic geometry and statistics or between algebraic topology and robotics. More so, maybe, since cryptography is fundamentally discrete and graph theory is central to much of discrete mathematics. I could list some connections (e.g. you could look into Bent functions), but the main thing to note is that these connections aren’t really fundamental connections between the two subjects in the way that the connections between, say, algebraic geometry and number theory are. 156 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Ilan Jinich
