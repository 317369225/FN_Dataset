What is discrete mathematics and why is it so important for computer science?I am only a highschool student so excuse my ignorance. I see discrete mathematics almost in all Computer Science programs, so what is it exactly? And why is it specifically so important for Computer Science?Originally Answered: What is the role of discrete mathematics in computer science? Discrete Mathematics is very closely connected with Computer Science. Theoretical Computer Science, the foundation of our field is often considered a subfield of discrete mathematics. Computer Science is built upon logic, and numerous, if not most, areas of discrete maths utilized in the field. For example, Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Discrete Optimization, Number Theory, Mathematical Logic, Discrete Probability Theory, among many others are fundamental to Computer Science. I almost find it odd to separate the two. Discrete Maths are a branching point for Computer Science, so they serve as a fundamental backbone to understanding it. 374 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Ukkasha Salman
