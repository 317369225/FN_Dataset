Using precedence how these 2 operators make sense p∨q∧r => (p∨(q∧r))?There is no universally used precedence for AND and OR; even the symbols used vary from discipline to discipline and from author to author.  Check the book you're reading to see what's used there. You can expect the negation symbol to have highest precedence since it's a unary operation.  AND and OR usually have the same precedence, and when that's the case an expression like P∨Q∧R  P∨Q∧R would not appear since it's not well formed.  Implication and bi-implication also usually have the same precedence. There has been some push to make ∧  ∧ have a higher precedence than ∨  ∨ , but their duality suggests that they should be given the same precedence. 187 Views · View Upvotes
