Discrete math: What is temporary hypothesis discharged, and what is hypothesis by deduction method? (In Proofs of arguments with quantifiers)My discrete book does not explain those two well, I see them in the steps of some proofs but i don't fully understand them. An example of those two would be highly appreciated.In my experience, proofs of arguments with quantifiers are often poorly explained in books on logic. I will to explain how I prove universal generalizations. You start a premise of the form P(x)  P(x) where x  x is a free variable and newly introduced in this premise. There are two cases to consider. Direct proof: Suppose we are subsequently able to derive a statement of the form Q(x)  Q(x) where no free variables that were subsequently introduced after the above premise occur in Q(x)  Q(x) . Then we can conclude that ∀y:[P(y)⟹Q(y)]  ∀y:[P(y)⟹Q(y)] where the variable y  y does not occur in either P(x)  P(x) or Q(x)  Q(x) . Proof by contradiction: Suppose we are subsequently able to derive a statement of the form Q∧¬Q  Q∧¬Q (a contradiction). Then the original premise must be false, and we can conclude that ¬∃(y):P(y)  ¬∃(y):P(y) where the variable y  y does not occur in P(x)  P(x) . The above methods of proof are easily generalized for multiple variables and sub-proofs within proofs. (Not sure what you mean by the "hypothesis by deduction method.") 120 Views · View Upvotes
