How can I prove that there's no bipartite graph with δ(G)>n2   δ(G)>n2 ?Let G  G be a bipartite graph of order n  n . How can I prove that there's no G  G with δ(G)>n2   δ(G)>n2 ?δ(G)  δ(G) is the minimum degree of any node in the graph G, correct? The degree sum formula for a bipartite graph (with U and V as the two parts) is ∑ u∈U deg(u)=∑ v∈V deg(v)=|E|  ∑u∈Udeg(u)=∑v∈Vdeg(v)=|E| If deg(x)>n/2  deg(x)>n/2 for all x  x in G, then |E|=∑ u∈U deg(u)>|U|(n/2)  |E|=∑u∈Udeg(u)>|U|(n/2) .  Similarly |E|>|V|(n/2)  |E|>|V|(n/2) .  So, 2|E|>(n/2)(|U|+|V|)=n 2 /2  2|E|>(n/2)(|U|+|V|)=n2/2 . But, the largest number of edges that a bipartite graph can have is |U||V|  |U||V| , i.e., every vertex in U connects to some edge in V.  That means |E|≤(n−|U|)|U|  |E|≤(n−|U|)|U| . Putting these together gives n 2 /2<2un−2u 2   n2/2<2un−2u2 , or 0<4un−4u 2 −n 2   0<4un−4u2−n2 .  But the right-hand side reaches its maximum value (parameterized by |U|=u  |U|=u ) at 4n−8u=0  4n−8u=0 , or u=n/2  u=n/2 .  At that point it is 4(n/2)n−4(n/2) 2 −n 2 =2n 2 −n 2 −n 2 =0  4(n/2)n−4(n/2)2−n2=2n2−n2−n2=0 .  Since the inequality is strict, it cannot be satisfied.  Thus no such graph exists. 537 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
