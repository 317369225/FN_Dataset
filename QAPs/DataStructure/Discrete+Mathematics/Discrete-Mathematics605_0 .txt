How can I create a phrase-structure grammar that generates only strings consisting of a 0 followed by an even number of 1s?Would any of these work? 1.) S -> 0A,  A -> 11A, A -> λ  λ 2.) S -> 1A,  A -> 1B, B -> 1 3.) S ->, 0A, A -> 1B, B -> 1A 4.) S -> 11A, A -> 00B, B -> 11A, B -> 11The third never terminates, so it won't work. The second and fourth do terminate. The second gives only S→1A→11B→111  S→1A→11B→111 , which is not at all what you want. The fourth gives S→11A  S→11A , and anything after that begins with two 1  1 's, and you can never get rid of them, so that won't work either. The first does work where λ  λ denotes the empty string. A  A will generate any even number of 1  1 's including no 1  1 's. Therefore S  S will generate any string starting with 0  0 followed by any even number of 1  1 's. 459 Views · View Upvotes
