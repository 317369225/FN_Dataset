How can we prove the implication rule of logic?If P implies q, why is it logically equivalent to “not p or q”? It makes no sense to me at all.It’s fairly simple with an indirect proof here is half of it: SHOW:(P→Q)→(∼P∨Q)  SHOW:(P→Q)→(∼P∨Q) ∼[(P→Q)→(∼P∨Q)]  ∼[(P→Q)→(∼P∨Q)] IP P→Q  P→Q (1) ∼(∼P∨Q)  ∼(∼P∨Q) (1) P∧∼Q  P∧∼Q (3) P  P (4) Q  Q (2, 5 MP) ∼Q  ∼Q (4) Q∧∼Q  Q∧∼Q (6, 7) DONE So this shows that (half of) the equivalence has to be the case (you can do the other half), but maybe this is not really an explanation. Let me try the “plain English” version. Let’s assume that P implies Q. The only ways that this can be true are if P and Q are both true or if P is false. So it must either be the case that Q is true or P is false. Similarly, let’s assume that either P is false or Q is true. Further, let’s assume P is true. Based on the first assumption, we have to conclude that Q is true. So P implies Q. The easiest way to see the equivalence is to draw the truth table for the expression and verify that the truth-conditions are the same for both sides of the equivalence, as some other answers have discussed. 79 Views
