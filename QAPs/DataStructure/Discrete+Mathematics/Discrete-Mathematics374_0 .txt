How do I show that for any (a,b)∈Z  (a,b)∈Z we have E(a+b2 )+E(a−b+12 )=a  E⁡(a+b2)+E⁡(a−b+12)=a such that E(x)  E⁡(x) is the integer part of x?  x?Hi ! Did you think about what is truly critical in this problem ? What makes the identity non-trivial ? Obviously the flooring function E will give results that can not be expressed as a polynomial expression making only a and b intervene, the subtlety is that since the a and b are elements of Z, then applying the function E to the two expressions above will either return the expression, or the expression minus 1/2. One obviously sees that a discussion on the parity of a and b would prove the expression. Thus, one may be tempted to laboriously write a=2n+c and b=2m+d where c and d are each either 0 or 1, and then check the identity, either computing each of the 4 cases, or using a symbolic approach essentially doing them simultaneously. However, this requires some useless calculation (here not much) and such a method would not be comfortably generalizable to more complicated similar problems (for instance with more variables, more E functions, and E functions inside other E functions etc...), and in which even more calculation would be required. The key argument here is that we can easily see that the left member is not only completely determined by the parities of a and b, but is even completely determined by the parities of a+b and of a-b. Now since (a+b)-(a-b)=2a, which is even, a+b and a-b have the same parity. Thus, a+b and a+b-1 always have different parities, and exactly one of the two terms of the sum will yield itself after being applied on by E, and the other will lose 1/2. Hence always the result ((a+b)/2 + (a-b+1)/2) - 1/2 =a. Similarly you can now attempt to express E((a+b+c+1)/2)+E((a-b-c)/2)+E((c-a-b+1)/2)+E((b-c-a)/2) in a more concise form (and (SPOILER ALERT !!!! even as a perfect shape)). 313 Views
