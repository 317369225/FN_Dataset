Can someone help me solve this question? I can't understand the 3 different types of relations (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)A relation R is reflexive if for all x in the domain, R (x,x) is true. An example of a reflexive relation is equality: x = x for all x. Something like less-than is not reflexive because it's not true that x < x for all x (or for any x, in this case). R is symmetric if for all x, y in the domain, R (x, y) is equivalent to R (y, x). Equality, for example, is symmetric (x = y is the same as y = x), but less-than is not symmetric (x < y is different from y < x). R is transitive if for all x, y, and z in the domain, R (x, y) AND R (y, z) together imply R (x, z). For example, equality is once again transitive, and less-than is also transitive, because x < y and y < z implies x < z. The relation in your problem, which can be summed up as "these numbers differ by two" is not transitive because if x is 5, y is 7, and z is 9, x and z do not differ by two, even though the pairs x, y and y, z differ by two. The relation in your problem is not reflexive, since a number does not differ from itself by two. It is, however, symmetric. We say that R is an equivalence relation if it is all three of reflexive, transitive, and symmetric. It's called an "equivalence" relation because, as you may have noted, equality for numbers generally possesses these properties. 282 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
