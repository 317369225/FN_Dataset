How can you prove that for all real numbers x, if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational, using contradiction and contraposition?Let x be a real number. We want to prove by contradiction that if x 2   x2 is irrational, then x is irrational. Proof: Assume the negation of this statement: x 2   x2 is irrational and x is rational. (Keep in mind that the negation of an implication, P→Q  P→Q is P∧∼Q  P∧∼Q ). But if x is rational, then x can be written as x=bc   x=bc where b and c are integers. Then x 2 =b 2 c 2    x2=b2c2 which is also rational. This contradicts  the statement that x 2   x2 is irrational. 285 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
