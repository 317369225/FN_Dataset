What is the difference between discrete mathematics and logical mathematics?I notice the questioner responded to Professor Hyttel's answer with another question - which book to study, Knuth and Graham's "Concrete Mathematics", or Shoenfields's "Mathematical Logic"? It would help if you could clarify your goal. You seem to be generally interested in discrete math and logic. These are two different subjects (although discrete math courses typically contain some introduction to mathematical logic). "Concrete Mathematics" is a fantastic book, but it's not about what is normally taught as discrete math. The title is a deliberate pun on "discrete". CM is an in-depth discussion of technique and method - how to solve recurrence relations, finite differences, generating functions, and so on. 66 Views  View Upvotes
