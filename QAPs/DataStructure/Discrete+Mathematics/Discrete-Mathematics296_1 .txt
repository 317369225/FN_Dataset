What's the best way to think about f(g(f −1 (x)))  f(g(f−1(x))) ?In addition to Alon Amit's answer, there is a terminology in group theory which generalizes your composition functions, namely; g ′ (x)=f(g(f −1 (x)))  g′(x)=f(g(f−1(x))) This kind of composition is called as conjugacy. And g ′   g′ and g  g are called conjugate of each other if there exists a function f  f which satisfies the above equation. Conjugacy is a very important topic in group theory. It describes an equivalence relation and partitions the set of functions( or, generally, the elements) that we are working in. By using these conjugate classes, we can find the number of elements in the group (if the group is finite) if we know the number of elements in every one of the conjugate classes. This is called as the class equation, or specifically conjugacy class equation. Analyzing groups of prime order becomes somewhat simpler through knowing what conjugacy is. The second Sylow theorem uses conjugacy explicitly. It is just a very central idea of the group theory. General referances: Conjugacy class Sylow theorems 259 Views · View Upvotes
