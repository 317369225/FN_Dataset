If one element is taken from a countably infinite set, is it still infinite?Yes: the act removing (or adding) any finite number of objects from a countably infinite set results in a new set that is still countably infinite. (The same is true for infinite sets of any "size".) We typically demonstrate the cardinality of one set by showing its elements can be put into 1-1 correspondence with the elements of a second set of known cardinality. To demonstrate: since you start with a countable set the elements can be arranged first, second, third, .... Suppose the element that is removed is the first one. For my notation: ABN +  ={a 1 ,a 2 ,a 3 ,…}={a 2 ,a 3 ,a 4 ,…}={1,2,3,4,…} (Original set)(After a 1  was removed)  (Original set)A={a1,a2,a3,…}(After a1 was removed)B={a2,a3,a4,…}N+={1,2,3,4,…} Since we know A is countably infinite its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of N +   N+ . I can do it like this: a i ↔i  ai↔i . If it can be shown that B can be put into a 1-1 correspondence with A we'll be done. I can do that this way: a 2 ↕a 1 ↕1 a 3 a 4 ⋯a k ⋯↕↕⋯↕⋯a 2 a 3 ⋯a k−1 ⋯↕↕⋯↕⋯23⋯k−1⋯ (From B)(From A)  (From B)a2a3a4⋯ak⋯↕↕↕⋯↕⋯(From A)a1a2a3⋯ak−1⋯↕↕↕⋯↕⋯123⋯k−1⋯ (Apologies for the poor alignment; I didn't spend a lot of time on the Latex.) 148 Views · View Upvotes
