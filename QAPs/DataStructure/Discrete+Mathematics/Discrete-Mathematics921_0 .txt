How can we explain by words that P→Q is equivalent to ¬P∨Q?Hans Hyttel provides a good description with words, and John Pye an example. Personally, I find descriptions and examples a little misleading when it comes to logic. They assume that the logic applies to your intuitions and reasoning. When learning logic, I find it is better to ignore semantic descriptions, and even avoid referring to the values as "true" and "false". Instead, think of them as abstract operations between any two arbitrary values. You can then use value tables to demonstrate that the formulae have identical values (note that the value listed below the connectives have the broadest scope here, applying to the formulae). p1100 q1010 p1100 →1011 q1010     pqp→q11111101000101100010    p1100 q1010 ¬0011 p1100 ∨1011 q1010     pq¬p∨q110111100100011011001010 118 Views · View Upvotes
