Is the function -(x)² surjective?I’m trying to prove that R and the interval (-infinity, 0] have the same cardinality. So I’m trying to show an injection/surjection from R to (-infinity, 0], or the other way around. All I can think of to start with is y = -(x)². This seems to map from R to (-infinity, 0]. So is it surjective?The function y=−(x) 2   y=−(x)2 has every element of its co-domain mapped to at least one element of the domain. So y is surjective. 50 Views
