What does cryptography have to do with graph theory?Actually, cryptography has nothing to do with graph theory. Cryptography deals with ways to encrypt a message or other data so that only the intended recipient can decrypt the message. Broadly speaking, graph theory deals with some sorts of entities (e.g. people) and relationships between them. For instance you could make a graph consisting of vertices that represent people in your city, and with an edge between two vertices if those two people know each others names. So they are not related at all, except for the fact that both ‘cryptography’ and ‘graph theory’ have the word ‘graph’ in them. ‘Graph’ comes from a root word meaning writing. ‘Cryptography’ means hidden writing, so that is a good term. ‘Graph Theory’ is not a good description of what it refers to. ‘Relation Theory’ might be a better term. 158 Views · View Upvotes
