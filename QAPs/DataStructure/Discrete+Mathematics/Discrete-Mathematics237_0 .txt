For an n n -digit binary number, what is the probability that the digits contain consecutive 1's?For example, for a 3 digit binary number, it has 8 possibilities, and 110,011,111 are the 3 scenarios when there is consecutive 1s.Let's see. How many single-digit numbers don't have two consecutive 1's? Two of them: 0 and 1. Two digits? Three: 00, 01, 10. Three digits? Five: 000, 001, 010, 100, 101. Four digits? Eight. 0000, 0001, 0010, 0100, 0101, 1000, 1001, 1010. Five digits? Thirteen. 00000, 00001, 00010, 00100, 00101, 01000, 01001, 01010, 10000, 10001, 10010, 10100, 10101. 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... Ring a bell? Yes! Fibo... Fibosomething! That thing with the rabbits? What was it? Right, Fibonacci! Every number is the sum of the two previous ones. So the next one would be 21. Is it? Are there 21 six-digit binary numbers without two consecutive 1's? I'll save you the trouble. Yes, there are 21 such numbers. And yes, this pattern continues to hold. The number of n  n -digit sequences of bits without any 11 is non else than F n   Fn , the n  n th Fibonacci number. Why? Well consider, for instance, the list we just wrote for the five-digit numbers. There are 13 of them, of which 8 end in 0 and 5 end in 1. Huh. 8 and 5. You see, those that end in 0 are simply the 8 four-digit strings with a 0 attached in the end. And those that end with 1 must actually end in 01, since 11 is outlawed, and they are simply the five three-digit strings with a 01 attached. Generally, all n  n -digit strings with no 11 can be obtained by either attaching a 0 to an (n−1)  (n−1) -digit string with no 11, or attaching a 01 to an (n−2)  (n−2) -digit string with no 11. So the number of such strings satisfies the same rule as Fibonacci numbers, and happens to start off the same way, so these numbers can't help but actually be Fibonacci numbers. Now, we are looking for a probability: the likelihood that a random sequence of n  n bits will avoid having 11. Since there are 2 n   2n binary strings overall and F n   Fn of them avoid two consecutive 1's, the probability is simply p n =F n 2 n    pn=Fn2n . So this is your answer. You can write it down a bit more explicitly: You may know that F n ≈φ n 5  √    Fn≈φn5 where φ=1+5  √ 2   φ=1+52 is the golden ratio.  So p n ≈15  √  (φ2 ) n   pn≈15(φ2)n . This, by the way, tends to 0 very rapidly as n  n grows, which isn't too surprising: if you flip a coin a thousand times in a row, the chances that you won't ever get two heads in a row are really, really tiny. You can now determine just how tiny. 12k Views · View Upvotes
