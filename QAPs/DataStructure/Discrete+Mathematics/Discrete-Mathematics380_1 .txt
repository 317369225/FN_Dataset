What is the difference between discrete and continuous random variables?Discrete and Continuous Random Variables:   A variable is a quantity whose value changes.   A discrete variable is a variable whose value is obtained by counting.   Examples:     number of students present                                     number of red marbles in a jar                                     number of heads when flipping three coins                                     students’ grade level   A continuous variable is a variable whose value is obtained by measuring.   Examples:     height of students in class                         weight of students in class                         time it takes to get to school                         distance traveled between classes   A random variable is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.   ▪         A random variable is denoted with a capital letter ▪         The probability distribution of a random variable X tells what the possible values of X are and how probabilities are assigned to those values ▪         A random variable can be discrete or continuous 4k Views · View Upvotes
