Given the integer partitions of 5  5 which uses 1  1 as a part, what is the generating function of such partitions?So far i've listed the integer partitions of 5  5 which involves 1  1 as a part: 1+4,3+1+1,2+2+1,2+1+1+1,1+1+1+1+1  1+4,3+1+1,2+2+1,2+1+1+1,1+1+1+1+1 . Now, i'm interpreting the problem to be the same as finding the coefficient of x 5   x5 in the generating function (1+x+x 2 +x 3 +x 4 )(1+x+x 2 +x 3 )(1+x+x 2 )(1+x)  (1+x+x2+x3+x4)(1+x+x2+x3)(1+x+x2)(1+x) .  Since we can associate the powers of x ′ s  x′s as the partitions, but  1+1+1+1+1  1+1+1+1+1 isn't here.So, the generating function for partitions of 5  5 is (1+x+x 2 +x 3 +x 4 +x 5 )(1+x 2 +x 4 )(1+x 3 )(1+x 4 )(1+x 5 )  (1+x+x2+x3+x4+x5)(1+x2+x4)(1+x3)(1+x4)(1+x5) . This can be found on the Wikipedia page, and an explanation can be found there as well. So, if the exponent of x  x is more than 0  0 in the first term, then we have at least 1  1 1  1 in our partition. So, we have to subtract out the cases where this isn't the case, and the generating function for that is (1+x 2 +x 4 )(1+x 3 )(1+x 4 )(1+x 5 )  (1+x2+x4)(1+x3)(1+x4)(1+x5) , for the same reason that the above generating function works. Now, this is sort of nice! The number of partitions is the coefficient of x 5   x5 in (1+x+x 2 +x 3 +x 4 +x 5 )(1+x 2 +x 4 )(1+x 3 )(1+x 4 )(1+x 5 )−  (1+x+x2+x3+x4+x5)(1+x2+x4)(1+x3)(1+x4)(1+x5)− (1+x 2 +x 4 )(1+x 3 )(1+x 4 )(1+x 5 )=(x+x 2 +x 3 +x 4 +x 5 )(1+x 2 +x 4 )(1+x 3 )(1+x 4 )(1+x 5 )  (1+x2+x4)(1+x3)(1+x4)(1+x5)=(x+x2+x3+x4+x5)(1+x2+x4)(1+x3)(1+x4)(1+x5) , which is 5  5 . This checks out with the answer we obtained by listing them all. 352 Views · View Upvotes
