Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y)))  Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y))) equivalent?It is my understanding that the quantifiers can go all at the beginning since they apply to the whole statement, but the textbook keeps showing the latter version with the quantifier in the middle. I would like to know if my way is okay since that is how I understand it better.Edit: the sentences are not equivalent, it is easily observed by the bound of the conjunction. My previous answer about the placement of quantifiers inside vs in front of sentences remains true, although in this case irrelevant. 47 Views  View Upvotes
