What is discrete mathematics and why is it so important for computer science?I am only a highschool student so excuse my ignorance. I see discrete mathematics almost in all Computer Science programs, so what is it exactly? And why is it specifically so important for Computer Science?Originally Answered: What is discrete mathematics? Where is it useful? How is it relevant to IT?What Is Discrete Math? Has some good words to describe what discrete mathematics is. As the aforementioned link says, it's not really its own branch like, say, algebra or geometry. It's a (aptly enough) set of branches that have in common that they deal with discrete, rather than continuous, objects/structures. In case you didn't happen to know, discrete generally means countable, as in (analogically speaking) apples, as opposed to continuous, as in (from a macro perspective) water. Situations in which topics from discrete math help to find a solution include the following: How many eight-digit numbers are there that contain a five and a six? What's the smallest number of NAND gates you need to implement a logic circuit with the output response of a given truth table? Draw a 55 grid graph. How many edges does the nn grid graph have?These are just a few miscellaneous problems found among the many topics under the broad tent that is discrete mathematics. To answer your third question about relevancy to IT, I would think it could come in handy to be knowledgable about growth rates of functions (Big-O O analysis) if you were designing an algorithm to solve a problem. Or if you were developing some highly distributed network, maybe some topics from graph theory would help you figure out the shortest path a process on one node is from a process on another node. Hope that helps! 279 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Subalica Gohain Chetia
