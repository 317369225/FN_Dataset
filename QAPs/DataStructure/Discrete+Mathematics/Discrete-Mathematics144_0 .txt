What is the role of logical equivalence in discrete structures?Logical equivalence is a part of logic which is an important part of discrete mathematics. Let's start with an equivalence from number theory: For any integers x and y: x + y = y + x. You might recognize that as the commutative law of addition. The important aspect of this is that this equality is true for any values of x and y. So one can substitute either of these expressions for the other. Sometimes mathematicians say these types of equalities are 'identically equal'. Logical equivalences are very similar, except that instead of the variables representing numbers, they represent propositions - statements whose value is true or false. For instance, if P and Q represent propositions, then the following is a logical equivalence: P∨Q⟺Q∨P  P∨Q⟺Q∨P . In English, it says that P or Q is equivalent to Q or P. Not very controversial is it? Here's one called DeMorgan's Law: ¬(P∨Q)⟺(¬P∧¬Q)  ¬(P∨Q)⟺(¬P∧¬Q) . This is very useful when trying to simplify logical expressions with negations in them. There are an infinite number of these logical equivalences. Whenever you have a logical equivalence, you can always substitute one expression for the other, and that can be very useful. 145 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Sara Mughal
