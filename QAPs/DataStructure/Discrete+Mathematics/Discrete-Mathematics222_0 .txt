Are there any real life applications of nonlinear Diophantine equations?Well, balancing chemical equations can be thought of a finding solutions to Diophantine equations. Consider the very important chemical reaction that is used to heat homes as well as to generate electricity. It is the reaction of natural gas (methane) and oxygen that produces carbon dioxide and water. Using chemical formulas: CH 4 +O 2 →CO 2 +H 2 O  CH4+O2→CO2+H2O We want the coefficients in front of these so that they are balanced, that is, so that the number of each type of atom is the same on both sides of the equation. Let's put the variables W, X, Y, and Z out front: WCH 4 +XO 2 →YCO 2 +ZH 2 O  WCH4+XO2→YCO2+ZH2O In order to balance the hydrogens, Z must be twice W: 1) Z = 2W In order to balance the carbons: 2) W = Y In order to balance the oxygens, we must have that: 3) 2X = 2Y + Z Eliminating W from the first two equations gives: 4) Z = 2Y Plugging this into equation 3), we get: 5) 2X = 2Y + 2Y, or 6) 2X = 4Y, which gives: 7) X = 2Y We have 3 equations (to start with) in 4 unknowns, so there are an infinite number of solutions. Let's choose, 8) Y = 1 and see what happens. From 7) we then get: 9) X = 2 and then from 4) we get: 10) Z = 2 and then from 2) we get: 11) W = 1 So the balanced equation is: CH 4 +2O 2 →CO 2 +2H 2 O  CH4+2O2→CO2+2H2O And there you have the most difficult way to balance a simple equation that I have ever seen. Sorry about that. But this technique will actually work no matter how complicated the equation is, and you can use linear algebra programs to solve these equations, so that's cool. ------- Depending on the background of the students you can ask them to find four sets of integers that satisfy the Pythagorean formula: A 2 +B 2 =C 2   A2+B2=C2 ------- Here's a fun one historically. Students who can program can find a solution: 61x 2 +1=y 2   61x2+1=y2 Fermat couldn't solve this in the 1600s but Euler did less than 100 years later. The least positive integer values are x = 226153980, y = 1766319049. Go Euler! 466 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
