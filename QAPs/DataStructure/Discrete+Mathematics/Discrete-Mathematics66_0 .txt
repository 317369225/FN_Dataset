What are some less mainstream, new applications of graph theory?Cool fun question! Graph Theory is being used as a tool to decipher the DNA structure in genes, and protein structure. See n-Nucleotide circular codes in graph theory This is a development that has been going on for some time. See Structural resemblance between the families of bacterial signal-transduction proteins and of G proteins revealed by graph theoretical techniques for an early example. Below is a nice example of graph metrics like centrality and connectivity being used for analyzing viruses. See A Systems Biology Starter Kit for Arenaviruses 302 Views  View Upvotes
