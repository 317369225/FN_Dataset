What is the difference between an inclusive or and an exclusive or?In a regular OR, the result of the operation is true if either or both of the operands are true. In an exclusive OR, the result of the operation is true if exactly one of the operands is true. That is, they differ in that True OR True = True, but True XOR True = False. In the context of bitwise operations, it's just applying the above-described operations independently on each bit position, where 1 denotes true and 0 denotes false. 365 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Richard Shatz
