Can somebody give me a clear and detailed proof of Sperner's Theorem?Sperner's theorem follows immediately from the Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality. There are many proofs of this inequality, but here's one by Noga Alon which I like. Let F  F be a sperner family of subsets of 1,2,3,⋯,n  1,2,3,⋯,n Then ∑ f∈F  1(n|f|) ≤1  ∑f∈F1(n|f|)≤1 Proof. Let σ  σ   be a permutation chosen uniformly at random. Consider the family of sets B={{ϕ,σ(1),σ(2),σ(3),...,σ(i)}|i≤n}  B={{ϕ,σ(1),σ(2),σ(3),...,σ(i)}|i≤n} Let  X f   Xf be an indicator random variable such that X f =1  Xf=1 if f∈B  f∈B and 0  0 otherwise. The expected size of B∩F  B∩F is ∑ f∈F  E[X f ]  ∑f∈FE[Xf] by the linearity of expectation. For a fixed set  f∈F  f∈F , the probability that f∈B  f∈B is 1(n|f|)   1(n|f|) So the expected size of B∩F  B∩F is ∑ f∈F  1(n|f|)   ∑f∈F1(n|f|) Notice that |B∩F|≤1  |B∩F|≤1   (can you see why?) So ∑ f∈F  1(n|f|) ≤1  ∑f∈F1(n|f|)≤1 I wrote a few (more detailed) blog posts on this some time ago, perhaps you may be interested in reading them. :) 343 Views · View Upvotes
