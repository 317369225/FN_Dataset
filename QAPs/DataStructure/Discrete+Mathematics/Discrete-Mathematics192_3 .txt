How do i work out how many rows appear in a truth table for q ∨ p ∨ ¬s ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬t ∨ u?q ∨ p ∨ ¬s ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬t ∨ u I am a 16 year old learning discrete maths from rosen's book and i don't understand this question. The answer says 64, how does one work something like this out.Lets hope my answer helps you The number of rows is the number of different combinations of  values the variables of the expression q ∨ p ∨ ¬s ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬t ∨ u can get which is 2^6 (where 6 is the number of the variables).You need to know a bit of combinatorics to see this. 60 Views
