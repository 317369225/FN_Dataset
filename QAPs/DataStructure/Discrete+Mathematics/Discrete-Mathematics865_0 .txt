How do I prove that the difference of any two odd integers is even using discrete mathematics?Suppose b and c are odd. Then b and c can be written as b = 2j+1 and c = 2k + 1 for some integers j and k. So, b - c = (2j + 1) - ( 2k + 1 ) = 2j - 2k = 2( j - k ), so b - c is even. ------- If you wanted to use some Discrete Math, you could do it this way: If b and c are odd then this can be expressed as b mod 2 = 1 and c mod 2 = 1. Subtracting the left hand sides and the right hand sides, we get: (b mod 2) - (c mod 2) = 0 (b-c) mod 2 = 0 Thus, b-c is even. 189 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
