What mathematical objects can conveniently express both continuous and discrete probability distributions?There are two ways to describe both discrete and continuous distributions. One is very indirect. The simplest and most direct is the distribution function. For a univariate distribution it's just P(X <= x). In the case of a discrete distribution this is a step function. For a discrete distribution the probability mass function is the set of differences at the steps. For a continuous distribution the probability density, if it exists, is the derivative. But there are also distributions that are continuous but have no density, and mixtures of discrete and continuous distributions. The distribution function can be used for all types. The more convoluted description is the characteristic function. This is defined as the expected value of exp(itX). It is defined for every distribution and defines it uniquely. Although it is useful for theoretical purposes, it is not very intuitive. 185 Views  View Upvotes
