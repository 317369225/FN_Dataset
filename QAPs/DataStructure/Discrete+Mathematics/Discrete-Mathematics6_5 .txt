How can we prove the implication rule of logic?If P implies q, why is it logically equivalent to “not p or q”? It makes no sense to me at all.This is intended to be more of an intuitive answer. Think of it this way. P→Q  P→Q means that whenever P  P is true , then Q  Q must also be true. Now , Either P  P is false , in which case P→Q  P→Q is vacuously true. This contributes the “¬P  ¬P ” Or P  P is true. In this case , if Q  Q is true then P→Q  P→Q becomes true. this contributes the “Q  Q ”. Covering both cases , we have ¬P∨Q  ¬P∨Q . Since there are no other cases , this is equivalent to P→Q  P→Q . 66 Views
