Why Computer Programmers generally focus on Discrete Maths rather than Continuous Maths?The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, in particular combinatorics and graph theory. This means that in order to learn the fundamental algorithms used by computer programmers, students will need a solid background in these subjects. Indeed, at most universities, a undergraduate-level course in discrete mathematics is a required part of pursuing a computer science degree. On the other hand basic calculus is needed almost everywhere in Computer Science. Knowing basic analysis and number theory helps you in cryptography and similar subjects. 179 Views  View Upvotes
