Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y)))  Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y))) equivalent?It is my understanding that the quantifiers can go all at the beginning since they apply to the whole statement, but the textbook keeps showing the latter version with the quantifier in the middle. I would like to know if my way is okay since that is how I understand it better.They are not equivalent.  If they were logically equivalent then a given model would either model both sentences or model neither sentence.  But consider the model M  M that has a single element a  a such that M⊨¬S(a)∧¬F(a)  M⊨¬S(a)∧¬F(a) .  Then M  M models the first sentence, but does not model the second sentence.  In case you do not know what a model is, just observe that in the first sentence S, as a predicate, need never be true of anything.  But in the second sentence, something must satisfy S. 104 Views
