How do you graph (x+1) (x-2) /x(x-3) (x+2)?f(x) [x^2–x^2-x-2]/[(x)(x-3)(x+2)] =f(x)/g(x) since the degree of f(x) is power2 is less than that of g(x) is power 3 The partial fractions are relatively easy. f(x) = A/x + B/(x-3) +C/(x+2) do the required manipulation then x^2-x-2 = (A+B+C)x^2 +(-A+2B-3C)x +C(-6A) A+B+C =1 -A+2B-3C =-1 , , , -6A =-2 Solve and A=(1/3) , B = (-1/3) , C = (2/5) f(x) = [ 1/3x] - [ 1/3(x-3)] +[2/5(x+2)] Here you have a graph with 3 asymtopes Asymtope 1 , is at x=0 Asymtope 2 ,is at x =3 and Asymtope 3 is at x = -2 Draw the 3 asyp. and find that the curve(s) are contained within their bounds. 37 Views · Answer requested by Isabella-Marie Cullen
