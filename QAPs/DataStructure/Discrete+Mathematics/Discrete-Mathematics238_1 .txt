Why can't all real numbers between 1 and 0 be counted?Are all real numbers uncountable because, essentially, you can never get from 0 to 1 because all the decimal number combinations in between 0 and 1 are infinite? Trying to understand the Cantor Diagonalization Argument.From my understanding, the diagonal method works on the premise that even after you have made a list of all the decimals between 1 and 0, you can make a diagonal cut through the list, adding 1 to each digit (or changing 9's to 0's) and have a number that is different in every way from every other number. Infinity is weird stuff 38 Views  View Upvotes
