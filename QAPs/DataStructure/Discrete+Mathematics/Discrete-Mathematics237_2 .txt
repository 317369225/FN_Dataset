For an n n -digit binary number, what is the probability that the digits contain consecutive 1's?For example, for a 3 digit binary number, it has 8 possibilities, and 110,011,111 are the 3 scenarios when there is consecutive 1s.Originally Answered: For an n-digit binary number, what is the probability that the digits contain j consecutive 1's? The number of ways to choose a block of j consecutive digits is n−j+1  n−j+1 . The number of ways to assign a digit (0 or 1) to the remaining n−j  n−j digits is 2 n−j   2n−j .  Hence the answer, if we are allowing leading 0's, should be 2 n−j (n−j+1)  2n−j(n−j+1) . If we are not allowing leading 0's, then the leading digit has to be 1; delete it and apply the previous argument to the remaining n-1 digits to get the answer 2 n−1−j (n−j)  2n−1−j(n−j) . 205 Views · View Upvotes
