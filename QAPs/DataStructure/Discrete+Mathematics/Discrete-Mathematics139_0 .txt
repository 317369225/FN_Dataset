How do I prove the following: For all integers a, there exist an integer b so that 3 | a+b and 3 | 2a+b?It depends on what you mean: if 3 | a+b and 3 | 2a + b are separate statements, then the other answers work. If you want to find a b such that 3 | a + b and 3 | 2a + b at the same time, for the same a and b, then the statement is not true: just take a = 1, and prove that it is not possible for 3 | b+1 and 3 | b+2 at the same time. 21 Views  Answer requested by Alex Stone
