If a number whose only factors are 1 and itself is a prime, then what is the name of a number which has no integer roots?What patterns emerge when we mark off, from the list of natural numbers, all powers of 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, etc. (skipping numbers which were marked off)? Do these numbers have any names? What research has been done? What patterns are there?Contrary to how the primes work, most integers have no integer roots other than themselves. Think about it: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20...therefore, we tend to think about numbers that do have integer roots as unusual rather than the other way around. 85 Views  View Upvotes
