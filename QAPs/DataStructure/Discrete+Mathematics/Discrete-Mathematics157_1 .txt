What is the difference, in layman's terms, between a symmetric and antisymmetric relation?Let's start with the formal definition, and then get to a layman's explanation. A binary relation, R, over a set B is said to be symmetric if whenever (x,y)∈R→(y,x)∈R  (x,y)∈R→(y,x)∈R . In English, this says that if some element x in B is related to some element y in B, then y must be related to x. So it's rather clear how such a relation could be called symmetric. As an example, let B = { living people } and define R = { (x, y) such that x and y have the same biological parents }. For example, I, Tim, have two brothers, Chris and Mark. So the ordered pair (Tim, Mark) would be in the relation because we have the same Mommy and Daddy. But so would the reverse ordered pair, (Mark, Tim). So you can see that in this relation if any ordered pair is in it, the reverse must be in it. And that's all a symmetric relation means. A relation R over B is said to be antisymmetric if whenever (x, y) is in R then (y, x) is not in R (unless x=y). So antisymmetry is sort of, but not quite, the opposite of symmetry. Basically it means that if x is related to y then y is not related to x (unless x and y are the same). As an example, let B = { living people } and define R = { (x, y) such that x is older than y }. For example I am older than my brother Mark, so (Tim, Mark) is in this relation, but clearly my brother is not older than me, so (Mark, Tim) is not in this relation. So informally, in an antisymmetric relation, we have a 'one way but not the other' situation. 130 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Chris Purrone
