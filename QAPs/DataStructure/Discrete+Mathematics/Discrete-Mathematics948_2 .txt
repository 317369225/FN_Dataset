How can I express this in FOL?if Bob loves everyone that Mary loves, and Bob loves David, then Mary doesn’t love David. How can this be properly expressed? I have been trying it for quite a while. I appreciate the help.  ( FOL stands for First Order Logic).A2A Frankly speaking, other answers are quite correct, though, they lack some brackets needed for truly rigorous expression in FOL. Let L 2   L2 stand for «first object loves second one», m,b,d  m,b,d for Mary, Bob, David respectively, logical constants will be as follows: &,∨,⊃,neg  &,∨,⊃,neg . In that case formal expression will be thus: (((∀x(L 2 (m,x)⊃L 2 (b,x)))&L 2 (b,d))⊃(¬L(m,d)))  (((∀x(L2(m,x)⊃L2(b,x)))&L2(b,d))⊃(¬L(m,d))) 141 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
