Are vectors only discrete points, can they be continious?I am not sure what you mean. Are you asking about a vector space, or vector field? Let's assume you are asking about a vector space. For example, R2 R2 , is a two dimensional vector space, the scalars for real numbers and the vectors are tuples of two real numbers. Points in this space can be very close to each other, and I suspect this is what you mean by "continuous". In mathematics, we reserve the word "continuous" to describe functions, and we don't use that to describe vectors or a vector space. 200 Views  View Upvotes
