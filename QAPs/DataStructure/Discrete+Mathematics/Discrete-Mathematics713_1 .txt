When are two edges said to be adjacent (in graph theory)?My teacher is saying that if there are 2 edges then they will be adjacent if and only if there both vertices are common. while my opinion is that if there is atleast one common vertex then the both edges will be adjacent to each other. please give proofs with answer( links or screenshot of any book)Two edges are adjacent when they share a vertex. Ex. {x,y} and {y,z} are adjacent, when x,y,z are vertices of a graph. If they share both vertices, they are the same edge. 66 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
