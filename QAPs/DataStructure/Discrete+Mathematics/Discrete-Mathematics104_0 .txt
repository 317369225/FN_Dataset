Is the function -(x)² surjective?I’m trying to prove that R and the interval (-infinity, 0] have the same cardinality. So I’m trying to show an injection/surjection from R to (-infinity, 0], or the other way around. All I can think of to start with is y = -(x)². This seems to map from R to (-infinity, 0]. So is it surjective?Taking any arbitrary y=a  y=a where a∈(−∞,0]  a∈(−∞,0] We have −x 2 =a  −x2=a y=−x 2   y=−x2 is a polynomial function which is defined everywhere. Which means that every y  y value has a pre image in the function’s domain, making the function surjective 160 Views · View Upvotes
