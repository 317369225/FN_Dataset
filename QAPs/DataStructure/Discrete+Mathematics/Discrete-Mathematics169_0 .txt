What is the difference between contrapositive and negation of a mathematical statement?There is a big difference between the contrapositive and negation of a mathematical statement. In the case of negation of a statement the logic involved in it get completely reversed. And thus the conclusion also get reversed. While in the case of contrapositive of a statement the logic involved in it does get reversed . The only thing which changes is the way to express that logic . These can be clear by considering the example. Example : Consider a statement with two parts p: I will go out of the home . q: It will not be raining outside . So the combined statement becomes "I will go out of home if it will not be raining outside ." ( p ->q) ie (p implies q) Now will see the negation and contrapositive of the above statement . Negation : I will go out of home only when it will be raining outside .(p and ~q) Contrapositive : If it will be raining outside , I will stay at home . (~q->~p) I have attached the screenshot of one the relevant slide . You can also refer the following links for better understanding about Contrapositive and Implication.
