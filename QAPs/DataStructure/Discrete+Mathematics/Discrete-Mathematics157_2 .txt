What is the difference, in layman's terms, between a symmetric and antisymmetric relation?Here’s a way to think about symmetry and antisymmetry that some people find helpful. A relation R on a set A has a directed graph (or digraph) GR: the vertices of GR are the elements of A, and for any (a,b∈A) there is an edge in GR from a to b  b if and only if ⟨a,b⟩∈R⟨a,b⟩∈R  ⟨a,b⟩∈R . Think of the edges of GR as streets. The properties of symmetry, antisymmetry, and reflexivity have very simple interpretations in these terms: R is reflexive if and only if there is a loop at every vertex. (A loop is an edge from some vertex to itself.) R is symmetric if and only if every edge in GR is a two-way street or a loop. Equivalently, GR has no one-way streets between distinct vertices. R is antisymmetric if and only every edge of GR is either a one-way street or a loop. Equivalently, GR has no two-way streets between distinct vertices. 87 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Chris Purrone
