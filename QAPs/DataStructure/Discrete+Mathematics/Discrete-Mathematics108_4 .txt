What is a bijective function ℕ → ℚ?A one-to-one correspondence with no repeats. (p.s. please don't use really complex maths i don't have any advanced knowledge).There's a technique for generating all positive rationals without repeats in reduced form which works like this: Start with the list Q 0 =(01 ,10 )  Q0=(01,10) , one of which is not negative, and one of which is not a number, but we can ignore them. Generate list Q 1 =(01 ,11 ,10 )  Q1=(01,11,10) , where the new bold value in the middle is formed by adding the numerators of the neighboring values and the denominators of the neighboring values. Generate the list Q 2 =(01 ,12 ,11 ,21 ,10 )  Q2=(01,12,11,21,10) , where, again, the new, bold, values are formed by adding the numerators and denominators of the neighboring values. Similarly, you can generate Q 3 ,Q 4 ,…,Q n ,…  Q3,Q4,…,Qn,… . A few of those are: Q 3 =(01 ,13 ,12 ,23 ,11 ,32 ,21 ,31 ,10 )  Q3=(01,13,12,23,11,32,21,31,10) Q 4 =(01 ,14 ,13 ,25 ,12 ,35 23 ,34 ,11 ,43 ,32 ,53 ,21 ,52 ,31 ,41 ,10 )  Q4=(01,14,13,25,12,3523,34,11,43,32,53,21,52,31,41,10) Q 5 =(01 ,15 ,14 ,27 ,13 ,38 ,25 ,37 ,12 ,47 ,35 58 ,23 ,57 ,34 ,45 ,11 ,54 ,43 ,75 ,32 ,85 ,53 ,74 ,21 ,73 ,52 ,83 ,31 ,72 ,41 ,51 ,10 )  Q5=(01,15,14,27,13,38,25,37,12,47,3558,23,57,34,45,11,54,43,75,32,85,53,74,21,73,52,83,31,72,41,51,10) You can use the fact that if ab <cd   ab<cd , then ab <a+cb+d <cd   ab<a+cb+d<cd to show that that each of those lists contains distinct rational numbers in order. It's not as important to show, but it can be done, that the new fractions are also reduced. It's also easy to see that the length of Q n   Qn is 2 n +1  2n+1 , and each new Q n   Qn introduces 2 n−1   2n−1 new values, in the even positions in the new list. So the 4th new rational in Q 10   Q10 would be the 8th number in Q 10   Q10 . You also have a mirror symmetry: if ab   ab is introduced in a particular Q n   Qn , so is ba   ba . It's also clear that Q n   Qn introduces 1n   1n . Harder to show is that all multiples 0<an <1  0<an<1 are also in Q n   Qn . So all positive rationals will ultimately appear in the list. So you can make a 1-1 and onto map (a bijection) of naturals to rationals by looking at natural numbers of the form 2 n +m,m<2 n   2n+m,m<2n (which is, well, all of them), and going to the 2m  2m rational in Q n+1   Qn+1 . This gives you the sequence of rationals starting with (11 ,12 ,21 ,13 ,23 ,32 ,31 ,14 ,…)  (11,12,21,13,23,32,31,14,…) . 281 Views · View Upvotes
