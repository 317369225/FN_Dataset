How will be made the graph for y=sine|x|?Just draw the graph of sine x in a cartesian plane where x takes positive value i.e in first and fourth quadrants and take reflection of this in y-axis . As input to sine is of the type |x| ,.if you would give negative value to x like -π/3 ,|x| would convert this into π/3 ,which every absolute functuon does. As sine|-π/3| =sine|π/3|=sine(π/3) ,so the function sine|x| takes the same value either x is positive or negative , that is why we take reflection in y axis of the graph drawn in first and fourth quadrants. 54 Views · View Upvotes
