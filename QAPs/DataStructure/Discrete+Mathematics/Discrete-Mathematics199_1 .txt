What is the smallest positive integer 'k' such that C (2k,k) is divisible by 200?I'd say k=13. The reason is because 200=(2 3 )∗(5 2 ).  200=(23)∗(52). So the numerator must have atleast two 5's in order to divide 200. In all k's before and including 12, see that (2k)!, there are atmost 4 5's in the numerator. In the denominator, you simply double the number of 5's since it is k!∗k!.  k!∗k!. The reason 26! works is because it gives you extra 5's for 25 that are not cancelled. This can be seen by case analysis. Also, I confirmed that k=13 works. Please tell me whether I am right or not. 82 Views · View Upvotes
