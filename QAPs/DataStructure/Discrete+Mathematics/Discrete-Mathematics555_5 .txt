How many n ∈ {0,1,2...999} contain the digit 6 exactly once?And how does this differ from: “How many n contain the digit 6 at least once?”Let the number be , where X, Y and Z are the digits. Fix X=6, then we have Y and Z So total count of such numbers=n[6YZ]= Similarly, when , we have n[X6Z]= 81 Lastly, when , we have n[XY6]= 81 so the total count= 243 For the second problem, you may have two different approaches: Approach 1:============ Total count of numbers containing the digit ‘6’ at least once= n (Numbers with presence of ‘6’ exactly once)+ n (Numbers with presence of ‘6’ exactly twice)+ n (Numbers with presence of ‘6’ exactly thrice) =n[6YZ]+ n[X6Z]+ n[XY6] +n[X66]+n[6Y6] + n[66Z] +n[666] = Approach 2:=========== Total count of numbers containing the digit ‘6’ at least once = n (Universal Set)- n (Numbers without the presence of ‘6’ anywhere) = 43 Views
