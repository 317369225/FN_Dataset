Permutations and Combinations: How many ways can 10 men and 7 women sit at a round table so that no 2 women are next to each other?In a general case, when we arrange 'n' things together, (n+1) gaps are generated. But this is a special case. As men & women are sitting around a round table, 'n' things will generate 'n' gaps. If 10 men sit around this table, 10 gaps will be created. There are 7 women. Ways of choosing gaps = 10C3. Now, assuming that all men & women are dissimilar, we can come up to this : Men can change their places in 10! ways. Women can change their places in 7! ways. Total ways = 10C3  10!  7!  = 10!  10! / 3!. Hope this helps. Gm Chan's answer to this question helped me to write my answer. 7 white and 3 black balls are placed in a row at random. What is the probability that no two black balls are adjacent? You may read it. 240 Views  View Upvotes
