What is meant by selfcomplementing graphs in graph theory?A self-complementary graph is a graph that is isomorphic to its complement. Here, the complement of a graph G  G is the graph having the same vertices as G  G and having an edge between two vertices u  u and v  v if and only if there is no edge connecting u  u and v  v in G  G . Some results on self-complementary graphs include: For a self-complementary graph to exist, its number of vertices must either be a multiple of 4, or one more than a multiple of 4. This means that self-complementary graphs on 2,3,6,7,10,11,…  2,3,6,7,10,11,… vertices do not exist. The trivial graph on one vertex is considered self-complementary. There is only one self-complementary graph on four vertices: the path on four vertices. There are only two self-complementary graphs on five vertices: the cycle on 5 vertices, and the A  A graph (also known as the Alavi graph), which is a cycle on three vertices, with two pendant vertices each adjacent to two distinct vertices in this cycle. The Graph isomorphism problem would be solved if we solved it for just self-complementary graphs. Recently, Babai announced a quasi-polynomial algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem. 259 Views · View Upvotes
