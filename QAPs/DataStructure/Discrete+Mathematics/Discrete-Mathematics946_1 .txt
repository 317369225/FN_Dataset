How can I define bijection between (0,1) and (0,1]?Here is a non-constructive way of obtaining that bijection. Consider f:(0,1)→(0,1]  f:(0,1)→(0,1]  the canonical inclusion. Therefore, |(0,1)|≤|(0,1]|  |(0,1)|≤|(0,1]| . Consider then that (0,1] is obviously included in (0,2), thus |(0,1]≤(0,2)  |(0,1]≤(0,2) . But it is very easy to construct a bijection from (0,2) to (0,1), therefore we obtain that (0,1]≤(0,1)  (0,1]≤(0,1) . Therefore, |(0,1)|≤|(0,1]|  |(0,1)|≤|(0,1]| and (0,1]≤(0,1)  (0,1]≤(0,1) , and thus, using Schoreder-Bernstein theorem (Schröder–Bernstein theorem) , we have that both sets have the same cardinality and therefore there must be a bijection between them. 493 Views · View Upvotes
