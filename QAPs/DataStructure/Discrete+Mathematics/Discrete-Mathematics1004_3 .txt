What is the intuitive explanation for p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r)  p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r) ?I am not sure it makes sense to talk about intuition when what you have are a bunch of symbols. My intuition says replace the symbols with their definition and see what happens. In this case the definition of implication is:      p→r≡¬p∨r  p→r≡¬p∨r This is sometimes controversial as it is true if p  p is false no matter what r  r is. Thus "grass is red" implies "the Moon is made of cheese" is true! I give this example to illustrate that intuition may not be the best tool when thinking about logical implication. Anyway using our definition to substitute for implication symbols in the question we have:      ¬(p∨q)∨r≡(¬p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)  ¬(p∨q)∨r≡(¬p∨r)∧(¬q∨r) Which follows from the non-controversial De Morgan's Laws:      ¬(p∨q)≡¬p∧¬q  ¬(p∨q)≡¬p∧¬q      ¬(p∧q)≡¬p∨¬q  ¬(p∧q)≡¬p∨¬q and the distribution of "or" over "and":      (p∧q)∨r≡(p∨r)∧(q∨r)  (p∧q)∨r≡(p∨r)∧(q∨r) all of which are "intuitive". 764 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Raj Kumar
