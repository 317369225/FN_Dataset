Let G  G be a hypohamiltonian graph of order n  n . How can I prove that Δ(G)⩽n−12   Δ(G)⩽n−12 ?Pick an arbitrary vertex v  v and let deg(v)  deg(v) be its degree. Note that G  G cannot contain a triangle. G∖v  G∖v is hamiltonian, by definition. So for every edge {a,b}  {a,b} in the hamiltonian cycle, either {v,a}∉E(G)  {v,a}∉E(G) or {v,b}∉E(G)  {v,b}∉E(G) . So deg(v)≤n−12   deg(v)≤n−12 302 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
