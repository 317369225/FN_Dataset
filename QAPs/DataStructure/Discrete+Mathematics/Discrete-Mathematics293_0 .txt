10 children and 17 adults split into teams, say that they cooperated for a project with 2 children and 3 adults. Do they all tell the truth?each adult i claims to have worked with three other distinct adults and two other distinct children, and each child a claims to have worked with three distinct adults and two other distinct children. Define an edge ij  ij if person i  i has worked with person j  j . Each of the 17  17 adults claims to have worked with three adults. Consider the subgraph induced by the set of adults. By the handshaking lemma, it must satisfy: ∑ 17 i=1 3=17(3)=2E  ∑i=1173=17(3)=2E , a contradiction as 17(3)  17(3) is odd.
