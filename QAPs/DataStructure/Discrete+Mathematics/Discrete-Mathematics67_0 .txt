How can I graph |y|=2x+3?I guess you know the graph of y=2x+3 and you might be getting problem in drawing the graph of |y|=2x+3. You see there is one change in it from y=2x+3 : y is replaced by |y| , So give it a thought what change this |y| would bring . Let's say if you put x=2 in y=2x+3 ,you get 'y' as 7. But when you put x=2 in |y| =2x+3 ,you get |y| as 7 ,therefore 'y' can be 7 or -7 as absolute of any value is always positive i.e. |-7|=|7|=7. So , whatever value of 'x' you will put in |y| =2x+3 ,you will get two values of 'y' where one value is negative of another. But you have to keep one thing in mind you don't want |y| to be negative when you put any value of 'x' because |y| can't take negative values . So keeping these things in mind you will draw the graph of |y|=2x+3 with the help of y=2x+3: 1.First you will draw the graph of y=2x+3 which is a straight line. 2.Now ,you will neglect that part of y=2x+3 which is below x axis i.e where y is negative because you don't want |y| to be negative as discussed earlier. 3.Now take the image of the graph which you get in 2nd step in x-axis . Why x-axis ? Because for the same value of x you will get two values of 'y' . I think it clears your doubt if it doesn't feel free to ask.I am also attaching the image of graph in comments but i would suggest you to first try yourself.
