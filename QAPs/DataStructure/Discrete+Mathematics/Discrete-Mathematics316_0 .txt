Does b!^k divide (b*k)! if b,k are positive integers?We know that k!  k! divides the product of any contiguous range of k  k numbers.  (Simple proof: at least one of them must be divisible by k  k , at least one must be divisible by k−1  k−1 , etc.) So, (bk)!  (bk)! is the product of a range of bk  bk integers, or b  b ranges of k  k integers each.  Thus the product of 1...k  1...k is divisible by k!  k! , and the product of k+1...2k  k+1...2k is divisible by k!  k! , and so on.  We have b  b products that are divisible by k!  k! , so their product is divisible by (k!) b   (k!)b . 136 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Dimitris Chatzopoulos
