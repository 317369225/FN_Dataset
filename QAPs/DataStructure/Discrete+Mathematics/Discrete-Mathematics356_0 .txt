How do I show that for all sets A,B, C: if A∩C⊆B∩C and A∩¬C⊆B∩¬C then A⊆B?You can prove it from the properties of ⊆  ⊆ , ¬  ¬ and ∩  ∩ . Here you have to recall that A∩B  A∩B is the set of those elements which are in both A  A and B  B and that A⊆B⇔∀a(a∈A⇒a∈B)  A⊆B⇔∀a(a∈A⇒a∈B) Or you can prove in Boolean algebra the following formula: (((a∩c)→(b∩c))∩((a∩c ′ )→(b∩c ′ )))→(a→b)  (((a∩c)→(b∩c))∩((a∩c′)→(b∩c′)))→(a→b) . Here you must use that |a→b|=1⇔|a|⩽|b|  |a→b|=1⇔|a|⩽|b| . Both proofs are quite straightforward and left to the reader. 120 Views · View Upvotes
