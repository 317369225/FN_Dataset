How can I show that there are no integer solutions for the equation a³ = b⁴ + 6 , where a, b ∈ Z?Perfect cubes and perfect fourth powers can only take a limited set of values modulo 13. In particular, perfect fourth powers may take the values of 0, 1, 3 and 9; whereas perfect cubes take the values of 0, 1, 5, 8, 12 (why?). By direct substitution we see that there is no possible choice where the given relation can hold modulo 13, which means it cannot hold in general (no integer solutions). 425 Views  View Upvotes
