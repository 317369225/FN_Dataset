How do I write p∧(p→q))→q  p∧(p→q))→q   in disjunctive form?(p→q)  (p→q) says that the truth of p leads to the truth of q I name this assertion  " the rule." now (p∧(p→q))→q  (p∧(p→q))→q can be written as (p∧therule)→q  (p∧therule)→q   if we remove " and the rule" then we have (p→q)  (p→q) which is just "the rule" So the original statement is a rule nested in itself. There is a logical puzzle like Zeno's paradox that starts this way, with trying to explain how a rule is to be applied and continues indefinitely. It's not a normal tautology, like" the bachelor is unmarried." or  "x>1 and x>0 ", in which the second part is unnecessary because its implied in the first.  this statement has a rule within a rule. But the statement is not empty, it has meaning. the meaning is just "the rule" which brings us back to the beginning, the answer is (p→q)  (p→q) 82 Views · View Upvotes
