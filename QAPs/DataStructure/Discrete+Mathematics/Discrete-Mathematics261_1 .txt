Is it possible to demonstrate that there is only one tern of solutions (if y=1) to the equation x^3 +y^3 =z^2 over the positive integers?I'm not sure I'm interpreting your question correctly.  Were you looking for solutions to x 3 +1=z 2   x3+1=z2 ?  Or were you looking to show that x 3 +y 3 =z 2   x3+y3=z2 only has a solution if x=1 or y=1?  These are both known as diophantine equations, which I admit are not my specialty.  On the first equation, I was able to find a paper that showed the only nontrivial positive integer solution to x 3 +1=z 2   x3+1=z2 is when x=2 and z=3. I was able to dig up an interesting result on the second of the two problems.  You can see in that source that you have a solution to x 3 +y 3 =z 2   x3+y3=z2 if x=3m 4 −n 4 +6m 2 n 2   x=3m4−n4+6m2n2 y=−3m 4 +n 4 +6m 2 n 2   y=−3m4+n4+6m2n2 z=6mn(3m 4 +n 4 )  z=6mn(3m4+n4) for any integers m and n.  In particular 11 3 +37 3 =228 2   113+373=2282 and 8663 3 +2137 3 =812340 2 .  86633+21373=8123402. So you see we do not need x=1 or y=1 to get a solution to this, and in fact there are infinitely many solutions in the positive integers that do not require x=1 or y=1.  There exist solutions to the equation that are not obtained in this way as well. 105 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
