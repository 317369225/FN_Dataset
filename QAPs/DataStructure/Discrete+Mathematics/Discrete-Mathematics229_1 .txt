Theoretical Computer Science: How does "if p, then q" hold the same logical meaning to "q unless ~p"?Please include in your explanation how they have the same meaning in all four possible combinations of "p" and "q". Thank you in advance.If p then q (A) is logically equivalent to q unless not p (B) by the demonstration through a truth table. I know they are mind numbingly boring, but for the fundamentals nothing beats them. So we'll take it by case to show them to have the same truth values: take each letter to represent the propositional form associated to them: Take p,q  p,q as true. Then A is true, as is B. Take p,∼q  p,∼q as true. Then A false because the hypothesis is true while the conclusion is false. B is false because q is false. Take ∼p,q  ∼p,q as true. A is true as implication does not mean necessity: i.e. q can be true without p. If we interpret unless in B as meaning ∼  ∼ q⇒∼p  q⇒∼p , then the statement is true by the same principle as above. (This is known as the contrapositive or Modus Tolens) Take ∼  ∼ p,∼q  p,∼q as true.  A is true because the implication says nothing about the false case of p, so the claim still holds. B holds as ~p allows ~q. Since all cases for the truth values of the only elements, p & q, of give the same truth values for the propositions A and B, they are logically equivalent. 233 Views · View Upvotes
