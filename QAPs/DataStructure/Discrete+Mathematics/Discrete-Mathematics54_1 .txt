Given the mean and SD for a normally distributed discrete data, is it possible to compute the probability of an event?Yes, you just need a lookup table for the continuous version, where you can find the probability of your z-value : z:=x−μσ   z:=x−μσ (so you transform your random variable). The easiest correspondences in this respect may be the “1–2–3 rule, aka 68–95–99.7 rule” , where events that are 1 sigma away from the mean (meaning +/- away) comprise 68% of the data, similar for those events that are 2,3 sigma away from the mean. 84 Views · View Upvotes
