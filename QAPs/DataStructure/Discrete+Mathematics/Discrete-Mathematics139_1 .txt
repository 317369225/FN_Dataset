How do I prove the following: For all integers a, there exist an integer b so that 3 | a+b and 3 | 2a+b?I'll try to show you the essence of a proof of the first fact, without proving it, mainly because I detest doing proofs. You need to appeal to the definition of x|y  x|y . This means that there's a number k  k such that kx=y  kx=y . Well, returning to the question at hand, if we assume that we can find a number to show that 3|a+b  3|a+b then what would it be? Put the facts we have into the equation kx=y  kx=y : k⋅3=a+b  k⋅3=a+b . Solve for k  k : k=a+b3   k=a+b3 For any a  a b  b can be chosen so that a+b  a+b is divisible by 3  3 . Hence, the proof. 9 Views · Answer requested by Alex Stone
