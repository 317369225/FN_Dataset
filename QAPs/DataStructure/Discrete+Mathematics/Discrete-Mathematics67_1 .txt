How can I graph |y|=2x+3?First of all don’t consider that y is representing a single valued function as it is violating the parameters for to it to be a function. Now consider a curve being represented in such a manner that x and y follow the above relation. One important point to be noted here is that 2x+3 always takes a positive value as it represents |y|. So the inequality 2x+3>=0 …..→ x>-3/2 ** Now simply draw the graph of y=2x+3 **Take the part of graph which has x>=-3/2 **Now for corresponding y ….-y also satisfies the equation as |-y|=y **Therefore one can conclude that one x on curve corresponds to two values of y …..+y and -y….Hence for every point y on cure there also exists -y for a particular x. **So one has to take the mirror image of line y=2x+3 for x>=3/2 about x axis to include -y for the corresponding +y. Finally the graph would look like this 67 Views · Answer requested by Amitanshu Pattanayak
