How do I prove n⌊x⌋ = ⌊n × x⌋Below is my draft attempt at the proof. Could someone give me some advice as to whether I'm on the right track? I've followed the format of a similar question in my textbook, but I don't fully understand how nd = ⌊xn⌋ by the definition of floor. Could someone explain that step in further detail?You can't prove this because it's not true. Let x be root-2 = 1.414... so the floor of x is 1 while the floor of 5x = 7.07... is 7, which is not 5 times 1 47 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Emma Hudson
