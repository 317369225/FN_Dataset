How can I find the correct adjacency matrix given a particular graph?Yes that is correct. In an adjacency matrix, the '1' denotes the presence of a tie while the '0' denotes the absence of one. Note that the graph above is undirected hence the matrix values are duplicated across the diagonal. If it was a directed graph, these values would possibly not be identical. ie A tie from A to B is not the same as B to A 76 Views  View Upvotes
