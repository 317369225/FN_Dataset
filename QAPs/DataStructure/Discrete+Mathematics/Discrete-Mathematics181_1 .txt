How many numbers between 1 and 21million are divisible by 2,3, or 5 but not 7?Paraphrasing the problem, we are looking for integers 1≤x≤21⋅10 6   1≤x≤21⋅106 such that x  x is divisible by 30, but it is not divisible by 7. Thus, we may simply omit numbers divisible by 210  210 from our calculations, and we will find the correct number of integers. The number of integers divisible by 30 in the given interval is 700,000  700,000 as can be seen easily. The number of integers divisible by 210 is 100,000  100,000 , and therefore there are 600,000  600,000 such x  x . 203 Views · View Upvotes
