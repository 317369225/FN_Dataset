When are two edges said to be adjacent (in graph theory)?My teacher is saying that if there are 2 edges then they will be adjacent if and only if there both vertices are common. while my opinion is that if there is atleast one common vertex then the both edges will be adjacent to each other. please give proofs with answer( links or screenshot of any book)documented proof here in this online book. use ctrl+f to search and search for the word "adjacent". the first one is what you are searching for :) http://cs.bme.hu/fcs/graphtheory... 17 Views
