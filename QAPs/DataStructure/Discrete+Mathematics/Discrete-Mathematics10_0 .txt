Do prime numbers form a pattern in different bases?Not exactly a pattern, but there is something that can be said about the density of primes in a given base. In base 10,  10, except for 2  2 and 5  5 , every prime ends with the digit 1, 3, 7, or 9. That’s pretty obvious. But there’s more to it than that. Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions says that there are infinitely many primes ending with each of the relatively prime digits 1, 3, 7, and 9. Furthermore, the primes are evenly distributed (asymptotically) among those ending with 1, 3, 7, and 9. That means that as n  n approaches ∞  ∞ , the ratio of number of primes less than n  n ending with the digit 1 to the number of primes less than n  n ending with 3 approaches 1  1 . Dirichlet didn’t show this just for the base 10  10 , but for any base. So, for example, if you write your numbers base 14  14 , there will be infinitely many primes ending with the relatively prime digits 1, 3, 5, 9, b, and d (where b is the digit for 11 and d the digit for 13), and there will be approximately the same number of primes ending with each of those digits. 1.9k Views · View Upvotes
