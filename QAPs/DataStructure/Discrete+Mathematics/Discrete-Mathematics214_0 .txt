How should I remember rules of logical equivalences?There are three tables in my book related to Logical equivlances 1) simple(DMs law, associative, distributive... Etc), 2) involving conditional statements and 3) biconditional statements. I must know them all in order to attempt the proof questions. Is there any trick to memorize all of these tablesMemorization works well for many facts, sometimes not connected well. They are like point clouds of fact which center on some shape. This is a statistical notion. You should take the laws of logic seriously. They lay ground for future studies. 130 Views
