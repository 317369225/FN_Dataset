Why can't I express syllogism about Socrates using propositional logic?In propositional logic this syllogism will be presented thus: p∧q⇒r  p∧q⇒r because it consists of three distinct propositions. The expression is not universally true, although the syllogism is true. Our formalization is, hence, incorrect. In FOL, however, we have means to express properties and relations and we can also say something about all objects (universal quantification), some objects (existential quantification) and certain objects (constants for objects). This means that the syllogism can be presented as follows: (∀x(H(x)⇒M(x))∧H(s))⇒M(s)  (∀x(H(x)⇒M(x))∧H(s))⇒M(s) where H,M,s  H,M,s stand for human, mortal and Socrates respectively. Here we have a universally true expression, so the formalization is correct. This means that there are some expressions which cannot be formalized with help of propositional logic. 123 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
