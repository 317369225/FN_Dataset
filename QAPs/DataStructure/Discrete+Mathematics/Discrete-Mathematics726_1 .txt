What are some of the interesting (possibly counterintuitive) results from combinatorics and/or discrete mathematics?Here's a fun problem with an unexpected result. Shuffle a deck thoroughly with 52 cards. The number of arrangements of these 52 cards is quite staggering. Suppose we dealt the again and again at the fast rate of 1 deal per second. How long would it take, on average to get the same arrangement? Well there are 52! arrangements of cars. The number expressed in scientific notation is 8x10 67   8x1067 . So this is about how many seconds it would tale to randomly shuffle a deck before you got your original arrangement. How long is this? This is about 2 million billion billion billion billion billion years. So if you randomly shuffle a 52 card deck, this means that there is virtually no chance anyone else in the world will have ever shuffled a deck at random and come up with the same arrangement of cards. The Sun would burn out before that would happen, abruptly ending our experiment. My friend, Alon Amit, pointed out that if we ask a slightly different question, "What are the chances that two people in the world would randomly end up with the sane shuffle, the answer is about N − −  √   N , where N is the large number above. Well, the square root of 2 million billion billion billion billion billion years is about 4x10 26   4x1026 years. Still, the Sun would burn out before this would happen. Bottom line: Your life might be more fruitfully spent than just shuffling cards for billions of years. For instance, you'll miss the Avengers movies, and worse, you won't have children. 515 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Ahmad Baubaid
