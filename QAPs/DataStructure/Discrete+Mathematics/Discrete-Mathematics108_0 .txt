What is a bijective function ℕ → ℚ?A one-to-one correspondence with no repeats. (p.s. please don't use really complex maths i don't have any advanced knowledge).The other answers have already given you the 'standard' answer. I'll give a less common answer, which has the advantage of being applicable to many structures other than the rationals. Any fraction can be uniquely represented as an irreducible fraction "a/b" where a and b are co-prime (and where a may be negative). Therefore, any fraction can be represented by a unique string (finite sequence of characters) from the alphabet that includes the digits 0-9 and the characters / and -. To construct a bijection from the naturals to the rationals, you can therefore simply enumerate all the fraction-representing strings of length 3 in alphabetical order (ie "0/1", "1/1", " 1/2", ..., "9/8") followed by all the strings of length 4 ("-1/1", ... "99/8"), etc. This approach can easily be extended to any other collection where every element can be finitely described, such as the algebraic numbers or computable numbers. 1.6k Views  View Upvotes
