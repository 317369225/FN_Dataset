Why is graph theory important?Well in itself, Graph Theory is an important area of Discrete Mathematics. Graphs are very simple to explain discrete structures, but are use a basic functional structure that can model numerous discrete things. I'll give a couple examples: A collection of computers and communication links between the machines---a network. If you directed the edges, it could represent a set of web pages and hyperlinks between them---a web graph (one model for the Internet that resembles something like a bow tie).These are just a couple examples, but you will find that graphs can be applied all over the place, and since there are numerous algorithmic approaches to do operations or solve combinatorial problems efficiently with them, they become an important asset to computer scientists. For example, most of my research involves graph theory and scheduling theory, and I use graphs all the time to solve scheduling problems or find approximate solutions. The particular thing worth mentioning is unlike a lot of mathematical objects, graphs aren't just used by theoreticians, they're used very much by "applied people" and all the time in computation, so that makes them very important to study. At one time, Graph Theory was studied more as a recreational mathematics topic, but now it has a critical place intersecting Maths and Computer Science. Let us not forget the rich history Graph Theory has as a mathematical field (with many beautiful results), but I hope this answers the question. Hope this helps! 711 Views
