Why discrete mate is important in CSE?If you are not discrete, people will find out that you have a mate and may accuse you of cheating. On a more serious note: Why is discrete maths important in computer science? Because much of the mathematical foundations of computer science comes from discrete mathematics. Graph theory is central to the study of data structures and algorithms. Combinatorics is useful in the analysis of algorithms. Many data structures are representations of finite sets in the form of trees or ordered lists. Finite automata are edge-labelled graphs. In the study of cryptography, number theory and in particular modular arithmetic becomes important. The list is very long. 171 Views  Answer requested by Md. Forhad
