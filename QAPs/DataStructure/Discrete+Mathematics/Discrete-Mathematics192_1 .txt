How do i work out how many rows appear in a truth table for q ∨ p ∨ ¬s ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬t ∨ u?q ∨ p ∨ ¬s ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬t ∨ u I am a 16 year old learning discrete maths from rosen's book and i don't understand this question. The answer says 64, how does one work something like this out.Rows in truth table shows all the possible combination of the variables. General rule is : for n variables there are 2^n possible combinations. So, Here we have 6 variables(p,q,r,s,t u) so number of rows would be 2^6=64. 66 Views
