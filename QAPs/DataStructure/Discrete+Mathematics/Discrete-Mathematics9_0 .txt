What is a discrete category in mathematics?A mathematical “category” consists of objects (dots) and morphisms (arrows), plus a rule for composing morphisms (matching arrows head to tail.) In a “discrete category” the only morphisms are the identity morphisms. An identity morphism I X   IX maps from X  X to X  X itself, and has the property that any morphism f  f composed with I X   IX equals f  f . In a discrete category, this latter condition is almost trivially satisfied as there are no other morphisms that are composable with the identity. Any class of objects can be transformed into a discrete category by equipping each object with an identity morphism. 139 Views · View Upvotes
