How can I find the correct adjacency matrix given a particular graph?Graph Representation In the first case we store a matrix (two-dimensional array) with size NxN, where N is the number of vertices. This means that for each edge between the vertices i and j we have the value of 1 (A[i][j] = 1), and 0 otherwise. so your representation is correct In case of directed graph, we can use 1 for the edge (i,j) and -1 for (j,i) in case the edge is directed from i to j. here an example 190 Views  Answer requested by Chris Purrone
