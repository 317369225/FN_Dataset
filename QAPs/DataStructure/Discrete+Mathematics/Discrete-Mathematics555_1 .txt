How many n ∈ {0,1,2...999} contain the digit 6 exactly once?And how does this differ from: “How many n contain the digit 6 at least once?”For 0 to 99: For each group of 10 except 60 to 69, there is one 6-containing number, for a total of 9. For 60–69, all of them except 66 have one six, so there’s another 9. Total 18. Take 0–99 as having a leading zero. For all groups of 100 (0–99), (100–199), up through (900–999), with the exception of (600–699), the leading digit is not a six, so each of the 9 has 18 single-six numbers. So 9 x 18 = 162. For 600–699, each number with the last two digits containing no sixes will have a single 6. That’s 9 out of 10 for each group (0–9),(10–19), ..(90–99)and 0 out of 10 for the group (60–69), so 90 total. Add to the previous to get 252 out of the 1000 numbers have exactly 1 six. If you are asking about applying ‘at least one six’ to the same interval {0,999}, then 1/10 of the 1000 have a 6 in the first digit, 1/10 have a 6 in the second, and 1/10 have a 6 in the third. 100 for each case. This gives 10x10 = 100 for the first digit, then 10x9 for 2nd digit (10 in common with first), and 9x9 for the third digit (10 in common with first and 9 with second, not multi-counting 666), for a total of 100+90+81 = 271 605 Views · View Upvotes
