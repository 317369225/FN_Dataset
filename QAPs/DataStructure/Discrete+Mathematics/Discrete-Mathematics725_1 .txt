How do you solve the recurrence relation a n+1 −a n =3n 2 −n,n≥0,a 0 =3  an+1−an=3n2−n,n≥0,a0=3 ?Your approach is completely correct. You are not getting the correct result because you made an error calculating your f. You wrote: a n =a n−1 +f(n)  an=an−1+f(n)   with f(n)=3n 2 −7n+2  f(n)=3n2−7n+2 But the actual f(n) is: f(n)=3n 2 −7n+4  f(n)=3n2−7n+4 Try to see where was your error and fix the final result. 160 Views
