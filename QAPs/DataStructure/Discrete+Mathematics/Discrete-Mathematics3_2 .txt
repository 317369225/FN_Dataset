Can you prove that k divides (knn) with n,k>0 ?It is quite simple really, there is a binomial identity which is easily shown** (ab)=ab (a−1b−1) Use this for a=nk and b=n (nkn)=nkn (nk−1n−1) which is divisible by for . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ **We can see that we may choose a team of people from people and then a leader from the team members in ways, alternatively choose a leader from people and remaining team members from people in ways. Hence . You can also use the binomial formula to show this but it is less fun. 74 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Jared León
