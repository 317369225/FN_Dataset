On a 2-d grid, how many 2n  2n -move paths can be made that begin and end at (0,0)  (0,0) and also pass through (k,n−k)  (k,n−k) ?Constraint: 0≤k≤n  0≤k≤n .Assumptions: Let's constrain n∈N∪{0}  n∈N∪{0} and k∈N∪{0},k≤n  k∈N∪{0},k≤n . Also, let's assume that the path is allowed to overlap or intersect with itself. Each move in the path must be parallel to either the x  x or the y  y axis. Answer: (nk) 2   (nk)2 Reasoning: The minimum number of moves needed to get from (0,0)  (0,0) to (k,n−k)  (k,n−k) is n  n , since we must move ≥k  ≥k units on the x  x axis and ≥n−k  ≥n−k units on the y  y axis. But note that the path must also end at (0,0)  (0,0) (and the minimum number of moves needed to get from (k,n−k)  (k,n−k) to (0,0)  (0,0) is also n  n ). Thus, we must use the Rule of product, multiplying {the number of n  n -move paths from (0,0)  (0,0) to (k,n−k)  (k,n−k) } with {the number of n  n -move paths from (k,n−k)  (k,n−k) to (0,0)  (0,0) }. The answer follows, since the number of possible relevant n  n -move paths is (nk)  (nk) , since we must choose which k  k of the n  n moves will be progressing towards the destination on the x  x axis. 616 Views · View Upvotes
