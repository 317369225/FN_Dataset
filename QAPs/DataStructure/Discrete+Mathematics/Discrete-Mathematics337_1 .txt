How do I prove the following statement by contradiction?If a, b and c are integers and a^2 + b^2 = c^2, then at least one of a and b is evenI believe you could do a proof by cases, cases bein one of the two is even and other is odd (use definition of odd as well as even). For that one, you can say suppose a is even and b is odd. The last case would be both a and b are even. The key here would be to know that even means the number is equal to 2x, where x is some integer. And for a is odd, we would say a = 2x + 1, where x is some integer again. You would start the proof by saying "Suppose a,b and c are three integers such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. We need to show that at least one of a and b is even for this statement to hold" Then you would list out both cases, and show that it all works out with the help of some simple algebra. I may be wrong, but you could also try a proof by contradiction. That is, say "suppose not. Suppose nether a nor b is even for..." You would then show that can't be possible and hence your supposition is false, meaning the statement has been proven. 266 Views  View Upvotes
