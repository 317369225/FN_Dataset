Is the function -(x)² surjective?I’m trying to prove that R and the interval (-infinity, 0] have the same cardinality. So I’m trying to show an injection/surjection from R to (-infinity, 0], or the other way around. All I can think of to start with is y = -(x)². This seems to map from R to (-infinity, 0]. So is it surjective?Yes. To prove surjectivity, you need only show that for every y value there is some x value the function maps to it. In this case, any y is mapped to by x=−y − − −  √   x=−y . Ergo, the function is onto. However, a much simpler function for this purpose would be y=min(x,0)  y=min(x,0) . Then, for every y, you can just say x=y  x=y maps to it. However, neither of these functions are injections, and so are not actually suitable for your proof. A function that is both injective and surjective from R to (−∞,0)  (−∞,0) would be −e x   −ex . I'll let you think about one that also includes zero. 59 Views
