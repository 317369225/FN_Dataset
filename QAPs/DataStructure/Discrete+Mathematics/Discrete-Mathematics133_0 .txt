Let S be the set of all strings with 0's and 1's. Define f : S → Z(nonnegative) s.t f(s)=the length of s, for all s∈S. Is f onto?Prove or disprove.It is onto. But, any ideas on how one can show it?This is trivial. You've defined S to include all binary strings of any length. That means you are including the empty string (which has length zero) and the unary representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. (and the unary representation of a positive integer encodes that number by the length of the string). So for any nonnegative integer n, you have included s that is just n 1's in a row. 49 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Prabh Sodhi
