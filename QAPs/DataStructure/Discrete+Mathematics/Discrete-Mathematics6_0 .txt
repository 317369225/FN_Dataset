How can we prove the implication rule of logic?If P implies q, why is it logically equivalent to “not p or q”? It makes no sense to me at all.Well, one can simply prove it via truth tables. Or one can simply prove a formula (p⊃q)≡(¬p∨q)  (p⊃q)≡(¬p∨q) in some calculus. Now, to your second question. Classical implication indeed doesn’t have much sense as a formalisation of “if …, then…”. Precisely because of this definition. Another definition is that (if we take “truth” as 1 and “false” as 0) lhs is not greater than rhs in a true implicative formula (which means that it suffices for lhs to be false or rhs to be true for all formula to be true). And this definition doesn’t make sense either. These two definitions allow, for instance truth of such expressions as “if the Moon is square, then it is cold in winter”. It is surely cold in winter but not because the Moon is square. If, however, you want to find some connective that meaningfully represent “if …, then …”, you have to leave classical logic and use relevance one. Hope, that helps. 291 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Charles Alexander
