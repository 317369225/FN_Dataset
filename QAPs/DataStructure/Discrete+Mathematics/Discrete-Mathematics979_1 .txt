Can somebody give me a clear and detailed proof of Sperner's Theorem?Here is a step by step proof: Sperner Family: A family F  F of sets is called a Sperner family if no member of F  F is a subset of any other member of F  F , i.e. A,B∈F⇒A⊄B  A,B∈F⇒A⊄B and B⊄A  B⊄A . Sperner's Theorem: Let F  F be a Sperner family of subsets of an n-element  n-element set X  X . Then, |F|≤(n⌈n2 ⌉)  |F|≤(n⌈n2⌉) Proof: Claim 1: Consider a chain of subsets, a sequence ϕ=A 0 ⊂A 1 ⊂⋯⊂A n =X  ϕ=A0⊂A1⊂⋯⊂An=X . There are as many chains as permutations of X  X , that is, n!  n! Proof: Let π  π be any permutation, then we get a chain by setting A i ={1π,2π,…,iπ}  Ai={1π,2π,…,iπ} for i∈{0,1,…,n}  i∈{0,1,…,n} . Similarly, given a chain, we can uniquely recover the permutation since elements are added one at a time. Thus, there are as many chains as permutations i.e. n!  n! Claim 2: The number of chains containing a given set A  A where |A|=k  |A|=k is k!(n−k)!  k!(n−k)! Proof: If |A|=k  |A|=k , then it must happen that A=A k   A=Ak . So the chain containing A  A is obtained by joining together a chain for A  A and a chain for X∖A  X∖A . Thus, A  A lies in k!(n−k)!  k!(n−k)! permutations. Claim 3: Let F  F be a Sperner family, then any chain contains at most one member of F  F Proof: Assume that a chain contains more than one member of F  F , say A,B  A,B . Since A,B  A,B lie in a Sperner family, we know A⊄B  A⊄B and B⊄A  B⊄A . But this contradicts that A,B  A,B lie in a chain, since any two sets A,B  A,B in a chain satisfy A⊂B  A⊂B or B⊂A  B⊂A . Now back to the proof of Sperner's theorem. We know that any chain contains at most one set in F  F . So the number of chains which contain a member of F  F is ∑ A∈F |A|!(n−|A|)!=n!(∑ A∈F 1(n|A|) )  ∑A∈F|A|!(n−|A|)!=n!(∑A∈F1(n|A|)) Since, there are at most n!  n! chains in total, we have ∑ A∈F 1(n|A|) ≤1  ∑A∈F1(n|A|)≤1 Now, the middle binomial coefficients are the largest, so their reciprocals are the smallest. Thus, for any A∈F  A∈F , 1(n⌈n2 ⌉) ≤1(n|A|)   1(n⌈n2⌉)≤1(n|A|) . So, ∑ A∈F 1(n⌈n2 ⌉) ≤∑ A∈F 1(n|A|) ≤1  ∑A∈F1(n⌈n2⌉)≤∑A∈F1(n|A|)≤1 ∑ A∈F 1(n⌈n2 ⌉) ≤1  ∑A∈F1(n⌈n2⌉)≤1 |F|(n⌈n2 ⌉) ≤1  |F|(n⌈n2⌉)≤1 |F|≤(n⌈n2 ⌉)  |F|≤(n⌈n2⌉) This proves the claim of Sperner's theorem. 654 Views · View Upvotes
