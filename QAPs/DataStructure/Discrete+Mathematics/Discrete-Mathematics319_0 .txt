How can you use recursion in a program to solve the Tower of Hanoi?The goal is to move a tower of n disks from peg A to peg C. This can be done by moving the smallest n-1 disks to peg B, move the largest disk to peg C, and then move the smallest n-1 disks from peg B to peg C. When moving the n-1 smallest disks, you can ignore the fact that the largest disk exists; since it's the largest, any disk can be placed on top of it, as if it was the ground. Therefore, the problem of moving the n-1 smallest disks is analogous to the problem of moving the n disks, except for the name of the pegs. 147 Views  View Upvotes
