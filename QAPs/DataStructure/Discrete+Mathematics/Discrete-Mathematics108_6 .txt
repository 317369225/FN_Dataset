What is a bijective function ℕ → ℚ?A one-to-one correspondence with no repeats. (p.s. please don't use really complex maths i don't have any advanced knowledge).Here is a wierd one. Following is a recursive definition of a bijective function [math]f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Q}^+[/math] [math]f(1)=1[/math] [math]f(n)=\begin{cases}f(n/2)+1 & n \text{ is even} \\ 1/f(n-1) & n \text{ is odd} \end{cases}[/math] This can be calculated quite quickly (can be done in [math]\log n[/math] iterations) and it can be shown that each positive rational occurs exactly once. Its inverse can also be defined recursively as [math]f^{-1}(x)=[/math][math]\begin{cases}2 f^{-1}(x-1) & x > 1 \\ f^{-1}(1/x)+1 & x < 1 \end{cases}[/math] However the inverse function may sometimes take a lot of recursions for even simple looking fractions. To get a function to all rationals you can use the the bijective function from [math]\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Z}[/math]. 154 Views  View Upvotes
