What are some interesting applications of De Morgan's laws?Linear algebra is made possible by the traditional rules of arithmetic: commutative, associative, etc. De Morgan stands tall in arithmetic. Here is-are some interesting applications that I noticed that I haven't an answer to yet. So: Why is it that the case that Linear algebra Cannot deal with Commuting items, which is the comfortable and uncomplicated bed made with the excluded middle – which when you look at the idea of what commutative items are: items subject to the excluded middle. Whatever way you look at it.  Very Local: commutative. Is there a skip in this somewhere where linear algebra could live without this and still be consistent? Is this like a scripting language that has the marker that it can skip with loose strings (not hard strings) (Java-script) in a string sometimes when interpreting the output of the compiling language? The cogency of these questions or examples lies only in their high level of abstraction. So, we might say that what has caught out our attention is the power of additional dimensions that otherwise would be contradictions. Compiler and writers implement type inference by a method or intent of contradiction resolution, or Haskel types, type inference off the arithmetical line: that may may an kind of answer. But what method or intent? Proof theory? Or, more specifically, Goedel? It's not immediately apparent.  And if so, in either of these cases, would it work with Lie algebras. That's the answer but doesn't display how, by which transformations from the arithmetic line to Lie algebra. 318 Views · View Upvotes
