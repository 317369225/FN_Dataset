What is a "truncated graph"?There are two different uses of the phrase "truncated graph". One is used in "graph theory", ie the mathematics of arrays of points (vertices) joined by lines (edges) and enclosing areas. There truncation is the process of replacing a vertex that has n (>3) edges leading into it by a group of n new vertices which each have three and only three edges leading into them, thus: so a truncated graph has no more than three edges leading to any vertex. We can see the meaning of the term by imagining the vertex as the corner of a polyhedron. The truncation operation is equivalent to cutting off that corner (truncating the solid in a literal sense), forming a new face. This operation makes a graph easier to manipulate, while preserving certain important properties of the graph. However, outside the realm of graph theorists, among the vast majority of the population, "graph" means "a curve or wiggly line showing the relation between two variables, represented on perpendicular x and y axes; particularly the change in a variable with the passage of time". Here a truncated graph is something completely different. It is a graph where the whole of one axis is not represented. This may be simply a way of saving space, but can lead to (or be deliberately designed to encourage) misreading, whereby a small variation is given the appearance of a large one. See for example this graph of my Klout rating. where the part of the vertical axis below about 43 is truncated, so the variance (between 50 and 52) can be more visibly represented. 253 Views  View Upvotes
