How can we explain by words that P→Q is equivalent to ¬P∨Q?Intuitively, it is much easier to see why P⟹Q≡¬[P∧¬Q]  P⟹Q≡¬[P∧¬Q] . By De Morgan's Law, we would then have ¬[P∧¬Q]≡¬P∨Q  ¬[P∧¬Q]≡¬P∨Q . Using the  Raining⟹Cloudy  Raining⟹Cloudy example,  beginners often mistakenly assume that this statement suggests a causal or temporal relation between raining and cloudiness: that rain somehow causes cloudiness, or that cloudiness somehow causes rain. Neither is the case, of course. It means only that it is not the case that it is both raining and not cloudy at a given instant in time. That is the only possibility that is ruled out at that instant. As reflected in the truth table, everything else is possible: if it is raining, then it would be cloudy. And if it is not raining, it could be either cloudy or not cloudy. 146 Views · View Upvotes
