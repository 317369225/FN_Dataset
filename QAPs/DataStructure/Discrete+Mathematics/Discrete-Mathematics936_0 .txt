Why is graph theory important?It’s elegant, and provides a framework to model a large set of problems in CS. In addition, it has natural connections to Combinatorics, Topology & Algebra (but then, what doesn’t, right ?). It was motivated by the Konigsberg’ Bridge Problem. — It has surprisingly beautiful results regarding Traversability of Graphs, Coloring and important properties such as the Chromatic Number (χ  χ ) (Elegant Result : Heawood conjecture), Clique Number (ω  ω ) to name a few. Many Graph Problems are NP-Complete, and provide a useful tool for study in Computational Complexity. Graph Theory can be studied using tools from Topology, Combinatorics and Algebra. - Topological Properties include Planarity and Embeddings. - Combinatorial Properties include Matchings, Optimizations and Path-Enumerations. - Algebraic Properties include Eigenvalues, Sparsity and Expanders. But mostly, its important because it is an area of Mathematics, and the elegance of some of it’s results is moving. I’m not going to sit here and give you it’s applicability to problems in Operations Research, Network Analysis, etc (You can Google that if you want). The reason is that I disagree with the premise that something’s applicability should decide it’s importance. To me it’s important because of its beauty, and because of the informative power it gives. Knowledge needs no justification to be important, because it IS important by definition. So, I hope my answer is more of a prelude to what Graph Theory is and what its connections are with other branches of Mathematics. This in turn, I hope, prompts you to study it and see said connections and beauty for yourself. That study should be the answer to your question. 838 Views · View Upvotes
