How can you prove that any integer x, x (x^2 - 1) (x-2) is divisible by 4 using discrete mathematics?Is it necessary to prove it using contradiction or contraposition ?Surely, x(x 2 −1)(x−2)=(x−2)(x−1)(x)(x+1)  x(x2−1)(x−2)=(x−2)(x−1)(x)(x+1) Is product of 4 consecutive integers, and one of them must be a multiple of 4, and there is at least one other number which is even. So overall this is a multiple of 8. In fact you can take this even further, it is a multiple of 3 too. Hence the overall product is a multiple of 24. More generally product of k consecutive numbers is a multiple of k! (factorial of k=1×2×⋯k  k=1×2×⋯k ). So 4!=24.  4!=24. You can prove this using binomial coefficients being an integer. There is a another way to verify such statements, you can substitute all numbers 0≤x<K  0≤x<K , to check if divisible by K for any polynomial on x. So in this case if we want to check if statement is true for 4 in a slightly brute force way, substitute all numbers from 0 to 3. For x =0,1,2 it is trivially zero, and for x=3 it is 24. So it is a multiple of 4. 125 Views
