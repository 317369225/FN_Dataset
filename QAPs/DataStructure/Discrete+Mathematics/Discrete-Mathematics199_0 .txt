What is the smallest positive integer 'k' such that C (2k,k) is divisible by 200?(2*k)!/k! * k! should be divisible by 200. 200 = 2^3 *5^2 After cancelling out the common factors C (2k, k), the result should contain at least two 5s in order that it is divisible by 200. That is, if there is one 5 in the denominator, there should be three 5s in the numerator, If there are two 5s in the denominator, then there should be four 5s in the numerator. When k is 3 or 4 we get only one 5 left out in the result. Hence, they are ruled out. When k is 5, we donâ€™t have any 5 left out in the result. When k takes the value up to 9, we have only one 5 left out in the result. When k is 10, then we have two 5s in the denominator and two 5s in the numerator. When k is 13, then there are two 5s in the denominator and four 5s in the numerator. That means it will be divisible by 200. Therefore, the smallest positive integer value of k is 13. 67 Views
