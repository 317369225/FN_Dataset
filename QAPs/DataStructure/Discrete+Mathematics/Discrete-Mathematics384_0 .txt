How can one order the numbers 1 through 17 so that the sum of any two consecutive numbers are always a square number? Also, how does one prove there is no such ordering for the numbers 1 through 18?This question is about existence of a Hamiltonian path in a graph in disguise, which is in general a complex (NP-complete) problem. Let's connect two vertexes labeled by numbers 1,…,17  1,…,17 with an edge if their sum is a perfect square, i.e. 4,9,16,25  4,9,16,25 in our situation. Then we get the following graph: Note that  vertexes 16 and 17 have degree 1, so they must be the end vertexes of the path.  If we add vertex labeled 18, it will also have degree 1, so it is clearly impossible for a path to have three end vertexes. Let's find a Hamiltonian path: 16-9-7-2-14-11-5-4-12-13-3-6-10-15-1-8-17.  This is obviously an ordering you've been looking for. 5.6k Views · View Upvotes
