In an infinite array of random integers can I find an infinite sequence of the same integer?Suppose you have, say an infinite sequence of bit-strings {0,1}^inf or an infinite array of random integers. You can clearly find any finite sequence of consecutive 1's and 0's but can you find also an infinite sequence of 1's (or 0's) or would that fall under Russell's paradox?Yes. Reoccurrence of integers, patterns and any concept is possible. That's the definition of infinity. 9 Views
