How can I graph 2+3i?You need to clarify what you mean. Is i i your dependent variable? That is, do you wish to graph the line y(i)=2+3i y(i)=2+3i ? This would be a simple matter of plotting two points and extending the line with a ruler. Or do you mean i i to be the imaginary unit? That is, do you wish to graph the complex constant function f(z)=2+3i f(z)=2+3i ? If this is the case then you are going to have a bit more trouble. A complex graph has four dimensions, making it hard to visualize and harder to graph. One way of handling such a problem is the provide two 3-d graphs, one showing the real part of the function and the other showing the imaginary part. In this case the real part graph will be a horizontal plane at 2 2 and the imaginary part will be a horizontal plane at 3 3 . Or do you mean to to graph the point 2+3i 2+3i in the complex plane. In this case you just pencil in a dot at the point (2,3) (2,3) in the complex plane, like so: I assume that the last one is the question you meant to ask, but note how important it is to ask your question precisely and clearly. 150 Views  View Upvotes
