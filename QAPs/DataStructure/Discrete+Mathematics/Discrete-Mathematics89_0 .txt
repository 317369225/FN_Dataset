What are unlabeled graphs in discrete mathematics?May I define them as classes of isomorphism of graphs?A simple graph consists of a set of vertices and an adjacency relation on pairs of distinct vertices. When the adjacency relation is symmetric, the graph is undirected. Often simple graphs are represented by square matrices, called adjacency matrices, whose entries are either 0 or 1 having only 0’s on the diagonal. An isomorphism between two simple graphs is a bijection between the vertices of one and the vertices of the other that preserves the adjacency relation. If the graphs are represented by matrices, then an isomorphism corresponds to a permutation applied to both the rows and columns. The graph isomorphism problem asks for an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not. The best one to date runs in quasi-polynomial time; there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve the graph isomorphism problem. 593 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Gus Wiseman
