In a product sum, does the count of miniterms starts with 0 or 1?For example, I've got an exercise that states as following:Find the simplest sum of products for the function: f(x,y,z)=∑m(1,3,4,6,7)  f(x,y,z)=∑m(1,3,4,6,7) I assume that 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 are the positions on the logic boolean table where the product equals 1. My question is, does 1 stands for the first row of the table or the second? ThanksIndex starts at 0. For a table with 2 bits, you have 0-3 indexes, 3 bits (0-7), 4 bits (0-15), and so on. 50 Views  View Upvotes
