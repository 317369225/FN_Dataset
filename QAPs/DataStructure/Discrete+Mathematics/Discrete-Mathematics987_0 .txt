Why discrete mate is important in CSE?I've taught Discrete Mathematics I and II, along with Automata Theory, many times. They are part of the Computer Science Program at UT Dallas. Discrete Mathematics provides an essential mathematical background computer scientists need, including such topics as logic, proofs, set theory, functions, combinatorics (a fancy name for learning how to count such things as the number of passwords with 8 characters from the alphabet), recursion, graph theory, tree theory, and finite automata. All of these topics are useful for any computer-related field. 106 Views  View Upvotes
