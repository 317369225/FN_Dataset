How does a "face" in Euler's polyhedral formula relate to "cycle" or "loop" in graph theory?Addittion of a loop necesarilly adds a face to the graph which is neighbor with exactly one other face. This corresponds to adding a vertex of degree 1 the graphs dual. Regarding cycles there is not a specific relationship. In nonseparable graphs you may prove with the ear decompistion lemma that no matter how you draw the graph on the plane all faces are bounded by cycles. But in an ordinary graph you may not say that every face is necessarily bounded by a cycle. 58 Views
