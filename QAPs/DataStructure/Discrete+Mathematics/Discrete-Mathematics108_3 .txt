What is a bijective function ℕ → ℚ?A one-to-one correspondence with no repeats. (p.s. please don't use really complex maths i don't have any advanced knowledge).Given a positive integer n, let f(n) be the continued fraction (minus one) corresponding to the sequence of multiplicities (plus one) of each prime {2,3,5,…,p}  {2,3,5,…,p} in n, where p is the largest prime factor of n. This function f is a bijection, meaning its image spans every non-negative rational number, without any duplicates. For example, 21=2 0 3 1 5 0 7 1   21=20315071 so the corresponding sequence is (1,2,1,2); thus, f(21)=1+12+11+12   −1=38   f(21)=1+12+11+12−1=38 . Here is a plot showing the sorted and unsorted sequences of rational numbers from f(1) through f(120): Notice that many of the rational numbers here are very close to the golden section. Here is some Mathematica code to compute the function: primord[1]:=0; primord[n_Integer?Positive]:=With[{pairs=FactorInteger[n]},FromContinuedFraction[Table[Plus@@Cases[pairs,{Prime[i],y_}:>y]+1,{i,PrimePi[Max@@First[Transpose[pairs]]]}]]-1]; Table[primord[i],{i,120}] It outputs the following sequence: {0,1,12 ,2,23 ,32 ,35 ,3,13 ,53 ,58 ,52 ,813 ,85 ,25 ,4,1321 ,43 ,2134 ,83 ,38 ,138 ,3455 ,72 ,34 ,2113 ,14 ,135 ,5589 ,75 ,89144 ,5,513 ,3421 ,57 ,73 ,144233 ,5534 ,821 ,113 ,233377 ,118 ,377610 ,218 ,27 ,8955 ,610987 ,92 ,47 ,74 ,1334 ,3413 ,9871597 ,54 ,811 ,185 ,2155 ,14489 ,15972584 ,125 ,25844181 ,233144 ,311 ,6,1318 ,1813 ,41816765 ,5521 ,3489 ,127 ,676510946 ,103 ,1094617711 ,377233 ,37 ,8934 ,712 ,2921 ,1771128657 ,143 ,15 ,610377 ,2865746368 ,198 ,2129 ,987610 ,55144 ,298 ,4636875025 ,97 ,1119 ,14455 ,89233 ,1597987 ,3447 ,112 ,75025121393 ,117 ,518 ,114 ,121393196418 ,4734 ,196418317811 ,4713 ,512 ,25841597 ,317811514229 ,94 ,514229832040 ,1911 ,144377 ,235 ,8320401346269 ,7655 ,5576 ,23389 ,829 ,41812584 ,1831 ,175 }  {0,1,12,2,23,32,35,3,13,53,58,52,813,85,25,4,1321,43,2134,83,38,138,3455,72,34,2113,14,135,5589,75,89144,5,513,3421,57,73,144233,5534,821,113,233377,118,377610,218,27,8955,610987,92,47,74,1334,3413,9871597,54,811,185,2155,14489,15972584,125,25844181,233144,311,6,1318,1813,41816765,5521,3489,127,676510946,103,1094617711,377233,37,8934,712,2921,1771128657,143,15,610377,2865746368,198,2129,987610,55144,298,4636875025,97,1119,14455,89233,1597987,3447,112,75025121393,117,518,114,121393196418,4734,196418317811,4713,512,25841597,317811514229,94,514229832040,1911,144377,235,8320401346269,7655,5576,23389,829,41812584,1831,175} 390 Views · View Upvotes
