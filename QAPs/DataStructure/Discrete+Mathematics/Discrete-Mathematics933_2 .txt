How do I write p∧(p→q))→q  p∧(p→q))→q   in disjunctive form?I assume that you need a disjunctive normal form — i.e. disjunction of conjunction of quasi-elemetary formulas (QEF). QEF is defined as follows: A propositional variable is QEF If A  A is QEF, ¬A  ¬A is QEFThe formula you have contains implications which are defined through the disjunction as follows: (A→B)≡(¬A∨B)  (A→B)≡(¬A∨B) . So, your formula will look like thus: ¬(p∧(¬p∨q))∨q  ¬(p∧(¬p∨q))∨q . Then you apply de Morgan's laws and get (¬p∨¬(¬p∨q))∨q  (¬p∨¬(¬p∨q))∨q , then once more: (¬p∨(¬¬p∧¬q))∨q  (¬p∨(¬¬p∧¬q))∨q . Then you remove double negation (because why not!) and commutative property of disjunction and get: ((p∧¬q)∨¬p)∨q  ((p∧¬q)∨¬p)∨q . That's it. 191 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
