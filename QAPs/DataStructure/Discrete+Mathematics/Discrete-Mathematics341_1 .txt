If 54 people enter the raffle (including yourself), what are your chances of winning the laptop?There is a 1/54 chance of your ticket being pulled out of the hat. That much is fairly certain. However, spinning the wheel is technically more deterministic than it is random. So lets say that your skills at spinning the wheel are between the two extremes: perfect wheel spinning (you get the outcome you want 100% of the time) and random wheel spinning (truly random). Therefore depending on the randomness of the wheel, the probability of you winning the laptop is between 1/54 and 1/162. 45 Views
