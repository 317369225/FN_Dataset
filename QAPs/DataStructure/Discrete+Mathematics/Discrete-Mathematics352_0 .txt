How do I write "only prime number that can only be divided by itself and one" and I can only use these predicates : H(x, y) is x/y=integer(x mod y=0), S(x, y) is x=y, and P(x) is x is prime number?My guess is : ∀x∀y(~S(x, 1)^(~S(x, y)^~S(y,1)→~H(x, y))→P(x)) But I can't check if it's true or falseI'll interpret your proposition as, "A number is prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself." This is the same as, "If a number is only divisible by 1 and itself then it is prime." First, the domain of x and y should be specified as positive integers that are >= 2. Then we can express your proposition using predicate logic as: ∀x∀y[(¬S(y,1)∧¬S(y,x)∧¬H(x,y))→P(x)]  ∀x∀y[(¬S(y,1)∧¬S(y,x)∧¬H(x,y))→P(x)] ------------ Here's a fun proposition to express, "There are an infinite number of primes." If you think about how to express this without using the word 'infinite', you can say, "For any prime number, x, there is a greater prime, y." Assume the the domain of x and the domain of y are the positive integers that are >= 2. Then we can express this proposition using predicate logic as: ∀x(P(x)→∃y[G(y,x)∧P(y)])  ∀x(P(x)→∃y[G(y,x)∧P(y)]) where G(x,y) is x>y  x>y . 109 Views
