How can we prove the implication rule of logic?If P implies q, why is it logically equivalent to “not p or q”? It makes no sense to me at all.When is P⇒Q  P⇒Q false? That happens only when P  P is true and Q  Q is false. When is ¬P∨Q  ¬P∨Q false? That happens only when P  P is true and Q  Q is false. For all other combinations of truth values, P⇒Q  P⇒Q and ¬P∨Q  ¬P∨Q are both true. That tells you they’re equivalent. 83 Views · View Upvotes
