What is the difference between the set of real numbers and sets of cardinality ℵ 0   ℵ0 , i.e. the set of integers, that makes the cardinality of reals bigger?The key property the reals have is called completeness. That's what makes the difference. Two sets have equal cardinality if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between them. That’s the definition. Now, Cantor’s diagonal argument shows that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the reals and the naturals, i.e., they can not have the same cardinality. His argument shows that there can never be any way to count the reals. It’s not just that we haven’t figured it out yet. This provides the fundamental distinction between countable infinity and uncountable infinity. Now, the rationals are also countable. And, like the reals, they are dense: they seem to “fill up” the number line. Except they don’t! There are gaps, or missing points. This is because they are not complete. This is the key property the reals have that makes them uncountably infinite. For more explanation, see Tom McFarlane's answer to What are real numbers? and Tom McFarlane's answer to I know the set of rational numbers is countable. Given that the set of real numbers in an interval, say (a,b), is uncountable and that there is always a rational between any two real numbers, how is it that the number of rationals is not also uncountable? 283 Views · View Upvotes
