When are two edges said to be adjacent (in graph theory)?My teacher is saying that if there are 2 edges then they will be adjacent if and only if there both vertices are common. while my opinion is that if there is atleast one common vertex then the both edges will be adjacent to each other. please give proofs with answer( links or screenshot of any book)You are right.... Your teacher is wrong.. Any standard text book on graph theory will have the definition or criteria for adjacent edges. It will be better if you pick one from the library of your institution and show the appropriate page to your teacher. But since you have specifically asked for screenshot, here it goes: 53 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
