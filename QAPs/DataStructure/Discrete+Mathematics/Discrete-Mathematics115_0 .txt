In a product sum, does the count of miniterms starts with 0 or 1?For example, I've got an exercise that states as following:Find the simplest sum of products for the function: f(x,y,z)=∑m(1,3,4,6,7)  f(x,y,z)=∑m(1,3,4,6,7) I assume that 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 are the positions on the logic boolean table where the product equals 1. My question is, does 1 stands for the first row of the table or the second? ThanksFor the second row, because minterm starts from index zero 60 Views
