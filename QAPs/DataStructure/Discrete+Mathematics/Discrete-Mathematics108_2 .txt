What is a bijective function ℕ → ℚ?A one-to-one correspondence with no repeats. (p.s. please don't use really complex maths i don't have any advanced knowledge).Well, you'll need some basic knowledge of countability. The rationals are countable, which means that you can produce a one-to-one correspondence with the naturals. So just look for any proof that the rational numbers are countable, and it will show you a one-to-one correspondence. The easiest way to do this is to create a table with row and column values going from 1, 2, 3, ... with the entries being the fraction colrow colrow . The first entry pairs with 1. Then move down, that pairs with two. Then move diagonally, that's three. And keep making diagonals. You can see that this pattern hits all of the rationals, exactly once, if you ignore values which reduce to ones you already have. An easy proof that rational numbers are countable It isn't an explicit function, but it works. 406 Views  View Upvotes
