How do I find elements outputted by a recursive function given one output?So, I understand finding output of a sequence formula given an element, but what if it was a recursive function given: f(n)=f(n-1)/2 +4 and f(1)= 6 ?In the general case the function has to be evaluated for a given value n and all values k<n which are needed in each step. Some functions might be simplified to a formula which directly calculates the end result, others might not. For the function in the description: f(n)=f(n−1)/2+4  f(n)=f(n−1)/2+4 f(1)=6  f(1)=6 it turns out the difference between results for f(n) and f(n-1) is 2 1−n .  21−n. f(1) = 6; f(2) = 6/2+4 = 7; f(3) = 7/2+4 = 7.5; f(4) = 7.5/2 + 4 = 7.75; ... and f(0) = 4 So we can write f(n)=4+∑ n k=0 2 1−k =∑ n k=−1 2 1−k .  f(n)=4+∑k=0n21−k=∑k=−1n21−k. That turns out to be a geometric sequence with r=12   r=12 and a 0 =4  a0=4 Finally f(n) becomes the sum of this geometric sequence from a 0   a0 to a n   an : f(n)=41−0.5 n+1 1−0.5   f(n)=41−0.5n+11−0.5   note that the n+1 in the exponent is because in the sum above we started from k = -1, not k = 0. Each individual case will be different. A good starting point is to evaluate the first few values and look for patterns. Then try to get a sum or a product, since iteration is generally cheaper to evaluate than recursion. Finally try to reduce the sum/product to a function which can be evaluated in without iteration - in constant time as long as operands are small enough to fit into the word-size of the computer. p.s.: I hope I didn't mess up the indexing. 159 Views
