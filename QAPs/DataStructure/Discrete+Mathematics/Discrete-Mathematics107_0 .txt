If one element is taken from a countably infinite set, is it still infinite?Yes. The set will still be countably infinite after you remove any finite number of items. Think of the set of counting numbers {1,2,3,4,...} {1,2,3,4,...} . If we remove the first one then we have {2,3,4,...} {2,3,4,...} , which is still countably infinite. It's possible for the set to still be infinite even after removing an infinite amount of objects from it. Consider removing all of the even number from the set of counting numbers. You are left with the set odd numbers, which is infinite. 214 Views  View Upvotes
