How can I prove that there's no bipartite graph with δ(G)>n2   δ(G)>n2 ?Let G  G be a bipartite graph of order n  n . How can I prove that there's no G  G with δ(G)>n2   δ(G)>n2 ?Case 1: n  n is even. Then, at least one partition will have at least n/2  n/2 nodes, and the other will have at most n/2  n/2 nodes. Let's call these partitions S l   Sl and S s   Ss respectively. (Note that they may have equal sizes.) Case 2: n  n is odd. Then, at least one partition will have at least (n+1)/2  (n+1)/2 nodes, and the other will have at most (n−1)/2  (n−1)/2 nodes. Let's call these partitions S l   Sl and S s   Ss again. [l:large, s:small]. Now, the nodes in larger partition can have at most |S s   Ss | edges out of them, which leads to contradiction. 172 Views · View Upvotes
