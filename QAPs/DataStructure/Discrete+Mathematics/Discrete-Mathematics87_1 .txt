What mathematical objects can conveniently express both continuous and discrete probability distributions?Measures are what you are looking for. A measure is a function that assigns numbers to subsets of the space you wish to study. The original problem was assigning lengths, areas, volumes and so on to subsets of euclidean spaces. This forms the basis of what is known as Lebesgue integration. In probability theory, the subsets are events and the assigned numbers are probabilities. The discrete and continous cases can now be unified using Lebesgue integration notation. You may wonder why I omitted the word “all” in the paragraph above: Ideally we should like to assign probabilities to every possible event. Similarly, one would expect that we should be able to assign a length to any subset of the real number line. It turns out that this is not so - at least not if you accept the Axiom of Choice. The solution is to only work with subsets/events that are measureable. Sets that are not measureable are pretty weird. Check out the Banach–Tarski paradox and prepare for your head to hurt … The youtube channel Vsauce has also done a wonderful video about it: So the subject is more involved than one might think at first glance. However, a lot of the depth of the subject may not be needed if all you’re looking for is greater notational simplicity. 209 Views · View Upvotes
