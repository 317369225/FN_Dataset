Is it possible to demonstrate that there is only one tern of solutions (if y=1) to the equation x^3 +y^3 =z^2 over the positive integers?When y = 1, x^3 = z^2-1 = (z-1)(z+1). Factorise x^3 into a product of primes. Each prime appears a multiple of 3 times. Now factor z-1 and z+1. If a prime other than 2 divides one of these, it cannot divide the other. So either z-1 or z+1 has to be a perfect cube or a power of 2 times a perfect cube. The number of powers of 2, if any, must be split so that one of z-1 or z+1 has one more power of two and the total power is a multiple of 3. Powers of 2can only occur if z is even. This provides some limitations on the solution. Is that enough? If not see if you can extend this argument. 119 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Paul Robinson
