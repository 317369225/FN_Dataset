What are some of the practical applications of discrete mathematics in the field of computer science?Discrete math was the precursor to computer science and everything from the way that bits express logical constructs to looping constructs and algorithms used in our code to the pixel arrangements you see on your screen and much more are all based on discrete mathematics. A good example of its practical use is Bitcoin. If you read Satoshi Nakamoto's original whitepaper on Bitcoin you'll see that he annotates the logic using syntax you will find in discrete math textbooks and describes the problems he solves and demonstrates proof using discrete mathematics. Cryptography itself is a concept in discrete mathematics and all cryptography algorithms use discrete math concepts like prime number factorization to provide secure systems using things called public and private keys that ensure the security of information being transmitted. The concept of a proof is key in discrete mathematics. How can we know that if our base case for something is true that all other inputs to a function or algorithm will produce the correct result? Discrete math covers these types of proof using concepts like inductive reasoning, and sometimes making a sound program, model, or algorithm necessitates using this mathematical mindset that is backed up by a proof. Disclaimer: I'm no expert in discrete math, but I do a lot of programming so I see the results of discrete math in my work all the time. 737 Views  View Upvotes
