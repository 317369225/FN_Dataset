How do I prove that the relation R  R over N×N  N×N defined by (a,b)R(c,d)⟷a|c∧b|d  (a,b)R(c,d)⟷a|c∧b|d is a partial order relation?You must prove that the relation is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. I will show how to deal with one of these three conditions; the other two are similar in spirit. Suppose that (a,b)R(c,d) (a,b)R(c,d) and that (c,d)R(e,f) (c,d)R(e,f) . We must then show that (a,b)R(e,f) (a,b)R(e,f) . Since (a,b)R(c,d) (a,b)R(c,d) we have that a|c a|c and b|d. b|d. . And since (c,d)R(e,f) (c,d)R(e,f) , we have that c|e c|e and d|f d|f . But since a a is a divisor of c c and c c is a divisor of e e , then obviously a a is a divisor of e e . Similarly, we see that b b is a divisor of f f , and we are done. 502 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Frank Tominc
