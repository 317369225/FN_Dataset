How do I find elements outputted by a recursive function given one output?So, I understand finding output of a sequence formula given an element, but what if it was a recursive function given: f(n)=f(n-1)/2 +4 and f(1)= 6 ?Start y(2) =y(1)+4=6/2+4=7. = 8- 1/2^(2-2) = 8-1/2^(0) y(3)= y(2)+4 =7/2+4 =7+1/2. = 8 -1/2^(3-2) =8-1/2^1 Continue and you will find that y(n) = f(n) = 8 - 1/ 2^(n-2) Eg f(4) = 8 - 1/ 2^(4-2) = 8- 1/4 =7+3/4=7.75 Obviously lim. f(n) as n > inf =8 as 1/2^(n-2) tends to zero as n tends to inf. 95 Views
