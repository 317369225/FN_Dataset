How do I write p∧(p→q))→q  p∧(p→q))→q   in disjunctive form?It's a tautology, that is, it's true no matter what the truth values of p  p and q  q happen to be. There are many ways you can write it as a disjunction of conjunctions of variables and their negations.  You could write it out so that all four combinations of values of p  p and q  q appear.              (p∧q)∨(p∧¬q)∨(¬p∧q)∨(¬p∧¬q)  (p∧q)∨(p∧¬q)∨(¬p∧q)∨(¬p∧¬q) That's verbose. Since it doesn't depend on the value of p  p , you could write it more simply as              q∨¬q  q∨¬q . But it doesn't depend on the value of q  q either, so you could write it as              ⊤  ⊤ where  ⊤  ⊤ is the truth value True. But is ⊤  ⊤ in disjunctive normal form? Is it a disjunction of conducts of variables and their negations? Yes, it's an empty disjunction, and empty disjunctions are interpreted as ⊤  ⊤ . 754 Views · View Upvotes
