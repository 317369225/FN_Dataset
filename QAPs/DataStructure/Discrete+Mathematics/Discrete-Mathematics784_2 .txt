Can you prove O(log(n!))=O(nlogn)  O(log⁡(n!))=O(nlog⁡n) ?Without a good definition, you cannot get a good answer. I suppose you mean by the above that log n! is O(n log n) AND n log n si O(log n!). That will make O(log n!) and O(n log n) the same... Otherwise, O(n log n) = O(log n!) does not make sense. Neither of these is a function, they are sets of functions. Many others have proven log n! is O(n log n) based on the fact that n!<n^n. The converse follows from the fact that n!>n/2*...*n>(n/2)^(n/2). Taking logarithms on both sides yields log n! > n/2 log n/2. Moving the constants around give us n log n is O(log n!). 213 Views  View Upvotes
