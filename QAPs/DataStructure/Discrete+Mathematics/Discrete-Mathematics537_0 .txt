Does discrete maths play an important role in coding? Does it help reduce bugs in code? Is it the blueprint to think about the logic before coding it?Discrete Mathematics helps you to understand the proof of existing algorithms as well as formulate and prove new ones if required. Since algorithms are at the very heart of theoretical computer science and programming, so yes it is highly important in coding. And it would not be an exaggeration to say that it is the blueprint to think about logic before coding it. If you want to master the mathematics necessary for Computer Science, read Concrete Mathematics - an excellent book on the subject. Also, you can read 'The art of Computer Programming', which is a book on the mathematical side of programming by world's foremost authority on the subject. 169 Views  View Upvotes
