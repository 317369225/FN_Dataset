How can you prove that any integer x, x (x^2 - 1) (x-2) is divisible by 4 using discrete mathematics?Is it necessary to prove it using contradiction or contraposition ?You want to show that if x is an integer then x(x 2 −1)(x−2)  x(x2−1)(x−2) is divisible by 4. Consider these two cases: 1) x is even. Then the factors x and (x-2) are both even, so the expression is divisible by 4. 2) x is odd. Then the factor (x 2 −1)=(x−1)(x+1)  (x2−1)=(x−1)(x+1) . Since x is odd, both of these factors must be even. And if you multiply two evens you get a multiple of 4. Thus, whether x is odd or even, x(x 2 −1)(x−2)  x(x2−1)(x−2) is divisible by 4. 324 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
