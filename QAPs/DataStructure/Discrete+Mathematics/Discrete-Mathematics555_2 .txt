How many n ∈ {0,1,2...999} contain the digit 6 exactly once?And how does this differ from: “How many n contain the digit 6 at least once?”Pad each number with leading zeros to make each 3 digits. Now consider that modified set. For exactly one 6, you have a six in one place and a not-6 in two other places, so there are 1 * 9 * 9 = 81 numbers that meet this requirement for each of the three places to put the six. Total ways comes to 3 * 81 = 243. For any 6s, you get everything that isn't all not-6s, so 1000 - 9^3 = 1000 - 729 = 271. 155 Views  View Upvotes
