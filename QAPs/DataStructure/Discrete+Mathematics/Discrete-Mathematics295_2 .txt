Can a simple undirected graph with 11 vertices and 53 edges have a Eulerian cycle?Some important theorems to keep in mind: ------------------------ If G is a connected graph, then G contains an Euler cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree.  A connected graph G has an Euler path if and only if exactly two vertices have odd degree.  ------------------------ Assume that at least one cycle exists. So at the very least your graph is resembles a circle or path that walks through all points. This has to happen at least once for your graph to be considered a eulerian cycle.  A cool way to approach this is to build on that graph.  To maintain edge parity whilst constructing your complicated 53 edge requirements you only have handful of options.  1) Add an edge of even weight(where weights represent number of edges) between two unconnected vertices 2) Super impose a cycle on your graph with weight n. Edges already in the cycle from the previous graph update their weights such that w = w + n. Edges that don't exist in in the graph are added with their weights set to n.  Given the logic that you're building up to a graph with 53 edges using either even edge connections between unconnected weights or using super imposed cycles, I've hastily invented a cool trick to tell if certain graphs are constructable. I haven't fully tested or proved it so use at your own risk. Given that #edges > #vertices #edges mod #vertices is even implies Eulerian cycle. #edges mod #vertices is odd implies no Eulerian cycles.  This is a test that checks to see wether or not super-imposing a graph would work. The even would be adding an even edge between two unconnected vertices on your graph.  365 Views  View Upvotes
