What is the actual significance of partial ordering and total ordering?Both partial and total orderings occur everywhere. The concept of something being a part of something else leads to partial ordering, so does the concept or a hierarchy, an organigram etc. Accordingly, they also show up everywhere in mathematics, along with more advanced concepts like “least upper bound” etc. The theory around them as appears in math is not particularly deep, though. Some deep considerations around the Zorn lemma occur in fundamentals of mathematics. 330 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Gus Wiseman
