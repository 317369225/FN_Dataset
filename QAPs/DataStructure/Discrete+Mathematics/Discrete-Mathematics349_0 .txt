Where am I going wrong with the following equation? M(n)={2 M(n−1) −1,3, if n>1.otherwise.   M(n)={2M(n−1)−1,if n>1.3,otherwise. I am trying disprove the following statement: M(n) for all positive integers is prime.You approach seems fine; you are not proving anything, just checking a few examples. Your sequence grows very fast. I don't think there is a good way to check if the next value is prime; if it is, it would be by FAR the largest known prime number. 1.6k Views  View Upvotes
