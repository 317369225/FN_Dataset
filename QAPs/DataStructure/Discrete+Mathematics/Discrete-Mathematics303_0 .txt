What is the precedence of set operations?Operations like union ,Cartesian product, intersection etc for example : AXBXC or A union B X CIntersection and union usually have the same precedence. When mixing ∩  ∩ , ∪  ∪ , and ×  × in the same expression, I would fully parenthesize the expression. It would read better that way as in the following distribution identities.             (A∩B)∪C=(A∪C)∩(B∪C)  (A∩B)∪C=(A∪C)∩(B∪C)             (A∪B)∩C=(A∩C)∪(B∩C)  (A∪B)∩C=(A∩C)∪(B∩C)             (A∩B)×C=(A×C)∩(B×C)  (A∩B)×C=(A×C)∩(B×C)             (A∪B)×C=(A×C)∪(B×C)  (A∪B)×C=(A×C)∪(B×C) 353 Views · View Upvotes
