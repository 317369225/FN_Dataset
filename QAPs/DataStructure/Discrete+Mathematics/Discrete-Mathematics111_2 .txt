What is discrete mathematics and why is it so important for computer science?I am only a highschool student so excuse my ignorance. I see discrete mathematics almost in all Computer Science programs, so what is it exactly? And why is it specifically so important for Computer Science?Discrete mathematics - at least as I learned it - is a collection of techniques and algorithms relevant to all sorts of things you often need to do when programming: Working with graphs, i.e. collections of nodes and edges. How do you find the quickest way across town? How can you drive around a neighborhood to deliver papers, making sure you drive on each road exactly once? How much water can a complicated pipeline deliver to all the homes connected to it? What’s the bottleneck for fed-ex delivering packages all over the world? All of these can be solved with graph theory. Complexity theory: given three ways of solving a problem, which one will work faster? This is harder to figure out than it sounds. Problems where you need to classify objects and check for their membership: is it a type of duck? a dog? how many creatures are in each category? Set theory give you a way to work with this sort of question. There’s a lot more to it, but this is some of the highlights. I’ve taken a lot of computer science courses over the year. The single most useful was, without a doubt, discrete mathematics. It’s the only course with unintuitive content that was directly applicable to work in industry. Well, that and perhaps introduction to algorithms, and intro to programming. 2.9k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Andy Anderson
