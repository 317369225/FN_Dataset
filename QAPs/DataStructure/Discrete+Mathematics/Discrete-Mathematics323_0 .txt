If we have an alphabet that consists of 4A, 5B and 3C with all As identical (same with B and C), how many 12 l-words can we make that have BBB in them?10080 Let us first place the Bs in their positions. In how many ways can K objects be placed with possibilities of G gaps between them such that two things are not adjacent? The answer to this is the number of non-negative integer solutions to x 0 +1+x 1 +1+x 2 ...1+x K−1 +x K =G  x0+1+x1+1+x2...1+xK−1+xK=G . The +1s are here to make sure that there is at least one gap between every pair of objects. The number of solutions to this is C(G+1,K)  C(G+1,K) . Using this, we can place BBBBB in 8 ways, B BBBB, BBBB B, BB BBB and BBB BB in 28 ways each, and B B BBB, B BBB B and BBB B B in 56 ways each. Thus placing the Bs can be done in a total of 288 ways. After this, the remaining characters can be placed in C(7,3)=35  C(7,3)=35 ways. The required answer is thus 288∗35=10080  288∗35=10080 . 1.7k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Dimitris Chatzopoulos
