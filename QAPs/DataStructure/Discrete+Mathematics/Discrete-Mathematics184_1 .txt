Could someone explain that step in further detail?Where did you get this problem, which is obviously wrong? You can not prove it as it is not correct. For example . Then . The left side is for any . But, on the right side, you have and so on, for respectively. To make it a little clear, I do one extra stuff by stating when , , so that . Do you see ?
