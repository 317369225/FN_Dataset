The statement (p∧(p→q))→q is tautology.How do I show that the statement p∧(p→q)∧¬q is a contradiction by using the first statement  without a truth table?I assume you are using classical logic. You can derive this formula in any calculus you want: ((p∧(p→q))→q)→(¬(p∧(p→q)∧¬q))  ((p∧(p→q))→q)→(¬(p∧(p→q)∧¬q)) . Or you can build an analytic tableaux for the formulas you mentioned and show that there is a contradiction. However, a simpler way would be that of using Boolean algebra. Assume that A→B⇔¬A∨B  A→B⇔¬A∨B or equivalently |A→B|=1⇔|A|⩽|B|  |A→B|=1⇔|A|⩽|B| . Then you have to derive that if |(p∧(¬p∨q))→|=1  |(p∧(¬p∨q))→|=1 then either |p|=0,|(¬p∨q)|=0,|¬q|=0  |p|=0,|(¬p∨q)|=0,|¬q|=0 . You can do this almost the same way you solve linear equations, so  I leave it for you. 125 Views
