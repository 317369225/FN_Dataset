How many numbers between 1 and 21million are divisible by 2,3, or 5 but not 7?Well, the question is ambiguous - are you looking for numbers divisible by 2 and 3 and 5, or numbers divisible by 2 or 3 or 5?  I'd want to clarify that first.  Then I'd find out how many such numbers there are between 1 and 210.  Then I'd multiply by 100000. Edit:  the question has changed and now reads "How many numbers between 1 and 21million are divisible by 2,3, or 5 but not 7?"  From 1 to 30, the numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5 are 30−ϕ(30)  30−ϕ(30) .  Multiply by 700000 to get the count less than or equal to 21 million, then take 6/7 of that to get the number not divisible by 7. 92 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
