How do I show that if the logical statement p=∀x(A(x) ↔[F(x) ∨∃y(P(x,y) ∧A(y))]) is true then the statement q=∃x¬A(x) →∃x¬F(x) is a valid conclusion?So, you start by assuming the antecedent of the conditional you want to prove. That's an existential claim, so pick an arbitrary letter to represent a concrete example thereof (I'll use a). Next, instantiate the universal premise with the same letter: A(a)↔(F(a)∨∃y…)  A(a)↔(F(a)∨∃y…) . We already have the negation of the left side of the biconditional, so by modus tollens we get the negation of the right. Applying DeMorgan laws, this is a conjunction ¬F(a)∧¬∃y…  ¬F(a)∧¬∃y… . Simplify that conjunction, retaining the left conjunct, and then an existential generalization gives you your desired conclusion. 42 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
