What is hailstone sequence?A good one! Let's start with hailstones first. Do you know how hailstones are formed? A simple Google Search reveals that, "Hail forms when thunderstorm updrafts are strong enough to carry water droplets well above the freezing level. This freezing process forms a hailstone, which can grow as additional water freezes onto it. Eventually, the hailstone becomes too heavy for the updrafts to support it and it falls to the ground." So you see, water droplets are falling down, but they're again taken up by the updrafts, and they freeze and come down heavier, again they go up, and again they come down heavier, repeating this process till the updrafts are no longer strong enough to take the hailstones to a higher altitude, and they finally come down and all 'hail' breaks loose, hahaha! Similarly, take a number, say, x. If x is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 which gives you 3x+1. If x is even, simply divide it by 2. Assign the new value to x. Repeat. For x=6, you get, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1,... The mystery is, by experimentation, for most (almost all) values of x, you can see that the cycle of 4, 2, 1,... eventually appears, and this seems straightforward at a glance, but the conjecture lies here, Do ALL numbers eventually generate the 4, 2, 1,.. sequence eventually? You'll think I'm crazy, but then, think again, do ALL numbers do that? This question was proposed in 1937 by Lothar Collatz and is called Collatz conjecture. The link given below has a calculator, in case someone wants to use brute-force technique to disprove Collatz Conjecture ;-). Mathematical mysteries: Hailstone sequences 59 Views  View Upvotes
