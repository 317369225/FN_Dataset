How can I prove that there's no bipartite graph with δ(G)>n2   δ(G)>n2 ?Let G  G be a bipartite graph of order n  n . How can I prove that there's no G  G with δ(G)>n2   δ(G)>n2 ?Suppose such a graph, G(A,B,E)  G(A,B,E) , exists. Let v  v be some vertex with minimum degree, and assume WLOG that v∈B  v∈B . deg(v)>n/2  deg(v)>n/2 so v  v has more than n/2  n/2 neighbors in A  A , hence |A|>n/2  |A|>n/2 . There are n  n vertices in G  G , so |B|=n−|A|≤n/2  |B|=n−|A|≤n/2 Since  |B|≤n/2  |B|≤n/2 , every vertex in A  A must have degree at most n/2  n/2 . This contradicts the minimality of v  v 282 Views · View Upvotes
