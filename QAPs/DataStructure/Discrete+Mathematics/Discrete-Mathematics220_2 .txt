Can you solve the equation x+y+z=39 over the positive integers?Let's look at this a different way. We're going to look at the string ∣∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋯  ∣∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋯ , with 39  39 dots. Let's look at some permutation of this. For example, we could have ⋅⋅⋅⋅∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋯  ⋅⋅⋅⋅∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋯ , so that the last string of ⋅  ⋅ s has 29  29 dots. This permutation corresponds to the triple 4,6,29  4,6,29 . Why? Because there are 4  4 dots before the first "divider", 6  6 dots between the first and second divider, and 29  29 dots after the second divider. However, there's a problem here. We could have the permutation ⋅∣∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋯  ⋅∣∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋯ , with 38  38 ⋅  ⋅ s at the end. This corresponds to the triple 1,0,38  1,0,38 , which doesn't work, because 0  0 isn't a positive integer. We could subtract out all of the cases with exactly 1  1 0  0 , and then add in the cases with exactly 2  2 0  0 s. However, there's a better way. Let's set aside 3  3 of the ⋅  ⋅ s, and permute the rest. Then, after we're done, we'll throw one dot between each set of divisors, which will add 1  1 to each of them. This ensures that each of the values is positive. We can see that every possible triple corresponds to exactly 1  1 of these permutations. Thus, our answer is equal to the number of permutations of ∣∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋯  ∣∣⋅⋅⋅⋅⋯ with 36  36 0  0 s, which is clearly (382)=19⋅37= 703   (382)=19⋅37=703 , which gives us the number of possible solutions. At this point, it's easy to list all possible permutations based on the positions of the dividers (hint: there are 38  38 slots, and we want to put dividers in 2  2 of them. Let each spot be a 0  0 if it has no divider, and a 1  1 otherwise. Thus, each triple corresponds to a 38  38 -bit binary integer with exactly 2  2 1  1 s in its binary representation, and it's easy to list those in ascending order). 278 Views · View Upvotes
