What equivalence relations can be created from {0, 1, 2, 3} ?Is (0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3) (0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3) the only one?There are 15 possible equivalence relations here. One way to understand equivalence relations is that they partition all the elements of a set into disjoint subsets. An element is always in the same subset as itself (reflexive property), if x is in the same subset as y then y is in the same subset as x (symmetric property), and if x, y and y, z are in the same subset, then x, z are in the same subset (transitive property). So, in how many ways can we divide {0, 1, 2, 3} into disjoint sets? If 1 disjoint set: Everything is in the same set --- every element is equal to every other element. Only 1 way to do this. If 2 disjoint sets: either a set of 3 elements plus a set of 1, or 2 sets of 2. In the case of a set of 3, one element will be excluded from it, 4 choices as to which element. In the case of 2 sets of 2, your choice comes down to which element you pair with the 0 element. 3 choices there. So, 7 choices total. If 3 disjoint sets: necessarily a set of 2 and then 2 sets of 1. Can pick any 2 elements out of 4 to go into the set of 2, so C(4,2) (4-choose-2, binomial coefficient of 4 and 2) = 6 choices. If 4 disjoint sets: all elements are by themselves in a disjoint set. Nothing is equal to anything else. 1 way to do this. In total, 15 equivalence relations on 4 elements. 258 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Chris Purrone
