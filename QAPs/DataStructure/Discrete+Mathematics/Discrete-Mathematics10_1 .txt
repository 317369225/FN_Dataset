Do prime numbers form a pattern in different bases?That depends on what you mean by a pattern. We have certain patterns in base 10 that are evident, yet do not quite help us discover more meaningful ways to detect them Numberphile did a video on a particular bias in the prime numbers in base 10. It’s called Chebyshev's Bias and you can watch the video here. There are other patterns that show up through various bases, most notably the last digit of such primes. And I’m sure there’s more. Hopefully some that give us a method of generating the next prime, but we don’t know about them quite yet. 259 Views · View Upvotes
