How can we explain by words that P→Q is equivalent to ¬P∨Q?You want an example of a real life situation, I guess. Denote with C  C the event that the sky is cloudy, and R  R the event that it's raining. Obviously R⇒C  R⇒C , since if it's raining, the sky needs to be cloudy. This means that if R  R is true, i.e. it is raining, then C  C has to also be true. Also, if it's not raining, the sky can be both cloudy or sunny. The only situation we don't allow is the one in which it is raining and the sky is sunny. That is, when R  R is true and C  C false. Looking at the truth table other users posted is also useful, but to see that R⇒C  R⇒C is equivalent to ¬R∨C  ¬R∨C , you can also think that, for the formula to be true, we need either the weather not to be rainy, or the sky to be cloudy. If any of these two is true, you don't care about the other one and can declare the whole formula true. This is exactly how the ∨  ∨ operator works. 84 Views · View Upvotes
