What's the difference between concrete and discrete mathematics?Concrete: maybe as opposed to abstract. It should therefore relate to solving practical problems with the appropriate tools instead of seizing a problem as a way to construct an abstract structure and dig into its properties with full generalization in mind. I never heard this term as a generic one but a google search provides with a book (see Garrett Thomas answer). Discrete: all maths tools within which the 'domains' are essentially discrete. Combinatorics, graph, logic, topology, for instance. If I had to look for differences between both 'fields', I would say that concrete math would correspond to an applied maths course while discrete maths would correspond to courses related to foundations in computer science or abstract algebra (starting with Euclidian division, finite groups, graphs, graphs automorphisms, enumerative combinatorics). 153 Views
