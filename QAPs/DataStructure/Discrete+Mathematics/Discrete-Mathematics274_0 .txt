How can I create prediction intervals for discrete numeric predictions that are spread over time and each have different probabilities of accuracy?I sounds like you want a random walk model. If you have some time series estimate for the expected value of the state of your system you may need to account for uncertainty in your system outputs or inputs in some systematic way that reflects the dependence of your uncertainties on the value of the state variables. A prime example is the prediction of peak power demand in a utility service area during each day of the week, month or year. At any stage the uncertainty reflects variability in weather, economic activity and household use, not only locally, but in the exchange areas nearby and across the country. It's important to know for planning purposes how much the actual load and dispatch-able capacity might vary from the expected value to assure continuity of service throughout the service area. It's basically a simple idea that allows you to extend an expected value into the future and to estimate a range around each expected value to account for external uncertainties and/or uncertainties internal to the system. Some contributors to uncertainty might grow with the load, while others would aggregate around some independent projection of means and variances. Global warming affects, for example, would show up as greater variance in local and global weather patterns pretty much independent of the load, but with a potentially big influence on both load and available capacity. I know that this is pretty general, but maybe it gives you a flavor of how to incorporate uncertainties into stochastic time series analysis. The best part of this approach is that you can use and test data to extend your model as you extend your knowledge. 130 Views
