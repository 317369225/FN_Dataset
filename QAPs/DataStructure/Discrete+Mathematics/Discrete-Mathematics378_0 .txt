Can I assume a population is discrete if the probability of each event happening is reasonably high?For instance, if i am presented with data that p(x=50)= 0.1, p(x=60)= 0.2 p(x=70)=0.5, p(x=80)= 0.2 Can I assume that it is a discrete distribution, given the fact that if it is a continuous distribution, the probability of each individual event happening would be extremely low.The way you describe the problem, all x-values correspond to x-probability values, P(x=some number). All your probabilities add up to 1, which is a requirement. Their x-values are discrete, and don't show signs of varying as continuous. Your distribution is discrete, and you can even make a histogram. 45 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by A. Mustafa
