Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y)))  Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y))) equivalent?It is my understanding that the quantifiers can go all at the beginning since they apply to the whole statement, but the textbook keeps showing the latter version with the quantifier in the middle. I would like to know if my way is okay since that is how I understand it better.You probably meant to rewrite it as ∃x∀y(S(x)∧(F(y)→¬A(x,y)))  ∃x∀y(S(x)∧(F(y)→¬A(x,y))) which, as far as I can tell, is equivalent to the second claim. 38 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Paul Robinson
