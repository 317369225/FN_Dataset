How can I find all integers solutions to 5x ≡ 1 (mod 1303), 5x ≡ 15 (mod 1303), 5x ≡ 10 (mod 30)?This appears to be a homework problem, so I won't give a complete answer. I'll give two observations: First, you may have copied the problem down wrong: there are no simultaneous solutions of the first two congruences mod 1303. Double check you have the problem right. Second, this is a classic application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. If you're having trouble applying it, post more details about what you attempted. I won't solve it for you, but I'll offer suggestions proportional to the effort you put in to it. 224 Views  View Upvotes
