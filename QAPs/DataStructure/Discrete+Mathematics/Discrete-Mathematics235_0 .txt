How do I use the pumping lemma to prove A={www∣w∈{a,b} ∗ }  A={www∣w∈{a,b}∗} is not a regular language?I understand I have to use proof by contradiction, but how do i set up my s for pumping lemma so i cant split it into 3 parts?Here is a simpler example to help you get started. Let us prove that B={ww∣w∈{a,b} ∗ }  B={ww∣w∈{a,b}∗} is not a regular language. Suppose B  B were regular. Then there would be some integer p>0  p>0 such that for all s∈B  s∈B where |s|≥p  |s|≥p , we would have strings x,y,z  x,y,z such that s=xyz  s=xyz and such that the conditions |y|>0  |y|>0 |xy|≤p  |xy|≤p For all i≥0  i≥0 we have xy i z∈B  xyiz∈B all hold. To show that B  B is not regular, it is therefore enough to find some s∈B  s∈B with |s|≥p  |s|≥p such that every partition of s  s will violate at least one of the conditions 1-3. We choose s=a p b p a p b p   s=apbpapbp . It is obvious that |s|≥p  |s|≥p . If condition 2 is to hold, we must have that y  y consists of a  a 's and nothing else. If condition 1 is to hold as well, y  y cannot be empty. But then the string xy 2 z  xy2z cannot be of the form ww  ww for some w∈{a,b} ∗   w∈{a,b}∗ , so condition 3 gets violated. 423 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
