How can you prove that any integer x, x (x^2 - 1) (x-2) is divisible by 4 using discrete mathematics?Is it necessary to prove it using contradiction or contraposition ?The expression can be written as , x.(x+1).(x-1).(x-2) [Since a^2 - b^2 = (a+b).(a-b)] Rearranging the four integers , we have, (x+1).(x).(x-1).(x-2). Now of the four consecutive integers making up the product, at least one exists which is divisible by 4. It could be any one integer though, we cannot guess which one. It is in fact possible to state a stronger statement, which states that product of four consecutive integers is divisible by 4! = 24. This is a result in Number theory which is proved well in Barnard and Child. 89 Views
