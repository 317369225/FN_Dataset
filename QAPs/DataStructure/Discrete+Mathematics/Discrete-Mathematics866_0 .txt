How do I prove that the negation of any odd integer is odd using discrete mathematics?Let us recall the definition of an odd number. x is odd iff x = 2 * m + 1 , where m is an integer. Let x is the odd number. By definition, x = 2 * m + 1. Multiply by -1: -x = -2 * m - 1 = -2 * m - 1 + 2 - 2  = (-2 * m - 2) - 1 + 2 = -2 * (m + 1) + 1  = 2 * (-m - 1) + 1. Since m is in integer, therefore (-m - 1) is an integer. Hence -x is an odd number. 268 Views  View Upvotes
