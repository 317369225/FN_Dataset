How can you prove that any integer x, x (x^2 - 1) (x-2) is divisible by 4 using discrete mathematics?Is it necessary to prove it using contradiction or contraposition ?The basic method for such questions is to write f(x)=x(x 2 −1)(x−2)  f(x)=x(x2−1)(x−2) . Then one remarks that f(x+4)−f(x)  f(x+4)−f(x) is divisible by 4 since f  f is an integer polynomial. Thus it suffices to check for x=0,1,2,3 in order to conclude. 116 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
