How can I prove by induction 1^2+3^2+5^2+...+ (2n+1) ^2 equals (n+1) (2n+1) (2n+3) /3? For n >=0The straightforward approach: For n=0  n=0 , it is clear that 1 2 =1=(1)(1)(3)3 .  12=1=(1)(1)(3)3. Now we can assume that this formula holds for some value of n  n (since we just showed that it does).  Now if we consider n+1  n+1 , the sum becomes 1 2 +3 2 +…+(2n+1) 2 +(2n+3) 2   12+32+…+(2n+1)2+(2n+3)2 And we know the sum of all but the last of these terms, so we can substitute that in leaving: 1 2 +3 2 +…+(2n+1) 2 +(2n+3) 2 =(n+1)(2n+1)(2n+3)3 +(2n+3) 2   12+32+…+(2n+1)2+(2n+3)2=(n+1)(2n+1)(2n+3)3+(2n+3)2 Some algebra gives: 1 2 +3 2 +…+(2n+1) 2 +(2n+3) 2 =(2n+3)((n+1)(2n+1)3 +(2n+3))  12+32+…+(2n+1)2+(2n+3)2=(2n+3)((n+1)(2n+1)3+(2n+3)) Then this equals: (2n+3)((n+1)(2n+1)+(6n+9)3 )  (2n+3)((n+1)(2n+1)+(6n+9)3) Which equals: (2n+3)(2n 2 +9n+103 )  (2n+3)(2n2+9n+103) Which equals: (n+2)(2n+3)(2n+5)3   (n+2)(2n+3)(2n+5)3 Which finally equals: ((n+1)+1)(2(n+1)+1)(2(n+1)+3)3   ((n+1)+1)(2(n+1)+1)(2(n+1)+3)3 And we see that this is exactly what the formula predicts when we plug in n+1  n+1 .  Since we have shown that the claim holds for zero and that if it holds for any natural number, it must also hold for its successor, it follows by induction that the claim must hold for all natural numbers. Here's a more fun way.  Let's instead start by first using induction to prove the much more frequently used result: 1 2 +2 2 +…+n 2 =n6 (n+1)(2n+1)  12+22+…+n2=n6(n+1)(2n+1) Again the base case of zero holds trivially.  We then assume the equality for n  n and consider the sum of the first (n+1)  (n+1) terms.  We then get: 1 2 +2 2 +…+n 2 +(n+1) 2 =n6 (n+1)(2n+1)+(n+1) 2 =(n+1)((n+1)+1)(2(n+1)+1)6   12+22+…+n2+(n+1)2=n6(n+1)(2n+1)+(n+1)2=(n+1)((n+1)+1)(2(n+1)+1)6 And we have shown that the result holds for all natural numbers. So how can we use this formula to verify the sum you asked about?  We apply it twice and subtract! First, we apply the proven result for (2n+1)  (2n+1) to get: 1 2 +2 2 +…+(2n+1) 2 =(2n+1)((2n+1)+1)(2(2n+1)+1)6 =(2n+1)(n+1)(4n+3)3   12+22+…+(2n+1)2=(2n+1)((2n+1)+1)(2(2n+1)+1)6=(2n+1)(n+1)(4n+3)3 We then notice that if we examine the even terms of the above series, after factoring out a four, we get exactly the proven result applied to n  n : 2 2 +4 2 +…+(2n) 2 =4(1 2 +2 2 +…+n 2 )=4n(n+1)(2n+1)6   22+42+…+(2n)2=4(12+22+…+n2)=4n(n+1)(2n+1)6 So the sum you seek must just be the difference of these two results: 1 2 +3 2 +…+(2n+1) 2 =(2n+1)(n+1)(4n+3)3 −2n(n+1)(2n+1)3 =(2n+1)(4n 2 +7n+3−(2n 2 +2n))3 =(2n+1)(2n 2 +5n+3)3 =(n+1)(2n+1)(2n+3)3   12+32+…+(2n+1)2=(2n+1)(n+1)(4n+3)3−2n(n+1)(2n+1)3=(2n+1)(4n2+7n+3−(2n2+2n))3=(2n+1)(2n2+5n+3)3=(n+1)(2n+1)(2n+3)3 303 Views · View Upvotes
