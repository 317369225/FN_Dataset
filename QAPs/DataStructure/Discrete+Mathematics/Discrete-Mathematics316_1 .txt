Does b!^k divide (b*k)! if b,k are positive integers?Let's use some "cross-induction" (induction on two variables). Base Step 1!^1 divides (1 * 1)!. Inductive Step b!^k divides (b * k)! implies (b+1)!^k divides ((b+1) * k)!, and b!^k divides (b * k)! implies b!^(k+1) divides (b * (k+1))!. Proof (b+1)!^k = ((b+1) * b!)^k = (b+1)^k * [b!^k] ((b+1) * k)! = (bk+k)! = (bk+k) * (bk+k-1) * (bk+k-2) * ... * (bk+1) * [(bk)!] and b!^(k+1) = [b!^k] * b! (b * (k+1))! = (bk+b)! = (bk+b) * (bk+b-1) * (bk+b-2) * ... * (bk+1) * [(bk)!] Thus, all we need to prove now is: (b+1)^k divides P(bk+k, k), and b! divides P(bk+b, b). (b+1)^k divides P(bk+k, k) P(bk+k, k) = (bk+k) * (bk+k-1) * (bk+k-2) * ... * (bk+2) * (bk+1) = ((bk+k)-0) * ((bk+k)-1) * ((bk+k)-2) * ... * ((bk+k)-(k-2)) * ((bk+k)-(k-1)) = (bk+k)^k * some other junk = (k * (b+1))^k * some other junk = k^k * [(b+1)^k] * some other junk. Yes, (b+1)^k divides P(bk+k, k). b! divides P(bk+b, b) So for this one, I ran some Python code that did it from 1 to 100 for b, and for each of those, from 1 to 100 for k, which leads me to believe it works in general. This might take some more rigorously sophisticated mathematics to conclude, but I would like to hypothesize that it works for all b and k. Conclusion I would like to say yes, b!^k does divide (b*k)! for all positive integers b and k. If anyone would like to comment or suggest edits on improving this last step, feel free to. 77 Views  View Upvotes
