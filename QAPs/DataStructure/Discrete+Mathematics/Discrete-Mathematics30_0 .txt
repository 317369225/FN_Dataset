What is a traceable graph?Ok, so I guess you know what is a graph. A traceable graph is simply a graph which admits a hamiltonian path. But what is a hamiltanion path ? It’s a path that goes through all vertices of the graph (remember that each vertex of a path is visited only once). Thus, a graph is said to be traceable if there exists a way to chose a initial vertex, follow an edge going out of this vertex thus arriving to a new vertex, follow an edge going out of this new vertex etc. i.e. each time following an edge going out of last visited vertex without ever visiting a vertex twice, but still visit every vertex of yout graph. 188 Views · View Upvotes
