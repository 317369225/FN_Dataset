What is the intuition for conversion between different number systems?For example, from decimal to binary use repeated division and from binary to decimal use multiplication. How and why does it work? What is the mathematical explanation?There are only 9 number. The rest is remainders. So when you look at 1000 decimal, it 83 dozen and 4. 4 is the remainder and 83 is too big still. So we count the 83 into dozens and we get 6 doz and 11. And we keep counting in dozens and remainders until no is left but remainders, ie 6,11,4. If you want fractions, then the decimal bit is the same, just different. A dcimal is a series of added tenths. That is, in 3.14159, the 4 means that the number lies 4/10 of the way between units to the left, here 3.1 and 3.2. The conversion into 12ths is then to write a number as a series of added twelfths. So .14159 is 1.69808 twelfths. Hey, that’s a twelfth and a bit of a twelfth. The bit is ,69808, and that fraction is so many twelfths, and a bit of a twelfth. Like 8.37696 twelfths. And you keep going away until you have enough remainders (what gets left behind), and you go 3.14159 = 3.1 8 4 6 … by series of dozenal remainders. If you use base 12 or some other base, you don’t have to use the unit equality for approximations. You can rely on that 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 dozenal is 2985984 decimal, or nearly 3 millions. So if you have something that is 80 millions decimal, it’s 80/3 = 26.66. dozenal millions, and converting 26.66 to 2 2 . 8 is something you can do in your head. 235 Views · Answer requested by Raj
