If one element is taken from a countably infinite set, is it still infinite?Yes, if an element is taken from a countably infinite set, the new set obtained is still an infinite set. Let X  X be a countably infinite set. Let x∈X  x∈X be an element of X  X . The set Y:=  Y:= X−{x}  X−{x} is an infinite set, because if Y  Y is a finite set, then union Y∪{x}=X  Y∪{x}=X would be a finite set, a contradiction (because the union of two finite sets is finite). 89 Views
