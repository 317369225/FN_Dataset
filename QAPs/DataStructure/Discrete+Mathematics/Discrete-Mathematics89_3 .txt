What are unlabeled graphs in discrete mathematics?May I define them as classes of isomorphism of graphs?It seems to me that this would depend upon what category of graphs you want to study, but it seems strange to me to say that you want to define unlabeled graphs in terms of labeled graphs. On the other hand, I think it would be easy, after defining graphs of all kinds, including labeled graphs and unlabeled graphs, to prove a theorem that categorizes unlabeled graphs in terms of isomorphism classes of labeled graphs. Basically, it seems that what you want is to consider is a forgetful functor on the category of labeled graphs that “forgets” the labels. But it seems like it won't work if your category of labeled graphs includes some “distinguished” labels or “distinguished” vertices or “distinguished” edges. 145 Views · View Upvotes
