Is Boolean logic based only on binary transistor circuits or can it be applied to more complex physical systems?Where can I read about this stuff in more detail? (but oriented towards beginners)NO. The “binary transistor” doesn’t exist. All transistors are analog devices… the only thing distinguishing “binary transistor” from the others is that it is designed to transition to the maximum/minimum voltage in as short a time as possible. The transition itself is still a continuous analog change. It is more correct to say that digitial circuits EMULATE the mathematics of boolean algebra. The reason for the “EUMULATE” is that with boolean algebra, you get absolutes. The results are always true/false values. With digitial logic, you always have “indeterminate states”. One way to demonstrate this is to connect the output of a not gate to its input. By boolean algebra this give you a sequence of ones and zeros… It doesn’t. What you get is a steady voltage half way between the the maximum voltage and the minimum voltage. And that changes depending on how the not gate is manufactured. Current not gates (NAND gates actually) are implemented by one transistor - and they can’t do anything else but provide an indeterminate result in this configuration. In the old days, a not gate involved up to around four transistors… one was a buffer amplifier, and that introduced enough in circuit delays that you COULD get a sequence of high/low voltages. Boolean algebra is a math system that was initially developed around 1847 through 1854 for analyzing truth systems. In the 1930s electrical switching systems developers recognized that they could use boolean algebra to analyze those circuits… Boolean algebra 364 Views · View Upvotes
