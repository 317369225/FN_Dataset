How can you prove that for all real numbers x, if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational, using contradiction and contraposition?The contrapositive of If x2 x2 is irrational then x x is irrational is: If x x is rational then x2 x2 is rational. To prove that, I would just do it directly, not by contradiction. Using contrapositive and contradiction would be overkill, I think they meant to use one or the other. So if x=nm x=nm where n n and m m are integers, then n2 n2 and m2 m2 are also integers and x2=n2m2 x2=n2m2 is rational. 227 Views  View Upvotes
