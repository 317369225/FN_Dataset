How can you prove that for all real numbers x, if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational, using contradiction and contraposition?Okay, so we want to prove that ∀x∈  ∀x∈ R:(x 2 ∉Q)⇒(x∉Q)  R:(x2∉Q)⇒(x∉Q) . Using the method of proof by contradiction, let's try to prove that ∃x∈R:(x 2 ∉Q)∧(x∈Q)  ∃x∈R:(x2∉Q)∧(x∈Q) . If  x  x is rational, then we can represent it the next way: x=pq ,p∈Z,q∈N  x=pq,p∈Z,q∈N . Let's raise x  x to the 2nd power: x 2 =(pq ) 2 =p 2 q 2    x2=(pq)2=p2q2 . But p 2   p2 is an integer and q 2   q2 is natural: m=p 2 ∈Z,n=q 2 ∈N  m=p2∈Z,n=q2∈N . So we can say that x 2 =mn ,m∈Z,q∈N,  x2=mn,m∈Z,q∈N, which means that x 2   x2 is rational by definition: x 2 ∈Q  x2∈Q . This statement contradicts our assumption that x 2   x2 is irrational. Therefore, such x  x doesn't exist. 770 Views · View Upvotes
