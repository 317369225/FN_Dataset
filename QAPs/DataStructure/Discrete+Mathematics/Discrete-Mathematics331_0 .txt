What is the criterion for a selection of a set of coin values so that a greedy algorithm yields the optimal solution for the Change-making problem?See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch...What you are looking for is a Matroid. Essentially, it is a finite set E coupled with a family of subsets I that hold some quality between other sets in the family. The quality we are looking for is that for some subset A_1 of a subset A_2 in E, if A_2 is an element in I then so is A_1. The following answer may help solidify what exactly a matroid is: Alan Guo's answer to What is a Matroid? 74 Views
