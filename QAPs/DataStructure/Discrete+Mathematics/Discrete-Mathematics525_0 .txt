What is the cardinality of a set S where every finite multiset of elements of S is a member of S?This is an enumeration of the first fifty elements of such a set.I’m not sure what order you’re using when you say this is an enumeration of the first fifty elements of such a set, but if you have an enumeration of the set, then it’s countably infinite Another way to look at a set of multisets is that they’re rooted trees. The outer bracket corresponds to the root, and each of its elements is a child of the root. The leaves are the empty sets. For example, corresponds to {{{}{}}{{}}{}}. You traverse the tree to get the expression. Down is {, up is }. You’re asking about the cardinality of the set of finite rooted trees. It’s countably infinite. 586 Views · View Upvotes
