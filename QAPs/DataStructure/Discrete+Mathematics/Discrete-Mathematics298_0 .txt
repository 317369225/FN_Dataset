Properties of relations are considered only one one set. Can we define a reflexive relation on sets A and B?The only way you can have a reflexive relation is from a set to itself. Treat the relation R  R as a subset of A×B  A×B . To be reflexive means for each element a∈A  a∈A , (a,a)∈R  (a,a)∈R . That implies a∈B  a∈B . Therefore A⊆B  A⊆B . Likewise B⊆A  B⊆A . So A  A and B  B are the same set. 101 Views · View Upvotes
