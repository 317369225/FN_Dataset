For an n n -digit binary number, what is the probability that the digits contain consecutive 1's?For example, for a 3 digit binary number, it has 8 possibilities, and 110,011,111 are the 3 scenarios when there is consecutive 1s.Originally Answered: For an n-digit binary number, what is the probability that the digits contain j consecutive 1's? This qustion is inspired by another question: For an nn n -digit binary number, what is the probability that the digits contain consecutive 1's? I wrote a small program that can get the probability through brute force but I wonder what is the general formula. 122 Views
