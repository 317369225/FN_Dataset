Given n objects and p positions evenly divided around a table, n <= p, how many placement combinations exist?Restrictions: There can be no neighboring objects and any rotation of an arrangement should be considered the same arrangement. Example: for n = 3, p = 6, there are 2 possible arrangements: 1_2_3_ or 1_3_2_ . (2_1_3_, 2_3_1_, 3_1_2_, 3_2_1_ are rotations of the latter two.) For n = 4, p = 6, none.Imagine scooting the 1st object (position-wise) after Object 1 back 1 position, scooting the 2nd object after Object 1 back 2 positions, and so on. The position difference between consecutive objects diminishes in each case by one. Since no two objects were adjacent to begin with, the objects remain in distinct spots in the same order as they were originally. However, the last object after Object 1 can now be at most (p - 2) - (n - 1) = p - n - 1 positions after Object 1. [(p - 2) because it originally could be at most (p - 2) many positions after Object 1, the (p - 1)-th position after Object 1 being ruled out by adjacency to Object 1; (n - 1) because it is the (n - 1)-th object after Object 1] Conversely, any choice of how to distribute the n - 1 objects other than Object 1 among the p - n - 1 many positions after Object 1's can be seen as arising uniquely from this scooting process. Thus, the question is as to how many ways to carry out the distribution in the last paragraph. This breaks down into choosing n - 1 positions out of p - n - 1 many positions, and then choosing a correspondence of n - 1 objects with those n - 1 positions. The former produces a factor of (p−n−1n−1)=(p−n−1)!(n−1)!(p−2n)!   (p−n−1n−1)=(p−n−1)!(n−1)!(p−2n)! , while the latter produces a factor of (n−1)!  (n−1)! ; multiplying these together, we get our final answer, (p−n−1)!(p−2n)!   (p−n−1)!(p−2n)! (i.e., the product of the whole numbers in the range (p−2n,p−n)  (p−2n,p−n) ). (Note: if n is more than half of p, this should be interpreted as coming out to zero; also, the above discussion assumed n > 0, with the answer for n = 0 being trivially 1. Both of these are accounted for by the previous parenthetical formulation.) 546 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Ivan J Miranda
