Can you solve the equation x+y+z=39 over the positive integers?Since we have 3 variables and 1 equation the solution set will take the form of a plane; in particular, one that looks like an expanded version of the line y=−x+39  y=−x+39 . There's really nothing more to it solution-wise. We can fix arbitrary x,y∈Z  x,y∈Z to find exactly one solution z∈Z  z∈Z such that x+y+z=39  x+y+z=39 .
