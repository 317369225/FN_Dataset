Is there a way to calculate the first digit of Graham's number using discrete mathematics?I'm not sure what you mean by "using discrete mathematics", but regardless the answer is No, not in any reasonable or quite unreasonable time frame. The calculation is trivial from a theoretical standpoint, but it is far outside the realm of possibility to actually carry out. It's possible that there's some clever shortcut but we don't know of any such shortcut, and I believe it's unlikely that one exists. Oh, by "first digit" I assume you mean the most significant one, the one on the left of the decimal notation. If by chance you're thinking of the least significant one (the units digit) then the answer changes dramatically: the units digit of Graham's number is 7. (Proof: left as an exercise to the reader.) 4.3k Views  View Upvotes
