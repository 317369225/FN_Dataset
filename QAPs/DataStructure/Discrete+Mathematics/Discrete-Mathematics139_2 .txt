How do I prove the following: For all integers a, there exist an integer b so that 3 | a+b and 3 | 2a+b?Let's deal with non-negative integers, because it's easier to understand, and the results are the same if you deal with all integers. The first part is easy. You're given some integer a  a and you want to find a b  b such that 3|(a+b)  3|(a+b) . Say that a=10  a=10 . Obviously, you can pick a an integer b  b so that 3|(a+b)  3|(a+b) . For instance b=2  b=2 would work, as well as b=11  b=11 .  Formally, if 3|(a+b)  3|(a+b) then there exists an n such that 3n=(a+b)  3n=(a+b) . Given a value for a  a , we can just solve b=3n−a  b=3n−a . Try values of n until you get the equation. You can do essentially the same with your second equation, is there a b such that 3|(2a+b)  3|(2a+b) ? Again you are given a  a , so just set up the equation b=3n−2a  b=3n−2a .  Try values for n until you get a solution. 41 Views · Answer requested by Alex Stone
