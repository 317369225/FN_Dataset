Why can formulas without common variables be equivalent?Usually formulas with different variables are not equivalent since when you set the variables to particular values, they give different values. That's analogous to polynomials like x 2 +3yz  x2+3yz and 3xy+z 2   3xy+z2 being different. When x=2  x=2 , y=0  y=0 , and z=1  z=1 , the value of the first is 4  4 while the value of the second is 1  1 . Some logical formulas with different variables can be equivalent if their values don't depend on those variables.  For example, (P∧Q)∨(¬P∧Q)  (P∧Q)∨(¬P∧Q) is logically equivalent to Q  Q . Although the first formula had the variable P  P in it, its value doesn't depend on the value of P  P . 273 Views · View Upvotes
