Which App can I develop using Discrete Maths?Quite a lot, In Discrete Mathematics you learn topics like Graph theory, in it you will find trees, trees are used a lot in Computer science, heard of binary trees used for fast operations? huffman codding trees used in compression? Discrete maths also plays a huge part in writing algorithms, you learn logic and how to calculate complexities of algorithms, sorting etc. Long story short in computer science you always deal with discrete data thats exactly what discrete mathematics is all about. So, behind every app theres discrete mathematics. 149 Views
