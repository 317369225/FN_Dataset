The statement (p∧(p→q))→q is tautology.How do I show that the statement p∧(p→q)∧¬q is a contradiction by using the first statement  without a truth table?The first statement is ¬(p∧(p→q))∨q  ¬(p∧(p→q))∨q Take its negation to get (p∧(p→q))∧¬q  (p∧(p→q))∧¬q , which is your second statement. Since the first statement is a tautology, its negation is a contradiction 266 Views · View Upvotes
