For an n n -digit binary number, what is the probability that the digits contain consecutive 1's?For example, for a 3 digit binary number, it has 8 possibilities, and 110,011,111 are the 3 scenarios when there is consecutive 1s.Precising answer of Alon Amit, how can we show that it's really Fibbonacci, let's have C n   Cn equal to how many there are numbers with two consecutive 1's. To calculate C n+1   Cn+1 , we realize that any number of length n+1 can be written as a number of length n with appended 1 or 0. We look at two last digits of any number of length n. So after appending 1 or 0, it can look like ......xx|0    <- appending 0 never changes number of consecutive 1's, so it gives us C n   Cn numbers in .....xx .....x0|1   <- appending 1 to such number also doesn't change number of consecutive 1's,  and we have C n−1   Cn−1 numbers with consecutive 1's in .....x .....x1|1   <- appending 1 to any number ending with 1 always gives us consecutive 1's, so we have 2 n−1   2n−1 cases like that. Summing, we have C n+1 =C n +C n−1 +2 n−1   Cn+1=Cn+Cn−1+2n−1 . Solving this recursive equation may be hard, but fortunately it's easier to solve other one: Let C ′ n   Cn′ be 2 n −C n   2n−Cn , which is a number of numbers without consecutive 1's. We then see that: C ′ n =2 n −C n =2 n −C n−1 −C n−2 −2 n−2 =2 n−1 +2 n−1 −C n−1 −C n−2 −2 n−2 =2 n−1 −C n−1 +2 n−1 −2 n−2 −C n−2 =2 n−1 −C n−1 +2 n−2 −C n−2 =C ′ n−1 +C ′ n−2   Cn′=2n−Cn=2n−Cn−1−Cn−2−2n−2=2n−1+2n−1−Cn−1−Cn−2−2n−2=2n−1−Cn−1+2n−1−2n−2−Cn−2=2n−1−Cn−1+2n−2−Cn−2=Cn−1′+Cn−2′ And we know that equation, it defines Fibbonacci sequence. 443 Views · View Upvotes
