How do i work out how many rows appear in a truth table for q ∨ p ∨ ¬s ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬t ∨ u?q ∨ p ∨ ¬s ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬t ∨ u I am a 16 year old learning discrete maths from rosen's book and i don't understand this question. The answer says 64, how does one work something like this out.The math goes like this. You take the amount of possibilities for each variable, and then multiply them all together. In the case of a truth table, each variable can either be true or false. This makes two possibilities. The negation doesn't change the rows but would change how many columns you have in the end. As there are six variables, each with two possible outcomes, this makes 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 outcomes. This multiplies to 64. More on this is explained with combinations, which is a later chapter. 200 Views
