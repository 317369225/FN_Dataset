What is logical equivalence in discrete structures?Informally, two propositional expressions are considered to be logically equivalent if they mean the same thing. In logic, this means that the expressions are either both true or both false. For instance, consider this propositional expression, "George Washington was the first US President and Abraham Lincoln was the 16th US President." Now consider this one. "Abraham Lincoln was the 16th US President and George Washington was the first US President." These are different propositional expressions but they mean the same thing. In logic we'd write that for any propositions, P and Q, P∧Q⇔Q∧P  P∧Q⇔Q∧P . This is read as, "P and Q is logically equivalent to Q and P". There are an infinite number of logical equivalences, so forgive me for not writing them all down. Formally, you can define two propositional expressions to be logically equivalent if their truth tables are the same. Logical equivalences have counterparts in other areas of mathematics. For instance, you're probably familiar with the commutative law of addition. One form is, "If x and y are natural numbers then x + y = y + x". These mathematical expressions are considered equivalent because x + y always has the same value as y + x. 201 Views · Answer requested by Sara Mughal
