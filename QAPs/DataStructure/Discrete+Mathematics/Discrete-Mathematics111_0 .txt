What is discrete mathematics and why is it so important for computer science?I am only a highschool student so excuse my ignorance. I see discrete mathematics almost in all Computer Science programs, so what is it exactly? And why is it specifically so important for Computer Science?Discrete mathematics is very simple really. It just means that we’re only talking about whole numbers, or more accurately, things that can be counted. So 0, 1, 2 and 3 are all part of discrete mathematics. The same goes for -1, -2, -3 and so on. How about 1.3, 36.9, -9.99 or 3.14? Well, they do not exist when talking about discrete mathematics. They are simply ignored. This actually makes the math much easier. Example Say you want to add up everything that exists between 0 and 5. In continuous mathematics (the opposite of discrete), the calculation would go like this: ∫ 5 0 xdx=[12 ∗x 2 ] 5 0 =5 2 2 −0=12.5  ∫05xdx=[12∗x2]05=522−0=12.5 In discrete mathematics, the equivalent calculation would go like this: ∑ i=0 4 x i =0+1+2+3+4=10  ∑i=04xi=0+1+2+3+4=10 So you see, the latter is much simpler. You just add all the numbers. Graphically, it would amount to this, where the continuous sum is the area below the red line while the discrete sum is the area below the blue line. Another continuous function (sine wave) may look like this: …while a discrete function (square wave) might look like this: I can tell you that the math behind the last one is a lot simpler. Why is it important for computer science? In the world of computers, all the information is stored in bits, units of information that can take the value of either 0 or 1. It’s not like in nature, where something can take all the values in between 0 and 1 as well. Instead, everything is binary. Since the bits are the building blocks of everything that happens in computer software, everything becomes discrete. For instance, the hard drive on the laptop I’m using right now can store 1 845 074 329 600 bits of information. Not 1 845 074 329 599.99, but exactly that number. You can’t have half a bit. The study of algorithms is also firmly in the discrete world. An algorithm is a step-by-step list of instructions to the computer and it’s what makes computer programs possible. When determining how much time an algorithm needs to run, you count the number of operations it needs to perform. Notice the word count. Again, discrete mathematics. Discrete mathematics is the very foundation of computer science. Don’t believe anyone who tells you differently. 1.6k Views · View Upvotes
