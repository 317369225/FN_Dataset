How is Discrete Math related to cryptology?The answer given by Shai Simonson gives a nice example of discrete mathematics in RSA. I’ll give some other examples, without going into details. El-Gamal encryption and Diffie-Hellman key exchange are based on the discrete logarithm problem: stating that in some algebraic groups computing an exponent is easy, yet doing the inverse is very hard. Goldwasser-Micali and Paillier encryption are based on quadratic residuosity theory. McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems are based on coding theory, and particularly syndrom decoding problems. Elliptic Curve Cryptography is based on the fact that you can use the points on certain algebraic curves to construct special algebraic groups in which the discrete logarithm problem is especially hard. Lattice-based cryptography uses discrete lattices to create post-quantum secure cryptosystems. They are generally based on the shortest vector problem, the closest vector problem and the learning-with-errors problem. Shamir Secret Sharing, and most threshold encryption schemes are based on Lagrange interpolation over finite fields. Extensions have been built on matroid theory. Most symmetric algorithms (AES, SHA2, etc.) are defined as operations over finite fields (e.g. words of 128 bits). 258 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
