How many reflexive relations in a set having 'n' elements?Let’s say a set A contains n elements. A (binary) relation on a set A is a collection of ordered pairs of elements of A. In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product A 2 =A×A  A2=A×A Hence, the number of possible order pairs is n 2 .  n2. For a given relation R every element of A^2 could either be present or not. The total number of possible relations are 2 n .  2n. For a relation to to be reflexive all the ordered pairs (i,i)fori=1,2,…,n  (i,i)fori=1,2,…,n must be present. The remaining n 2 −n  n2−n can either be present or not. Which gives us 2 n 2 −n   2n2−n possible relations. 174 Views · Answer requested by Rajesh Kumar
