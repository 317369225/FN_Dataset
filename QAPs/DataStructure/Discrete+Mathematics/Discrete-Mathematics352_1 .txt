How do I write "only prime number that can only be divided by itself and one" and I can only use these predicates : H(x, y) is x/y=integer(x mod y=0), S(x, y) is x=y, and P(x) is x is prime number?My guess is : ∀x∀y(~S(x, 1)^(~S(x, y)^~S(y,1)→~H(x, y))→P(x)) But I can't check if it's true or falseWouldnt your efforts be more efficiently utilized, if the above problem was substituted with real-life problems that need to be resolved urgently. for eg. 'How do i ensure that all humans are provided with adequate nourishment and living facilities, without causing the elite to make significant compromises to their objective of wealth and power accumulative growth' 58 Views
