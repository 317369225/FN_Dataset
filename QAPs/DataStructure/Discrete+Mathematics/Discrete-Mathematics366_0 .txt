What is the history of discrete mathematics?The term "Discrete Mathematics" is probably best defined as the areas of math, that don't deal with real numbers - it deals with a variety of areas in which the the values are not continuous, such as integers or logic. The usual sequence of math in high school and college mainly was a calculus sequence. As computers became more important, and because computers work with binary numbers and computer instructions are not executed continuously (meaning that they are executed one instruction at a time) discrete math topics became more important. So in a sense discrete mathematics encompasses a variety of areas, not neccesarily related, that are important in computer science, and later, many other fields. At the university level, books on discrete mathematics started coming out around 1980, and since then the topics covered have been somewhat standardized. Here are just some of the topics covered: - logic - set theory - functions - recursion - proofs - number theory - combinatorics (counting) - graph theory - tree theory - finite state machines - cryptography - the theory of computation Other than the importance of these topics, I have found that students who learn discrete mathematics improve their ability to think. And that is REALLY important. 594 Views
