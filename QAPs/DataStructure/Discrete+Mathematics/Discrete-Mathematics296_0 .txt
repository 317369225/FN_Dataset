What's the best way to think about f(g(f −1 (x)))  f(g(f−1(x))) ?You should think of f(g(f −1 (x)))  f(g(f−1(x))) as doing just what g  g does, except on a renamed version of the underlying set, where f  f supplies the renaming. Example? Sure. Let S  S ={1,2,3}  ={1,2,3} be a set, and let T  T ={A,B,C}  ={A,B,C} be another set. Imagine that g  g is some function that does things to the elements of S  S , for instance perhaps g(1)=3,g(2)=3,g(3)=1  g(1)=3,g(2)=3,g(3)=1 . Let f  f be a "renaming" function which maps each element of S  S to an element of T  T , for instance f(1)=A,f(2)=B,f(3)=C  f(1)=A,f(2)=B,f(3)=C . Now define a new function g ′   g′ to be g ′ (x)=  g′(x)= f(g(f −1 (x)))  f(g(f−1(x))) . First of all, what does g ′   g′ act on? Well, it operates on T  T . If you start with some x  x in T  T , you see that f −1   f−1 maps it back to S  S , then g  g does whatever it does to it, and finally f  f maps the result back to T  T . In fact, you should observe that g ′   g′ acts on T  T in "the same way" as g  g acts on S  S . Just like g  g throws both 1  1 and 2  2 to 3  3 and maps 3  3 back to 1  1 , so does g ′   g′ throw A  A and B  B to C  C and maps C  C back to A  A . In this sense, g ′   g′ is just the same as g  g , operating on renamed versions of the elements of the space. 9.1k Views · View Upvotes
