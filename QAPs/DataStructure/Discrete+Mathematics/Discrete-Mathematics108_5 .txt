What is a bijective function ℕ → ℚ?A one-to-one correspondence with no repeats. (p.s. please don't use really complex maths i don't have any advanced knowledge).A one-to-one correspondence from N to Q is easily constructed from the Calkin–Wilf sequence, i.e., a breadth-first traversal of the Calkin–Wilf tree, which generates a list of all positive rationals, without any duplicates. Two such lists provide a map to all non-zero rationals, and since there is a bijection between N and 2N, that gives a map from N to all non-zero rationals. Including zero is done with a trivial shift in the mapping to make room for one more element. 329 Views · View Upvotes
