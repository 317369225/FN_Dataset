What is the difference between an inclusive or and an exclusive or?Unlike inclusive OR, aka OR, the exclusive OR operation, aka XOR, can be used to swap the values of two binary numbers without the need of a third temp variable. Let's say X and Y are two n-bit binary memory registers and you now want X to hold the bit sequence in Y and you want Y to hold the bit sequence in X. But things are really tight and you have no other register to hold the original X in while you put Y in X so you can then put the original X into Y. What actually works is this: 1) X := X XOR Y 2) Y := Y XOR X 3) X := X XOR Y Source: XOR swap algorithm 4 Views  Answer requested by Richard Shatz
