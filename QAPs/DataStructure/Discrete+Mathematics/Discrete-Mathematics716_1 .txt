What order does a loop give a node in graph theory?A topological ordering can only exist if the directed graph is acyclic so since a loop could be thought of as a cycle of size 1 a topological ordering is not possible. If by order you're referring to degree of a node then a loop adds two to the degree of a node in an undirected graph. For a directed graph a loop gives one to the out degree and one to the in degree of the node. 36 Views
