How can I express this in FOL?if Bob loves everyone that Mary loves, and Bob loves David, then Mary doesn’t love David. How can this be properly expressed? I have been trying it for quite a while. I appreciate the help.  ( FOL stands for First Order Logic).Using b for Bob, m for Mary, d for David, and Lxy for "x loves y," we get (∀x(Lmx→Lbx)∧Lbd)→¬Lmd  (∀x(Lmx→Lbx)∧Lbd)→¬Lmd . Note that this sentence is neither a theorem nor a contradiction in classical FOL. 268 Views · View Upvotes
