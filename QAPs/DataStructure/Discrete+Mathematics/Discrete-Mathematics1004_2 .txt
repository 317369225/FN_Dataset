What is the intuitive explanation for p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r)  p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r) ?Intuitive, eh? Those symbols are as simple as the algebra ever gets, so if you don't find that intuitive, more algebra won't help. Try a concrete example. p = egg is from a robin q = egg is painted with blue dye r = egg is blue All robin eggs are blue* === p implies r All eggs painted blue are blue === q implies r Eggs from robin and/or painted blue are blue === (p or q) implies r Logical-or allows "both" to be true, so you could paint a blue robin egg with blue paint, and it would still be blue. * In real life robin's eggs aren't always blue, but for the purposes of this example, let's ignore that. 264 Views  View Upvotes
