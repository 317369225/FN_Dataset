Let S be the set of all strings with 0's and 1's. Define f : S → Z(nonnegative) s.t f(s)=the length of s, for all s∈S. Is f onto?Prove or disprove.It is onto. But, any ideas on how one can show it?I agree that it's trivially onto, but it doesn't hurt to prove it anyways. You can definitely S inductively as the smallest set containing the empty string, 0,1, and closed under concatenation. Then you can prove the subjectivity of f by induction. Given n, choose a string of length n-1 and stick a 0 on the end to get one of length n. 16 Views  Answer requested by Prabh Sodhi
