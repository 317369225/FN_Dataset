How many reflexive relations in a set having 'n' elements?Let us first understand how to count the total number of relations on a set A  A containing n  n elements. A relation is simply a subset of the cartesian product A×A  A×A . If A={a 1 ,a 2 ,....,a n }  A={a1,a2,....,an} , then                 A×A={(a 1 ,a 1 ),(a 1 ,a 2 ),....,(a 1 ,a n ),  A×A={(a1,a1),(a1,a2),....,(a1,an),                                    (a 2 ,a 1 ),(a 2 ,a 2 ),....,(a 2 ,a n ),  (a2,a1),(a2,a2),....,(a2,an),                                    ....                                    (a n ,a 1 ),(a n ,a 2 ,)....,(a n ,a n )}  (an,a1),(an,a2,)....,(an,an)} Clearly, this set of ordered pairs contains n 2   n2 such pairs. We can construct an arbitrary subset of this set in 2 n 2    2n2 ways. This will be the total number of possible relations on A  A . Now, we want to count the number of reflexive relations. Recall that a relation R  R on A  A is reflexive if (x,x)∈R  (x,x)∈R , ∀x∈A  ∀x∈A . So we have to construct subsets of A×A  A×A such that they must include all n  n diagonal pairs in the above cartesian product. But you have a choice as to whether or not to include all the remaining n 2 −n  n2−n ordered pairs. Since there are two choices for each of those (include/exclude), it gives us a total of 2 n 2 −n   2n2−n reflexive relations on A  A . In a similar manner, try to to calculate the number of possible symmetric relations on A  A as well! 2k Views · View Upvotes
