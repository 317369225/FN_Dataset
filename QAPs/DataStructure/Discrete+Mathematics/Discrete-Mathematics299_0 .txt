How do I verify a well-formed formula in propositional logic and first order logic?I assume that you want to verify whether a given formula is a tautology. I'll consider mostly the cases of propositional parts of the most popular logics. Classical logic and logics of Jan ≈Åukasiewicz For the case of propositional logic one can use truth tables and for the case of classical FOL one usually uses the method of analytic tableaux. Intuitionistic logic When working with propositional intuitionistic logic one can use a special deciding procedure described by Gentzen in his Investigations into logical deduction. The book (along with his other works) is (as far as I know) available online, so you are encouraged to search for yourself. After all, it is one of the most important works in proof theory. Relevance logic Relevance logic can be presented as a four-valued logic, so one simply uses truth tables. Here is a funny tool to construct truth tables for classical logic: Truth Table Generator. 71 Views
