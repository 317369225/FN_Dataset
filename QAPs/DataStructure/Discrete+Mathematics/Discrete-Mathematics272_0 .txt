What does this notation for satisfiability of compound propositions for solving a given Sudoku puzzle in discrete mathematics mean?The second sentence uses the notation ∨ 9 j=1 p(i,j,n)  ∨j=19p(i,j,n) . This is an abbreviation for p(i,1,n)∨p(i,2,n)∨⋯∨p(i,9,n)  p(i,1,n)∨p(i,2,n)∨⋯∨p(i,9,n) , where each ∨  ∨ represents a disjunction (logical or). So the expression R(i,n)=∨ 9 j=1 p(i,j,n)  R(i,n)=∨j=19p(i,j,n) means row i  i contains the number n  n if the first cell in the row contains the number or the second cell contains the number or etc. The sentence you quote does the same thing, but with a conjunction: R(i)=∧ 9 i=1 ∨ 9 n=1 p(i,j,n)=∧ 9 n=1 R(i,n)=R(i,1)∧R(i,2)∧⋯∧R(i,9)  R(i)=∧i=19∨n=19p(i,j,n)=∧n=19R(i,n)=R(i,1)∧R(i,2)∧⋯∧R(i,9) . In other words, a row i  i is valid if it contains a 1 and it contains a 2 and...etc. The next sentence does this again to assert that all rows meet this criterion by adding another layer of iterated conjunctions: ∨ 9 i=1 ∨ 9 n=1 ∨ 9 j=1 p(i,j,n)=∨ 9 i=1 R(i)  ∨i=19∨n=19∨j=19p(i,j,n)=∨i=19R(i) , meaning that the Sudoku puzzle is (potentially valid) if the first row contains all 9 digits, the second row contains all 9 digits, etc. Exercise 65 is relatively simple, as the problem is symmetrical in rows and columns. Exercise 66 is more tricky, but shouldn't be that hard. 117 Views · View Upvotes
