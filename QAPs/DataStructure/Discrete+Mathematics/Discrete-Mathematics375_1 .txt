Why can't I express syllogism about Socrates using propositional logic?The classical syllogism is an inference rule that involves universal quantification. If P  P and Q  Q are predicates, the syllogism reads If ∀x.P(x)⇒Q(x)  ∀x.P(x)⇒Q(x) holds and P(a)  P(a) holds, then Q(a)  Q(a) holds. In the famous example about Socrates, the predicate P  P is defined by P(x)  P(x) if x  x is a man and the predicate Q  Q is defined by Q(x)  Q(x) if x  x is mortal. Quantification is not part of the language of propositional logic. 130 Views · View Upvotes
