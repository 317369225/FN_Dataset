What's the difference between discrete mathematics and combinatorics?Discrete Mathematics covers many topics such as logic, set theory, proofs, functions, recursion, recurrence relations, number theory, combinatorics, graph theory, tree theory, finite state automata, etc. One of the topics is combinatorics. This topic essential means 'counting'. Here's an example of a problem in combinatorics: How many 8-character passwords are there that can use upper and lowercase letters, digts, and 5 special characters? 148 Views  View Upvotes
