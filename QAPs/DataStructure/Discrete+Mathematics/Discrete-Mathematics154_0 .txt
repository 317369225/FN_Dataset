Given a circle with many small circles inside, how can I prove that a line must intersect many small circles?Exact question: Given is a circle C with diameter 3 and some smaller circles, each fully inside C. The sum of the diameters of the smaller circles is 25. Prove that for each line p in the circle's plane there is a line q parallel to p such that q passes through at least 9 of the smaller circles.By symmetry, it is enough to show that there is a horizontal line with the required property. Replace each small circle by its vertical diameter. Clearly, a horizontal line intersects a small circle iff it intersects that segment. Project all those line segments onto the vertical diameter of the large circle. As the large diameter is 3 and the sum of smaller diameters is more than 3*8, some point on the large diameter has to be covered by at least 9 small diameters. A horizontal line through that point has the desired property. 664 Views  View Upvotes
