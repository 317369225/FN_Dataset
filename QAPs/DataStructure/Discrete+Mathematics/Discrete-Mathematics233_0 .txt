How do I use the pumping lemma to prove that A=a 2 n  |n≥0  A=a2n|n≥0 is not a regular language?Note: that a 2 n    a2n means a string of 2 n   2n "a's"Let the pumping length be n n , and suppose that you have the string w=a2n+k w=a2n+k . Now if A A is regular, when we divide the string into w=xyz w=xyz , we should be able to put any number of y y 's, and still have a string in our language. But the next largest string is a2n+k+1. a2n+k+1. For a large enough value of k k , these will be too far apart, so xyyz xyyz will not be in the language. (Proof for the appropriate value of k k left to the reader.) Therefore, the language is not regular. 321 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
