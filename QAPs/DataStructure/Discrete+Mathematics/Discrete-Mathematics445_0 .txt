What is Norman Wildberger's problem with real numbers?These are some of Wildberger’s ideas, which are very insightful. Nobody is doing foundations. This is very true and there should be more. It is also true that those mathematicians who are doing foundations have little ability to publish their research. In teaching, the norm is to drill in the "how to" technical part of mathematics before teaching the "Why" that creates intuitive understanding. Extremely large numbers are qualitatively different from common numbers. Infinity is unmeaning. Infinite sets are not real/do not exist. That something does not exist is not a reason why mathematicians should avoid it. We do not need to use existing sets because we can easily construct our own. Technically an actual existing infinite set should be defined as any object x in the physical universe such that there exists an isomorphism to the set of natural numbers f:x→N  f:x→N . In other words, there is a process (such as a computer program) by which every element u of the set x can be caused to exist. It is not necessary that the entire set be able to exist at the same time. Alternatively you could define existence in terms of the existence of classification functions. MemberQ[x,u]:=Module[{a=1},While[a<u,a=2^a];Return[If[a===u,True,False]]]; This function always returns an answer in finite time, and it describes an infinite set {1,2,4,8,16,32,…}  {1,2,4,8,16,32,…} . It can easily be proven that this set is isomorphic to N. Or we could argue that a set would exist if every one of its elements could exist. Let S be the set of all finite sets that do exist. If S does belong to itself then S is an infinitely deep finite set that exists. If S does not belong to itself then we have an infinitely big set that exists. Let M be the multiset of all objects belonging to finite existing sets, with multiplicity of x being the number of finite existing sets x belongs to. Formal power series are infinite sequences of integers together with some algebraic operations that can be performed on them. They can be added together like numbers. They can be multiplied, and some of them have reciprocals. They can be composed like functions, and some of them have compositional inverses. All of these operations can be enumerated explicitly as actions on infinite sequences of integers, using the language of finite sets. Exponential formal power series are written as infinite series of the form f(x)=∑ ∞ n=0 a n x n n!   f(x)=∑n=0∞anxnn! , and people who do not understand them in the formal sense can can still try to work with them informally as functions. The following identity between two formal power series is true without qualification. ∑ ∞ n=0 x n =11−x   ∑n=0∞xn=11−x Here the left-hand side is the exponential formal power series with sequence of coefficients a n =n!  an=n! , while the right-hand side is the multiplicative inverse of the exponential formal power series 1−x  1−x . If you misinterpret this as an equation where the left-hand side is a function whose image at x is the limit of the sequence of partial sums of the infinite series, then it is only conditionally true for certain numbers x and not others. For example it is true for x=1/2  x=1/2 but not for x=2  x=2 because in the latter case we would have 1+2+4+8+...=−1  1+2+4+8+...=−1 which of course is nonsense. A great example of the unique technology of formal power series is Euler’s pentagonal number theorem. Consider the formal power series, f(x)=∏ ∞ n=1 (1−x n ).  f(x)=∏n=1∞(1−xn). Euler proved that its coefficients are all 0, -1, or 1, depending on whether the index is a pentagonal number. f(x)=1−x−x 2 +x 5 +x 7 −x 12 −x 15 +x 22 +x 26 −x 35 −x 40 +x 51 +x 57 −x 70 −x 77 +x 92 +x 100 +⋯  f(x)=1−x−x2+x5+x7−x12−x15+x22+x26−x35−x40+x51+x57−x70−x77+x92+x100+⋯ Euler’s theorem has a generalization, involving “strict trees” on integer partitions [1]. The following is a summary of my recent encyclopedia entry, A273873: Number of strict trees of weight n. A strict tree t is either (case 1) a positive integer t = n, or (case 2) a set t = {t1, t2, ..., tk} of two or more strict trees (i.e. branches) with distinct weights, where the weight of a strict tree in the second case is the sum of the weights of its branches; hence the multiset of weights is a strict integer partition of n. For example, {{{{{2,1},1},2},3},{4,{2,1}},{2,1},1} ... (more)
