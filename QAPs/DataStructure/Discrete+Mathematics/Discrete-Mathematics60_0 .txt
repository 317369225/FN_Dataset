What are irreducible polynomials over GF(2)?I’ll talk more generally about finding irreducible polynomials in F_p[x]. The idea is that the process is similar to the sieve of Eratosthenes. You list out the monic polynomials degree-by-degree, and cross out those which are products. Since you are interested in F_2, we’ll now specialize to that. For F_2[x], the monic polynomials of degree 1 are x and x+1, both of which are irreducible. The monic polynomials of degree 2 are x^2, x^2+1, x^2+x, and x^2+x+1. Since x^2, x^2+1, x^2+x all have roots in F_2, they can be written as products of x and x+1. Hence x^2+x+1 is the only irreducible polynomial of degree 2 in F_2[x]. For degree 3, the polynomial p(x) must not have any linear factors. This means that p(0)=p(1)=1, and we see that x^3+x^2+1 and x^3+x+1 are the only irreducible polynomials of degree 3. You can progress on in the demonstrated manner. But this is clearly not very efficient, if you want to determine all irreducible polynomials of degree < n for large n. Let p(x) be a polynomial of degree 4. It’s irreducible if it has no linear or quadratic factors. As above, we still need p(0)=p(1)=1. The polynomial must have an odd number of terms (why?) Since there are 2^4=16 polynomials of degree 4, we can rule out 12 of them by this simple analysis, so there are only four left. Now, we have only one irreducible polynomial of degree 4, so the only polynomial left that we need to eliminate that hasn’t already been eliminated is (x^2+x+1)^2 = x^4+x^2+1. The other three are irreducible. Namely, x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1, x^4+x^3+1, and x^4+x+1. Now that we know what the irreducible polynomials of degree 3 are, we can use similar analysis to determine the irreducible polynomials of degree 5, and so on. Exercise: what are the irreducible monic polynomials of degree 2 in F_3[x]? (I’m giving this particular question as an exercise because the answer’s there for you to check on p. 373 of Artin’s book.) 483 Views · View Upvotes
