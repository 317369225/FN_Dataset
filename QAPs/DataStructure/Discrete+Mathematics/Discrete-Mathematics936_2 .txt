Why is graph theory important?Because graphs can be used to model different scenarios, particularly when referring to Computer Science. For example, routing algorithms work as if the network was a graph, Finite State Machines are represented as graphs, logic formulas can be represented as graphs (OBDD). In the latter case, this representation makes it possible to compare two formulas and tell instantly if they are equivalent or not. tl;dr: graph theory has a shit ton of applications in Computer Science. 363 Views
