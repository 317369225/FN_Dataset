How powerful is graph theory in solving world problem such as qualifying new drug trial on diverse population?Some might wonder how on earth does graph theory have any relation to epidemiology. Here is one possible application: Suppose the human race is on the brink of an antibiotic apocalypse, when the overuse of vaccines and antibiotics have led to the natural selection of super bacteria that are resistant to all known treatment. Let's say that your company has finally invented a new drug that it needs to distribute to all major cities of the world in a single roundtrip by plane, with a severe time constraint that prevents you from reaching all the cities that you want to visit; plus, prior to making the trip you don't even know whether any particular city is safe to land in (the bacteria have some probabilit of mutating into an untreatable form in some cities during your trip); and furthermore you need to travel by the shortest distance because you have limited fuel. Tough luck, yes? Luckily, graph theorists and researchers in operations theory have been studying this exact problem since at least the 1980s, and the situation I outlined above is a classic instance of the Probabilistic Time Constrained Traveling Salesman Problem. What we know so far is that this exact optimisation problem is NP-hard, roughly meaning that a polynomial-time solution may not exist (if the number of cities increases by a factor x, the time to find an exact solution grows by a lot more than x). However, efficient approximation solutions have been found that are at most 2 times worse than the optimal solution, at least for the simple case where we have no time constraints and no probability involved. That is the classic Traveling Salesman Problem, another famous example in graph theory. 207 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Bon Chue
