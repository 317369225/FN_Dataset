Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y)))  Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y))) equivalent?It is my understanding that the quantifiers can go all at the beginning since they apply to the whole statement, but the textbook keeps showing the latter version with the quantifier in the middle. I would like to know if my way is okay since that is how I understand it better.No, they're not equivalent. Let's break them down part by part. The first says, in English, "there exists some x such that for all y if S(x) is true AND F(y) is true, then A(x,y) is not true." So essentially, it says that there is some number/element/anything x such that, for all y (all of them in whatever set; all. period. all), whenever S(x) is true and whenever F(y) is true (remember, for all of the y's, it implies that A(x,y) is not true. Meaning this statement can evaluate to true when: 1) S(x) is false or F(y) is false or both; because if the left side of an implication is false, the statement always evaluates true. Because only true can imply anything. You can never have F -> T. The second says, in English, "there exists some x such that S(x) is true AND, for all-y if F(y) is true, then A(x,y) is not true." This means that the statement in parentheses evaluates to false any time S(x) is false; but that clearly goes against what we said for the first statement: "this statement can evaluate to true when: 1) S(x) is false or F(y) is false or both." And the reason is that if either part of an AND expression in false, the statement is false. To further convince yourself, construct a truth table. A truth table is a valid proof :-) 158 Views  View Upvotes
