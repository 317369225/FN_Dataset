Is it allowable in logic to take a conditional, change to its contrapositive form, and prove it by contradiction?Yes, but this does not offer anything new. To prove P implies Q by contradiction, you assume P and not Q, and try to get a contradiction. The contrapositive is (not Q) implies (not P), so the negation of the contrapositive is (not Q) and not (not P), which is clearly the same thing as P and not Q. In particular, in the end you are making the exact same assumptions, so you might as well stick with contradiction or contraposition. 64 Views  Answer requested by Patrick Lank
