What are the applications of discrete mathematics and database systems in computer engineering?In my uni, computer engineering students study discrete mathematics, data structures, database and software engineering. Discrete math could be used for digital circuits and AI, but what are some applications of database in computer engineering?Do you still remember the ER model in database? Do the operations like union, projection, and so on look similar to the operations in set theory? 158 Views  View Upvotes
