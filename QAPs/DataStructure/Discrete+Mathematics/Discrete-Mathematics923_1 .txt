What are some interesting results in graph theory?Let G be any digraph with vertex set V (loops are allowed, but not multiple edges). The complement Ḡ is a digraph with an edge from v to w if and only if G does not contain such an edge. A path or cycle on G is a subdigraph that is a (directed) path or cycle digraph. Paths and cycles are never allowed to use the same vertex twice (that is, no two arrows can point to or from the same vertex). A path may be an isolated vertex; a cycle may be a loop. A path or cycle passing through every vertex is said to be Hamiltonian. A cycle-cover is a subdigraph that is a union of disjoint cycles and such that every vertex is contained in some cycle. A digraph G, a Hamiltonian path on G, and a cycle cover of G: That a permutation can be represented either as a word or as a collection of cycles is one of the most broadly exercised combinatorial devices, and graphically, this may be regarded as a correspondence between Hamiltonian paths and cycle-covers. Interestingly, such a correspondence exists even if the arrows of the Hamiltonian paths and cycle-covers are restricted by an acyclic digraph. An acyclic digraph G and its complement Ḡ (first row), the seven Hamiltonian paths on Ḡ (second row), and the seven cycle-covers of Ḡ (third row): A sketch of a direct bijective proof of the Theorem: 922 Views · View Upvotes
