Can you solve the equation x 2 −1=2(y+z)+y 2 −12z   x2−1=2(y+z)+y2−12z over the positive integers?Fortunately x  x does not appear more than one place.  That means we can recast the equation as a quadratic diophantine in 'y' and 'z': 4z(y+z)+(y 2 −1)=2z(x 2 −1)  4z(y+z)+(y2−1)=2z(x2−1) 4z 2 +4zy+y 2 −2(x 2 −1)z−1=0  4z2+4zy+y2−2(x2−1)z−1=0 You can find general methods to solve this hyperbola demonstrated here: https://www.alpertron.com.ar/MET... Now, this method is somewhat complicated (but can be automated--- there are several software packages available.)  Let's see if we can't come up with a simpler way.  We can rewrite the equation above as: (2z+y) 2 =2z(x 2 −1)+1  (2z+y)2=2z(x2−1)+1 So, any time 2z(x 2 −1)+1  2z(x2−1)+1 is a square, some integer value of y will satisfy this equation.   We can easily find some trivial values of n 2 =2z(x 2 −1)+1  n2=2z(x2−1)+1 Say, x = 1 gives us n=1, arbitrary z.  So we have a family of solutions x=±1,y=1−2z  x=±1,y=1−2z but this didn't produce positive integers. Say we write the equation as (n+1)(n−1)=2z(x+1)(x−1)  (n+1)(n−1)=2z(x+1)(x−1) z=(n+1)(n−1)2(x+1)(x−1)   z=(n+1)(n−1)2(x+1)(x−1) Recall that y=n−2z  y=n−2z , so if 2z>n  2z>n , y  y will be negative.  That is, to find a positive integer, we need z  z to be "small" with respect to n  n .   Fortunately solutions for small values of z are easily found (and even parameterized): z = 1, x = 5, y = 5 z = 1, x = 29, y = 39 z = 1, x = 169, y = 237 z = 1, x = 985, y =1391 Wolfram Alpha link to general solution: Computational Knowledge Engine z = 3, x = 3, y = 1 z = 3, x = 7, y = 11 z = 4, x = 4, y =3 Unfortunately I am not able to parameterize the solutions further, but it seems likely for any z for which *some* solution exists, that infinitely many solutions exist. 458 Views · View Upvotes
