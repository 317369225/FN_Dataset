How can you prove that any integer x, x (x^2 - 1) (x-2) is divisible by 4 using discrete mathematics?Is it necessary to prove it using contradiction or contraposition ?X(x^2-1)(x-2)= (x-2)(x-1)(x)(x+1)....if x is an integer atleast one of x-2,x-1,x,x+1 should be divisible by 4..since these are 4 consecutive integers.. Hence the whole expression is always divisible by four for all intrgral x. 105 Views  View Upvotes
