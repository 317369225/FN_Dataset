How can I draw a complete graph of six vertices with the least amount of crossings and how do I prove it is the least?There is a (very crude) approximation that says the crossing number cn(G) (minimum number of edge crossings for a drawing of a graph in the plane) for a graph having e edges and n vertices satisfies cn(G)≥e−3n  cn(G)≥e−3n Look at that - if you can draw K6 with the number of crossings equal to that lower bound you should be good. Ack - as was pointed out to me (much more politely than I deserved to have it pointed out) in the comments, my lower bound reference is worthless here. In my coffee started head I reversed the numbers of vertices and edges. There is a conjecture that (the right is a lower bound, and the result is correct for K6) cn(G)=14 ⌊n2 ⌋⌊n−12 ⌋⌊n−22 ⌋⌊n−32 ⌋  cn(G)=14⌊n2⌋⌊n−12⌋⌊n−22⌋⌊n−32⌋ 258 Views · View Upvotes
