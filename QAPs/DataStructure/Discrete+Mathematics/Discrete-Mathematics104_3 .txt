Is the function -(x)² surjective?I’m trying to prove that R and the interval (-infinity, 0] have the same cardinality. So I’m trying to show an injection/surjection from R to (-infinity, 0], or the other way around. All I can think of to start with is y = -(x)². This seems to map from R to (-infinity, 0]. So is it surjective?You need to show that ∃  ∃ f  f : R→(−∞,0]  R→(−∞,0] , ∋  ∋ , f  f is bijective. Also, it is surjective. However, your function is not injective. Specifically, for your function, f(x)=f(−x)  f(x)=f(−x) , ∀  ∀ x  x ∈  ∈ R  R For a bijection, you need f  f , ∋  ∋ , (f is surjective) and (f is injective). Here’s how I think of this : You want a function that is a bijection from R→(0,∞)  R→(0,∞) , and then you can reflect it. f(x)=e x   f(x)=ex , ∋  ∋ , f  f : R→(0,∞)  R→(0,∞) is clearly a bijection. Reflect this function along the x-axis, and your function will be a bijection from R→(−∞,0)  R→(−∞,0) From what I think, f(x)=−e x   f(x)=−ex does the trick from R→(−∞,0)  R→(−∞,0) . Be careful with the fact that 0  0 is in a closed interval for your purposes, though. So, you have to ‘adjust’ your function for that. If f  f doesn’t have to be continuous, then such a function/s (a bijection from R→(−∞,0]  R→(−∞,0] ) exists, and I’ll leave it up to you to figure the function out. 306 Views · Answer requested by Emma Hudson
