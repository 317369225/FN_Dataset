Why is Rubik's cube considered to be the best illustration of Group Theory?First define the set G  G of all the “cube moves”(the way you can rotate a part of the cube). Then you define the binary operation of concatenation, say ∗  ∗ , then if we take elements x,y∈G  x,y∈G , if we apply ∗  ∗ to these elements, then we get x∗y  x∗y which is again one of the cube moves for example: double rotation (x∗x=x 2   x∗x=x2 , where x  x is a basic 90 degree rotation of one of the facets), rotation followed by the rotation in the opposite direction:x∗x −1 =I  x∗x−1=I (here I  I is the identity element which does nothing),… . We have that for every two elements in x,y∈  x,y∈ G,x∗y∈G  G,x∗y∈G andx −1   x−1 . With the addition that the G  G is not the null-set, we have that G,∗  G,∗ is a group. This is a great example of a group, because you can easily imagine what the group-operation does and so it’s a great way to use this as a basis when learning the more abstract parts of elementary group-theory 104 Views · View Upvotes
