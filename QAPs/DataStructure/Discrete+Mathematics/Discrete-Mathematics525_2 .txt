What is the cardinality of a set S where every finite multiset of elements of S is a member of S?This is an enumeration of the first fifty elements of such a set.If S  S is a finite set S={a 1 ,…,a k }  S={a1,…,ak} then a sub-multiset of S  S corresponds to a vector (x 1 ,…,x k )  (x1,…,xk) where x i   xi is the number of occurrences of a i   ai in the multiset. The set of such k  k -dimensional vectors is of course countable. More generally, if S  S is a set with cardinality K  K then a sub-multiset of S  S corresponds to a function f:S→N∪{ω}  f:S→N∪{ω} where f(a)=k  f(a)=k if the sub-multiset has k  k occurrences of a  a . There are K ℵ 0    Kℵ0 such functions. Now what is the cardinality of a set that is closed under the operation of finite multisets? Here we want the cardinality K  K of S  S to be equal to that of K→N∪{ω}  K→N∪{ω} . However, a moment’s thought should convince us that such an identity cannot hold for any set, since the function space operation will always produce a set of strictly greater cardinality. That is, for any sets A  A and B  B , where B  B is not a singleton set, we have that the set of functions A→B  A→B has greater cardinality than those of A  A and of B  B . (A proof of this will use diagonalization.) 329 Views · View Upvotes
