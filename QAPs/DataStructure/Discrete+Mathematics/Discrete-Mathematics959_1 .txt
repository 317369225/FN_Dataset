What is discrete geometry?Mostly geometry is conceived of as describing the properties of points and sets of points (geometric shapes) within some continuous space. However the fundamental axioms of geometry in no way demand a continuous space in which to embed these points and lines. It is perfectly possible to view geometry through the lenses of group theory and simply view lines as sets of discrete points. Provided we assign points to lines in a way consistent with the axioms of geometry, we would then have a model of geometry which is discrete instead of continuous. I will a concrete example of such a model, which is a discrete metric plane, consisting of 9 points and 12 lines : Given are 9 points, P1,P2,...,P9 P1,P2,...,P9 . Given these 9 points we will define 12 lines, l1,l2,...,l12 l1,l2,...,l12 as follows : l1={P1,P2,P3} l1={P1,P2,P3} l2={P4,P5,P6} l2={P4,P5,P6} l3={P7,P8,P9} l3={P7,P8,P9} l4={P1,P4,P7} l4={P1,P4,P7} l5={P2,P5,P8} l5={P2,P5,P8} l6={P3,P6,P9} l6={P3,P6,P9} l7={P1,P5,P9} l7={P1,P5,P9} l8={P2,P6,P7} l8={P2,P6,P7} l9={P3,P4,P8} l9={P3,P4,P8} l10={P1,P6,P8} l10={P1,P6,P8} l11={P2,P4,P9} l11={P2,P4,P9} l12={P3,P5,P7} l12={P3,P5,P7} The following figure should make this clear. Orthogonality of the lines is defined by orthogonality of the line segments in the figure. 95 Views
