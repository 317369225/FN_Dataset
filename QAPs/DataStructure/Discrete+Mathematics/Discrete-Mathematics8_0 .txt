How do you graph (x+1) (x-2) /x(x-3) (x+2)?I suppose you want to graph f:x→(x+1)(x−2)/(x(x−3)(x+2))  f:x→(x+1)(x−2)/(x(x−3)(x+2)) , which gives you this graph : fonction_rationnelle_quora It’s quite easy to prove your function goes to 0  0 as |x|  |x| goes to \infinite  \infinite only by studying degrees of polynomials (denominator’s degree is bigger than numerator, i.e. it grows way faster and their fraction quickly tends to 0  0 ). You can see your function diverges in −2  −2 , 0  0 and 3  3 as these are roots of your denominator. It’s also easy to see f(−1)=0  f(−1)=0 and f(2)=0  f(2)=0 . To see how your function looks around these, you simply look at its sign around them : for x  x just below −2  −2 , you can see x+2  x+2 , x+1  x+1 , x−2  x−2 , x  x and x−3  x−3 are negative : there’s an odd number of them which are negative, and thus f(x)  f(x) is negative. As x  x goes through −2  −2 , x+2  x+2 becomes positive, and thus becomes f(x)  f(x) for x  x just below −1  −1 , you can see x+2  x+2 is positive, while x+1  x+1 , x−2  x−2 , x  x and x−3  x−3 are negative : there’s an even number of them which are negative, and thus f(x)  f(x) is positive. As x  x goes through −1  −1 , x+1  x+1 becomes positive, thus f(x)  f(x) becomes negative for x  x just below 0  0 , you can see x+1  x+1 and x+2  x+2 are positive while x−2  x−2 , x  x and x−3  x−3 are negative : there’s an odd number of them which are negative, and thus f(x)  f(x) is negative. As x  x goes through 0  0 , x  x becomes positive, and thus becomes f(x)  f(x) for x  x just below 2  2 , you can see x+1  x+1 , x  x and x+2  x+2 are positive while x−2  x−2 and x−3  x−3 are negative : there’s an even number of them which are negative, and thus f(x)  f(x) is positive. As x  x goes through 2  2 , x−2  x−2 becomes positive, and thus f(x)  f(x) becomes negative for x  x just below 3  3 , you can see x+1  x+1 , x  x , x−2  x−2 and x+2  x+2 are positive while x−3  x−3 is negative : there’s an odd number of them which are negative, and thus f(x)  f(x) is negative. As x  x goes through 3  3 , x−3  x−3 becomes positive, and thus f(x)  f(x) 147 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Isabella-Marie Cullen
