How is it possible that we can have one to one correspondence between two infinite sets: positive integers set and positive odd integers set?Isn’t the odd set a proper subset of positive integers set? How can they have the same cardinality even if they are infinitely large?This is precisely the definition of an infinite set: A set S  S is infinite if there exists a proper subset S ′ ⊂S  S′⊂S such that there is a bijection between S ′   S′ and S  S . In the case of the set of positive integers N  N and the set of positive odd integers N odd   Nodd , the bijection f:N→N odd   f:N→Nodd is defined by f(n)=2n+1  f(n)=2n+1 It is easy to see that f  f is surjective, since a positive integer is odd precisely when it is of the form 2n+1  2n+1 for some n  n , and it is also easy to see that f  f must be injective, since m≠n  m≠n implies that 2m+1≠2n+1  2m+1≠2n+1 . The fact that there is a bijection between the set of positive integers and the set of odd positive integers did indeed strike Galileo as a paradox. See e.g. Galileo's Paradox: An Infinite Series of Square Numbers for a popular account of this. The reason why we define that arbitrary sets A  A and B  B have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between them is that this is the natural generalisation of the corresponding notion for finite sets. 460 Views · View Upvotes
