What is known about non-associative categories?As David Joyce already mentioned, deductive systems are categories without associativity required. But another thing to think about is that a one-object deductive system is the delooping of a monoid without associativity required. A cool class of examples are loops, which are abelian groups where associativity has been dropped (instead of having a multiplicative inverse for every element, we say that division is always possible, which is inequivalent in absense of associativity). So, deductive systems are like many-object versions of monoids without associativity. Functors can still be defined without any trouble, but they may fail to be associative between deductive systems. With this, deductive systems themselves form a deductibe system. I suspect it would not be difficult to put many categorical constructions in terms of deductive systems; in particular, adjoint functors seem like they should still behave well. You can from there define limits and colimits. Alternatively, there should still be an actual category of presheaves over any deductive system (since natural transformations get their associativity from the target category), and with that I think the Yoneda lemma still holds! So, there is already a lot here that can be done with deductive systems. 205 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Gus Wiseman
