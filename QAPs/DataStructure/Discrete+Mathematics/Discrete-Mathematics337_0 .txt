How do I prove the following statement by contradiction?If a, b and c are integers and a^2 + b^2 = c^2, then at least one of a and b is evenYou want to prove by contradiction that if a a , b b , and c c are integers and a2+b2=c2 a2+b2=c2 then at least one of a a and b b are even. Proof: Assume this is false. Then both a a and b b are odd. If a a is odd then a2 a2 is also odd, because an odd multiplied by an odd is odd. Similarly, if b b is odd then b2 b2 is also odd. But then a2+b2 a2+b2 would be even, because if you add two odd numbers, you get an even number. So that means c2 c2 is even. And this can only happen if c c is even. Thus, c c  can be written as c=2p c=2p for some integer p p , so c2=4p2 c2=4p2 . And so: (1) c2 c2 is a multiple of 4. Now since a a and b b are odd we can write them as: a=2k+1 a=2k+1 and b=2j+1 b=2j+1 . So, (2) c2=a2+b2=(2k+1)2+(2j+1)2=4k2+4k+4j2+4j+2 c2=a2+b2=(2k+1)2+(2j+1)2=4k2+4k+4j2+4j+2 You can see that 4 is not a factor of c2 c2 , because 4 factors out from every term on the RHS except for the last term, 2. But (1) and (2) contradict each other, because (1) says c2 c2 is a multiple of 4, and (2) says c2 c2 is NOT a multiple of 4. Thus proving that a a and b b cannot both be odd. 655 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
