What is the intuitive explanation for p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r)  p∨q→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r) ?Here is an algebraic perspective: Implication can be thought of as "exponentiation." A good way of seeing this similarity, is to consider finite sets. If we have finite sets A  A and B  B , then the number of functions A→B  A→B is equal to |B| |A|   |B||A| .  We have an evaluation map (A→B)×A→B  (A→B)×A→B , that takes any function f:A→B  f:A→B and an element of a∈A  a∈A and gives you f(a)∈B  f(a)∈B . Similarly in logic given an implication A→B  A→B and a proof of A  A , one can derive B  B . So one can intuit that this evaluation map gives one the ability to take powers with propositions where A B   AB is the proposition B→A  B→A . Also one can interpret p∨q  p∨q as a way to "add together" propositions so I'll write it as p+q  p+q , and similarly with p∧q  p∧q and multiplication.  With these analogies set up, we can write the statement (p∨q)→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r)  (p∨q)→r≡(p→r)∧(q→r) as r p+q ≡r p ×r q   rp+q≡rp×rq the familiar equation from arithmetic.
