Do discrete math and algebra have something in common?or more specifically, do these two subjects actually overlap each other?Of course. Here's one example. Let's say you have a graph where vertices represent states, and edges are labeled by transition probabilities between states. Let's say you start a random walk (Markov chain) in this graph, what's the distribution of states where you will end up after infinitely many steps? Well, you can represent the graph as an adjacency matrix M M . Then a probability of paths of length n n between a pair of nodes is simply Mn Mn . You can now go on and solve your problem, because if the distribution P P of states is stationary, then P=MP. P=MP. This is linear algebra. 317 Views  View Upvotes
