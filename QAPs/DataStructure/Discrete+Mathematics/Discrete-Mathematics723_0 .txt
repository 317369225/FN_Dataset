What is the difference between discrete mathematics and logical mathematics?As far as I know, there is no branch of mathematics called "logical mathematics".  Are you perhaps thinking of mathematical logic? Discrete Mathematics is a part of mathematics that concerns itself with mathematical objects that are not "continuous" – in some sense discrete mathematics is only defined negatively as those areas of mathematics that do not involve the real numbers and notions of continuity. Graph theory and combinatorics are important areas of discrete mathematics. Mathematical logic  is a part of mathematics that concerns itself with the study of mathematical properties systems of logic – the notions of truth and deduction as formalized in model theory and in proof theory. 242 Views · View Upvotes
