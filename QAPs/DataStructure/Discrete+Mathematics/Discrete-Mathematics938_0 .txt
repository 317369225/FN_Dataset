What are components in graph theory?In a directed graph, a connected component is a set of vertices reachable from one another. To find one, you just start from a vertex and explore (e.g. BFS) its neighborhood iteratively. A connected component can be a single vertex up to the whole graph (in which case, the graph is called connected). For directed graphs, we talk about strongly connected components, as the set of vertices such that any vertex in the set can be reached from any other in the set. For instance, a clockwise directed ring is a strongly connected component. Both the number of connected components and strongly connected components, in undirected and directed graphs respectively, can be found in linear time. For the undirected case, a BFS looping through all unexplored vertices will do. For the directed case, the algorithm is highly non-trivial, and I recommend you Wikipedia. 146 Views  View Upvotes
