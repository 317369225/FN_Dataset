How do I prove that R  R is a equivalence relation given that R=(a,b)R(c,d)⟺ad=bc  R=(a,b)R(c,d)⟺ad=bc with a,b,c,d∈R  a,b,c,d∈R ?To show that it's an equivalence relation, show that it's reflective, symmetric, and transitive. Reflexive. Show for all (a,b) (a,b) that (a,b)R(a,b) (a,b)R(a,b) . That means that ab=ba ab=ba . Is it true that ab=ba ab=ba ? Symmetric. Show for all (a,b) (a,b) and (c,d) (c,d) that (a,b)R(c,d) (a,b)R(c,d) implies that (c,d)R(a,b) (c,d)R(a,b) . Is it true that ad=bc ad=bc implies cb=da cb=da ? Transitive. Show for all (a,b) (a,b) , (c,d) (c,d) , and (e,f) (e,f) that (a,b)R(c,d) (a,b)R(c,d) and (c,d)R(e,f) (c,d)R(e,f) implies that (a,b)R(e,f) (a,b)R(e,f) . Is it true that ad=bc ad=bc and cf=de cf=de implies af=be af=be ? Warning: that last one isn't necessarily true when some of the variables are 0. 846 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Frank Tominc
