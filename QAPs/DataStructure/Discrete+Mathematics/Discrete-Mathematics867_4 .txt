How can you prove that any integer x, x (x^2 - 1) (x-2) is divisible by 4 using discrete mathematics?Is it necessary to prove it using contradiction or contraposition ?Common answer is that u take x=2k for even numbers and x=2k+1 for odd numbers. This covers whole set of integers for values of k-integer. For x=2k when inserted you get : 2k*(4k*k-1)*(2k-2) or 4*(k*(4*k*k-1)*(k-1)) clearly divisable by 4. For x=2k+1 you get (2k+1)*(4*k*k+4*k+1-1)*(2k-1) or 4*((2k+1)*(k*k+k)*(2k-1)) also divisable by 4. 63 Views  View Upvotes
