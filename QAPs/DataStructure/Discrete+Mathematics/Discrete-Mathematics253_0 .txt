How can I write the implication A=> (~B or ~C) in conjunctive normal form?You've got 3 variables, so you can use a truth table for this, it'll only need 8 rows. The question looks a bit like a homework exercise, so I'm not going to state the final answer, but we can work it out for a different expression. What you need is a set of "or" (disjunctive) clauses that each use all the variables to capture one position where the overall formula is false (and are true elsewhere), so that you can connect them with "and"s: When we've identified these clauses, the conjunctive normal form of this unspecified formula is (A or B or ~C) and (~A or B or C) and (~A or ~B or C) You can do the same thing with the implication given in the question, just work out its truth value for all 8 combinations of A, B, C, find the disjunctive clauses, and write out their conjunction. 309 Views  View Upvotes
