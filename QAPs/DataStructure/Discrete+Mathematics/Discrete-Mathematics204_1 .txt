Is discrete math (Combinatorics, Graph theory, number theory, etc.) more beautiful than continuous maths (Analysis)?The world of mathematics is often divided between discrete math and analysis. It also divided between pure math and applied math. Up until recently with the advancement of computer science, applied math was mainly analysis in my opinion. I found that for me analysis, especially diff. equations, involved a lot of memorization of formulas: I didn't like that. I'd rather derive things than look up the formula to fit the problem. It didn't seem like math to me. Discrete math seemed more abstract and math for its own sake: pure math. Things like group theory, vector spaces, number theory, and the like were more pure and beautiful to me at least. 329 Views  View Upvotes
