Where am I going wrong with the following equation? M(n)={2 M(n−1) −1,3, if n>1.otherwise.   M(n)={2M(n−1)−1,if n>1.3,otherwise. I am trying disprove the following statement: M(n) for all positive integers is prime.Littlewood conjectured that this was true, a long time ago, and could not prove it. I had a go at it, trying to prove something more general, that any Mersenne prime (not just in this sequence) would be the exponent to make another Mersenne prime, and could not prove it for the excellent reason that it is not true: 2^17 - 1 = 131071 is prime, but 2^131071 - 1 is not (I forget the factoring, but it distressed me to find it), so then I tried to prove that the problem was that 17 is a Fermat prime and that my conjecture would work in all other cases-- and eventually decided that since Littlewood was no slouch as a mathematician, a conjecture he could not prove is genuinely difficult (compare: Riemann Hypothesis; if you think you can solve that easily, bear in mind that Riemann was no dummy).  The motivating problem for asking whether it is possible to generate an infinite number of Mersenne primes is that this would settle whether there is an infinite number of "perfect" numbers. In early medieval times a certain Iamblichus argued that there must be, because perfection is an attribute of God: even in that period mathematicians criticized this argument as not proving anything and questioned whether the assertion was true. This conjecture, that there are an infinite number of perfect numbers, is the longest-standing unsolved conjecture in mathematics. 257 Views  View Upvotes
