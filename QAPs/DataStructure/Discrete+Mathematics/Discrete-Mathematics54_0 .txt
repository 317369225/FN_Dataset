Given the mean and SD for a normally distributed discrete data, is it possible to compute the probability of an event?There is no such thing as "normally distributed discrete data". The normal distribution is continuous. However, the data could be approximately normal, for example the binomial distribution with large numbers of successes and failures, and likewise for the negative binomial and the Poisson with large mean. In these cases you can estimate probabilities with just the mean and standard deviation. Actually the standard deviation in these cases is a function of the mean so if you know the mean you also know the standard deviation. 87 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
