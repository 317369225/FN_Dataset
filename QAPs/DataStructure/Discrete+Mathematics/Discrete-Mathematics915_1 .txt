How do I prove that a given function is surjective in a given interval?Being more specific, I have a set A=[−1,1]  A=[−1,1] and I have to prove that the function f:A→A  f:A→A defined byf(x)=x 3   f(x)=x3 is surjective.Another route: You can use the fact that x^3 is a polynomial function and the intermediate value theorem to show that it is surjective. 133 Views
