Has anyone solved a level 5 exercise in R. P. Stanley's "Enumerative Combinatorics"?If so, did they write a paper on it?I don't know if any [5] exercises have been solved, but certainly several [5-] exercises have been solved. As an undergrad one summer, I worked with Prof. Stanley on exercise 4.82 in EC vol. 1 (particularly part (f), which was labelled as a [5-]). We ended up solving it; you can see the resulting paper here. Interestingly, we solved it in the period of time after he published the online second edition of volume 1 but before the corresponding print edition was published, so this exercise no longer appears as unsolved in the print edition. It is now a [3] problem (which goes to show that not all level 5 exercises are necessarily that hard). 709 Views  View Upvotes
