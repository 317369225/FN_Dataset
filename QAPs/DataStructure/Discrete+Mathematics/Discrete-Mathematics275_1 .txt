How can you prove that for all real numbers x, if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational, using contradiction and contraposition?If X is rational (not irrational) then X can be expressed as a ratio of A to B (where A and B are integers). X squared is then the ratio of A squared to B squared, contradicting the premise that X squared is irrational. This proves the statement that X is irrational indirectly by proving the contraposition (that all non-irrational number can not be X). 302 Views
