What is the importance of Discrete Mathematics?The modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, in particular combinatorics and graph theory. This means that you need to learn the fundamental algorithms used by computer programming languages. Actually Discrete Mathematics is the backbone of Computer Science “Theoretical Computer Science”. It brings rational clarity to your solutions and a formal way of analysing a problem. Every field in computer science is related to discrete objects whether it is Algorithms, databases,AI, Networks,  Computer Architecture, Compilers etc. 68 Views
