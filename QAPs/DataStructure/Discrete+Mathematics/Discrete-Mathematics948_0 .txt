How can I express this in FOL?if Bob loves everyone that Mary loves, and Bob loves David, then Mary doesn’t love David. How can this be properly expressed? I have been trying it for quite a while. I appreciate the help.  ( FOL stands for First Order Logic).Using x♡y  x♡y to represent "person x  x loves person y  y ", and m  m for Mary b  b for Bob d  d for Davidwe have:      (∀x:m♡x⇒b♡x)∧b♡d⇒¬(m♡d)  (∀x:m♡x⇒b♡x)∧b♡d⇒¬(m♡d) means if Bob loves everyone that Mary loves, and Bob loves David, then Mary doesn’t love David I make no comment on the individuals involved or the validity of the logic :-) 3.9k Views · View Upvotes
