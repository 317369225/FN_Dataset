Is it ever possible to have a uniqueness quantifier with a conditional proposition?Is it ever the case that you would have  ∃x(P(x)→Q(x))  ∃x(P(x)→Q(x)) Or is that always nonsensical, because P(x)  P(x) could be False and P(x)→Q(x)  P(x)→Q(x)   could still evaluate to be True? Is that why, so far in this textbook, I'm only seeing uniqueness quantifiers with propositions that are conjunctions?Let's work within classical logic. If by "nonsensical," you mean ill-constructed, then the answer is that ∃x.P(x)→Q(x)  ∃x.P(x)→Q(x) has a well-defined interpretation, as do all closed formulae. But I think the more instructive question to ask here is whether the formula is satisfiable or valid. Clasically, P(x)→Q(x)  P(x)→Q(x) is equivalent to ¬P(x)∨Q(x)  ¬P(x)∨Q(x) , so your formula is equivalent to ∃x.¬P(x)∨Q(x)  ∃x.¬P(x)∨Q(x) . This formula is not a valid, as if our universe contains one element x  x , we can choose the predicate P  P to hold for x  x and Q  Q to not hold (thus we've found a structure that does not satisfy the formula). But also, we can find a model of this formula by simply switching the roles of P  P and Q  Q in the previous example. So this formula is satisfiable and non-trivial, as we can find both models in which it is true, as well as models in which it is not. 68 Views
