What is discrete mathematics and why is it so important for computer science?I am only a highschool student so excuse my ignorance. I see discrete mathematics almost in all Computer Science programs, so what is it exactly? And why is it specifically so important for Computer Science?Discrete thinking is essentially the foundational set of thoughts behind much of CS. Data structures and algorithms all draw from it very, very heavily. You've got conditionals, graphs, sets, logic, pretty much everything to let you think about CS from a Turing machine all the way up. Many of these are topics with far more ground to cover than just one class, but Discrete does a good job of giving you the fundamentals and lays the groundworks for a lot of comp sci. I also think Discrete math (if you can call it math) maps the most directly to CS and is a pretty easy sample course to try out if you want to see if you have an aptitude for CS. 2k Views  View Upvotes
