Can you prove O(log(n!))=O(nlogn)  O(log⁡(n!))=O(nlog⁡n) ?If I understand the question correctly we have to show it in two directions: 1) log n! < C * n log n this one is trivial, as n log n = log n^n as others already explained 2) n log n < C * log n! this one is perhaps more interesting. Observe that in expansion of n! half of elements is larger than half of n. So (n/2)^(n/2) <= n! and thus n/2 log (n/2) <= log n!. If we agree (n/2) is at least as large as say... sqrt(n), then we have n/2 log sqrt(n) <= log n!, which finally leads n/4 log n <= log n!, or n lg n < 4 * log n! 342 Views  View Upvotes
