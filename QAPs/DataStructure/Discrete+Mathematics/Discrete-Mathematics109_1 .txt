What is the actual significance of partial ordering and total ordering?Most of the systems we use in a daily basis are totally ordered. So we take it for granted. The dictionary, real numbers, rational and irrational numbers, integers - all of them are totally ordered.  Many of the nice properties of these spaces are conferred by their ordering. For instance, the completeness properties which assert the existence of infima and suprema of partially ordered sets. The familiar least upper bound property of real numbers would be meaningless without ordering. Another example is the frequently used Intermediate Value Theorem for real numbers. It can be generalised to any totally ordered set. In topology, Order topology can be induced on totally ordered sets. Many order topologies have some nice properties. For example, the ordered square ([0,1][0,1] [0,1][0,1] with dictionary order) is connected but not path connected. Partially ordered set, as the name suggests, is just a set where some elements may not be comparable by the order relation. Whereas in total order all elements are comparable. So partial order can be thought of as a generalisation of the total order. Without order, comparing becomes impossible. Comparing 1 and 2 will be like comparing apples and oranges. What we can do is to create an anti-symmetric, transitive and total relation on these objects to make them comparable i.e. apples and oranges can be compared by their number of seeds. This is a total order (induced by the order of natural numbers). 174 Views  View Upvotes
