How can I determine which binary strings belong to a specific phrase-structure grammar?Struggling with this...Say you have G = (V, T, S, P) as the phrase-structure grammar with V = {0, 1, A, B, S}, T={0, 1} and set of productions P consisting of S -> 0A, S -> 1A, A -> 0B, B -> 1A, B -> 1 What belongs to this? 10101, 11001, 0000, or 001011 ?Strings matching x0101010...101 where x can be any bit. Of your strings: only 10101 is in the language. 51 Views  Answer requested by Chris Purrone
