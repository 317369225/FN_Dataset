How do I prove that a given function is surjective in a given interval?Being more specific, I have a set A=[−1,1]  A=[−1,1] and I have to prove that the function f:A→A  f:A→A defined byf(x)=x 3   f(x)=x3 is surjective.This is probably a homework exercise.  I will just give you a hint. Just apply the definition of surjectivity.  Show that for any point x∈[−1,1]  x∈[−1,1] there is another point y∈[−1,1]  y∈[−1,1] such that f(y)=x  f(y)=x .  You can do this constructively.  The little bit of insight is that you have to verify that the constructed value of y in fact lies inside A  A . 162 Views · View Upvotes
