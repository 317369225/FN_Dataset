How do I make generalized form from a given set of expressions (Want steps/algorithm)?example : for pi/6 , pi/2 ,5*pi/6 , 3*pi/2 , etc; we can write general form (2*n +1)*pi/6Well it's really straightforward. You start by finding the LCM of all the denominators. That LCM will be the denominator of the generalized form. Now's the numerator part. You'll have to find an expression that generalizes those. In most cases I've seen, you'll get a linear expression. To test if the expression you get is linear, remember the condition: the differences of the adjacent terms must be constant. Let's take the example you have here. It's very clear that the LCM of the denominators is 6, so that's the denominator for our generalized form. Now, the numerators. Our sequence here is pi, 3*pi, 5*pi, 9*pi. Now these are simply odd numbers, where the terms 7*pi is missing. So you write (2n+1)*pi, since that's the general form of an odd number. Hope you understood :) 38 Views  View Upvotes
