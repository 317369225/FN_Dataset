What is discrete geometry?The term Discrete Geometry is usually reserved for geometric problems in ordinary continuous spaces that have a combinatorial aspect. This includes sphere packings, lattices, covering problems (e.g. Moser's worm problem), search and escape problems (e.g. Bellmans's lost in a forest problem), rigidity problems, tiling and tesselations, dissections, classification of polytopes etc. Discrete geometry covers a range of geometric topics and cannot easily be defined in a succinct way. It should be distinguished from finite geometry where e.g. real numbers are replaced by elements of the finite fields to define geometries made out of discrete objects. Graph theory or network theory is also distinct from discrete geometry, but I doubt everyone would agree on the boundaries of the subject. 137 Views  View Upvotes
