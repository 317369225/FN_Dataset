Is the function -(x)² surjective?I’m trying to prove that R and the interval (-infinity, 0] have the same cardinality. So I’m trying to show an injection/surjection from R to (-infinity, 0], or the other way around. All I can think of to start with is y = -(x)². This seems to map from R to (-infinity, 0]. So is it surjective?Hi there! While the function you describe is definitely surjective, it will not help you prove that the cardinality of R  R and the half-open interval (−∞,0]  (−∞,0] are the same. If your specific question is ‘find me such a function that is a bijection’ then other people have already hinted at a solution. However, to prove that the cardinality is equal, you can use a (non-trivial) result; if A⊆B⊆C  A⊆B⊆C and |A|=|C|  |A|=|C| then |A|=|B|  |A|=|B| . If you combine this with the proof you already have for the open interval (−∞,0)  (−∞,0) then you’re done. For a proof of the syllogism, look for instance at Introduction to Set Theory by Hrbacek and Jech, Lemma 1.7 chapter 4. 95 Views
