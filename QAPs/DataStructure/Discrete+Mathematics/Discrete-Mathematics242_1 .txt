How many distinct areas must a Venn Diagram on on N sets contain?There are two ways to parse this question. If you use circles, then he answer is roughly Nd Nd where d is the co-VC dimension of the family of all circles in the plane (which is 2 I think). I'm sorry for the extreme laziness of my answer -- Google "arrangements of circles" and similar terms until you find the exact rate at which the maximum number of regions grows. If you mean that you want some figure, possibly very messy, that includes all possible inclusion/exclusion conditions on the sets, then the answer is 2N 2N by definition. In this case it will be inexpressible using circles for N>3. 214 Views
