How many n ∈ {0,1,2...999} contain the digit 6 exactly once?And how does this differ from: “How many n contain the digit 6 at least once?”Taking numbers 0 - 999. NUMBER 6 EXACTLY ONCE ::---- 1 digit no.: 1 2 digit no.: 1×9 + 8×1 = 17 3 digit no.: 1×9×9 + 8×1×9 + 8×9×1 = 81+72+72= 225 Required no. of numbers : 243 AT LEAST ONE 6 ::---- 1 digit no.: 1 2 digit no.: 1×10 + 8×1= 18 3 digit no.: 6 at unit place: 9×10×1= 90 6 at ten's place and not at unit's place: 9×1×9= 81 6 at hundred's place but not at any other (unit or ten) place: 1×9×9= 81 Total 3 digit: 252 Required no. of numbers: 1+18+252= 271 We have 271 – 243= '28' numbers less when 6 is at exactly one place than when there is no limitations on the numbers of digit 6 between the numbers 0–999. So what are these missing numbers::--- 2 digit : 66 3 digit : 166, 266, 366, 466, 566, 666, 766, 866, 966, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 667, 668, 669, 606, 616, 626, 636, 646, 656, 676, 686, 696 68 Views · View Upvotes
