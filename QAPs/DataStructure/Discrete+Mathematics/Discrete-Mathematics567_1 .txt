What is the difference between the set of real numbers and sets of cardinality ℵ 0   ℵ0 , i.e. the set of integers, that makes the cardinality of reals bigger?Essentially, if a set has an infinite number of elements but I can create a sequence that gives back each element, then we say the set is countably infinite and has cardinality N 0   N0 . Thus, we see that the first transfinite cardinal is really defined in terms of the integers - the integers ‘have that much infinity’, so anything that we can put into 1–1 correspondence with the integers (which is what a sequence is) must also ‘have that much infinity’. This is where the rub comes in — it turns out that there is no way to create a sequence which gives us every real number. No matter how you construct the sequence, you always miss some real numbers. Thus, because we can correspond every single integer to a unique real number and still have some real numbers left over, there must be ‘more infinity’ in R  R than there is in Z  Z . And that’s really as deep as it goes without getting into bigger cardinals. Aleph null is defined as ‘the amount of infinity in the integers’ (very roughly), and aleph one is defined as ‘the amount of infinity in the reals’ (again very roughly). The continuum hypothesis, the first of Hilbert’s 23 problems, says that there is no infinity between these two; this is an undecidable statement in all widely accepted mathematical structures. 221 Views · View Upvotes
