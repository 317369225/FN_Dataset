What is meant by selfcomplementing graphs in graph theory?Let G  G be a graph. Then the complement of G  G is the graph G ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯    G¯ which contains the same vertices as G  G , but each pair of vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in G  G . A good way to think about this is by using edge subtraction: G ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯  =K n −G  G¯=Kn−G , where n=|V(G)|  n=|V(G)| A self-complementary graph is then a graph which is topologically equivalent to its complement. Here is a simple example: Self-complementary graph 121 Views
