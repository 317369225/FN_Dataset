How can I measure correlation between continuous and discrete variables?Pearson correlation is defined for any numerical variables, just as other answers say. Often these correlations have special names, such as the Point-biserial correlation, which is defined between a binary and continuous variable. The Phi coefficient is used for two binary variables. They are just Pearson correlations, however. However, these coefficients may have properties that you find objectionable. For instance, phi often has a maximum value much lower than 1 and depends highly on the marginals. 195 Views  View Upvotes
