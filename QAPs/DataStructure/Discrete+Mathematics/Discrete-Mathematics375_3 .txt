Why can't I express syllogism about Socrates using propositional logic?You need predicate logic: 1. For all x, if x is a man then x is mortal. Symbolically: ∀x:[Man(x)⟹Mortal(x)]  ∀x:[Man(x)⟹Mortal(x)] 2. Socrates is a man. Symbollically: Man(Socrates)  Man(Socrates) 3. Applying (1) and (2) with x=Socrates  x=Socrates , we have, Socrates is mortal. Mortal(Socrates)  Mortal(Socrates) 46 Views
