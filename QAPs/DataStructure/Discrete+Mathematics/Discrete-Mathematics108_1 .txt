What is a bijective function ℕ → ℚ?A one-to-one correspondence with no repeats. (p.s. please don't use really complex maths i don't have any advanced knowledge).The easiest way to find a bijection between N  N and Q  Q is the method of dovetailing as already suggested by Daniel Goldman. The diagram below makes the function f  f created by dovetailing explicit. The  numbers given in red are the natural numbers and the fraction next to a red number n  n is the value f(n)  f(n) . We see that f(1)=11   f(1)=11 and that e.g. f(8)=23   f(8)=23 . This is actually a bijection between N  N and N×N  N×N , since every rational number corresponds to infinitely many fractions. To find a formula for the bijection, note that the small diagonal no. k  k contains k  k rationals. So the first k  k small diagonals contain the images (wrt. the function f)  f) of the first ∑ k i=1 i=k(k+1)2   ∑i=1ki=k(k+1)2 natural numbers. Thus, to find the image of some n  n find the largest k  k such that k(k+1)2 ≤n  k(k+1)2≤n . This is the number of the small diagonal. The difference (n−k)+1  (n−k)+1 tells us how many steps we have to follow along the small diagonal to reach f(n).  f(n). So f(n)=(k,(n−k)+1)  f(n)=(k,(n−k)+1) where k=max{m∣m(m+1)2 ≤n}  k=max{m∣m(m+1)2≤n} 840 Views · View Upvotes
