Is the function -(x)² surjective?I’m trying to prove that R and the interval (-infinity, 0] have the same cardinality. So I’m trying to show an injection/surjection from R to (-infinity, 0], or the other way around. All I can think of to start with is y = -(x)². This seems to map from R to (-infinity, 0]. So is it surjective?The function f(x)=−x 2   f(x)=−x2 is surjective but not injective. To show that sets A  A and B  B are of the same cardinality, you need to establish a bijection between A  A and B  B . The simplest example that I can think of is f(x)=−e x   f(x)=−ex 77 Views · View Upvotes
