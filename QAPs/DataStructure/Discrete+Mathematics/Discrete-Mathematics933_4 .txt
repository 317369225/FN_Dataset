How do I write p∧(p→q))→q  p∧(p→q))→q   in disjunctive form?First you show that it is a tautology. Here goes: Two cases q is true or q is false. If q is true the anything implies q. there fore (p^(p->q)) -> q regardless of p What if q is false? The the only way for (p^(p->q)) to be true is p->1 is true and p is true. But if q is false then (p->q) true implies p is false. which means p^(p->q) is false so the main implication is true. Again no matter what p is the main implication is true. Hence we have a tautology in which case consult David Joyce answer for the rest of the mechanics. 81 Views  View Upvotes
