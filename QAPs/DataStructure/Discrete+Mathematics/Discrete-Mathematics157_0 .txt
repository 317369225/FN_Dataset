What is the difference, in layman's terms, between a symmetric and antisymmetric relation?A symmetric relation can work both ways between two different things, whereas an antisymmetric relation imposes an order. Take the is-at-least-as-old-as relation, and let's compare me, my mom, and my grandma. It stands to reason that ancestors must be at least as old as their descendants, and moreover, we are all at least as old as ourselves. We can say that my mom is at least as old as me, but we can NOT say that I am at least as old as my mom, the two of us follow an ordered sequence. In this order, we can look at a general statement like "somebody #1 is at least as old as somebody #2, AND somebody #2 is also at least as old as somebody #1". From the antisymmetry of the relation, this lets us conclude that somebodies #1 and #2 must be the same person if this statement is going to be true. That person can be me, mom, or grandma, but the relation doesn't hold both ways between distinct pairs of us. A symmetric relation, on the other hand, does work both ways. Path relations between places (well, places in an ordinary, metric space) are like this; if you can walk from home to the grocery store, then you can also walk from the grocery store and back home. There is no ranking which differentiates whether you are starting from one related element or the other, so their relation is symmetric. 345 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Chris Purrone
