Can someone help me solve this question? I can't understand the 3 different types of relations (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)We say C  C is reflexive when xCx  xCx for all x∈Z  x∈Z . We say C  C is symmetric when xCy⟺yCx  xCy⟺yCx for all x,y∈Z  x,y∈Z . We say C  C is transitive when xCy  xCy and yCz⟹xCz  yCz⟹xCz for all x,y,z∈Z  x,y,z∈Z   For all x∈Z,x≠x+2  x∈Z,x≠x+2 and x≠x−2  x≠x−2 , so C  C is not reflexive.   For all x∈Z  x∈Z , if xCy  xCy , then either y=x+2  y=x+2 or y=x−2  y=x−2 . If y=x+2  y=x+2 , then x=y−2  x=y−2 and we have yCx  yCx . If y=x−2  y=x−2 , then x=y+2  x=y+2 and we have yCx  yCx , so C  C is symmetric.   2C4  2C4 because 4=2+2  4=2+2 and 4C6  4C6 because 6=4+2  6=4+2 , but 6≠2+2  6≠2+2 and 6≠2−2  6≠2−2 , so C  C is not transitive.   C  C must be reflextive, symmetric and transitive to be a equivalence relation, but C  C is only symmetric, so C  C is not a equivalence relation. 100 Views · View Upvotes
