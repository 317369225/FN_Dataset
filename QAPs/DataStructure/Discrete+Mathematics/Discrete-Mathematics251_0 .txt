Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y)))  Is∃x∀y((S(x)∧F(y))→¬A(x,y))and∃x(S(x)∧∀y(F(y)→¬A(x,y))) equivalent?It is my understanding that the quantifiers can go all at the beginning since they apply to the whole statement, but the textbook keeps showing the latter version with the quantifier in the middle. I would like to know if my way is okay since that is how I understand it better.No, they are not equivalent. For example, if S(x) is false for every x then your first statement is always true, but your second is always false. If you parenthesize the first statement differently then they will be equivalent. 603 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Nate Hutch
