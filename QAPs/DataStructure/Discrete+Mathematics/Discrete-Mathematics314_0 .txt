In an infinite array of random integers can I find an infinite sequence of the same integer?Suppose you have, say an infinite sequence of bit-strings {0,1}^inf or an infinite array of random integers. You can clearly find any finite sequence of consecutive 1's and 0's but can you find also an infinite sequence of 1's (or 0's) or would that fall under Russell's paradox?You need to be more specific about what you mean by "random". One can easily generate a random sequence that never repeats any integer. For example, consider the sequence S  S generated by this algorithm: for i=0…∞  i=0…∞          r:=FlipCoin()  r:=FlipCoin()           If r=Head  r=Head                  S i :=2i  Si:=2i          else                 S i :=2i+1  Si:=2i+1                    424 Views · View Upvotes
