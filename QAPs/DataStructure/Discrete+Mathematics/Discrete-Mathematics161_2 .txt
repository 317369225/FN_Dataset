How do I find elements outputted by a recursive function given one output?So, I understand finding output of a sequence formula given an element, but what if it was a recursive function given: f(n)=f(n-1)/2 +4 and f(1)= 6 ?A recursive function is not a sequence of itself. Like any function, it returns a single value to the caller: f(n). Whenever a function is called, a "stack frame" is created that contains the parameters that are passed to the function (in this case n) and the "return address" - the address of the next instruction to be executed once the function returns. Once the function has returned, the stack frame that was created for it disappears. The return value of the function is not stored anywhere (unless you specifically assign it to a variable) but is used in further computations (or just returned upwards). Since a recursive function creates a new stack frame each time it calls itself, many such frames may exist while the function is executing but only the most recently created stack frame is actually in use at any one time. To generate a sequence from a recursive function, you would do it the same way that you would with any function. The fact that a function is recursive doesn't change the fact that ultimately, only a single value will be returned to the caller. 65 Views
