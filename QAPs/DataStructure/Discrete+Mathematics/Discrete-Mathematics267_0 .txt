Is it ever possible to have a uniqueness quantifier with a conditional proposition?Is it ever the case that you would have  ∃x(P(x)→Q(x))  ∃x(P(x)→Q(x)) Or is that always nonsensical, because P(x)  P(x) could be False and P(x)→Q(x)  P(x)→Q(x)   could still evaluate to be True? Is that why, so far in this textbook, I'm only seeing uniqueness quantifiers with propositions that are conjunctions?When I get to the logical implication when I teach logic, after a few sessions, I give them some predicates, and then some English sentences that they are to convert to predicate logic expressions. Let's say that the domain is the set of cats, and I give the predicates: C(x): x is cute and D(x): x is destructive. And the I ask them to express the sentence, "Some cute cats are destructive" using predicate logic symbols. A correct answer is: ∃x[C(x)∧D(x)]  ∃x[C(x)∧D(x)] . Why? This can be restated as 'there is at least one cat that is cute and destructive'. And that corresponds to the original statement. Students will invariably ask if this is correct: ∃x[C(x)→D(x)]  ∃x[C(x)→D(x)] . It sure seems like this is right. And from a purely symbolic point of view this is a well-formed expression. The only problem is that this does not properly express the original statement. Here's why. We can rewrite this expression using the 'implication equivalence' which states that B -> C is logically equivalent to ~B v C. Therefore: ∃x[C(x)→D(x)]=∃x[C ¯ (x)∨D(x)]  ∃x[C(x)→D(x)]=∃x[C¯(x)∨D(x)] . Now the right hand side is true if you can find just one cat that is not cute, or if you can find a cat that is destructive. This is far from the original statement that, "Some cute cats are destructive". So I tell my students that if they interpret a statement in the form: ∃x[P(x)→Q(x)]  ∃x[P(x)→Q(x)] , then it is does not say what they think it says. 180 Views · View Upvotes
