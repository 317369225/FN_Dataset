Is Boolean logic based only on binary transistor circuits or can it be applied to more complex physical systems?Where can I read about this stuff in more detail? (but oriented towards beginners)Digital circuits and hence the computers are super beneficiaries of Boolean Algebra. The Boolean Algebra was developed well before the emergence of computers. This Algebra exists independently of the digital field. That means it is applicable to physical systems with their subsystems showing the binary characteristics. We can also implement this logic using simple switches and electrical relays. 76 Views  View Upvotes
