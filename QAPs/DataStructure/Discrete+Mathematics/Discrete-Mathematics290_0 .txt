How is this bijection: f(x)=2−22⌈22−x ⌉−22−x −1   f(x)=2−22⌈22−x⌉−22−x−1 constructed?This is a bijection: f:(0,2)→[0,2)  f:(0,2)→[0,2) . I found this formula but I have absolutely no idea how to construct this. Can someone explain the process?In fact, you just need to construct a countable set containing 0. For example, let S={2－2^(－k),k=－1,0,1,2……}.It's obviously countable.So we can easily get a bijection from S\{0} to S.Then just let number in [0,2)\S to be identical. This a bijection form (0,2) to [0,2). And the function in the question is also constructed following this thought. 123 Views · View Upvotes
