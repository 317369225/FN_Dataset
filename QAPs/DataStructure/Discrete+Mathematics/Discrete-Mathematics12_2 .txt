What does cryptography have to do with graph theory?Algebraic graph theory is used in quite a topics of cryptography. Modern cryptography heavily relies on discrete mathematical structures. There are hash functions based on Expander graphs (sparse graph with strong connectivity), Ramanujan graphs. Boolean functions can be represented using certain graphs. By so far, at least, I know following applications of Graph Theory in Cryptography. Cryptographic hash functions from expander graphs. Zero Knowledge Proof based on Graph Theory But I am sure there is lot more nexus between graph theory and cryptography, which had been explored and being explored.
