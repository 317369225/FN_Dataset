Is temperature continous or discrete variable? When I learned thermodinamics in school it was considered continous but is it really so?Temperature is a continuous variable. It measures the average kinetic energy of molecules. the speed of these molecules can be essentially ant speed below that of light. Many thermometers are digital, and so will display a finite set of temperatures. but this does not completely represent reality. 66 Views
