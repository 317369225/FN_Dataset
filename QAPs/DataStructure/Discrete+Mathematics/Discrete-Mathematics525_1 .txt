What is the cardinality of a set S where every finite multiset of elements of S is a member of S?This is an enumeration of the first fifty elements of such a set.David Joyce’s answer is probably the most helpful if you are thinking of the “smallest set closed under finite multisets.” Then we just have finite trees with {}  {} as the only leaf element. But, the smallest such set S  S is not the only such set S  S . Take R  R as the starting set (or, if you like, some appropriate set-thoretic construction of R  R .) Then the finite multisets of R  R are functions f:R→Z  f:R→Z with finite support, that is, f(x)≠0  f(x)≠0 for only finitely many values. However, we can show (with the axiom of choice) that these functions have the same cardinality as R  R . (A quick outline: functions R→Z  R→Z with finite support correspond to finite sequence of pairs from R×Z  R×Z . Obviously |(R×Z) n |=|R|  |(R×Z)n|=|R| and if we are careful we can show that the union of all such finite sequences still has the same cardinality.) This is where my answer diverges from Hans Hyttels’, because the cardinality of the function space is not greater when it has finite support, and we start with an infinite set. So, the sets in question can be thought of as finite trees, with leaves chosen from some leaf set. Pick {}  {} or N  N as the leaf set and you get S=ℵ 0   S=ℵ0 . Pick R  R as the leaf set and you get S=|R|  S=|R| , or S=ℵ 1   S=ℵ1 if you feel that way about CH. But you could also pick a larger set as the leaf set and get a still larger S. 394 Views · View Upvotes
