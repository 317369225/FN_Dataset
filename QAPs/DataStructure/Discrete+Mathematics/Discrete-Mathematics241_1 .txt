For any string w = w1w2   wn, the reverse of w, written wR, is the string w in reverse order, wn   w2w1. If language A is regular, is AR?For any language A, let AR ={wR| w E A}. Show that if A is regular, so is AR.Yes. If a language L is regular, then the language containing the reverse of the strings in L, call it LR is also regular. First, consider some examples of regular languages, and their 'reverses'. Suppose L = { binary strings that start with a 0 and end in 11 } Then LR = { binary strings that start with 11 and end in a 0 } Suppose L = { binary strings that have 011 as a substring } Then LR = { binary strings that have 110 as a substring } Suppose L = { binary strings that have exactly three 1's } Then LR = { binary strings that have exactly three 1's } Note that LR = L in this last example. ----- So, in every example LR was regular if L was regular. The proof centers on the fact that any regular language can be recognized by a DFA. So consider the DFA that recognizes a regular language, L. You can create an NFA that recognizes the strings that contain the reverse of the strings in L. Basically, you just 'reverse' the DFA, by going backward. There are a couple of difficulties to overcome. The main one is that if your original DFA has multiple final states, then the NFA you create needs to have a start state that has an epsilon move to each of the DFA's final states. 247 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
