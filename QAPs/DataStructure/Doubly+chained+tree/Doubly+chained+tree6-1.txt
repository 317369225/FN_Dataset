Could you summarize the action of the first 4 seasons of the 'Game of Thrones' TV series?
Stop watching the 5th season. You're mining the potential entertainment outcome of it. There is no just history/facts you're missing. There are personal changing in characters that you need to see to understand them. Wait for the catch-up-time to come, then watch everything. EDIT There is not simple way to tell you what happened. But this post got it all, if you have time to read. It's very complete. How would you explain the plot of Game of Thrones in brief, from the beginning?
