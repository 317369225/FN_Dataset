Could you summarize the action of the first 4 seasons of the 'Game of Thrones' TV series?
You really should stop watching and wait for the chance to catch up. I know that saying you're four seasons behind sounds daunting but it's amazing how fast one can breeze through.   A whole season can be watched in a single Saturday binge.  If you swap out GoT for the prime time of a weeknight,   a season will pass in 3 and 1/3 evenings.  All four seasons then only take 2 weeks (less if you throw a weekend binge in there).
