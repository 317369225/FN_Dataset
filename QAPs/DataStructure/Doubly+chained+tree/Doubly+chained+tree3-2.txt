What are the best programming interview questions you've ever asked or been asked?
The best interview I've had was one where I was given a laptop to code something from scratch in 3 hours, then explain my design and solution to the prospective team in front of a white board. The team spent 2 hours critiquing my solution, discussing how to make it better, and fit further requirements. The 6th hour was open ended questioning by my future team. The interviewers uncover A LOT about the candidate this way. A bonus benefit for the interviewers is that more than half of the candidates don't complete in time or just give up. The interview team wastes ZERO time on the rejects. This enables the hiring team to vastly increase the top of the candidate funnel. I got the job, but didn't take it, excellent interview format though. Whiteboards are for designing, not coding. On a side note, Uber's Software Engineering interview practices strike the right balance with respect to all the considerations brought up in answers to this question. Uber is hiring engineers. We have assembled quite a stellar team, and we're in it to win it. Check out the careers website or shoot me a private message if you're interested in joining  TechCrunch's Best Overall Startup.
