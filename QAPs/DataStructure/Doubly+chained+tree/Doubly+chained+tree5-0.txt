What is the strangest coincidence you have experienced?
I LOVE the French film, Am√©lie (2001). Would have seen it over 5 times for Yann Tiersen's soulful music and Audrey Tautou's indelible performance as the quirky protagonist. Needless to say, I am a fangirl. Now comes the coincidence (s) part: 1. Ms. Tautou and I share our birthday. Before you think I am being smug, I know, that's hardly a coincidence. The website OMG Facts takes it one step further and claims that each person shares his or her birthday with approximately 18 million people worldwide. By that logic alone, at least one celebrity should be there for each of the 365 days that comprise a year (not counting February 29) given how sweeping the term 'celebrity' is. Fine, at least appreciate me for knowing my onions, when it comes to trivia and pop culture ;). Moving on to the next. 2. Ms. Tautou has donated both her time and money to charities. I work full time for nonprofits and do have my pet charities. Again no biggie, you will say, since most celebrities do charity for PR, feel good factor or genuine goodness of heart. But wait till you see the last one. 3. Ms. Tautou's father is a dental surgeon and her mother a teacher. My parents have the exact same jobs. I was like, get out!
