How are generalized suffix trees different than the standard suffix trees?
I think generalized suffix trees just contain suffixes for a set of strings instead of the suffixes for a single string. So a suffix tree might contain the suffixes for: "banana" A generalized suffix tree might contain the suffixes for: "banana", "banter", "cat", "dog", etc... Since the suffixes are shared in a single tree, you'll want to use a unique identifier to specify which leaf node corresponds to which original string (so that you know, for example, that the suffix "ana" corresponds to the original string, "banana"). See: Generalized suffix tree
