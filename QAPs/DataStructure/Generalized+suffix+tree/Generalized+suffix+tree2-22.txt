As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
Well first of all I have to apologize, I am not here to answer your question but to ask question about CLRS(Third Edition). I don't have enough credits to ask you question yet. But this question has confused me for almost two weeks, I do appreciate if you could help me out of this. By the way, I am such a big fan of yours!      The question is : How do I specifically implement Matrix-Chain Multiplication problem in Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) in page 375?
