As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
As a student I might not able be able to judge on the whole contents of the book, nevertheless I have a suggestion of course ! The area of quantum computing has been developing in the recent past and there has been quite a few algorithms ( shor's algorithm, grover search) which could be added as a chapter ( or additional reading material).
