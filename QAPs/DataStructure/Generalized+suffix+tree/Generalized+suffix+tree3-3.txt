How can we find the number of palindromic substrings in a string in linear time?
Please follow this link. It has explanation and code for finding longest palindromic sub-string in linear time. This is known as Manacher’s Algorithm. Finding the Longest Palindromic Substring in Linear Time Edit : Since the question is changed to find number of palindromic substring, let me answer this part. Each palindrome needs to have a center. There are 2*n-1 probable centers in a string of length n (any character can be center, also center can be between two characters). Expand around each of these centers. If the characters mirror around the center, we got a palindromic substring. Increment count of palindrome substring. Expand till a mismatch is found. Do this for all 2*n-1 centers. Expand around each center takes O(n) time. Overall complexity is O(n^2). Updated 13 Nov 2013 • View Upvotes
