As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
I think you should consider moving some of the advanced or optional material to an online appendix if that's possible.  That way you have more room in the book for the basics. I'd like to see a little bit more on randomized algorithms and data structures at the level and depth of the current chapter on approximation algorithms.  It would also be nice to have a brief introduction to online and streaming algorithms, although that might be tough to do succinctly.
