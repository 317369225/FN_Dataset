What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
It would be very hard to prescribe the top 10 algorithms, which would be useful in algorithm challenges as such. However, I have written a very similar answer, which has a lot of overlapping points to you question. Vijay Nadadur's answer to What general algorithms (not statistical or machine learning) should a data scientist know? Focus on dynamic programming, heaps, and tree traversals techniques. These should be most useful.
