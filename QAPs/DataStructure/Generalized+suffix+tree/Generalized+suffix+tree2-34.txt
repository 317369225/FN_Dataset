As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
It will be great fun if you can divide the book into two valumes : 1 .Advanced. 2. Beginners. In advanced please keep topics like: 1. Segment trees/BIT. 2. Heavy light decomposition technique. 3. Suffix trees/arrays. 4. Line sweep 5. AKS primality. and for the Beginners part its all good with the last with some bit of changes .
