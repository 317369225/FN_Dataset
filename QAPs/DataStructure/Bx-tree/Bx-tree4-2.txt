Can you name some small, helpful "lifehacks" that soldiers use?
As an infantry explorer we spend most of our days and nights outdoors. When it was raining very hard you couldn't avoid getting soaked to the underwear. To get dry again I used the raincoat, ​ ​ and put my lighted emergency cooker ​ ​ between my feet. After about 10-15 Minutes I was dry again. But beware, you'll smell (even more) terrible after this procedure. Picture source: google
