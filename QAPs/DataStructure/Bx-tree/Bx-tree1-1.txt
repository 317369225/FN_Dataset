Why aren't more Hedge Funds publicly traded?
Let's make a distinction here between the hedge fund (a portfolio) and the fund manager (the organization that runs the portfolio; it may run multiple portfolios). Were a fund manager to go public, the portfolios of any of its individual hedge funds would still be "secret" - the returns would have to be audited, but only the actual performance and aggregate values would need to be reported in any annaul reports.  Of course, the 13F's would contain detailed information, but in the bigger sense these forms are largely unusable by the investing public. But the fund manager itself would be subject to a much greater degree of scrutiny. Further, should the manager have any outsized performance, the partners would get to keep all of it.  Think of what would have happened to Paulson had he sold a 50% stake in his company before having his banner year - he'd have gone public at a low point, and would have had to relinquish the performance fees to the public entity. By remaining private, fund managers avoid extra scrutiny and own all their profits.
