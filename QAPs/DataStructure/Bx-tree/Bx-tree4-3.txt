Can you name some small, helpful "lifehacks" that soldiers use?
Use the MRE heater for an actual heater.  If you take the heater, wrap it in a towel or shirt and place it in your sleeping bag or even in your tent, it makes for a nice space heater in the cold. Wet wipes are a great way to clean yourself if you don't have access to a shower. Rolling your clothes instead of folding them in a bag/suitcase opens up so much more space and the amount of wrinkling is reduced to a minimum. I think something similar to this has been mentioned already, but gun powder is great to use for cooking.  If you have a bullet or two that you can spare or even some explosives, open them up, light the powder and cook with it. I know it's kinda funny to think about, but if you're in the desert in the middle of summer, find a rock or a piece of metal, it will get hot enough to cook something like an egg or some bacon(yes, I have done this before). If it's snowing outside and you don't have electricity and you need to keep things cold, take it outside and bury it in the snow, it is ice after all and is just as cold as a freezer, just make sure you remember where you put your stuff or have a place marker or something.
