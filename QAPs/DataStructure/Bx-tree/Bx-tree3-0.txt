What is the interview for B.Math and B.Stat at ISI like?
I gave the interview for B. Stat at ISI Kolkata in 2011. It was my first interview experience and one that I will never forget. Initially I was asked some questions about my interests, education and achievements. It is all very general talk for the first 10-15 minutes which helped ease my nerves. After that I was asked around 6-7 questions from topics like permutation & combination, functions, quadratic equations, calculus. The best part is that the interviewers keep giving hints or suggestions whenever they feel you're stuck. The questions are not too difficult considering you've cleared the written test. Just make sure you don't go in with an arrogant attitude, have respect for the teachers in front of you, keep a smiling face and you'll come back with a nice experience. I got selected for the program but chose to pursue B.Tech in Computer Science at DTU instead. It is a decision I regret.
