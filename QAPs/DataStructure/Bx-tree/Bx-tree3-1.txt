What is the interview for B.Math and B.Stat at ISI like?
I am a BStat Student here at ISI. I remember my interview as one of the best experiences from my plus 2 level, as do most of my classmates. At that time, I absolutely hated interviews, and I wanted to get into ISI very badly.  Before the interview, I was understandably nervous- it is not everyday an 18 year old appears before a board of teachers! However, the teachers realized my nervousness, and they chatted with me for the first fifteen minutes without mentioning a single word about academics. After 15 minutes, as I began to relax, they started to ask me questions- I was asked on basic probability, combinatorics, algebra, geometry, all quite standard. And every time I came near losing my nerves, they calmed me down, gave me hints and made encouraging comments. It went on for about half and hr to 45 minutes.  Please remember, the professors do not want to prove that you don't know anything- you cleared the written, that means you have shown enough mettle already. Ask for hints if you cannot answer a problem, if you cannot understand the question ask for a clarification. And have clear knowledge of the basics. There is absolutely no reason to worry about the interview board.
