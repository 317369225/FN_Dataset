What is the interview for B.Math and B.Stat at ISI like?
Everyone who has given an answer till now were selected. I was not, so let me give my perspective. I appeared for the B.Math interview in 2009, I had no idea what the interview would be like, because I did not know anyone except one guy who had given the interview way back in 1995. So, I assumed it would be like the written test. I had a time frame of around one month between the results and the interview. I had done quite well in the written test and I did not study for the whole month. That is something I regret doing even after 6 years of the incident. The interview panel was maybe 7-8 professors from ISI Bangalore, but all were very kind and helpful. They asked me a few general questions, and then asked me what I liked. I told them that I like number theory. They gave me an easy question to solve, which I did. Then they gave me a slightly difficult one which I could do half, and the rest with the help of hints that one professor gave. The third question was on calculus, with something to do about asymptotics. And I had never heard of that term before (imagine that!). Needless to say, I could not figure out anything about that problem. Then they told me that the interview was over. It lasted probably 20-25 minutes. And I was sure, I would not get in. The things that I learnt was that the interview questions were slightly more difficult than the written exam, and that the professors want to help you a lot. So they give hints liberally and give you as much time as you want.
