Why aren't more Hedge Funds publicly traded?
Hmm... a publicly traded fund would know their net asset value (NAV) in advance of investors. If they listed publicly, they could arbitrage their own stock price. The consistently positive returns would lead to a rapidly higher stock price which they could continue to arbitrage...TO INFINITY No but seriously a lot of the larger funds are already publicly traded but they have broader asset management/broker dealerships associated with them: Oak Tree Capital (OAK) Och-Ziff (OZM) Fortress (FIG) Apollo (APO) Janus (JNS) Blackstone (BX) Etc. The main reason pure-play hedge funds don't list is because hedge funds don't get particularly high valuations on public markets. Their businesses are too volatile. A good year can send you soaring (like John Paulson in 2008), but one bad year can completely eviscerate you (like John Paulson three years later). Private equity lends itself to higher valuations because capital is committed for longer periods (7-10 years) and therefore provides more consistency to its cash-flow. In addition to valuation concerns, hedge funds are secretive by nature and generally allergic to regulatory oversight. Discretion is just a part of the industry culture, and being publicly traded runs counter to that posture. Updated 79w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
