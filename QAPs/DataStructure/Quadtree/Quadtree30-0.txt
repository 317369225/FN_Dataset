How do I apply KNN to find the closest points of interest (restaurant, gas station, etc.) on a large data set?
I have not worked at Google. From my past experience, how to safely reject non-matches is the key here, which helps bring down the quadratic running time down to close-to linear. For example, if you are looking for a McDonalds branch near a location in California, you wouldn't need to check any of the records in Massachusetts. In reality, whether a safe rejection is achievable heavily depends on your source data quality. The computational cost of checking the edge cases might still be very high.
