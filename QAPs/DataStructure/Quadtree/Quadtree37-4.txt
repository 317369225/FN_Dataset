What are the uses or possibly advantages of a multi-core processor without full connectivity between all of its cores?
Since you said you are new to Computer Architecture, I will give you a great tip. The first step in solving Computer Architecture problems is to specify the problem clearly, without ambiguities or room for alternate designs. Without taking this first step, the problem becomes generic and amenable to exhaustive solutions and arguments at same time. In your question, the property "without full connectivity" is a generic and unexplained term. Specify what you mean by this property in high detail. Only then can you expect a productive discussion on design advantages. Similar to Barry Rountrees answer,  I think you are trying to understand the advantages of a hierarchical multi-socket, multi-chip-module processor design. Have a look at and follow the citation tree of the AMD Opteron paper to understand arguments for such design. http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.o... [ Update after OP clarified question ] Now I see what you are puzzled by. Look at the design arguments for a crossbar network and a mesh network. You will have your answer. https://books.google.se/books/ab... Updated 27w ago • Asked to answer by Amine Mhedhbi
