What kind of data structures could be used in an image processing project?
It depends a great deal on the kind of processing you are trying to do. Often images themselves are just represented as large bidimensional arrays and what you try to optimise are the algorithms you run on them. You can change the color space, or represent the image in the spectral domain, but from a data structure point of view they are still arrays. Apart from that, graph structures and especially trees are quite useful. Spatial indexing can be achieved with quadtrees, and trees in general are a natural choice for image segmentation problems. I don't know much about image compression but if I remember correctly quite a few compression algorithms work by representing the image as some graph structure. That's the only really practical data structures I can think of. You also have fractal image compression, which is basically representing the whole image as a mathematical function. That's cool but that's not often used for real applications.
