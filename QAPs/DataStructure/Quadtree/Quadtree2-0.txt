Where can I find implementations, benchmarks and test data sets of QuadTree implementations in various programming languages?
http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/ is a general resource for many kinds of algorithms. While I did not find any specific reference to quad trees, here are related problems: 1.1.6 Kd-Trees 1.6.6 Range Search The Algorithm Design Manual: Steven S. Skiena is a fine book (by the author of the repository), which mentions spatial data structures and led me to Prof. Hanan Samet's Spatial Index Demos. Both are worth a peek. The Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS) at Rutgers University holds algorithm implementation workshop. The Sixth DIMACS Implementation Challenge Workshop is related to this subject. Here is some discussion of related issues: dimacs.rutgers.edu//Workshops/MiningTutorial/pindyk-slides.ppt Another list of quad-tree related links is: Geometry in Action: Quadtrees
