Can proof assistants like Coq be used to prove an algorithm implementation such as QuadTree?
In fact, coq is often used to prove algorithm. For example, merge sort is in the standard library with proof. It can also proof algorithm's complexity (A Coq-Formalized Proof of Quicksort's Average-case Complexity). If you have good tactic, you can even generate the algorithm instead of writing it out(seven tree in one is a great example of this).
