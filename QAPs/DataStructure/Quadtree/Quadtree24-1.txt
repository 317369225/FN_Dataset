How can I find the center of an array of geocodes?
I think DBSCAN as a clustering algorithm might be more relevant as you are looking for density based locations. I would like to think of this problem in a different way. I would tune up your lat/long data depending on the reliability field. After that I would like to organize the data in the form of a grid. Think of each state is a rectangle and the whole map is a grid. Now lat/long corresponding to this grid would get bucketed here, you can then look at the count of each grid and make a 'educated guess' about what to do. There is a data structure to do this which is quadtree. You can maintain each node of a quadtree in a hashtable. You will find quadtree implementations a plenty and it is not difficult to implement yourself too. You can also try geocoding the lat/long and then try to see for common string patterns for a region and do the classifying. I suggest you try a few approaches and then come back with more thoughts.
