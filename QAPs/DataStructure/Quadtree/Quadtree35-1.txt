JavaScript (programming language): Are Javascript functions like map(), reduce() and filter() already optimized for traversing array?
I don't know what specific techniques are being referred to, but it smells like premature-optimization-thinking. Strictly, a plain for loop is slightly faster if you run the two against eachother in direct comparison. However, it is generally silly to view performance in such a narrow way.    Your app is very unlikely to have performance problems due to stuff like that. In reality, your app FPS is going to tank because you're accessing offsetTop somewhere and causing a DOM reflow causing work equivalent to millions of filters and maps. Even if your problem can be helped by switching map to a for loop because you're iterating thousands of items per second, you could probably ask yourself if the problem is that you're... well, iterating thousands of items per second in the first place. Fast applications are born by spending time in the profiler, not by speculating about tiny parts of ones software.
