What are some ways and methods large DB vendors use to create GeoSpatial indexes?
I guess the question is how big is big? almost all systems rely on octree on visual side. Octree and quadtree systems provide your power-of-two breakdown of 3D and 2d spacial systems. Other than that it's a normal DB problem of storing addresses and spacial references and interpolating between them. How do you find the location fast (which is geodetic based) from an address (which is not geodetic based): street name records, address sub-records storing geodetic locations, then interpolate between.
