If you had a million points in 2D, how would you effectively calculate the distance from a point to every other point?
Assuming that when you write a point, it means, that point is the source, and we need to find the distance from that point to every other point, then it can be treated as a problem of graph theory. The best method to solve it is using Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the single-source shortest path problem. Its time complexity is O( |E| + |V| log |V|), where, E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices (assuming the graph is connected). For distances from each point to every other point, we have to repeatedly use the algorithm n times for n number of points.
