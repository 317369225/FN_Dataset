I want to build an Uber-like application. Where do I start?
Consider using PubNub EON (http://pubnub.com/developers/eon/) for your map widget, and PubNub as the data stream back end. You can build an app in HTML/CSS/JS that will work on Android and iOS using Cordova and embed EON for your mapping system. EON supports rendering of custom vehicle markers on a map that'll work on mobile. Then, it's a matter of writing code to identify drivers, passengers, and connect them with a hailing function. You can find a fill (wip) demo on github here: pubnub/pubnUber It demonstrates how you would combine the technologies to create an an Uber like app using PubNub, EON, Cordova, and Js.
