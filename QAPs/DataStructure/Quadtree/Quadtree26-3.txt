I want to build an Uber-like application. Where do I start?
I would split the world into grid squares of quadtrees. Pass in 2D latlng coordinates to return a 1D quadtree. This 1D quadtree can then be your pubsub room by which, latlng information is propagated and shared with everyone else inside the room. Do check out Cloudilly. It's a set of high-level messaging APIs that helps you with this propagation and sharing of information. Cloudilly uses persistent TCP and web sockets, rather than HTTP REST.
