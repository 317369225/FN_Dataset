What is the programming logic behind Google Maps?
A global quad tree, and layers of transparent PNG tiles. Google Maps - Quadtree tiling system The PNG tiles are stored at scales roughly 6 steps per octave. So, between say 1 mile and two miles, there would be 6 intermediate scales: 1 mile, 1 * pow(2, 1 / 6), 1 * pow(2, 2/6), ... 1 * pow(w, 5/6), 2
