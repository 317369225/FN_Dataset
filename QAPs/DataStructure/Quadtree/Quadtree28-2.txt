Is there a startup that creates an API for developers to build Uber/Lyft/Sidecar-like location and logistics features into apps?
Check out Cloudilly. I pivoted this from my previous carpooling project. It's a high level messaging API that's suited for building Uber-like apps. Features included: Presence, exit events, auto reconnection, offline data sync, push notifications and emails. Plus it's cross platform too. First, you will split the world into grid squares of quadtrees by passing in 2D latlng coordinates to return a 1D quadtree. This 1D quadtree can then be your pubsub room by which, latlng information is propagated and shared with everyone else inside the room. Cloudilly can then be used to help with this propagation and sharing of information.
