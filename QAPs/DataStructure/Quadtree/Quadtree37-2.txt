What are the uses or possibly advantages of a multi-core processor without full connectivity between all of its cores?
[Update] With the additional details, I think the Intel Phi has nonuniform latency for core-to-core communication, although I haven't found a cite for that in two minutes of googling.  As to why that's the default approach:  if you want equal latency between all possible pairs of cores, you are in effect putting a wire of the same length between every pair.  If you can tolerate a bus interface, then you just need to connect each core to its immediate neighbor.  That gives you faster neighbor-to-neighbor communication and dreadful worst-case communication.  It's also a lot cheaper to implement.
