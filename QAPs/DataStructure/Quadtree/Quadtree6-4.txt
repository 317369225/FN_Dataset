What are the algorithms for determining if a point is inside an arbitrary closed shape or not?
Fastest way, and quite simple and efficient: - Create a binary lookup table with the sufficient resolution (it will depend on the input space of data), so you put to 1 the ''pixels'' that lay inside the polygon. When a new point must be checked, their X,Y data will be the index value of the matrix (maybe you will have to quantizate it first), and you just have to check the stored value. It is only 1 reading operation. I think this is the most intuitive way and the nearer one to our brain's functioning. There is not math in it. It only encodes the red polygon as a group of pixels that are red, in a matrix that the other pixels are white. Every digital image is a lookup table that encodes the colour values on every position. And our brain also encodes the color values of every position. Updated 30w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
