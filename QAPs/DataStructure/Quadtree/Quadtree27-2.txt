How would I go about programming these features?
Er, for calendar, I don't think you would need to use images at all. Try to work it out using css. But yea using icons images is an easy way. Since the size of these images won't be much, going the image way is not slow but it is a little uncool. Perhaps you can use foursquare API or if your own events database then there are two possibilities. If the size of database is small then you can do a broot force search to find nearby places. So you would just need a database system. A better and faster way is to store them in a structured way, perhaps something like a QuadTree. You might also read about how foursquare does it. What tools it uses. Check out: https://foursquare.com/about.
