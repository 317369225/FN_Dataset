If you had a million points in 2D, how would you effectively calculate the distance from a point to every other point?
Edit: If you want to find out the distance from one point to every other point, it is just [math] \Theta (n) [/math] as you have to consider [math] n - 1 [/math] points and compute [math] n - 1 [/math] distances. If you want to compute the distances from every point to every other point, then-- If all the points are distinct, you need to consider every pair of points at least once, so the best algorithm would be [math] \Theta (n^2) [/math] because you would have to compute [math] \dfrac{n(n-1)}{2} [/math] distances.
