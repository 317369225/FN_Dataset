I want to build an Uber-like application. Where do I start?
Uber can be defined as something like its a mobile app based transportation network. It like connecting riders to drivers through apps. Uber API makes products /apps more powerful and enhance the user experiences. Uber serves about 250 cities in 53 countries. Uber’s considerably larger service area means it might be your only option for a taxi alternative. The way it works is simple: you use an iPhone or Android App to register, and order a Uber car. You are kept informed by your app/text messages on the status of your cab. After you are done with your ride, the cost of the ride is automatically deducted from your credit card. Uber’s marketing tactics have always been unique - from delivering to pickups. If you would like to create Uber like apps I would like to suggest you to have a check with this link @Mowares
