What was it like to be at the University of Maryland, College Park with Sergey Brin?
I took several classes with Sergey at UMCP, including one on algorithms from Bill Pugh, the inventor of Skip lists. As you might expect, Sergey was one of the top students in the department at that time, and was obviously very smart and inquisitive. Back then some of us were way ahead of our peers in Computer Science, mainly by virtue of having grown up with computers and thus having programmed since a young age. Sergey was clearly one of these fortunate few, though I certainly don't know the details of his pre-college years (or his post-college ones, for that matter). In those days (early 90s), it was quite uncommon for a U Maryland student to get accepted into the big 3 CS Ph.D. programs (MIT, Stanford, CMU). I was class of '92, and was accepted into MIT Course VI -- the first in a long time, if ever; Sergey, as is now well known, was admitted to Stanford. I personally think the early 90s were a tipping point for Computer Science at Maryland. While it was already a stellar program then, it wasn't thought of as such. Sergey's contributions to commercial software -- along with those of Gary Flake and others -- ultimately sent a clear signal to both the academic and commercial software communities that UMCP's Computer Science program was among the best in the world. It's worth noting, too, that the Quadtree -- a (perhaps the) fundamental spatial data structure -- which I used for the collision detection system in the Crash Bandicoot series -- was invented by another U Maryland CS faculty member, Hanan Samet.
