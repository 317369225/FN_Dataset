What are some examples where it would be beneficial to represent a graph as an adjacency matrix, instead of as an adjacency list?
If the network is relatively small and  not sparsed , which mean that the connectivity is high , and you want to find areas that are connected to each other . Another use of Page Rank alg. is based on eigen values and eigen vector that could be calculated via agency matrix. Another use is clustering  algorithm like spectral clustering  , MIN-CUT for maximal flow algorithms - all the above algorithm are better than it involve adjacency matrix
