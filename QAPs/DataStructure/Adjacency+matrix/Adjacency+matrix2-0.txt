What are the important theorems or properties of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix for a graph?
Usually for eigenvalues, it's easier to look at the normalized Laplacian matrix, which is the adjacency matrix normalized by degrees, and subtracted from the identity matrix. Many theorems make the simplifying assumption that the graph is d-regular because in such cases, these two matrices are more directly associated. For the adjacency matrix of an unweighted, undirected, d-regular graph, the following properties are often quite useful: 1. There are n real eigenvalues. 2. Assuming no self-loops, these eigenvalues sum up to 0, the trace of the matrix. 3. The squares of these eigenvalues sum up to the Frobenius norm of the matrix, which in turn equals to the number of edges, 2dn. 4. All eigenvalues are between -d and d. 5. If all eigenvalues are bounded away from d, e.g. between -0.9d and 0.9, the graph is very well connected. This means there are no bottlenecks in the graph, or equivalently that a random walk will rapidly approach the uniform distribution. Graphs with this property are known as Expander graphs. The picture gets much more complicated for directed graphs. In that setting, the Perronâ€“Frobenius theorem is probably a good place to start.
