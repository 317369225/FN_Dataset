Can a network be unambiguously defined other than by its adjacency matrix?Is it possible to compress a network using some of its characteristics?
If by this 'Is it possible to compress a network using some of its characteristics?' you mean is to possible to model a network's characteristics without just representing its full vertices and edge relations...then the answer is yes, but in the lossy(probabilistic) sense. Many recent approaches are precisely trying to address that question as it allows powerful applications like anonymizing and interpreting global and local network patterns without having to represent and manipulate that network directly, which is sometimes infeasible and very hard to digest visually This paper is of particular interest in relation to that, http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ju... It describes the KronFit algorithm which effectively allows the extraction of a compressed matrix (initiator matrix) which attempts to estimate the properties of the original network. This matrix itself is relatively tunable in compression degree. The algorithm is related to the more general kronecker graphs paradigm for modelling networks also detailed in the paper. Also, I would recommend generally reading on network modelling paradigms like ( Forest Fire Model, Small world model), as with some manipulation they can be used to generate 'compressed' representations of a network...though they may differ in their degree of descriptiveness and consistency in reflecting different desirable static and dynamic network properties like clustering, network diameter, degree distributions, among others. I am not yet aware of network specific models that have attempted to compress the network in the lossless sense of compression - of course you can use a standard lossless compression approach on the adjacency matrix directly, but the result will most likely be only useful for storage and not any form of interpretation of the actual characteristics of the network
