What is the best easy learning software just to visualize adjacency matrix directed weighted graph?
When I want to visualize any algorithm that I design, I normally use Octave (MATLAB is the commercial software). The algorithm I would use for this particular problem will be : 1. Generate random co-ordinates in 3D for the 'N' nodes of the graph. I would choose to restrict this to a finite bounding box. 2. Plot these points as 'circles' 3. Plot the connectivity between two nodes as a colored line between the corresponding points in 3D. I am assuming that you are aware of how to create a color map. The weight of the connectivity will determine the color of the line using interpolation on the color map. 4. Plotting an arrow is tricky but once you have used this software, you can surely plot 2 lines at the end point to indicate arrow. So, the 4 components viz. nodes, edge, direction and weight have been plotted into the graphics. Since this is a 3D plot, you may rotate the scene to visualize your graph.
