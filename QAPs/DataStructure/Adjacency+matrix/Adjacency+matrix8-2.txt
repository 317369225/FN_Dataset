What is the math involved in defining the kth power of a graph, particularly with adjacency matrix representation?P.S: How to visualize Graph Algorithms problems mathematically (having trouble big-time in solving CLRS exercises of the same)? Just found a good solution here What is an intuitive explanation for why raising an adjacency matrix to the power of n gives a new matrix with the number of n-paths? Though the real barrier is P.S. part!
