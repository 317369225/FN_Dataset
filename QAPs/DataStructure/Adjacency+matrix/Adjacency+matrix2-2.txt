What are the important theorems or properties of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix for a graph?
The top eigenvalue λ 1   of the adjacency matrix is known as epidemic threshold, see  this paper Epidemic spreading in real networks: an eigenvalue viewpoint. I have used in the past a constant number of top eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix to count triangles fast, see this paper Page on cmu.edu. Due to special spectral properties of real-world networks, this empirically reduces a matrix-matrix multiplication problem to performing a few number of matrix vector multiplication. For more info on these special properties, see this paper Page on sc.edu. As Richard Peng points out, it is more common to look at Laplacian matrices. A book which contains a wealth of information on both Laplacians and adjacency matrices is this one Graph Spectra for Complex Networks - Kindle edition by Piet Van Mieghem.
