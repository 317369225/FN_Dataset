How do I implement a depth first search C++ function, that takes an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix as parameters?
The DFS algorithm should operate independently of the graph representation.  DFS should proceed from node to node until no options of nonexplored nodes are available.  The graph should provide a function for getting the directly connected nodes of a given node.  The implementation of that function is the one that should have knowledge of the representation (adjacency list vs adjacency matrix).
