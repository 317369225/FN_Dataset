Can a network be unambiguously defined other than by its adjacency matrix?Is it possible to compress a network using some of its characteristics?
By 'unambigiously defined' you'd imply that two representations would be the same if and only if they represent the same network. Apart from reproducing the adjacency matrix, you can start asking what you mean by 'the same'. If all weights are scaled by a constant factor, is the graph still the same? Is the labeling of the nodes important? If not, there are many adjacency matrices that represent the 'same' graph. Graph invariants [1] is a key concept. In some applications, you'll also find that a smaller graph is for all purposes 'equivalent'. For instance a network of resistors in series and parallell, where some subgraphs of many resistors can be replaced by a single resistor.   Eigenvalues are also good representations of graphs. A famous example is the computation of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the web graph, which made billionaires out of a certain pair of startup founders [2].   [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gra...
