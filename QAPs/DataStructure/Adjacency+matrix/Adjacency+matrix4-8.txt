Which graph representation is better for competitive programming in C++: adjacency list or adjacency matrix?I want to implement some basic graph algorithms such as - bfs, dfs, dijkstra, mst- prim's and kruskal, max bipartite matching etc.. I want to know which is better representation for graph in terms of easy to manage with time and space - especially for competitive programming.
