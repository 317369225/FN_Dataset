What are the important theorems or properties of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix for a graph?
Let G  be an undirected simple graph of n  vertices with adjacency matrix A⊆R n×n   . If G  has diameter d  , then A  has at least d+1  distinct eigenvalues. Say the graph is k  -regular. Then G  is bipartite if and only if −k  is an eigenvalue of A  . Let t  be the number of triangles in G  . Then tr A 3 =6t  . If G  is a line graph, then its minimum eigenvalue is greater than or equal to −2  . If G  is k  -regular with least eigenvalue λ  , then α(G)≤−nλ/(k−λ)  , where α(G)  is the size of the largest independent set in G  .
