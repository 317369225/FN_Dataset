How is an enumerated data type used in system verilog? How often it is used in industries for verification purposes?
Enumerated types are used to associate names with state encodings. You might use the names ON or TRUE with 1'b1 and OFF or FALSE with 1'b0, but you do not also need to associate a value to an encoding  and you might ask a synthesis tool to pick the best encoding that produces the most efficient logic.  Enumerated types also create implicit constraints that restrict the enumerated set of values to a variable of that type - this is referred to as type safety.  Unfortunately, many tools are lax in enforcing this type safety, so you had better check how well they do this before you trust them.
