Software Engineering: What are good ways to avoid bugs while programming?
One principle which will serve you well: ensure that if your code is wrong, it will fail as soon as possible. For example: If your data structures need to maintain certain invariants, frequently assert that those invariants are true. Then you'll know that the invariants are broken as soon as they break, rather than down the road when the violations actually cause problems (which may never happen when you're testing). Ideally, any bug you have will be a compiler error, so you can be alerted to it before your code even runs. Turn on all warnings for your compiler. Use the type system to enforce properties that your program needs.
