What is an enumerated type?
An array type where symbolic constant values are automatically assigned unique values to allow the programmer to use the names instead of the values.  Typically enumerated types are numeric in nature to facilitate a fast or efficient comparison. You can then treat the enumerated type as a unique type, declare variables of it and assign it one of the constant values.  Enumerated types automaticaly constrain the values to the constants limited as a form of bounds checking. For example, a Java Enum: public enum Day {     SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,     THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY  } The seven(7) values would be assigned integer values in sequence starting from zero(0). I could declare a variable of the Day type: public Day today; And then assign values to it: today = Day.FRIDAY; And then do comparisons: if (today == Day.FRIDAY) { // Do Friday stuff }
