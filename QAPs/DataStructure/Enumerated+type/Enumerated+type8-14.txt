Software Engineering: What are good ways to avoid bugs while programming?
Many people here wrote how you can write a better code to avoid bugs (good software engineering practices, etc). However, I will tell you one small exercise that you can do to improve your brain, instead of the code, so that you make less mistakes in future. Avoid debugging and logging as much as possible. This may not make sense at first, but let me tell you how it works. When you debug or log the values, and as a result find and fix the bugs, you don't understand your code much better than you did before. Instead, if you deliberately avoid these techniques, but go through your code with the eyes, simulating the program in your brain, you will understand the whole picture of what you have written. At first it will be difficult to catch bugs this way, but after a few weeks you'll become better and better at this. As a result, you'll be able to hold bigger and bigger picture of your code in your short-term memory. And believe me, when this happens you will be making much less mistakes. This does not mean you should never debug. I also use debugger when necessary. Just try not to jump to it right away.
