Software Engineering: What are good ways to avoid bugs while programming?
TDD, no doubt about it. Andrés Ibañez covered some of the most important things, and those have all improved my code, but NOTHING has improved my code quality more than when I learned test-driven development (TDD). Having hundreds of tests constantly running on your code (autotest is superb) in the background really cannot compare to any other development practice. It's just so incredibly powerful. A piece of software (of any considerable size) developed by someone that knows how to TDD even reasonably well is very likely to have much fewer bugs than one that does not have tests. It's also much easier to change such software without introducing new bugs (because the test suite immediately tells you if a change breaks something) Updated 28 Apr 2014 • View Upvotes
