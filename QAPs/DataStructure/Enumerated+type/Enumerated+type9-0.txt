If C++ is a strongly typed language, then why does it allow these type of implicit conversions?
If you do g++ -Wall -Werror you'll get an error in this bit of code, so you can effectively strengthen the typing by cranking up the compiler settings. This was "allowed" because C lets it through (and you'll get a compiler warning, but not an actual error unless you use -Wall -Werror in the equivalent C).  Stroustrup had a bit of a devil's choice in ye olden days: extend C with classes and have a new language emerge over time, or make a wholly new language.  He chose the former, which had the advantage that people actually used the language and its extensions (unlike other languages like, say, Eiffel, which appeared at roughly the same time), but C compatibility is an original sin that C++ will carry around forever.
