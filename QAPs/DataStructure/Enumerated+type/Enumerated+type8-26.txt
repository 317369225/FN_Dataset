Software Engineering: What are good ways to avoid bugs while programming?
Constantly save and execute the program, testing all it's features. Make sure you are working with robust frameworks and libraries. Many times, bugs are not your fault. Have good coventions habits. Remember, Variable is not the same as variable or vAriAbLe.Â  Your variables, functions, and everything else should be properly named to ensure you are doing things right. You don't want to pass vArIaBle to foo() when your intention is to pass variable. Likewise, you want to call foo();, not Foo();. I can't stress it enough how having good naming convention habits is going to save you a lot of time and headches. when coding. Use clear code. Many times optimization is important, but if you have one extra line of code you are not decreasing the speed of your code. Being able to understand what you code is important to prevent bugs. Comment. You need to know what your functions do, because later you may need to modify the function, but if you don't remember what it did you are going to modify it and probably introduce a nasty bug.
