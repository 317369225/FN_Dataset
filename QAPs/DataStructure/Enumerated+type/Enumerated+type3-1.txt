How is an enumerated data type used in system verilog? How often it is used in industries for verification purposes?
An enumerated type lets you associate nonnumeric data types onto a simulation environment whose underlying operation is digital integers. In other words, you could have an enumerated data type for led_color that has the values GREEN and RED and BLUE.  Then you declare a variable of this type and can only assign those three colors to it.  If you assign an integer or a color not on the list, the simulator will give you an error or warning. So it checks your code for you. If the device under test has a register to control color, specific numbers might be associated with specific colors. The enumerated type can define what integer to associate with GREEN and what to associate with BLUE.  This allows your tests/code to use high level concepts like GREEN and let the simulator worry about whether that is 0x4729 or 0x638e.
