Software Engineering: What are good ways to avoid bugs while programming?
Learn from debugging. Most programmers, after they have spent 20 minutes debugging some problem are so happy when they find the problem, they immediately continue with their previous task, and thus forget what caused the bug. Instead, every time a bug costs you more than a trivial amount of time, take a break from programming and reflect on the original cause of the bug. Then, keep a simple list somewhere where you keep track of the amount of time a particular class of bugs has happened (e.g. copy paste: 10, off by one: 5, invariant violated: 3, etc). Understanding your causes will make you more aware of them when writing code, and thus truly cut down on bugs in the long run.
