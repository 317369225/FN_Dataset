Software Engineering: What are good ways to avoid bugs while programming?
Do Not Plan While Coding Understand the problem Understand the inputs and outputs required Understand how to test whatever it is you are coding Write the Code Test the Code (If TDD, write the test before the code).Too many developers, especially juniors, try to code their way out of a problem when the root cause is they don't understand the problem.  As my friend Jerry D'Antonio likes to say: "Code is a side effect of solving problems" It's really as simple as that.  One of the reasons people like TDD so much is because it forces them to understand the problem first by defining the inputs and outputs.  So I would argue that isn't the tests themselves that make you avoid bugs, it's the forcing you to analyze the problem first that does.
