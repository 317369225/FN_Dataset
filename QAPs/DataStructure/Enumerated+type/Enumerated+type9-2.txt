If C++ is a strongly typed language, then why does it allow these type of implicit conversions?
Strength of typing isn't a simple binary switch between "weak" and "strong". It's more of a spectrum running from essentially nonexistent at one end to extremely strong at the other. Overall, I'd say C++ comes in somewhat closer to the strong end than the weak end, but it's probably closer to the middle than it is to either end. As to desirability, it comes down to a question of backward compatibility. Your first example is allowed in C++ because it was allowed in C long before C++ existed. If you were designing C++ as a new language with no care about backward compatibility, then I think it's safe to say that it would be prohibited. As Bjarne has commented a number of times: if compatibility with C weren't a consideration in its design, C++ could be a much cleaner language (but one that almost nobody used).
