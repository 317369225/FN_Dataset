Objective-C (programming language): What is the difference between an array and an enumerated data type?
An enumerated data type is a way to define your own custom type, which will store one of a finite list of values. You define the values and their identifiers. For example if dealing with gender you could define an enum like: typedef enum Gender { female, male, other }; The different values in your enum are represented by a list of integers, but it allows you to avoid using arbitrary constants in your code for example if (user.gender == female) { [user doSomething]; } Is much easier to read than: if (user.gender == 0) { [user doSomething]; } An array on the other hand is a data type that holds a collection of values which could be integers, other primitives, objects, or even an enumerated type.
