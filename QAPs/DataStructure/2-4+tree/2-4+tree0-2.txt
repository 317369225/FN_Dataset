Are there any concrete examples where 2-4 trees or Red Black trees turn out to be much better than AVL or general binary search trees in application?I have been learning about 2-4 trees and red black trees but I can't particularly picture when will they turn out to be significantly more useful than the other generic trees.
Yes. For the very simple reason that Red-Black tree implementations are now widely available: FreeBSD: /head/sys/sys/tree.h
