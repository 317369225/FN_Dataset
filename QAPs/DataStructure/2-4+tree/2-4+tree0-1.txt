Are there any concrete examples where 2-4 trees or Red Black trees turn out to be much better than AVL or general binary search trees in application?I have been learning about 2-4 trees and red black trees but I can't particularly picture when will they turn out to be significantly more useful than the other generic trees.
AVL trees are a lot more rigidly balanced and thus their search times are better at the expense of insert time compared to RB trees. In general, they can be used interchangeably but when you need better inserts over search or vice versa then you use one over another.
