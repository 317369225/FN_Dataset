How do I sort array of pair<int, int> in C++ according to the first and the second element?
You can use sort. You can write a compare function to define how to do a search. For example, if you want to sort with respect to the second element in a pair, you can write a compare function as: bool compare(const pair<int, int>&i, const pair<int, int>&j){    return i.second < j.second;} And while using sort function in your main code: vector< pair<int, int> >v;sort(v.begin(),v.end(),compare); The basic syntax is to use like this: std::sort(myvector.begin(), myvector.end(), myCompFunction) Hope this helps.
