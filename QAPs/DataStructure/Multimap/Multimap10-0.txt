Which data structure sorts the elements on insertion in C++ STL?
To the best of my knowledge, the data structure itself is not specified by C++ standard, but it does state it explicitly that: Iterating over the elements in std::set/std::map should enumerate the elements in lexicographical order, and Insertions, lookups and deletions from std::set and std::map should have the worst case complexity of O(log(N)).(If lexicographical order is not required, consider std::unordered_{set,map}, which effectively are a hash set/map respectively.) In all STL implementations I have knowledge of, std::set/std::map internally use a Red-Black Tree. Also, neither red-black trees, nor std::set/std::map really "sort" elements. They just store them in a way that naturally results in iterating over them producing the lexicographical order.
