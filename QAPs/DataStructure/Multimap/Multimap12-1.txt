Where/how can one practice C++ STL?
use them in your code first: C++ reference has some very good examples. vector - C++ Reference first pick up few basic containers: 1) vector 2) list 3) deque assosiative containers: 1) Map 2) MultiMap iterators few generic algos auto_ptr (deprecated) but easy to impliement and gives one a grounding on the the nessisity of the complexities involved in shared_ptr. shared_ptr. from C++ reference search for the above topics and try out the example code provided there and think what part of your existing code can be replaced by these.
