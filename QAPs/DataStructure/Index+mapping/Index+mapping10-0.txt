How do I use Elasticsearch with mysql database? I am currently experimenting with jdbc river, but will it be fast enough in production?
We have explored the JDBC River for ElasticSearch to connect to and index from our SQL Server 2008 Database store, and it is definitely production-worthy. Just to give an indicator, a normal desktop class machine with 4GB RAM running as an ElasticSearch node could index about a million rows from the SQL Server database within 2 minutes through the bulk indexing facility provided by the JDBC river. If your database design is congenial to be plugged in through the JDBC river, then there must be no second thoughts. One thing you must ensure before initiating indexing through the river though, is to have the right database indexes for the query being plugged in (that is, ensuring there are index seeks as against index scans, and appropriate covering indexes are set up based on selected fields, etc. for the river query). This will ensure that the bulk reads from the database don't cost much. As an alternative, you can of course use one of the multiple clients available across different programming languages to achieve the same (NEST for .Net, for example), where your program would do the work of connecting to the database and reading from it and feeding the results into the predefined index mapping of ElasticSearch.
