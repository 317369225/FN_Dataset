Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
My favorite geoLocation App right now is http://geoloqi.com/ I met the cofounders Amber Case and Aaron Parecki at AppNation earlier this year. They demoed the app and I got hooked on it. Some of the coolest features include the ability to leave "GeoNotes" at a location with a time limit, so if your friends land there, they can get the note and make a realtime onsite connection with you as opposed to FourSquare, Gowalla, which are both sort of like 1-way checkins (i.e. you are just shouting to the world that you arrived at some place and "checked-in" ). Plus their logo is super cute. For that alone you should give this app a download and a try (just kidding, the app is really awesome!).
