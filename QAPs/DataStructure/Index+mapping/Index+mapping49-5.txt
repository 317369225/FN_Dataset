Is it fair to say that the United States government is corruption-free with negligible bribery? If no, which areas need improvement?
If a person needs to borrow millions to billions of dollars to actually have a chance to be elected head of government, the state will never be corruption free, because his donors will expect him to make politics in their favor, independent of what is best for society. We can say that corruption is far worse in most other countries however.
