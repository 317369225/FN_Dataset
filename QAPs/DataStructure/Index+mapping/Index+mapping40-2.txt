What are some must-have software for programmers using Linux?
Have you ever watched a coding tutorial and saw a really slick editing interface with terminal split screens and a gorgeous color scheme?  Here are the 3 tools that will get you the end result of a terminal like this: To learn how to configure these tools to get something akin to the screenshot above, check out Codementor's tutorial to best set up your Linux development environment: Configuring Your Linux for Development With Zsh, Tmux, and Vim Tools of the trade Zsh Bash is a nice default but we’re not here for defaults, we’re here for the best we can get and that means Zsh and all the bells and whistles that come along with it. In a nutshell, Zsh gives us a much more user friendly experience on the command line, it gives us things like better auto-completion, Vim key bindings and smart guesses when you write a command wrong. Zsh has a huge user community behind it and those smart people have added many, many customisations. Tmux Tmux is a terminal multiplexor. Sounds scary right? Well, it isn’t at all. Tmux is a tool that allows you to split your terminal screen into any layout you want as well as run multiple terminal instances that are easily accessible. Tmux has become the go-to tool for some of the biggest neckbeards out there. Vim Vim is a text editor and if you haven’t heard of it before, well, you’re either going to love it or hate it. People who are fans of it love it because it is an extremely versatile, customisable and powerful text editor. Now, for the sake of diversity, there is another extremely powerful text editor out there called Emacs which you should look into in your spare time and decide whether you would like to learn it. However, note that both Vim and Emacs have an extremely steep learning curve in terms of how they allow you to manipulate text.
