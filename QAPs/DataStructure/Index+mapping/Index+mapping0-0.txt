Can I use normal index together with geospatial index in one map function in CouchBase?It means, can I filter geolocation and document attribute at the same time in one query?
In it's current (Jan 2013) implementation, you can't mix. Current Geo Indexes follow the GeoJSON syntax for emitting points. However, we are currently working on a more robust R tree structure that doesn't require GeoJSON structures, but is more generalized. In which case you probably could creatively mix Geo and "non-Geo" together as long as it's understandable as an index, if you are doing bounding box/ellipse/polygon queries, you generally want to index properties that fall within or without that container. I am not sure mixing Geo/Non-Geo together makes sense. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt though if you have something that mixes the two somehow and is "query-able." It sounds like you probably just need Geo and Non-Geo indexes and do an intersection.
