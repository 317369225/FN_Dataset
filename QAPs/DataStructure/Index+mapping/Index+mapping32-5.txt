What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
Monitoring buzz about a startup requires you to keep your eyes and ears wide open. Thanks to social media management tools, it's far easier than it was earlier. There are plenty of good online monitoring tools available. We, at Zoho, launched one such comprehensive social media management tool last February called Zoho Social. Now let's see how it can help you to monitor buzz about your start-up. You would probably want to monitor one or more of these 1) track industry-relevant keywords, 2) mentions about your brand or 3) your set of audience.   1) Zoho Social's Monitor column helps you listen to what's being talked about your brand or relevant buzzwords/ phrases from your industry and you can engage with users right from the same column. 2) The Live Stream feature includes mentions about your brand, posts and messages across social networks. You can directly take any action from this column like retweeting, responding to messages, etc. 3) You can see a list of all your "Connections" (everybody who has engaged with your brand across various social networks) in 'Connections'. You can search by their name or profile handle, see recent interactions and take your conversations to the next level. Apart from the monitoring factor, Zoho Social offers some cool features like:   Talk: Schedule/ publish unlimited posts (even in the free plan!). Discuss: With the collaboration feature, you can discuss a post/ draft with team members. Analyze: Get detailed stats and understand what's working for your audience. Share: Share right from within your browser using our browser plugins. Keep moving: Access and manage your social media on the go with Zoho Social's iPhone and Android apps. Go ahead. Give it a try.
