What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
I've tried several solutions including Filtrbox (R.I.P.), elaborate Yahoo Pipes mashups, Social Mention, etc. (although I haven't used enterprise services like Radian6). For me the problem was that the services required upkeep, were finicky, or they weren't real-time enough to offer a good opportunity to respond/participate. The simpler the solution the better. So I've paired down my monitoring to these three tools: A TweetDeck column that searches for any mention of our company name. This is the front lines. When there's a mention on Twitter, it pops up on my screen. It's effective because Twitter is real time, it's the primary medium for public conversation, and most blogs post their stories there. http://spy.appspot.com - This is basically a mashup tool that monitors blogs, social networks, and comments. It's perfect because they handle all the grunt work and there's no tweaking required. It'll find even the most obscure mentions out there. Just create a search for your brand name (here's mine: http://spy.appspot.com/find/mugasha), subscribe to the RSS feed, and check it 1 or 2 times a day. Google Alerts is the safety net. It'll catch any big mentions, just in case they somehow slipped through. Create an alert for your company name and URL and subscribe to the RSS. Check once a day. Keep it simple :)
