What's the best way to store millions of hashtags in a database?What's the best way to store millions of hashtags in database and efficient to retrieve those hashtags like Twitter?
I don't think you've given enough detail to speculate on an  architecture, but my first suggestion would be to look at something like Apache Solr. You can also roll your own inverted index (e.g. mapping  hashtag to set of tweets) easily enough in any RDBMS. Scaling problems  left as an exercise for the reader (it's usually best not to try to  solve every scaling issue in advance, but build a prototype and evolve  the architecture as required).
