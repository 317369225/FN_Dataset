How is the autocomplete for Quora so fast?How do they do it? It's magic!
Prefix search can be faster than traditional inverted indices based keyword search (one to many, word to document IDs). e.g our prefix search framework takes 0.002s to execute a prefix based search for every 1mil titles - which is constant time for prefix strings unto 64 characters and goes slightly up for every 4 characters onwards. Its really about packing sequences of characters into 64bit integers. Once you turn this problem into a matter of identifying ranges within 'sets' of numbers, each representing part of a sequence, its pretty much  a solved problem. To match say 'Ste Jo' to titles matching  'Steve Jobs' or 'Steven Jonas' or whatever - you just perform one prefix search for each distinct term ('Ste', 'Jo') and you get the union for documents matching both ( in practice, one wouldn't use a naive union operation, either by relying on merge sort or on sets or something, to get that intersection, but that's another story ).
