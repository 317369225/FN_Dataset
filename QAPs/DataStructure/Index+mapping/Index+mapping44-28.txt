What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What is India Bangladesh land boundary agreement?India - Bangladesh land boundary agreement which was accepted some days agoÂ  involves three issues land boundary of approx. 6.1 km between both the countries , exchange of enclaves and adverse possessions which were long been the matter of contention between both the countries. The agreement deals with three of the issues in great details which will be difficult for me to discuss here but to be simple and short, some points i would like to make here 1. India will transfer 111 enclaves with a total area of 17,160.63 acres to Bangladesh, while Bangladesh would transfer 51 enclaves with an area of 7,110.02 acres to India. 2. in respect of Adverse Possessions, India will receive 2777.038 acres of land and will transfer 2267.682 acres of land to Bangladesh 3. it will result in a fixed demarcated boundary in all the un-demarcated segments and moreover people can decide either they wanted to be called Indian or Bangladeshi. People will not be forced to flee their homes they can choose to stay which ever side they wanted to be with. hope now your doubts are clear and even you have any you can ask and if having any suggestions then "there is always a room for improvement".
