What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: Is the land deal between India and Bangladesh good? How will India benefit from this deal?I will keep it short. The problem is called as problem of Enclaves or stateless citizens. Don't see the quantity of land being exchanged, see it from humanitarian perspective, that these people will be now either citizen of Bangladesh or India. They will have their identity. Enjoy benefits of growth and development in their country and will be connected to the country. It is beneficial for both the countries.
