What is the algorithm/data structure used by Lucene to compute the term frequency of documents?It looks like use the Map structure to compute the term frequency, but I wanted to know the more detailed answer.
Lucene uses inverted index(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inv...) to store term vectors.Â  For more detail check out lucid imagination wiki(http://www.lucidimagination.com/..., http://www.lucidimagination.com/...) and Lucene documentation(http://lucene.apache.org/core/ol...)
