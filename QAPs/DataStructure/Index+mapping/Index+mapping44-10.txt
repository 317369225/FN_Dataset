What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What is the India-Bangladesh land swap deal?Let me first clarify that I am not an expert on this matter in any way. There would be many other possibilities/situations prevailing over this land swap deal and I hope someone with better knowledge can share their thoughts soon. Anyway, from what I know, in a nutshell, Bangladesh has areas marked under India's territory inside it's own territory and India has similar areas inside Indian territory. These are called enclaves and there are numerous such enclaves exists on both sides of the border. To complicate matters there are actually enclaves within enclaves. Now, the issues due to this disconnected areas are manyfold and mainly it's 1. administrative 2. security. Administrative problems are there because even though if an enclave in under India's name, Indian administration can't do anything for the people living there. They can't provide any health/education/security/water or any basic necessities to these people as they are completely disconnected. Similarly Bangladesh also can't help them as they are not under their administration. The same story goes for the enclaves withing Indian territories but belonging to Bangladesh.  Secondly, the issue of security. Till such enclaves exists, it's impossible to seal the border even if we want to. Even though borders are manned, it seems they are open specially during daytime for people inside the enclaves to come to say Indian territory and vice-verse.  So to make things simpler, the governments of both the nations are agreeing upon swapping such areas and that in turn would help both the nations and specially the people living inside those enclaves.
