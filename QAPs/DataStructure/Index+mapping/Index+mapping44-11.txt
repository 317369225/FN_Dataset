What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What is the significance of the Land Border Agreement and the transit rights of PM Modi signed in Bangladesh and how will it affect the India-Bangladesh ties?India won't be directly benefited.  However, the people of chhitmahals (encircled enclaves of both countries) will be benefited because they would get citizenship of a country and along with citizenship, they would get facilities for treatment, education, movement, passport, etc.  Law and order problem is also expected to be improved in these areas. With the exchanges of chhitmahals, India can expect to gain the trust of people of Bangladesh and consequently it is further expected that Bangladesh would behave like a good neighbour in future.
