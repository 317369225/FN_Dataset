What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What is the Land Boundary Agreement of India with Bangladesh? Will India and Bangladesh gain anything individually? I somewhere read that India will lose 10K acres while Bangladesh will be losing 500 acres only?For what is the Land Boundary issue What's the India-Bangladesh land dispute all about? So India won't really be loosing or gaining anything with the deal as the territories being swapped are already inaccessible by any of the two countries and due to this people living in these areas have becomes almost stateless as no one is willing to provide for them , being on technical and legal terms citizens of another country and also has caused problems with increased illegal immigration from Bangladesh to India as in these areas the Gov. of India can't put up fences or any type of physical boundary to stop immigration or even infiltrators. The boundary agreement means that now every land boundary dispute with Bangladesh has been cleared up in addition to Maritime dispute being cleared earlier this year which is a welcome news as India as a country can move forward with its relations with Bangladesh on trade and transportation as currently every supply to the North East is sent through Silguri which is not the most efficient route so with this being cleared the potential for other issues regarding transportation through Bangladesh to the NE will increase . Now the 10k and 500 acres is just the territory which was inaccessible by the other being on the other end of the actual border.
