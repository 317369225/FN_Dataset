What are some must-have software for programmers using Linux?
There are already many good suggestions in the previous answers, and obviously some of this depends on what you want to focus on as a coder... Allow me to offer +1 to some, and offer some new ones too: Sublime Text -- best of breed as a hybrid between a text editor on steroids and a full IDE. Ruby -- better, I think, than Python, Perl &/or bash for writing command-line utilities and for many other programming projects. RVM -- if you're planning to get serious about Ruby, you'll find reasons to get into multi-versions, JRuby, Rubius, etc. Git -- yup. Unison -- helps keep dir-trees in sync on two/more systems. AutoKey -- can be very useful. Glipper -- I always need a history-list of cut-&-pastes. Shutter -- best for screen captures. Gimp -- required for a variety of image/photo editing. qBittorent -- my favorite torrent mgr. CrashPlan -- my favorite backup-in-the-cloud. TruCrypt -- sometimes you need to keep a secret. KRename -- part of the KDE suite of tools, my favorite bulk-file-renamer. KDiff -- also part of KDE toolsuite, a really decent GUI file-version comparison tool. K3b -- best CD/DVD burner program I've ever found. Kiki -- a pretty neat regex evaluator, checker & teaching/learning tool.
