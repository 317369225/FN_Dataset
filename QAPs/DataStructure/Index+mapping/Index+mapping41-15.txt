As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
First of all: You present Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization at the end of the Number-Theoretic Algorithms section but not Floyd's “Tortoise and the Hare” algorithm for cycle detection, which Pollard's method is based on. This is an excellent example of algorithm for which both correctness and complexity are surprising, and I think it should be featured in the book. I would indeed love to see: Bloom Filters Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays (also, the Knuth-Morris-Pratt section could be shortened) at the end of String Matching section. And I also think you can remove: Computational Geometry Linear Programming
