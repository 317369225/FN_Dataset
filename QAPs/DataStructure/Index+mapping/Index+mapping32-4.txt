Hello guys, I work for mention so I may not be objective. Mention is a tool that help you create alerts for your name, your brand, your industry, your company or your competitors and be informed in real-time about any mentions on the web and social web. Here are some key features of our product: • Media and Social Monitoring Get access to millions of sources in 42 languages (social networks, news sites, forums, blogs or any webpages). You receive live alerts any time you're mentioned on the web, so you can react quickly. You can use your social network accounts through mention to react and reply faster. And thanks to our in-house anti-noise technology, we get rid of mentions that may have pollute your feed. • Build for teams You can share your alerts with your team, assign tasks (read, reply, comment), and see what has been done thanks to your activity feed. All of that in real-time, on all devices (mention is available on the iPhone, Android, as a Chrome app and as a standalone desktop app). We are working on many more team-features. • Statistics Premium users can get access to our statistics module. This allows you to get an overview of your mentions history by source and language. You can also generate report as PDF and export datas in CSV format to analyze them your own way. • Fair price compared to competitors We currently have 3 plans.
