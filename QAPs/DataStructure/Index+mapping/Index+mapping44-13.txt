What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What is the Land Boundary Agreement between India and Bangladesh? What was the issue that led to this agreement?India and Bangladesh have a common land boundary of approximately 4,096.7 km. The border area is dotted with many Indian enclaves within Bangladesh, and many Bangladeshi enclaves within India. There are 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh (17,160.63 acres) and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in India (7,110.02 acres).  The India-East Pakistan land boundary was determined as per the Radcliffe Award of 1947. Disputes arose out of some provisions in the award. It was an agreement signed on May 16, 1974, soon after the independence of Bangladesh, to find a solution to the complex nature of border demarcation. A joint headcount estimates the population in the enclaves to be around 51,549 (37,334 of them in Indian enclaves within Bangladesh). ‘An adverse possession’ is territory that is contiguous to India’s border and within Indian control, but which is legally part of Bangladesh. Residents of these adverse possessions are Indian citizens. The same applies to Bangladeshi adverse possessions. In respect of adverse possessions, India is to receive 2,777.038 acres of land and to transfer 2267.682 acres to Bangladesh.However; the reality is that the area to be transferred is already in the possession.
