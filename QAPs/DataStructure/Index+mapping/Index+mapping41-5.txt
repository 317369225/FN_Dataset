As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
I would have liked to see these topics added: Zero-Knowledge Proofs: When I took 6.046 at MIT, we covered ZKP in class and it was the only topic outside CLRS that semester. It was pretty interesting and paired well with RSA (instructors were Rivest and Goldwasser) and the other material.  It could replace primality testing or integer factorization. Although it doesn't really fit in the "Number theoretic algorithms" chapter. An overview of Boosting/ Multiplicative Weights Update would also be extremely useful in my opinion. Given the fact that learning algorithms are increasingly important in theoretical CS as well as ML, I think it could find a place in the book. It could go into the approximation algorithms section, for instance instead of subset sum. A more ambitious proposal is that an entire section for learning algorithms is included.  I would put it instead of multithreaded algorithms, or string matching. I would suggest against removing linear programming or FFT.
