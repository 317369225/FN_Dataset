Why do Hash Tables need to store the Key of a record?Can't we just insert the Value (without the Key), after we calculate the hash for the table (using the Key)? I guess what I'm trying to get at is, what is the use of the Key after calculating the hash? We can just retrieve the record's Value if the requesting application knows the Key. Am I getting this wrong? Thanks.
Without the key, we can't access the hash directly. And, because hash tables are designed exactly for that reason: "A hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key, and you can identify a useful key value. Each item in the hash table has a key/value pair. The key is used to access the items in the collection."
