Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
Shameless plug: my startup, Locately (http://www.locately.com/), has built a system that can figure out where someone is shopping, eating, or playing based on location data (it's like a checkin, but you don't have to checkin: it's 100% passive).Â  Our first application for it is to help large brands and consumer insights firms (Nielsen, SymphonyIRI, ...) understand where consumers are shopping and why.
