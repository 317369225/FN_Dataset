What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
I use RoundTeam, retweet service to Aggregate updates about my startup. I simply created a separate account on Twitter and use RoundTeam to re-post all the relevant information about what people talk about my project there. I can access this separate account's feed at any time and favourite or reply to guys who talk about my project. No one tweet was ever lost :)
