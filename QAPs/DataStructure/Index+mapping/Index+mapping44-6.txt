What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What is the Land Boundary Agreement of India with Bangladesh? Will India and Bangladesh gain anything individually? I somewhere read that India will lose 10K acres while Bangladesh will be losing 500 acres only?During the separation of east pakistan (Bangladesh) there are some enclaves formed which were neither recognized by India nor Bangladesh.The people inhabited those enclaves neither hold indian nor Bangladeshi Identity(like ration cards,voter ID etc).It was very difficult for the authorities of both countries to find the nativity of those people.during UPA II rule there was an agreement made with Bangladesh Govt to arrange for swapping of enclaves between two countries. India is giving more land than Bangladesh.Anyway it is beneficial for the people of the enclaves living listless for generations.More over clear demarkation of Borders prevents disputes between neighbhors.
