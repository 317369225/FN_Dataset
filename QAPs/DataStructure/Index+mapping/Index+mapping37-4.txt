What's next after social democracy?
Replacement implies failure, or at least outdatedness.  I don't see this as applying to Social Democracy, or to socialism in general.   Leninist Communism established equality of class, gender and race as an ideal, if not yet fully realised. Most alternative politics were against some or all of these things, including some forms of socialism. So you can say that Leninism as a militarised version of socialism succeeded, but failed to move on in its Moscow-centred form.   Chinese Communism has evolved from Leninism to a more tolerant version of socialism. It retains public supervision of the economy, and all land is publicly owned, though mostly worked by individual families. That particular system seems to have been arrived at by accident, but was proposed as an ideal by some 19th-century radicals.   Socialism did suffer from being too technocratic, a benevolent elite looking after the masses.  The masses decided they could look after themselves, and were seduced by cunning advertising into thinking that they could flourish as isolated individuals. They abandoned others, and in the current crisis they are shocked to find that others are equally happy to abandon them.   Social Democracy in some form flourishes most places, and can expect to do better as the USA loses its authority.  If the Republicans get elected and the US decline continues, who do they blame?   In Europe, Christianity is increasingly marginal and socialism is the best replacement.  The main alternative on the right is layer-cake politics, radical and skeptical and libertarian at the leadership level, while being religious and fond of old ways among the voters.  How long can that last?
