What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What is the importance of the India-Bangladesh land boundary bill?I'll answer your sub-questions first, Bangladeshi infiltration will reduce as soon as India constructs fences on the border. It was sticky issue till now as the residents of the enclaves had no concrete identity so anyone can infiltrate/pass the border feigning the nationality of the other nation. (Also, the fact that some of India-Bangladesh borders are riverine in nature leads to some difficulty in patrolling) Regarding the Economic impact on the Indian economy, not so much. It will improve prosperity in the border areas but not the country as a whole. Purely speculating here, the points of contention between India and Bangladesh are the water sharing agreements and the border issues. With one out of the way, India can start having or start thinking about greater economic ties with Bangladesh. For your main question, I'd suggest you read through here: Â How will India benefit from redrawing borders with Bangladesh?
