What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Apart from what Tushar Singh has said here, I would like to address what many Indians are unhappy about, the land we "lost" in this deal. Okay, Bangladesh managed to get 10,000 acres more than India. That's about 40km 2   so some might say that it's neither nothing nor a significant thing! However, what doesn't occur to them is that it's not all in one place and these enclaves were practically inaccessible to the Indian crowd to begin with. These were scattered among hundreds of enclaves being swapped. So, I guess the real area difference would not be easily visible on the ground level.
