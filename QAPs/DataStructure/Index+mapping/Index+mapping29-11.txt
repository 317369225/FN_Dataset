Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
I'd add Ness Computing to the mix for finally cracking personalized recommendations in an elegant and functional mobile user experience.  Not limited to ratings in their app, they are pulling in Facebook and Twitter data to ensure information recommending restaurants is as accurate as possible.  Not limiting themselves to social opinions (which is notoriously inaccurate since what my friends like is NOT what I like) nor just category recommendations, Ness blends my own opinions of restaurant types, global ratings, and social opinions with location to know where I should go.  It's not been wrong yet.  Add to that the smart user experience that shows me not hours but whether the place is closed right  now or not, an easy user experience for closing restaurants so users can help keep the database accurate without jumping through hurdles (though they need to make it easier to add a place - i.e. not asking address since customers don't know that), and a smart distance search to show when I should go the extra mile to find what I really like instead of limiting myself to what's in the immediate vicinity. Smart developers and designers!  http://www.likeness.com/
