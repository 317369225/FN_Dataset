What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
Here at Sprout Social, we use our very own social monitoring platform to pull @ mentions, brand keywords and hashtags on Twitter, private messages, comments and posts on Facebook and comments or + mentions on Google+. We pull the specific mentions of our business into the inbox, but Sprout also has a great 'Discovery' feature, which is meant for more industry-relevant terms like "social business" or "social media management tool," which we use to proactively search for people who my be in need of a social media tool to manage their profiles. You can check out a free 30 day trial of Sprout to see if we're a good fit. Check it out here: http://bit.ly/1z2LKbp
