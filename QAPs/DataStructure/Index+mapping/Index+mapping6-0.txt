Could you introduce the index-file structure and theory of Lucene?It is an inverted index structure by Lucene In Action, Can you introduce its specific index structure and mathematical theory in detail? and how to improve the performance of large index? thank you.
The javadocs include a lot of details on the files formats. The most interestings are probably the format of the postings lists, described at http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_... Most mathematical theory is available in any good book on information retrieval, but it is true that Lucene has some specific algorithms. I wrote a blog post about it a few months ago: http://blog.jpountz.net/post/258... And regarding performance, Lucene wiki has a bunch of very useful tips on how to speed up things: http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-ja... http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-ja...
