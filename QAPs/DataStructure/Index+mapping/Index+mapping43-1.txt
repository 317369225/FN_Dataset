Do all Arab and Muslim countries treat women like second class citizens?
Of course not! Please note that even Arab countries are very different from each other. Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey etc are all muslim countries, with a high percentage in places like Singapore too. in Pakistan most the students in university are actually women. Please note that while men and women have different rights in Islam, both are still equal. Islamically a mother has more rights over the father and here is a hadeeth on the importance of mothers: A man came to the Prophet and said, ‘O Messenger of God! Who among the  people is the most worthy of my good companionship? The Prophet said:  Your mother. The man said, ‘Then who?' The Prophet said: Then your  mother. The man further asked, ‘Then who?' The Prophet said: Then your  mother. The man asked again, ‘Then who?' The Prophet said: Then your  father. (Bukhari, Muslim). Daughters also are considered a blessing over sons. These are just 2 examples. Please also note that just because something is known as a muslim country, you should not forget the land also has it's own traditions are cultures. British behavious is very different from French which is very different from America and so on...Although these places have high a high Christian population overall and specifically in certain areas. Please also look up and google places like Afghanistan and Iran were around 1960 and 1970, before the west interfered.
