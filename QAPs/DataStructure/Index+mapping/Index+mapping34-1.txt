What should I learn to enter the Big Data domain?I got stuck in software testing (mostly manual), for almost 6 years. Does it involve lot of coding experience and a niche skill set? How do I approach companies with openings on big data field?
Sure enough bigdata includes a wide spectrum. But the above preparation aims specifically for the machine learning. Those things are really very good for machine learning as I am also working in a project to implement the same. But the fact is... as a starter you won't be required to know all this in depth math and algorithms. There are five main things that is very necessary being a member of bigdata team, viz 1. Fundamental/primary language: you must have good knowledge of atleast one basic programming language like java or .net, java is preferable as most of the open source tools in bigdata exposed their APIs in java. 2. One NOSql database: you must know atleast one database. Some are mongoDb, Cassandra, Hbase, CouchDb, etc. 3 Search library/tool: you should also know one of this tool/tech. Majorly Solr, and Elastic Search are being used. 4. ETL Tool: Talend is one of the good example of it. But this you can learn afterwards... 5. Functional programming language like scala. But that too you can continue to learn after entering in bigdata world. Linux: you should have good understanding of Linux environment and should learn shell script and other basic linux commands. Also knowledge of version management tools like git will definitely help you.
