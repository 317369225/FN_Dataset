What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
What is an enclave? An enclave is any portion of a state that is totally surrounded by the territory of another state. In case of India, they are spread out in the areas of Assam, West Bengal, Tripura and Meghalaya. Out of these enclaves, there are also 24 counter-enclaves (an enclave within an enclave) thus making the whole structure extremely complex! Why was LBA required? The Bangladeshi and Indian enclaves are located deep inside their respective countries resulting in a strong incidence on their administration. Also, since the sovereign country has no real control over its respective enclave, their inhabitants lead a miserable life as they are basically stateless and denied access to basic infrastructure due to their peculiar geographical positioning. The Land Boundary Agreement Bill seeks to address this problem through swapping land (enclaves) between the two countries and redrawing the complex border.
