If I add a document to Elasticseach index, and the document has one more field than the mapping defined for the index, what would happen?
I am assuming that you are adding a document to an Elasticsearch "type", as the structural hierarchy in ES goes like this: Index(DB) | ----Type(Table)        |        ------Document(Row) Elastic search will then include your new field in the mapping of the type to which you are adding. Example, Suppose, movie type has 4 fields a, b, c, d and the document that you are adding has data for 5 fields a, b, c, d, e. The data for the 'e' field gets added to the mapping as well. So, the new mapping for the movie type will be a, b, c, d, e.
