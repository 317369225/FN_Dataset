Is it fair to say that the United States government is corruption-free with negligible bribery? If no, which areas need improvement?
The U.S. has a cleaner system by far than NATION'S like China and many others with a culture of corruption that is many centuries old. But American politicians now, especially at the highest levels, practice a system of legal bribery or extortion where their large, legal, open donors are buying their votes and influence. The massive donations by corporations and foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation, the giant speaking fees paid Bill and especially Hillary, are a form of unhidden influence buying.
