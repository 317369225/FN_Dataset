Is it a good UX or a bad one to have Google Maps as the index page?
In my opinion: not the best approach. If I understand your vision, the very first thing users would see when they land on your page would be the map, with interactive markers and possibly visual aids suggesting that the map is interactive. Is this enough? Maybe only if the user knows exactly what is being presented to him/her and how the system is expected to behave. More often than not,Â  this won't be the case. Users may land on your page with only a limited idea of what the Web page is about. Does it offer visual aids suggesting interactivity? Is there relevant header text indicating the brand name and some description that highlights the purpose of the website. Is the navigation flow visible and straightforward? Will users understand where they are in the website and how to proceed? These are basic heuristics you need to be concerned about. You probably do want a simple landing page that provides an initial walkthrough and let's users get to the map via a single prominent click on a visible, clear icon. You could mockup these alternative approaches and test them on a couple of actual users to get some preliminary feedback on how users will react to just a map versus a landing page followed by the interactive map.
