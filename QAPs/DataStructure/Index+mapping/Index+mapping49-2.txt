Is it fair to say that the United States government is corruption-free with negligible bribery? If no, which areas need improvement?
My company relies on government contracts for a significant part of our revenue, so I've learned a little bit about how to compete for these contracts and how they're awarded, and the follow up and due process that happen before and after an award is made. I'm not a huge fan of the US federal government, and so I'm probably biased toward seeing corruption and unfairness. But I don't see much. By and large, at least for contract awards, the process is very open and very transparent. There is a kind of corruption built into the whole system - but Americans already know all about this. It is pork barrel spending. This benefits the elected officials who dispense it, and it benefits the electorate of the elected official. But it generally doesn't benefit specific, chosen, private individuals - it's generally not targeted that way. I'm no expert. Maybe others have good examples of real down and dirty corruption?
