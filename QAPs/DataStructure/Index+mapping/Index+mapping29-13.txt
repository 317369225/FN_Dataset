Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
Thanks for the shout out Juhani and Paul! We at Grey Area released Shadow Cities in June this year and have had a great reception. New York Times' Seth Schiesel wrote a great piece that Paul also mentioned, which really captures how we approach the space at http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/1... Also, the guys at Taplap have a more casual take on the LBS games at http://thetaplab.com/. Other interesting takes include Hitchery and Flaregames when they decide to come out of stealth.
