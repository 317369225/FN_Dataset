Could you introduce the index-file structure and theory of Lucene?It is an inverted index structure by Lucene In Action, Can you introduce its specific index structure and mathematical theory in detail? and how to improve the performance of large index? thank you.
Just the Theory: Terms and their frequencies are denoted by Vectors stored in invertedIndex. A  Term is the basic unit for searching which consistindexs of a pair of  string elements:  <fieldname,text>. A term vector is a collection  of terms.The inverted index maps terms to documents. For each term T ,  it should store the set of all documents containing that term. So it is  the duty of analyzer to look for the terms in documents and create a  token stream so that they can be mapped.Terms are stored in segments and  they are sorted. The .frq file contains the ids of documents which contain each term, along with the frequency of the term in that document. Lucene stores the term data in inverted index format as described in the image below:
