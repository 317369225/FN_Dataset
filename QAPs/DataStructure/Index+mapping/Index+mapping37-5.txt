What's next after social democracy?
Democracy is here to prevail. but the Governments around the world are going to be more & more redundant. Giant corporations are going to play a bigger part in uniting people across the border for the same cause & with CSR & sustainable development initiatives, they soon are to become new-Governmental bodies around the world sooner or later.
