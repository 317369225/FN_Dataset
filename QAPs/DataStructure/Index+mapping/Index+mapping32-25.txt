What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
Since you didn't identify the data you want to track, I think the most important step is to figure out what you want to measure first, and to do this, you have to know who your audience is. Is this a marketing push to reach to a specific segment or demographic? Are you trying to build hype in hopes of attracting VCs? Are you trying to educate customers (current and potential) about your offerings? I think it's much easier for a startup to target an audience then try to reach everyone, but once you know what your key metrics are, then it will becomes obvious what software to use. Hope that was helpful.
