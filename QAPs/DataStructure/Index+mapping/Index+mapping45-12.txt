Why do Hash Tables need to store the Key of a record?Can't we just insert the Value (without the Key), after we calculate the hash for the table (using the Key)? I guess what I'm trying to get at is, what is the use of the Key after calculating the hash? We can just retrieve the record's Value if the requesting application knows the Key. Am I getting this wrong? Thanks.
Any hashing algorithm can give the same hash code for two or more different keys. This is called a collision and it is also the reason to store the key. The given key and the actual key are compared after computing the hash code. You can lookup for some implementations of hash tables to get a better understanding.
