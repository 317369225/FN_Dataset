Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
(disclosure: I'm the founder :) 360cities.net. (both the website and the default-on Google Earth layer) It enables regular people to publish and share their georeferenced 360ยบ panoramic images (think google streetview, but far more beautiful, and made by people like you). It lets people SHOW where they are. These other geolocation services are still missing that, somewhat. 360 Cities' newest service, Panomonkey.com, goes one step farther and creates the panoramic image for as well. So you can upload 10 overlapping shots from your phone, and it will stitch and map your 360 photo for you, which you can then publish to 360cities (and to google earth).
