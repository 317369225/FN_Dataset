How is the autocomplete for Quora so fast?How do they do it? It's magic!
My best guess at how it works: Maintain indexes that map a given string to an ordered list of the "top" (as determined by some query-independent measure like popularity) 1,000 questions that ...contain a token that has the same root word as the string ...contain a token with the string as a prefix For example, here's what the two types of index entries look like for the string "rest": ["What is the most restful kind of yoga?", "How can one be better rested with less sleep?", ...] ["Where can I find the best sushi restaurant?", "How can one be better rested with less sleep?", ...] The two indexes are just big hash tables, and each of their entries is an efficiently queryable memcached node. When a new N-word, M-character question is added, it causes that question to be inserted into N type-1 and M type-2 index entries (or fewer if some of the characters are inside stop words). When the user is in the middle of writing a query, and there are N tokens in the input field, you take the first N-1 tokens and get their type-1 index entry, and get the Nth token's type-2 index entry (this only requires bulking together N memcached lookups). Then do something like a join, or a scoring and sorting, with the questions that were found in the N lists.
