Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
Ok, some of these may be a little biased, but I think the data and analytics around location data is particularly interesting... companies like PlaceIQ and Sense Networks and TrendIT... also to see what Skyhook wireless will do in this area. And while not really a start-up necessarily, I think that keeping an eye on something like Qualcomm Alloyn would be worthwhile... allowing for adhoc and P2P connections to be made between people/devices that share a common space had some interesting implications and applications.Â  In the not a start up category... will be very interesting to see how eBay pulls together all those location based aquistions like Where, Milo, Red Laser, etc. And how others may try to emulate it. Also to watch how Apple location based reminders unfolds if at all. As far as applications are concerned I think Sonar is on to something, and as a previous poster noted Chalkbook looks promising. Also like the idea behind brom.ly and matchbookit.com suprisingly little happening in location based affiliate progams or real location based search start ups IMO.
