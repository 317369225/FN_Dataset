What's next after social democracy?
Social democracy seems to be the most stable of large-scale government styles. There will always be an imbalance of power between people, and social democracies are the best at keeping people involved in the system rather than rioting in the streets, because they feel like they have enough of a say.   "Weapons [of] information revolution" is a little on the grandiose side. Freer flow information probably leads to a freer society, but it seems unlikely that it is going to completely replace large-scale governments any time soon.   Although, things like Seasteading are a potential counterpoint: http://www.seasteading.org/
