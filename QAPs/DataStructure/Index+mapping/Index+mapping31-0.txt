What hardware is best for ElasticSearch?We have 8TB of data indexed which will scale to 80TB.  We add 300,000 documents to the index per day, planning to scale to 3 million.    Total of 27 million docs, planning to scale to 270m. Query numbers would be in the scale of thousands per day (ie, a small number) but the response time needs to be web-appropriate.
If the query volume is low but the index is very large, this calls for hundreds of shards (~2 per CPU core of the largest foreseeable cluster size) with 1 or 0 replicas depending on your availability needs. Short of Fusion I/O cards, you can't really buy enough disk to make disk-based Lucene indexes fast, so RAM is king (followed by CPU), but ElasticSearch runs in the JVM, so heap size limitations become a problem. The largest recommended JVM heap is 8GB, so 16GB of RAM per node is a good balance. This can be achieved through virtualization if necessary.
