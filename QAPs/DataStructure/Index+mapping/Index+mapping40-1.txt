What are some must-have software for programmers using Linux?
To start with, you must be well versed with Linux Bash commands. If you are a beginner, use this as your Linux wallpaper, until you learn the use of all these commands. Editor : Choose anyone from VIM/Emacs, you can find loads of confusing articles with battle between vim and emacs users. YOu can read an decide which one to go ahead with Bashrc : You may not always want to remember big commands to do tasks, you may store aliases to such commands in your .bashrc file. YOu can also do other stuff like change the look of terminal, increase command history, store history with timestamp and many more. Refer this question : What useful things can one add to one's .bashrc? Version control : If you are programming, you must use version control. Use Git/SVN or whichever you feel is easy and meets your needs. Tmux : Its a terminal multiplexer, allows you to split screen and do multiple things at one time. If you remotely access servers, Tmux is a boon. Vagrant/Docker : You may want to test your code locally before deploying it to production. Vagrant and Docker are nice utilities you may want to learn. It will let you quickly test your code in a virtual environment. Pidgin/XChat : You will need to connect to community to get help many a times. IRC clients are must here. Cloud Storage : I always keep a backup of my work on Dropbox. Always have a continuously syncing storage client installed and move your important tasks there, that you may not necessarily want to store on Github. Sticky notes app : Always have one sticky notes app on your system to remind you of your to-dos. Filezilla : Remote file uploads/downloadsEdit 1 : Thanks Alan Dillman for sharing: if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]   then     . ~/.bash_aliases fi Add this instead of putting the aliases directly in .bashrc.
