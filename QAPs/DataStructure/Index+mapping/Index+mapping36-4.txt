Wealthier nations tend to be less religious. Is low religiosity a cause, a consequence or just correlated with high wealth?
Technically the US is an outlier in terms of these studies. I don't think this is particularly a surprising phenomena.  The person with a decent amount of money thinks they did everything.  Unfortunately, money can indeed warp our understanding and our choices in reality. People in the West have a particular perception of meaning and purpose in live--usually around earning lots of money, and spending an hour or two with God who made it all is somehow a burden, whereas they owe everything to God.
