Does anyone really know what "small government" means?
This is a political issue and you are never going to get a common answer to any political question much less something as broad spectrum as this. This is my take on "Small Government" Small government is a conservative concept where the government stays out of the way while everyone gets rich.  It is a beautiful idea.   A wonderful concept.  However, in the most conservative places which would have the lowest impact on the lives of people, the reverse is true.  If you rank American states on a scale of wealth, the conservative states would be strongly represented in the lower end (with Texas being the exception to the rule) and more liberal states being highly represented at the higher end of the scale.  Internationally, the nations with strong social democracies are considered the most successful in terms of happiness ratings, economic opportunity, ease of business, lifespan and general health.  The arguments for small government do not stand up to the facts.  Rick H. Kennerly has a great answer on American states that details the specifics better than I can while Patrick Hochstenbach has a wonderful answer on the international stage.
