What companies are the top 10 players in the WebRTC emerging market?
Great choices from Tsahi.  If you like open source I think our EasyRTC would qualify. See http://easyrtc.com, the easyrtc github repo and Google Group for easyrtc If you want a more complete solution try https://tawk.com on Chrome. Coming soon on iOS as an app and Android Chrome browser. Some of the top 10 have already been acquired or paired up with larger organizations. AddLive, TokBox, Requestec, I'm sure Tsahi has the whole list somewhere. Another good place to check is the the sponsor lists for the WebRTC Expo at  http://www.webrtcworld.com and a growing number of other WebRTC conferences or sub conferences.
