What are some must-have software for programmers using Linux?
Linux is constantly evolving, there are several major distributions that make users 'addicted' to their style of use and purpose. There are options for anyone, some of them require a bigger learning time, like vim. But meanwhile you have alternatives like nano or mcedit. Because most of the tools for programmers of all kinds are open sourced, people choose their tools based on how large is the community behind them first and how long have they been in the market second. There are some monopolies within the tools you can use in some areas, amongst them Wine and Chromium Apps. My list of apps for my personal setup is kind of a must-have so I am using dotfiles to project those configurations in all environments I operate. ncurses - a library that does not come as default, but has a great array of tools built upon with helpful, nice presented info ccze, grc - coloring tools for cli, speeds up your time looking at the logs vim - best tool in my toolbox, highly modified, can't stand the default one now zsh - alternative to bash, much more developer friendly and easily customizable git - my versioning system of choice, usually in company of some management tools like, bitbucket or github , smartgit or command line managers(gitflow, git-up) chromium - a browser optimised for linux use and with a great platform for apps running native on your system docker - I prefer this to a virtual platform as virtualbox, but sometimes I just can't choose to use it, due to limited knowledge on my part, for now tor - secured web browser Note that this list is a personal must-have, you can do the work without them, harder or different. It is nerve-wracking for me not to have them, though.
