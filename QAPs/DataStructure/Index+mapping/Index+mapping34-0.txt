What should I learn to enter the Big Data domain?I got stuck in software testing (mostly manual), for almost 6 years. Does it involve lot of coding experience and a niche skill set? How do I approach companies with openings on big data field?
Thing is, big data isn't one subject, it's a collection of many. If you're starting from scratch, you have a long road ahead. I'm a beginner myself, but I'll help you out as much as I can. You need to know math fundamentals. Brush up on the basics of: 1. Probability and statistics 2. Linear Algebra - Matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, fields, etc 3. Basic calculus - differentiation and partial differentiation to start with 4. Discrete math - in particular, fundamental counting (permutations, combinations) After that learn octave. Familiarise yourself with the syntax and head over to coursera. Take up the machine learning by Andrew Ng if it's there, or you could check YouTube, I think his Stanford lectures are up there. Python is just as good in my opinion, there are projects that are meant for machine learning and statistics. Check out scikit, numpy to begin with once you grasp the basics. Edit: I forgot to mention implementing this using software. There's a whole other dimension to that as well. No sql databases, sharding, clustering, indexing, map reduce, etc Congratulations, if you've made it this far and have finished all of that, you can call yourself a beginner :-D After that, it all boils down to your interests and how much you practice. Sign up on kaggle.com and train on the problems there. Read papers online. Take up personal projects and polish your skills. And remember, don't stop learning, this field is vast.
