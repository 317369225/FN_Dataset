Is there an infinite array in Java? If there is, how can I create that array?
As others have noted, you are bound by the machine's memory, so in practice, you can't really have an infinite data structure. One way to get the illusion of it though is by using lazy data structures. Some languages provide ways to do that, such as Clojure and Scala. Other languages use lazy evaluation by default, such as Haskell, and so everything is lazy. For example, in Haskell positives = [1 ..] positives is a list of all positive numbers, so in theory, you have an infinite list, but in practice, you can't evaluate the whole list (actually a big part of it) and keep it in memory all at once. For Java, you can check out the Guava libraries to use lazy data structures.
