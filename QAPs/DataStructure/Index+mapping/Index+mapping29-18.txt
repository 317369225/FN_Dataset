Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
For Business. Your Chalkboard Chalkboard is a new mobile ad network. They use geo-location to show ads on a variety of mobile platforms. Chalkboard is trying to create a new standard by only showing ads for companies close to the user.  For example, if you are using your phone as a map, Chalkboard might show you an ad for a  nearby restaurant. Right now Chalkboard only has 3,000,000 people in their network, so it is not  large enough for every business to use, but I think this start-up has a lot of potential. I will definitlly be monitering their progress for my own company. -Andrea http://www.callnerds.com/andrea
