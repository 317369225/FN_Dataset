How bad is pollution in Taiwan?
All my relatives live in Taiwan and so, the last time I visited in Summer of 2013, I experienced no significant air pollution. I didn't need to wear a mask. I traveled throughout North and South Taiwan, to all the major cities like Taipei and later, the countryside. In my opinion, Taipei's air quality is comparable to LA's. In the countryside, the air quality is comparable to the air in Idaho. Clean and extremely crisp. Despite the comparison, if you take a look at the Air Quality Index Map (Air Pollution in Taiwan: Real-time Air Quality Index Visual Map), Taiwan's air quality index for major cities are ranked as "Unhealthy". The site is actually pretty fascinating. Take a look.
