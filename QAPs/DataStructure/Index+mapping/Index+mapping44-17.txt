What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What are the key features of the India-Bangladesh land swap deal?There were Indian villages within Bangladesh and Bangladesh villages within India.    There are 51 Bangladeshi enclaves with about 15,000 people within states like Meghalaya, Tripura and West Bengal. With the new agreement, these will become part of India and the people here have the option to relocate to Bangladesh if they prefer. Across the border, there are about 100 enclaves that now transfer officially to be a part of Bangladesh. The government has reversed an earlier decision to exclude Assam from the agreement. The Constitutional amendment that has now been approved by both houses of Parliament is intended to end decades of uncertainty for tens of thousands of citizens living in enclaves on the "wrong" side of their homeland's border. Fifteen states in India now have to clear the amendment, which is unlikely to be a problem. After clearing the bill on both the houses of Parliament PM Narendra Modi said "This would contribute to a stable &peaceful boundary, better management & coordination of the border &will lead to enhanced security as well".
