Is it fair to say that the United States government is corruption-free with negligible bribery? If no, which areas need improvement?
American corruption is smaller and more subtle than in places like Russia, China, and India. It's mainly confined to siphoning off money in unobtrusive ways that can be construed as unobjectionable. I would suspect it is at European levels, but this is guesswork. The premier example of our day is the Clinton Foundation. The basic scam as I understand it: Pay an outrageous speaking fee for either our former President or Secretary of State. Get comped on political favors or government subsidies by political allies or ambitious bureaucrats Bill, Hillary, family members, and Friends of Bill pull most of the "charitable" money out legally and buy nice things. Bill is a lovable rogue who I find hard to resent. But extending the scam to Hillary, Chelsea, and the slack-jawed siblings seems a step too far. The Clintons are not unique. Just smarter and more audacious. People like Dennis Hastert (R) and Harry Reid (D) have become remarkably wealthy after a lifetime of public service. http://www.nytimes.com/politics/...
