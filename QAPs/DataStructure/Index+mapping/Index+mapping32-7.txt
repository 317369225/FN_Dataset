What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
As a startup you need to focus on developing your offer and establishing a strong initial customer base. And you need social media monitoring exactly for that - to see what are the needs of your potential customers and to meet your most influential fans. Most tools out there charge prices that are only affordable by large corporations. And since you are a startup you need to do this as cost-effectively as possible, right? I would suggest trying Brand24– it’s a comprehensive tool where you get various customer insights organized in a single dashboard. It’s quite affordable and easy to navigate – subscriptions start from less than $50. You can sign up for a 14-day free trial to check it out – no credit card needed for that. It will be great for maintaining your reputation and for analysis the sentiment of your mentions. Over 30,000 brands globally are monitored with it so I think it might be helpful to you as well. :) Updated 15 Jun • View Upvotes
