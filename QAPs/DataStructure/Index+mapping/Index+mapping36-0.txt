Wealthier nations tend to be less religious. Is low religiosity a cause, a consequence or just correlated with high wealth?
The best statistics I have seen tie religiosity not to wealth but to income inequality. The two are often related; there are lots of very poor countries with a few wealthy warlords, plutocrats, or oligarchs, for instance. However, there are also a few wealthy countries with very high income inequality…with the United States being a rather prominent example. The evidence suggests that religiosity is the consequence, not the cause, of inequality, because religiosity tends to lag by about a year; that is, after a change in the wealth inequality rates, it takes about a year for the trend in religiosity to follow suit. One interpretation is that the wealthy tend to use religion to justify their position. I lean more toward a conjecture that the poor, when they realise that they do not have access to social mobility and equality or justice in the real world, instead turn to the balm of religion—imaginary hope being better than no hope at all, I suppose; and the belief in an afterlife providing an opportunity, albeit imaginary, for redress of inequities.
