When using logstash with elastic search, when/how do I specify the mapping of the index that will store the logstash data?
You could do it manually, but it's easier with an Index Template. Use the template directive in  your elasticsearch output block to point to a valid template.  Logstash ships with a basic one: logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch
