Wealthier nations tend to be less religious. Is low religiosity a cause, a consequence or just correlated with high wealth?
It's not really possible to tell. This is effectively an epidemiological study, and as should be repeated any time someone claims that the food du jour prevents cancer, epidemiological studies can never show causality*. You need a randomized, controlled, blinded experiment, and you'll never get that here. One could come up with explanations in any direction. Say, wealth gives free time which allows contemplation which leads to rejection of religion. Or in the opposite direction, rejecting religion leads to a greater emphasis on science and technology, which leads to economic success. Or for a non-causal connection, a good education system simultaneously boosts the economy and causes people to abandon religion. The data from the chart can't distinguish between those three scenarios. *Time-series can sometimes hint at it. If a dip in religiosity is followed by an increase in per capita GDP, that kind of rules out wealth decreasing religiosity, but it could still be something else causing both changes with different time delays.
