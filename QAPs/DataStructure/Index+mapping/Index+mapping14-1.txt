Is it a good UX or a bad one to have Google Maps as the index page?
Good or bad depends on the users and their goals. It sounds like filtering is the primary functionality of the site, so making sure that the filter slide-in is visible and at the top of the visual hierarchy for the page would probably be a good idea. Making the filtering as simple to use as possible and structuring it so it is self explanatory to use will probably be the biggest challenge. It may be a good idea to include some sort of introductory walk through if users don't get it right away.
