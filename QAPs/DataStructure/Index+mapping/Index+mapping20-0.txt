How should we continue to improve Data.gov?
A few ideas: -Increase the # of APIs (75,000+ data sets and 100 APIs right now) -More marketing/outreach - getting data released and APIs created is half the battle.  We need more community outreach like Health Datapalooza but for other sectors -Improve internal use - one of the biggest users of government data is government itself (for systems, benchmarks, etc).  Help improve use of Home | Data.gov within government with more outreach and training. -Would love to improve feedback flow when you want data that you can't get - right now feels like it doesn't add much pressure or affect change (I have some requests in regarding improving USAJOBS API and past prices database and never saw much change) -Tie it into FOIA processes - every year millions of dollars and hours are spent filling FOIA requests for various data and information.  This information should not be just sent to the individual like it currently is but also be released and included in Home | Data.gov and would save some of the duplication in FOIA processing (for example I know multiple people who have FOIAed and received list of federal employees salaries nationwide - that info should be available publicly by default now).
