Originally Answered: How is land border agreement of india-bangladesh is beneficial to india as india is giving more land?It is beneficial for both countries. Exchanging of the enlaves will be beneficial to the people. Currently, the people do not have access to basic rights. Resolving the land issue will help the people of the enclaves to grow. The people have the option to choose citizenship between India and Bangladesh. Losing a few acres of land is not a matter of concern. You should look at the people's lives. Actually, Bangladesh had proposed this land deal in 1974. It is only recently that the Indian parliment has approved it.
