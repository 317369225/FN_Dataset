Does anyone really know what "small government" means?
It is all a matter of drawing a line where the state should be responsible for different aspects of a our life, and where not. Governments vary in where they are each side of this line. Those that want excessive state responsibility for every aspect of our life are called socialists, and those that believe we should confine state roles to a (small government) minimum are called conservatives.Â  This is too large a question to answer simply, and we would need many questions to deal with this subject properly. I wish others the best will in the world who answer this question as it is.
