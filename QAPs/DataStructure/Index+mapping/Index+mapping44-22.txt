What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What are the key features of the India-Bangladesh land swap deal?India and Bangladesh  have worlds most complex land locks. A land lock is a situation in which a part of land or country is surrounded by foreign land.  That means to access that land you have to have access of foreign country's land or air space, thus making them very hard to be accessible and at times they remain cut off for years. To solve this lands swap is done. Just to consolidate the boarders.
