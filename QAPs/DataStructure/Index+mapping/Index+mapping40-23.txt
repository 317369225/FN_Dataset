What are some must-have software for programmers using Linux?
Programming in what language and at what level are what decide which packages you need installed on your OS. Gcc must already be installed in a Debian based OS; in RedHat Enterprise OSes you may need to get it I guess if it is the minimal install. One funny thing is how createrepo works for local repositories for RedHat Enterprise linux, but RPM is always there, so there is work around handy. Kate and kwrite combination works really well as it knows even Assembly language along with C, ANSI C, Python and a wide variety of high level languages as well. Gcc compiles them all! I don't think there is much required at all except a standard install of a GNU/Linux OS because the developers and maintainers of the OS know that the majority of their users are programmers themselves.
