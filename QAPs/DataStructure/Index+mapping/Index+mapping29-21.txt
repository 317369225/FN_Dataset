Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
I find the new Seattle Startup Glympse very interesting. The app allows you to share your location for a period of up to four hours. It is great if you are meeting with a group of friends, or you don't want to keep updating people with your ETA. All you do is sending them a "glympse" which will show your location on any mobile device or in any browser. Updated 8 May 2014
