Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
I am keeping an eye out on a new Montreal based startup www.localmind.com. Their promise is that they will connect you to someone at the location of interest to you and you can ask them any questions you like (how is the crowd at this bar, how many plugs are left at the coffee shop, etc)...
