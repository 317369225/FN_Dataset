How bad is pollution in Taiwan?
I have lived in Taipei for about 20 years, and been to all other cities in Taiwan. Air in Taipei is not very bad, but it is not good enough. Air in streets that are filled with cars and motorcycles is the worst; therefore,   if you ride a motorcycle in streets, I suggest you to wear a mask. Air in other cities in Taiwan are better than Taipei, and is good in countryside!^^
