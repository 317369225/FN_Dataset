I am introducing a SaaS mapping program that integrates data mapping, correlating that mapped data with a rich index of data, and a data mining program. What's the best approach to price this product?It's an enterprise solution geared toward governments and large health care systems.
Pricing is dependent on how badly your customers want your solution, who the competition is, and what kinds of value you can deliver. You could offer a fixed price enterprise license for each organization or charge per user. It also depends how much customization/integration is necessary, amount of support provided, and if training is extra.
