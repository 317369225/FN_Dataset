Is there an infinite array in Java? If there is, how can I create that array?
You can have sparse arrays, if you use a hashmap, that would be an array-like thing that would let you set items at arbitrary indexes 234, 456456, 8754764564, and 6547654996 and up to a few million of those, but not much more.Â  Is that close enough to infinity for you? There are also libraries for some languages for handling large but sparse matrices. Also note that while you can potentially make a disk-based virtual-memory file of hundreds of gigabytes, giving you a huge array capability on a 64-bit machine, that much virtual memory usually doesn't work too switftly.
