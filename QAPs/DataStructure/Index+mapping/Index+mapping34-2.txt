What should I learn to enter the Big Data domain?I got stuck in software testing (mostly manual), for almost 6 years. Does it involve lot of coding experience and a niche skill set? How do I approach companies with openings on big data field?
You got stuck in software testing? Really? Read your own question carefully. You seem to be stuck in fear and lack of perseverance to work hard to gain skills. You seem to be stuck in not knowing how to shape your career. You seem to be stuck in not having a vision for yourselves.
