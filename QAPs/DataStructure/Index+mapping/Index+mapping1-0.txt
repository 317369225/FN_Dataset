Elasticsearch: Is it possible to have the same index on different maps?In ElasticSearch, can 2 different maps be applied to same index? If yes, how? and how to access the fields of such index with different maps?
First thing that comes to mind is to duplicate all fields; use first set for mapping you would use for mapping1...
