What's next after social democracy?
Science fiction increasingly sees companies as the main political actor of the future: lobbying, Citizen United in the US tend to agree. I personally consider that the opposition against Proposition 8 in California was the first time corporation intervened as coherent political actors, and defended their values as such: more than individuals saying “It gets better” based on their orientation, it was a business community that defended that gay employees are not less productive than heterosexual ones, unless they worry about fairness, and asked their employees to testify “It gets better (once you work at Google)”—hence the many corporate sponsors to opponents of the bill, and the ads by company, rather than, say, sensitivity (butch, lipstick, bear, etc.) that could have made more sense for teenagers in need of models. Exclusive corporatism is hard to imagine, at least as a political system, but given Thiel’s and others’ intent to build city-states, that might be closer than one thinks. Sealand gave the precedent of a nation by jus gentis, whose only effective outside contacts were commercial, and whose prince was CEO. Such a structure would still need be tied to state-bound partners and contractors, but international groups already are. For judicial rulings between expatriate corporations, contractors can already bound themselves within their contracts to the ruling from company-employed, should I say “call-centered” private peace judges; such dispositions are generally locally enforceable. Health, education, security have already been essentially privatised, and could remain so via insurance contracts. This perspective is incredibly scary to me: so many abuse become likely and systematic once profits are the rule of the land, and secrecy can be as effectively enforced; I’m mainly concerned by anti-trust laws, the main current control of corporate abuse, that wouldn’t seem to be enforceable anymore.
