Is tensor index raising and lowering a mapping?
Just like the raising and lowering of indices on a vector represents a mapping between a vector space and its dual space, the raising and lowering of indices on tensors also represents a linear map. A tensor with m  up indices and n  down indices can be thought of as a vector that lives in the vector space formed by taking the tensor product of m  copies of V  and n  copies of its dual V ∗   . If you, say, lower an index, so that the tensor now has m−1  up indices and n+1  down indices, you've mapped your tensor into a different tensor product space, given by the tensor product of m−1  copies of V  and n+1  copies of V ∗   . This map is the one that acts on pure tensors by picking out one of the copies of V  in the tensor product and applying to it the same mapping that lowering an index does on V  itself; in other words, lowering the i  th index is the same as mapping, v 1 ⊗v 2 ⊗…⊗v i ⊗…⊗v N   to v 1 ⊗v 2 ⊗…⊗w i ⊗…⊗v N   , where w i   is the one-form corresponding to the vector v i   , and extending by linearity to the entire tensor space.
