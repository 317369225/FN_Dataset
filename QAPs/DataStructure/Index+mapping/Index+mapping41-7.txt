As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
Here's my two cents on what can be thrown in: Parameterized and Multivariate Algorithms Recently, there is a large and thriving body of research in the field of parameterized algorithms; particularly in developing exact algorithms for hard problems. Given the theoretical (in some sense, analyzing the complexity of an algorithm as a function of multiple parameters always seems to be a much deal compared to a worst-case analysis based on just the input size) and practical (a large fraction of practical problems are in fact hard to compute; and there are genuine situations---like voting algorithms---where approximate solutions may be of limited interest) importance of these algorithms to modern-day Computer Science, I feel that parameterized algorithms do deserve a chapter in an introductory treatise on Algorithms. The section could probably introduce the notion of parameterized analysis, and introduce some elementary concepts used for the design of FPT algorithms like bounded-depth search and kernelization. Streaming and Sublinear Algorithms Algorithms for handling humongous datasets are becoming increasingly relevant in recent years, and will only become more so in the coming decade. Foundational aspects of data science, and algorithmic techniques like streaming, sketching, sampling and sublinear algorithms could be introduced in a chapter or two. As for topics to remove, I feel that the chapters on Fibonacci heaps and van Emde Boas trees can probably go. Further, the treatment on graph algorithms can probably be compressed; e.g. by merging the two chapters on shortest paths into one.
