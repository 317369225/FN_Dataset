What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
Top four free tools: Social Mention, Google Alerts,Â  Addictomatic, Twitter Advanced Search - for low volume (Anglophone) conversation these will be probably be sufficient. Then if you're looking to go beyond mere monitoring and build the data into processes - brand strategy, customer service, PR, etc - the top 3 proprietary tools (right now) seem to be: Sysomos, Radian6 and Brandwatch. When you've got all that monitoring and reporting going - it's worth thinking about what you're going to do with all the data... so keep in mind your wider strategy and get some buy-in from colleagues.
