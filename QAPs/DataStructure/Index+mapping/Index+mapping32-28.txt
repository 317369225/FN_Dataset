What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
I use a variety of tools for engaging with social media. 1. I've found that one of the best monitoring and curation tools for twitter is 6Builder. 2. One of the best filtering tools for removing fake twitter followers is www.manageflitter.com, 3. and I'm obviously biased, but we have a CRM and social listening combo that is designed specifically for PR folks that works really well. www.tribedynamics.com
