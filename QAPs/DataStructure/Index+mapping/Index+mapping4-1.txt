What companies are the top 10 players in the WebRTC emerging market?
There's many ways to answer this - it depends what you mean by "top". In terms of defining the market direction, standards & platforms, spanning enterprise, telecoms & the mainstream web, and considering also their share of "public voice" I'd say [subjectively]: Google Ericsson Telefonica / Tokbox Oracle Genband CafeX Quobis Temasys Alcatel Lucent Dialogic Twilio With honourable mentions for Mozilla, OnSIP, Huawei, Unify, Avaya, Cisco, Telenor, NTT, Imagination, Microsoft, Acision, Sonus, Aspect, Priologic & a few others - as well as numerous open-source initiatives.
