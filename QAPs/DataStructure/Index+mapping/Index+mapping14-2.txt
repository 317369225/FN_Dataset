Is it a good UX or a bad one to have Google Maps as the index page?
My opinion: YES! As far as the basics of Ui and UX is concerned, it is a good idea assuming that this is what your website is all about. For example your website is MAP[.]com then you nailed in your ux. The user coming to your website is going to look for certain maps or location and giving him that rite on his Face is just perfect. As far as I understand your website, My suggestion for the side bar is to make visible at all time - give the option to hide it but Do Not Auto Hide it or something like that. The details you want to show about your site can be shown on the side-bar.
