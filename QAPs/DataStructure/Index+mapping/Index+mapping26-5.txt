Does anyone really know what "small government" means?
I think people can only understand something based on their own knowledge and experience. For Chinese, "small governments" did exist in the history and Chinese would probably define a small government with existing knowledge. For example, Chinese dynasties were all "small governments", which would govern in terms of "big things" and leave the small things to the people.
