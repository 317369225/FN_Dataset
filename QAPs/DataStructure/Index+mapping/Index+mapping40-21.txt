What are some must-have software for programmers using Linux?
I agree with most of what is said here. Just a couple of things to add. - If you're doing any sort of web development, and by any I mean 'it might wind up on the web some day,' I'd take a look at a basic NodeJS install. It can be a simple web server sending out static files or some pretty complex web apps, all by learning only one syntax. It also integrates (or substitutes for) build and deploy tools. - Some virtualization technology. Xen, VMWare, Virtualbox, whatever. Testing in a VM isn't identical to testing on native systems, but you can get some good ideas back quickly. The major linux distros will usually play together sort of OK, so having Windows/MacOS/Android/iOS configured VMs will often be useful. - This might show my bias as a former/maybe future DBA, but to me a local install of one SQL and one document database is crucial. At some point you're going to want to test something and not want to ask your DBA to create a testing environment for you. Reading from flat files will only go so far. The two 'Ms' Maria and Mongo will get you there quick. You'll be able to debug issues with your application that aren't necessarily with your application. - I was a bit surprised to see so many people suggest zsh. I've been a standard bash user all of these years, who knew that was wrong?
