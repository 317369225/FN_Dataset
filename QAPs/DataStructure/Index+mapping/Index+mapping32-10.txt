What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
I think you first need to ask "what are the relevant metrics?" A lot of entrepreneurs get really caught up with buzz that they forget how much more important it is to build an amazing product. Focus on creating exceptional value and the buzz will come. When it does, don't get too caught up in it. Track @replies on twitter. Check follower/like counts. And set up google alerts. Don't get obsessed with it. Followers only matter if they're actually going to move your company forward.
