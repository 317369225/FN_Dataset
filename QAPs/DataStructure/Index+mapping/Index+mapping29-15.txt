Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
In my opinion a great startup to follow is RewardMe (http://rewardme.com) I think there new concept of what Geolocation services should be will be excellent. They are revolutionizing the way that people will do business with retail and the restaurant and food industry. They've invented a whole new category known as Social CRM. In my opinion they've carved themselves a new niche that works directly with retailers and consumers in a way that completely benefits both easily. And I must admit, I'm biased about it because I'm an investor.
