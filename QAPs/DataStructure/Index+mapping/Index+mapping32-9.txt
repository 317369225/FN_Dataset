What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
In addition to the many very useful tools I see on this page, I’d recommend to give a try to Follow.net Competitive Intelligence Software. Follow has a section, called News Feed (image below), which allows you to see when and where a website (of a startup for instance) is mentioned on the web. News Feed provides you with notifications when the sites you follow do something new, or are mentioned on the web by someone else. This is an example with news outlet TIME. Closely monitoring several sites takes a lot of work, but Follow can be set up in a way you’ll be notified when the sites you follow do anything new online. You can open an account for free, even though you have the choice to more advanced paid plans, too. Follow shows much more than what you can see above of course, but that should answer the question, at least in part. You can install the toolbar on your browser -- or use the web-based platform -- and start monitoring sites on the Web. Try it out, and let me know how i went. As I said, there is a free version you can download and install immediately. Go to Follow.net Competitive Intelligence Software
