What are some resources to help build an indexed datastore of Google Maps routes?
Storing map routes is typically done using the Keyhole Markup Language format (see: KML Tutorial).  Displaying KML files in your Maps application is also pretty straightforward.  You can also use a service like Google Map Maker to easily expose custom maps to others. As for indexing and searching the map routes, that depends heavily on your use cases.  Do you need to get routes for a particular user?  A particular window in time?  A bounding box in latitude-longitude coordinates?  You could build an index for any or all of these dimensions with a typical relational database.
