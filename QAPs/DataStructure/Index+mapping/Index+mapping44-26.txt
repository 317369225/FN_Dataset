What is the Indo-Bangladesh land deal? How will it affect India?
Originally Answered: What is the significance of the Land Border Agreement and the transit rights of PM Modi signed in Bangladesh and how will it affect the India-Bangladesh ties?In order to understand the land boundary agreement 2015 we have to first look into the historical aspect. After the 1971 Bangladesh liberation, PM Indira Gandhi and sheikh mujibur Rehman signed an agreement regarding the land boundary agreement in 1972. Bangladesh passed the resolution in the same year but due to emergency conditions in India, Indian parliament couldn't give its ratification. So this agreement became a bone of contention. Under this agreement, there are certain enclaves (called chitmahals) in both the countries(162 total) where some citizenship is ambiguous. So this agreement transfers the enclaves to the respective countries. 111 to Bangladesh and 51 to India. It has various implications 1. The citizens of respective countries would be identified and ambiguities regarding their socio economic development would be taken care of. 2. India would be presented as a helpful country and not a big brother. 3. Bangladesh would allow Indian government to access the north eastern states through its territory (which is a necessity as these states are cutoff from the mainland India) 4. It would result in less immigration of illegal migrants in India because of identified areas/enclaves. This will definitely reduce cross border trafficking thereby strengthening both the countries. 5. India's look east/look south east policy would get boosted as we would have access to the Bangladesh territory. 6. India would help Bangladesh in infrastructure development so that Bangladesh's dependence on China and America reduces and we have a better say in Asian politics. So overall it will strengthen India's position as a peaceful and development oriented country rather than a big brother in south Asian region.
