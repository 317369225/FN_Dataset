Why do Hash Tables need to store the Key of a record?Can't we just insert the Value (without the Key), after we calculate the hash for the table (using the Key)? I guess what I'm trying to get at is, what is the use of the Key after calculating the hash? We can just retrieve the record's Value if the requesting application knows the Key. Am I getting this wrong? Thanks.
You have to store the key because the hash function is imperfect, so you can have several keys that hash to the same index.  When you first hash, you compare the key you want with they key at the index,  they will often match, but if they don't you have to have a fallback action, like peek ahead down the table, or rehash, until you get the key you want. Also you need the key if the hash table gets fuller than optimum, then you, horrors, have to expand the table, which requires you to allocate a larger table and rehash and fill the new table.  To do that of course you need the original keys and values.
