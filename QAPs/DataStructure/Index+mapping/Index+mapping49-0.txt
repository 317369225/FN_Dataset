Is it fair to say that the United States government is corruption-free with negligible bribery? If no, which areas need improvement?
No, it's not fair to say. It is fair to say, though, that the level of corruption is comparatively low. The standard go-to data set for corruption is Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index. Here's the map for the 2014 edition: (How corrupt is your country?) As you can see, the US comes out looking not perfect but rather decent, about on par with Germany, a little behind Switzerland or Denmark, but lightyears ahead of places with really significant corruption problems. (I notice New Zealand got cut off this map, as it often is... they actually score very well.) Obviously, this is a corruption perception index, and perceptions aren't everything, but I think it's widely accepted that TI's methodology, while imperfect, isn't likely to put countries at the top of the list that should be at the bottom or vice versa. Another important note is that TI mostly measures the kind of corruption that would affect businesspeople, especially traveling foreign businesspeople. The US has relatively big problems in some areas of government, like the criminal justice system, that don't really affect that demographic very much. Updated 10 Jun â€¢ View Upvotes
