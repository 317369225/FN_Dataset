As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
Remove Red-Black trees. They are an antiquated data structure that should not be used any more. B-trees are conceptually simpler, faster, use less memory, and are far more widely applicable. Red-Black trees are also a special case of B-trees with a branching factor of 4, but done in a weird and complicated way with multiple linked nodes with colors.
