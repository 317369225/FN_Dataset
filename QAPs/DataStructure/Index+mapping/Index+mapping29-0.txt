Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
Apps that help people find the experiences they want:  frestyl.com is an example of this.  I think the winners will keep their search experience tight and limited to a very specific type of "thing" whereas city guides will diminish in value. do@ is rumored to be launching an offering in this space soon. Localized Q&A:  Hipster, loqly, and localmind are in this space. Group Messaging: GroupMe, Brightkite, Belluga and others and (I think) Marco! are about using the privacy and ubiquity of SMS to connect friends together around location. Real-time informatics:  Adding "layers" of information that is relevant to a user right now are related to Apps that help people find the experiences they want and "Localized Q&A" but there are big chicken/egg problems to solve here or huge data problems to solve (look to do@ to try to solve this through sifting through existing data as opposed to asking users to add new data) Merchant Services:  Services like Gripe (company) and GeoToko are helping local merchants keep track of feedback, analytics, deals and other critical services to merchant engagement. Location-based games:  There haven't been many "true" games played over location yet but people like Ken Seto at EndloopX.com and Jeremy Wright are working on new location-based games. Things that organize things better: This is the area I am personally involved in and with obvious bias stated, I'm betting that helping people keep better track of things and perhaps share these things with others (when they want to) is an area that has a lot of room for improvement.  Some people will see the relevancy to location here.  Others will scratch their heads.  I expect to be out of stealth in the next couple of months!
