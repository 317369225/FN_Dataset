Why do Hash Tables need to store the Key of a record?Can't we just insert the Value (without the Key), after we calculate the hash for the table (using the Key)? I guess what I'm trying to get at is, what is the use of the Key after calculating the hash? We can just retrieve the record's Value if the requesting application knows the Key. Am I getting this wrong? Thanks.
The other answers already make it clear why you have to store the key if you are using the hash table as an associative array: whenever two keys collide (have the same hash value), you need to be able to tell which of the associated values belongs to which key. However,Â  hash tables can also be used in other ways. For example, take a look at Bloom filters. This is an example of a hash table that does not store the keys of inserted items. However, this design choice then implies that the data structure cannot give you exact answers about its contents.
