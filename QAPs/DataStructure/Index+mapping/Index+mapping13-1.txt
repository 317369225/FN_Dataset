What should you do if you want to join against your main database from Hadoop?There are at least a few reasons why just querying it adhoc might be bad: network saturation on your Hadoop cluster, performance of MapReduce, load on your databases.
Don't. Keep a copy of that data on HDFS. Sqoop (http://www.cloudera.com/download...) does this reasonably well, though it might take a while. You'll definitely want to have some sort of incremental update to your copy on hdfs (or a shared drive). You're invariably going to have to do joins of stuff in your main databases against your logs, and it's important to have a sane clear way you sync data. Just doing a full dump and then incremental nightly syncs based on last modified timestamps will carry you a long way.
