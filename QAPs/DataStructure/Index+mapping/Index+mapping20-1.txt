How should we continue to improve Data.gov?
I am particularly interested in a process for combining data from different sources and how Home | Data.gov could be used as a central location to help.  With the Zimmerman verdict creating so much outrage across the country, I have been thinking quite a bit about the root causes of violence, and have found three maps that I would like to correlate.  1) US Global Peace Index map with green and yellow states as the most peaceful Page on Visionofhumanity 2) Racist and homophobic tweets: U.S. students create 'hate map' of bigoted tweets (with images, tweets) · cbccommunity 3) Death and the Poverty belt: LOOK: Death And The 'Poverty Belt'.  I would expect to see states with high levels of racism and poverty as being the most violent.  Other contributing factors: drug use and low levels of education.  Here is an interactive map of the leading causes of death worldwide: USA TOP 15 CAUSES OF DEATH.  A Home | Data.gov service that aggregates data from different sources would be very helpful.  The other feature that comes to mind is one that leverages government spending data, and provides an interactive tool for redistributing the allocation of funds across government agencies and programs.  I would like to see a model similar to "crowdfunding" to be used to compare what the citizens of the US would like to fund vs. what Congress funds.  For example, the House just funded a $595 billion defense spending bill.  Is this really the best use of taxpayers' $$?  I would like to know what everyone thinks, not just what Congress thinks.  And finally, with so many incidents involving ethical failures in the federal sector, I would like to see data on disciplines over the last 3 years at every agency and department.  Here is a good doc that discusses some examples: Encyclopedia of Ethical Failure (EEF) Updated 29 Jul 2013 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Marc Bodnick
