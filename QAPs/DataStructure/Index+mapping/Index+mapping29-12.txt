Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
Geolocation is fundamental to the service the company I co-founded is building, frestyl.com. We help people promote and discover live, local music - basically allowing people to drop their events on a big, time-indexed map. The rest of the site's content is all relative to the users current position - you see music venues nearest to you, as well as other fans and artists. We like to think of ourselves as pretty cutting edge when it comes to creative approaches to geo :]
