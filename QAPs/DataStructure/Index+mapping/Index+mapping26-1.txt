Does anyone really know what "small government" means?
I think  in theory all parties know what small government means but in practice the concept is quite hollow. Without big government the economy would be in shambles, democracy would fail, life expectancies low. Government is 'nannying' as much the people as the military/industrial complex depending if you are left or right whatever you prefer. There aren't examples for small governments that do well except for something you  call failed states. Failed state index map: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fai...
