What are some must-have software for programmers using Linux?
There are lots of great answers here. My additional selection is going to depend on what type of development your projects take you, but in my mind knowing GDB is a must in many cases. Even if you have no need to use it on your code, it will be invaluable if you need to track down a problem in other's code that is breaking yours. Happy developing!
