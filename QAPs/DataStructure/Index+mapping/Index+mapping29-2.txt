Which are the most interesting geolocation start-ups to follow?Something new above foursquare, Gowalla, Badgeville, SCVGR, MyTown, GoRun, etc.
Only stepping in since Tom mentioned our project above (thanks mate). The team here at BNOTIONS.ca is building, as Tom mentioned, a location-based game called Urb-Ops (www.urb-ops.com). The basic premise being that location should be more fun, more social and more exploratory than it is right now. Sure, the game mechanics studied and evolved by Foursquare, SCVNGR, etc are really interesting, but there is very little out there that is truly fun. The first round of location based games (FoursqWar, etc) were interesting, but were largely about layering Risk-type dynamics (single player, place units, fight for territory) on a map. Interesting, but not really doing much besides using location as a basis for where you put your units. Most of the game isn't location-based really. We're hoping (and based on internal feedback this seems to be bearing out) that making a deeper game that is both passive (ie: if all you do is checkin with a location service, you're playing) and active (for higher level players, raids, etc) we'll be able to capture a few different demographics. But, beyond that, we like to play. The location based game arena, we feel, has largely been unexplored and so we're exploring. We'll make some areas work, and other areas we'll fall flat on our faces, but hopefully we'll get close enough that if all we achieve is "fun, interesting, a step in the right direction" that we can buildon that quickly!
