What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
For starters, it's always important to remember that BUZZ is important but not as important as CONVERSION. I say this because my previous company (which failed btw) focused too much on buzz and didn't pay attention to how the buzz can connect to real conversion. That's a whole another topic.. Anyways, there are many ways you can track your buzz, but I will suggest using the following ways. 1. Track your Brand on Keyhole. You can try tracking your URL, brand hashtags etc. to see the conversations around it on Twitter for free at Keyhole - Hashtag Tracking for Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. It'll give you data like the above AND data on the influencer, who tweeted the most, recent tweeters so it goes far beyond "causal monitoring," Mani Karthik (answer below) talks about (he has a great point!). 2. Search your company on Social Mention You need to play around with the keywords, but this gives you a good general overview of your brand online. It doesn't go into platform specific analysis, but it does the trick for a snap overview. So it's mostly for casual monitoring. 3. Google Analytics Is you get a sudden spike in your traffic, make sure to check the medium/source and you can quickly check what the buzz is all about! You probably know this since you mentioned google alerts. If your website traffic is stagnant despite high "buzz" (e.g. lots of people talk about you social).. not sure if its the right kind of buzz you want. Hope that was helpful.
