What hardware is best for ElasticSearch?We have 8TB of data indexed which will scale to 80TB.  We add 300,000 documents to the index per day, planning to scale to 3 million.    Total of 27 million docs, planning to scale to 270m. Query numbers would be in the scale of thousands per day (ie, a small number) but the response time needs to be web-appropriate.
You can look at Hardware for recommendations.  But it's also important to do what you can to store your data in the best format/config based on your usage.  Eg, for time series it's helpful to break apart indices by day.  If you have distinct doc types, it can be valuable to put them in different indices.  If you can, also optimize the index mapping.  It's also important not to have too many shards  (see Capacity Planning). It also depends on how you're querying it - eg, basic text search or you are using it for analytics with aggregations, etc.  There is a lot of tweaking your can do in your indices to make the most of your hardware.  For something of this size, it might be worthwhile to hire Elastic for consulting/support to ask for their recommendations on cluster, server and index configuration.    In general you shouldn't have a machine with more than 64 GB, or if you do, refer to Sizing and Swapping for recommendations on how to configure.
