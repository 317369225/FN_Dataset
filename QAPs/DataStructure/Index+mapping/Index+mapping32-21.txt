What tools do you use to monitor buzz about your startup?You know, besides the obvious like google alerts, etc...
For social media monitoring you can also try Fashionbi (Complete Digital Marketing Tools for the Fashion industry) - although specializing in the fashion and luxury industry, they have the fastest and most up-to-date Twitter analytics which gathers data in real time. They also recently added Weibo on their platform, apart from having many plans to expand into other networks. Their website has a great demo you might want to check out :)
