What is the best balanced binary search tree to know?Splay tree IMO. It is not kept always perfectly balanced, but its amortized complexity for operations are still same [ O(log n) ] as the other completely balanced binary trees but its easier to implement than others - probably more used as well.  One of few disadvantages is it rebalances itself even when a value is read, making it complicated for multi threaded application accessing the data.
