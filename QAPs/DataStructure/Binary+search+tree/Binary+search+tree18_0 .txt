What are some practical applications of binary search trees?Binary search trees are Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages' libraries. Binary Space Partition - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered. Binary trees - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables. Hash trees- used in p2p programs and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available. Heaps - Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* (path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games). Also used in heap-sort. Huffman coding tree-used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats. Syntax tree - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions. T-tree - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so.I myself had a very little knowledge about this, still I could manage to find this through a little reading. :)
