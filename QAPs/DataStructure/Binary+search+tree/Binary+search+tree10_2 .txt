What is the difference between Binary Search tree and Trie in Data Structure?A Binary Search Tree is a tree data structure where each node can have maximum of two child node with the constraint of left child will always be smaller than right child and parent node. While a trie data structure can have maximum of 26 nodes (considering alphabetic storage) where you can store data. Trie is a fast retrieval data structure which facilitates faster access of an element.
