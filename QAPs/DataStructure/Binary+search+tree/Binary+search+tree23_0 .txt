Can a tree be a Binary Search Tree if more than one nodes have the same value?If so how do you implement it?Yes, depending on the definition of a binary search tree. A binary search tree is just a tree that has certain properties. You will see some definitions that require trees to have unique values (by requiring left < current < right). Other definitions will stipulate that the left <= current < right. And still others will allow left <= current <= right. The definition in the very-popular CLRS algorithms book is left <= current <= right.
