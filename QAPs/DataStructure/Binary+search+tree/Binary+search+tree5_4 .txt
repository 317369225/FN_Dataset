What is the best method for checking if a binary tree is a binary search tree?You can start off with the definition of a binary search tree. In a BST every node has a left and right child. The left child must be lesser than or equal to the parent and the right child has to be strictly greater than the parent. Now for the algorithm. For every parent node check if the left child is lesser than or equal to the parent and if the right node is greater than the parent. You do this recursively until you have visited all nodes in the tree. The trick is to properly pass the min and max value a node can have when you make the recursive call.
