How can we convert a binary heap to a binary search tree efficiently?We have to do this inplace. Heap is represented as an array. So basically, we need to convert heap array such that array[i] > array[2*i] and array[i] < array[2*i + 1]. array[2*i] and array[2*i + 1] are left child and right child of array[i] respectively.Assuming you already have a binary heap, and it's a max-heap (largest element at the root node). Take the root element and delete it. This creates a hole at the last array index. Place the largest element there. Keep doing this till you have an empty heap: Now, you have a sorted array, which is a BST. The middle element of this array is the root node of the BST. Edit: Constraints were added after answer was posted, so am keeping the answer here for posterity.
