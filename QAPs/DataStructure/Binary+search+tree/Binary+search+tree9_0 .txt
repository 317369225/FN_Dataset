What is the most popular or most used Balanced Binary Search Tree?If we talk about RB Tree or AVL Tree then no one is perfect , It all depends on requirements or operations you wanna perform. Both RB-Trees and AVL trees are self-balancing BST . Both of them provide lookup and insertion performance. The difference is that RB-Trees guarantee rotations per insert operation. AVL trees maintain a more rigid balance than red-black trees. The path from the root to the deepest leaf in an AVL tree is at most , while in red black trees it's at most ,as a result, lookup in an AVL tree is typically faster, but this comes at the cost of slower insertion and deletion due to more rotation operations. So use an AVL tree if you expect the number of look-ups to dominate the number of updates to the tree else use RB tree if you want some performance on insertion/deletion operations. Edit:Java Collections such as TreeSet and TreeMap classes as well as the Standard C++ sets and maps uses RB tree so RB tree is more widely used while AVL tree is used as reference of RB tree.
