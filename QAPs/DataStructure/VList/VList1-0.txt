How do I use Ansys for obtaining dimensions for a design?
If you using Ansys APDL, assuming you already know how to either create or import geometries in ANSYS Go to PlotCtrls> Numberings> Switch ON the required numbers>OK Create the geometry if you haven't. If you have already, enter this in the command prompt    LPLOT,ALL (if you want to plot Lines) or     APLOT,ALL (if you want to plot surfaces) or     VPLOT,ALL (if you want to plot 3D objects     Then LLIST,ALL (to list list of lines and their exact length) or    ALIST,ALL (to list surfaces with their exact areas or     VLIST,ALL ( to list 3D objects with their volumes) *use p instead of ALL, to specifically pick a entity*  This will list your selected entities in a serial order. All you have to do is look for the entity number in the model and check its dimension using your predefined units.  You can also use the GUI method in APDL, but this one is much quicker. For future use, go to ANSYS Help to view the commands and how to use them. Otherwise, here's a list http://mostreal.sk/html/c-index.htm P.S. I will update the answer on the procedure to measure dimensions in Workbench later.
