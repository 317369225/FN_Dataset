How can you get job in Google after 3 years of passing college if you are an average coder and know some algorithms and some good data structures?
So I'm assuming you have graduated and now work full time at a software company.  At this point, you are worst off then fresh graduates from a high end University who can easily get an interview with Google but it's never too late! 1. Getting the phone interview.  This is crucial and can be done with a: 1. Good resume and the chance/ability to approach a recruiter. 2. Find Google at a career fair or whatever it takes to be in person.  Coding competitions can be a place too or MeetUps. 3. Find someone on LinkedIn that works for Google or has worked for Google. The key point here is that you need to meet someone either in person or connect with them somehow.  This will get you a referral which substantially improves your chances at getting a phone screening.  Applying on Google's site is nearly a complete waste of time since they receive an absurd amount of resumes because they place no limits to how many positions you can apply for. 2. Passing the coding interview. There are at least 3 rounds of interviews.  One is a simple phone screening with the recruiter followed by a phone coding interview done with Google Docs. 1. Anyone who knows a bit of coding and CS will get past the phone screening.  Just speak to the recruiter clearly and nicely. 2. The coding challenge shouldn't be tough but try to demonstrate your skills and ability to communicate about what you are coding out. 3. If you passed their phone technical interview, you will be flown down to Google for a day of interviews with I believe 5 interviewers all done with white-boarding.    So practice coding and practice white board coding as well. Lastly, Google uses many different languages.  Java is one of the big 3 they use.
