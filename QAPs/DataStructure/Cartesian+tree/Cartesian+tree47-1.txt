Literary Fiction: What's the most heartbreaking novel you've ever read?
I was seven or eight and my mom called me down for dinner. I was upstairs on my bed, under the covers, holding my bear (she's good at absorbing tears) and shaking and heaving like my heart would break. Rivers and rivers of tears. I'd cried before, as much as any kid, but not from such deep sadness and sorrow. It was the first time I remember being so wretched. I had a light on my bed, a clip-lamp that was really warm (I used to put my thermometer in it when I faked a temperature). I shone down on me, creating a spotlight, which was fitting because I finally gathered myself to go downstairs, puffy and wet, and felt like my entire family was going to notice me.  Like me and my misery would be in the spotlight. I couldn't have been more wrong. They noticed the tears, of course. But not the cause, not what I felt, not my emotions. One of the many times the lesson that 'one just don't have emotions in front of others' was written into my mental playbook of how to exist. I remember it perfectly. The details of the experience, and the emotions. No other book has affected me so much. Oh, the book was Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls. An honest (if not overly-sentimental) story about family, love, loyalty and loss. I won't say more, you should read it. It brought me the first real heartbreak of my life.
