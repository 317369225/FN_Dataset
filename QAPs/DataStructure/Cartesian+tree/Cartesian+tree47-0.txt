Literary Fiction: What's the most heartbreaking novel you've ever read?
My vote for the most heartbreaking novel I've read recently goes to A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry. “You see, we cannot draw lines and compartments and refuse to budge beyond them. Sometimes you have to use your failures as stepping-stones to success. You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair.' He paused, considering what he had just said. 'Yes', he repeated. 'In the end, it's all a question of balance.” Mistry's portrayal of the devastating and often inhumane side of Indian caste system, communal and political unrest, corrupt bureaucracy, period of emergency declared in late 70's, patriarchism, forced labor and sterilization/family planning, gentrification etc. was all brutally honest. However, although beautifully written, I struggled to find that "fine" balance the title suggests. Unlike so many who loved it (like John Burgess here), it was a painful read for me. It was like torturing an audience by throwing in plots of at least 20 sad and painful Indian soaps into one tragic movie. I would still highly recommend it though. Honorable Mention: And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini "I learned that the world didn't see the inside of you, that it didn't care a whit about the hopes and dreams, and sorrows, that lay masked by skin and bone. It was as simple, as absurd, and as cruel as that." A charming yet heartbreaking set of stories of people spanning generations and continents. Their narratives intertwined by their interconnected past. As Sai Janani Ganesan mentioned in her answer, this is wonderful read. Hosseini's other book 'Kite Runner was a bit heartbreaking too. Happy reading!
