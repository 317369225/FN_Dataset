What is the best way to extract the most important image from a web page given its DOM tree structure?
Things you may want to look at: Check if meta tag for "thumbnail" or "image_src" is pointing to any image Size of the image is a very important criterion. Images with good visibility ratio height/width or height/width and having a minimum height or width (possibly > 50) How well the alt tags of the image matches with the title or meta description of the page. Another thing that may help here is the position of the image. If it occurs in the first half of the page, then the chances are higher to be best pic for the page representation.Sorting on these three criteria combined should work well.
