Literary Fiction: What's the most heartbreaking novel you've ever read?
I am a HUGE fan of Khaled Hosseini's writing, the fact that he explores love in a familial setting, and in atypical relationships is brilliant. All of his novels have brought me to tears, but the one that touched me the most is : And the mountains echoed It made me think long and hard about my own identity. My favourite quotes from the book: “But it is important to know this, to know your roots. To know where you started as a person. If not, your own life seems unreal to you. Like a puzzle. Vous comprenez? Like you have missed the beginning of a story and now you are in the middle of it, trying to understand.” "They say, Find a purpose in your life and live it. But, sometimes, it is only after you have lived that you recognize your life had a purpose, and likely one you never had in mind.”
