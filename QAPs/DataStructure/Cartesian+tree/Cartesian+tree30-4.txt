What is the best way to extract the most important image from a web page given its DOM tree structure?
The most important image on a web page can be a debatable topic, but in most cases its the logo given we are talking about random set of web pages originating from different domains. One of the use cases in which you would need to do it is when you are attaching a link on another site and the site generates a summary of that link ( like facebook retrieves summary of the link and 3-4 thumbnails when you attach a link to the status message). If your use case is similar then the best option is to show few options. Based on Dom tree structure, I would say the best way to determine a important image from the web page is to check dimensions of images and give priority to the image with larger dimensions (as the publisher considers it important to embed a large image) and then definitely the logo on the webpage needs to be considered imp (look for the first image on the webpage leaving out the favicon) It’s an interesting question :) Updated 263w ago • View Upvotes
