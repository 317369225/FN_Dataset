What are some habits in database design for a web developer to build early on?
The best thing to learn about databases is 3NF -- third normal form. Briefly stated, it means creating a unique record in a table for repeated information. The Wikipedia article has a lot of technical/academic language, but the examples illustrate the principal: Third normal form A common example of 3NF is when storing customer records in an e-commerce website: a customer will have a shipping address and a billing address -- for most people, this will be the same! So, instead of creating fields for shipping and billing addresses, you would create a table for addresses, and two foreign keys in you customer table for shipping and billing. This is also the convention many web frameworks use for storing and retrieving data, it helps you develop a healthy instinct for how to separate data concerns in your code, and it improves your understanding of dependencies within a system. 3NF takes a bit more time up front, and a bit more code in the long run -- but I'm confident it'll open up opportunities and save you headaches over time. That's my general advice on common skills to learn for databases. Things get a lot more exciting when you dive into the specifics! :)
