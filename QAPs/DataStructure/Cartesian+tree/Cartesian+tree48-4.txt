Python (programming language):Â What are some cool Python tricks?
I'm not sure, whether these things are tricks - you would down-vote me in the worst case ;-) adding to *.py script #!/usr/bin/env python line, make it executable and run by: ./script.py generating HTML documentation: pydoc -w ./script.py else statement after for/while loops (go into, if there was no break) What I have ? pip freeze Is there something ? pip search something Do I need something ? pip install something We can not: def yetanotherfunc():     yaf_int = 1     def childfunc():         global yaf_int         yaf_int = 3 but we can: def yetanotherfunc():    yaf_int = [1]    def childfunc():        yaf_int[0] = 3 deep copy: import copy sth_deepcopy = copy.deepcopy(sth) Why do we have "private" attributes in Python: http://stackoverflow.com/questio... for in protocole: Understanding Python's "for" statement Generators can be use as alternative to callbacks - for example yields if there some big data has arrived.
