How is malloc implemented?
Malloc is required to do two things: request more virtual address space from the kernel if needed, and to find enough contiguous space in the virtual address segment to return to the calling thread. The first is operating system dependent, but on Linux and probably most Unixes the system call is sys_brk which adjusts the size of a process's data segment. Most mallocs will do this the same way. The second is completely implementation dependent, and Linux malloc, tcmalloc and jemalloc (amongst others) will have potentially entirely different approaches. These will trade off speed of allocation against the amount of fragmentation (and therefore unusable address space).
