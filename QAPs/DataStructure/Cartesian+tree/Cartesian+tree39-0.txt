What is the meaning of this saying? "If it's in the V, it's in the tree and if it's in the arc, it's out of the park"
Disclaimer: I am not a cricketing pundit and my answer is based on my own take on this. Firstly, I would like to tell you what I understand from that saying and then try to relate to his innings.   Background Analogy Ankit has used here may be true for Golf but I don't think it work for cricket  at least in this situation. I think "V" include backlift, point of contact and good follow through while hitting straight down the ground. These shots include straight, on and off drives. This shot when seen from bowling end umpire position looks vertical shot i.e. if you consider batsman foot as point of origin of a Cartesian co-ordinate system  then flow of bat will trace a trajectory along y-axis(some other components will be there in case of on and off drives). On the other hand, "Arc"  means the trajectory traced by batsman's bat about him in circular motion in 360 degree, 0 degree being the position when bat is along the pitch and perpendicular to  stumps. This is kind of horizontal shot. These shots usually end up as square cut(sometimes upper cut) and pull(sometimes hook). Relation to Miller's inning Now, if you watch his inning, every time he hits a six straight down the ground,it turn out to be pretty big six,considering the size of PCA cricket ground which is huge as compared to other smaller stadiums like M. Chinnaswamy stadium. According to me, what it means is every time he hit straight , he hits a biggie whereas whenever he plays an upper cut or pull shot it just passes the rope(at the end in both cases he hits six, only the length changes). I am assuming commentator was referring to the trees outside  stadium in this case. One six on long on is not huge because it was outcome of pull shot. I hope my answer will clear your doubt regarding that statement. You could watch that inning again here : Very mature inning I would say. Good for SA.
