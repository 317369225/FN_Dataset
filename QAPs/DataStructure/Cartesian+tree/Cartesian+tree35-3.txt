I feel like my life is going on the wrong way and I don't know what to do. What can I do?
Do you have any plan if you quit from your study ? What else that you can do equally well / or know very well compared to your knowledge in physics ? Why everything is no longer interesting to you ? What inspired you to take this subject at the beginning ? How much time you have spent for in this study ?  How do you find yourself compared to other students ? Think deeply, before taking any action. I have seen a lot of people find the thing that they know exactly what to do, so they quite to do what they love. Some appear  to be very happy, others don't. Some people such as me are not so happy with the area in bachelor studies, but do bear until graduation. Some of us took a career which aims toward a completely different area; some still hang around a similar one. Again, some seem to be happy, some don't. The only difference between these two groups of people is that the former has a very good plan, but the latter does not. By good, I mean they really do have a very precise thought about what they are going through. So, it really depends on what you have in your mind. For any directions, there is a chance of being successful as much as failed.
