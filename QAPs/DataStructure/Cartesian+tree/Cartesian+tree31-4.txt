Does acceleration cause spacetime curvature?
I must agree with anonymous. Acceleration does not cause spacetime curvature. If it did then all electromagnetic radiation (photons) would cause curvature and not travel in straight lines. We know from experiments starting in the 1920s that it takes a large mass to cause light to curve. So light traveling at approximately 186,232 miles per second travels in a straight line until it encounters some type of mass (like the Earth) which has gravity due to its density. The rotating black hole is still a hypothetical untestable entity.
