Taking out the concept of infinite, what would be left in mathematics?
If you exclude even potential infinities, you'll have to forego the possibility of bisecting every line segment.  There goes geometry. You'll have to give up even the simplest axioms for natural numbers (nonnegative integers) because they would imply there are infinitely many of them.  There goes arithmetic.  (See below for three axioms that imply infinity.) These axioms, for example, imply infinitely many numbers: For each number n, there is a next number, also called its successor, denoted σ(n). Two different numbers don't have the same successor, that is, m ≠ n implies σ(m) ≠ σ(n). There is exactly one number which is not the successor of any other, and it's denoted 0.
