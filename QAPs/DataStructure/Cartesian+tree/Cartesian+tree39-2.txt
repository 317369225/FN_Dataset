What is the meaning of this saying? "If it's in the V, it's in the tree and if it's in the arc, it's out of the park"
"If it's in the V, it's in the tree and if it's in the arc, it's out of the park" was said to David Miller as a child by his father. He told this some time during his interview. What this quote basically means is that if the ball is in your hitting range, it should probably go for a six out of the park.
