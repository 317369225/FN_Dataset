What are some habits in database design for a web developer to build early on?
Think about reusability in your code, and how your data structures and naming habits will make your code more reusable. I hope you have a lengthy career; and if you do, you'll be working on many applications. Without a doubt many of those will have user tables, and those users will have addresses, and so on. All your tables will have a primary key, a created date, an updated date - possibly a createdby and updatedby field. I like to add three FLAG fields that I can use as a database administrator - never queried by the app itself. Each of my tables has a RecordStatus field. Every single table I create has these fields and I always use the same field names. So quickly form a consistent plan for naming fields, keys and tables. That way those same data structures can be moved, along with the code, from project to project. For instance, years ago I created a table for addresses with international support, based on an ISO document I found. Even if I'm working on a project that is based in a single country I will use the same table. I simply hide the country field on the GUI. Along with that table I have amassed supporting tables and data for postcode lookup, regional divisions, continent divisions, language divisions, STD codes, and so on. I can reuse all that data and code with little adjustment because my address table's structure is always the same for every app I write. Whenever I need an address table I know it will plug into my application easily - and that I've already written lots of code to work with it.
