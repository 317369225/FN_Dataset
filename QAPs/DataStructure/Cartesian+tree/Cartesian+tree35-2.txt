I feel like my life is going on the wrong way and I don't know what to do. What can I do?
You may need psychological advice, which I can't and won't give. But you can talk to a career or guidance counselor about your situation. One option is to take a leave of absence from college and get a job. That may help your perspective. Again, talk to someone locally who can help you.
