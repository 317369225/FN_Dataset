What algorithms should a first year computer science student know?
I'm pretty familiar with a good chunk of different programs, and these tend to be the common ones in the first year as first year typically covers programming, here's the common set of algorithms you'll find are covered (keep in mind that many start introducing data structures in larger numbers than algorithms): -Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort) -Linear Search -Introduction to Recursion (usually Divide and Conquer examples like concepts including Fib(n) and sometimes even Binary Search) Usually you find an introduction to the idea of asymptotic analysis, but it is normally not dealt a deeper coverage until 2nd or 3rd year of a CS program due to the mathematics required.
