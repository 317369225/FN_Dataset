How does growing up affect the way we think about the world?
When you are a school kid, you cry for very lame things. You start to jolt everyone if you don't get your favourite food, you start screaming if someone breaks your stuffs that don't even matter, you deny your family's judgement for some stupid advice of your friends, your friends matter a bit too much for you then, maybe more than your family. You ask them to swear on your life if you want a guaranteed truth, as you sincerely believe that they won't be lying then. You make fun of some people for not being 'normal' under various circumstances. You believe that promises once made can never be broken. You walk shrugging off everything, or taking up anything. But, when you grow up, you see pain, misery, and sorrow. Your judgements fade. You understand that everyone has got one, or rather, many battles to fight. How one behaves under a given circumstance is not meant to be judged every time. Maybe he/she is facing something no one ever has, or maybe he/she is going through something terrible. You get this thing when you grow up. You don't cry for your favourite food, as you see a lot of people out there dying of starvation. You don't scream for broken stuffs, as you find yourself lucky already to possess them. When you grow up, you realise that there is a lot of despair in this world. You, then, try to bring a little peace and spread happiness, for it is the least you can do. You see that there are a lot of beautiful people still living in this world, and it's not that bad. You understand that family is the most important thing in this world. You begin to believe that this world is not some cocky place, but it is a place that deserve to be beautiful, and we, the people who dwell here, own the responsibility of making it happen! :)
