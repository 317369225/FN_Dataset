What are some of the more recent groundbreaking ideas in philosophy?
May not be groundbreaking, but certainly interesting to me are two theories. One is called Possible Worlds, put forth by David Lewis around 1986. It is a way of describing this universe as one of many possible universes. Another of my favorites is called emergence, it is a scientific and philosophical theory put forth by Stuart Kauffman and many other scientists describing how complex systems emerge from relatively simple interactions. This has a lot to do with the philosophy of science, but has roots as far back as Aristotle. As always, the Wikipedia pages for each. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E...
