Taking out the concept of infinite, what would be left in mathematics?
An endo-functor in the category of finite sets and bijections is called a species (of structures). There is a composition operation on species (obtained as a disjoint "sum" of cartesian "products"), so called because it is a natural* generalization of composition of exponential formal power series (*natural in the precise sense of a strict monoidal structure). This and the rest of the Theory of Combinatorial Species, invented and developed by the French [1], allows one to replicate a great deal of real-analysis using only combinatorics (as opposed to calculus). [1] André Joyal. Une théorie combinatoire des séries formelles. Advances in Mathematics 42, 1-82 (1981). English abstract: This paper presents a combinatorial theory of formal power series. The combinatorial interpretation of formal power series is based on the concept of species of structures. A categorical approach is used to formulate it. A new proof of Cayley’s formula for the number of labelled trees is given as well as a new combinatorial proof (due to G. Labelle) of Lagrange’s inversion formula. Polya’s enumeration theory of isomorphism classes of structures is entirely renewed. Recursive methods for computing cycle index polynomials are described. A combinatorial version of the implicit function theorem is stated and proved. The paper ends with general considerations on the use of coalgebras in combinatorics. Updated 4w ago
