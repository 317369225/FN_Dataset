Is it worth spending a lot of time practicing for programming contests and getting very good at it, with the hope that someday it might lead to a job for a big company such as Google or Facebook?
Ok, let me try to answer from a new perspective (the existing answers are negative): Practically, I think it may be worth, as long as you enjoy programming contests. I got full-time offers from both Facebook and Google. I'd say 70% of the questions asked are closely related to competitive programming problems. Many of them are algorithm problems (phone and whiteboard interviews). So sorry, I'd disagree with the Venn Diagram in another answer. I spent quite a lot of time (when compared with my peers) in competitive programming. HOWEVER, I do feel like getting offers from these big companies is more like a by-product for me - I truly enjoy programming contests and I enjoy the satisfaction when I get a tricky problem solved during/during the contests. So, in my case, I didn't spend time practicing for programming contests aiming at getting an offer from some big company; rather, I participated in programming contests because I just enjoy the process itself. However, as a final remark, the skill set for being a successful and productive software engineer is quite different from what you need to perform well in programming contests. You don't have to be a red coder, or clear first few rounds in Google Code Jam or Hacker Cup, to get an offer from big companies like Google or Facebook.
