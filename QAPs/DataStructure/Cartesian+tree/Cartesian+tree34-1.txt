What is your favorite tree?
Neem tree(Azadirachta indica). 1.This tree's leaves have helped me reduce the occurrence of pimples and acne during my teenage years(I give it the credit because I never had that problem as it detoxifies your blood). The leaves are acerbic(cant really describe it) and one will want to throw up the moment s/he starts chewing it. The new leaves are generally consumed.(the maroonish ones) 2. It kept my tonsil problem at bay.(My grandmas remedy was to apply the paste of its leaves on the swollen tonsils, worked for me) 3. The stem kept my teeth and gums strong(the stem is used as a tooth brush and I don't use it now but my father still does) 4. Neem along with other ingredients is used by my mother for face packs and other beautification purposes. Links to know more about this plant.
