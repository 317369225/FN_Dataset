How can you get job in Google after 3 years of passing college if you are an average coder and know some algorithms and some good data structures?
I believe to best answer this question, it is best to break the hiring process into two distinct steps: landing the interview, receiving an offer. The skills for both are actually very different with some overlap. To get an offer, first you must interview, so let's start there. My best advice is from personal experience. Do everything you can to "stand out" in a good way. Big companies like Google attract more candadites than they know what to do with, which means they have to filter them somehow to not waste time. You will want to have a great resume. Search online for guides and advice for this. At a minimum, have 8 people review you resume (and cover letter if applicable) and make sure at least two are proffesionals in the industry you want to join. Conferences often have mock interviews and resume reviews. Use this! You can try alternative channels to get noticed. Google sponsors events on their campuses, so if you live close to them, try to go! They track attendee info and even seperate students and industry. They would rather recruit someone with an active interest in community than someone who just did a degree and didn't spend time outside of school exploring their profession. They also attend conferences and hackathons. You have many options here. Consider an internship if you don't think you can land the job interview or pass the interview. It is much easier to pass an internship interview and be hired into a full position from there. Once you land an interview, you'll need to pass. There are many good resources for this. I suggest the book "cracking the coding interview" because it helped prep me and helped me get lots of interviews and job offers. Good luck and stay positive! You will fail at first, but it will get easier!
