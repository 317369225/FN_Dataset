What are some of the more recent groundbreaking ideas in philosophy?
I wouldn't recommend "recent" as necessarily a good measure of "groundbreaking" in philosophy. If you are looking for a basis of various streams of thought that now abound, you could read Will Duran'ts The Story of Philosophy. His classic line on Spinoza is a gem of quiet humor and empathy:"Nietzsche said somewhere that the last Christian died upon the cross; he had forgotten Spinoza."
