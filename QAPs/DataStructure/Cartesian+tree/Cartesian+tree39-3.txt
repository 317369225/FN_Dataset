What is the meaning of this saying? "If it's in the V, it's in the tree and if it's in the arc, it's out of the park"
Technically V describes the area covered between long-off and long-on. Numerous international and national cricketers have shown immense interest in hitting the ball straight down the ground. Those are the players, who more often than not, play with a straight bat. Undeniably, these shots are spectacular. Though I'm not really sure, but the term "in the arc" refers to the ball, which happens to come in the 'free swing' zone of the bat and consequently gets clobbered away for a fair amount of distance.
