Taking out the concept of infinite, what would be left in mathematics?
This idea is known as Finitism, and has been explored, although most interest was around the early 20th Century when the question of foundations was first being actively investigated. Hilbert, in an attempt to moderate between Cantor and the Intuitionists, tried to prove that finite mathematics was sufficient to prove any theorem that requires infinite objects, but he failed in this. GÃ¶del eventually proved that Hilbert's attempt was futile. Primitive recursive arithmetic is a theory of the natural numbers which is considered to be finitist because it does not include quantifiers, and hence has no way of talking about infinite sets, but it does implicitly assume the existence of a countably infinite number of possible variables. There are other, more strictly finitist, approaches such as Elementary function arithmetic, which is weaker than PRA but is conjectured (by Harvey Friedman) to contain "most" "natural" finite mathematics. That is, he believes that natural examples of arithmetical statements (statements that only talk about finite objects) that cannot be proven in EFA are rare. Reuben Goodstein was a finitist, and did work on reconstructing analysis from a finitist point of view. He happens to be my academic grandfather, but I haven't read his finitist analysis stuff.
