What are some uses of a C++ library which can help make competitive programming more efficient and elegant?
Recently I found about SGI library which is included in the C++ STL library, it comes with some untraditional data structures (not likely to be supported by a language by default) such as Rope (data structure), Trie, Radix tree, Splay tree, Order statistic tree, Cartesian tree and Skip list. These built-in data structures can save you much time and fuss implementing them from scratch during a contest, many problems can be solved in less than 5 lines using these libraries :) i.e :This problem is a direct problem on Rope data structure ACM-ICPC Live Archive For further information you can look up these data structures on wikpedia, also you can check this post on codeforces to get an idea on how to use them Implicit cartesian tree in GNU C++ STL. - Codeforces
