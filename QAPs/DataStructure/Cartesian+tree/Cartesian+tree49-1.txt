How can l learn exactly how a GPS is made without any prior knowledge?
You can't - exactly - you won't live long enough. All modern technology such as GPS is built upon an earlier body of knowledge generated in a global economy by millions of people. Not all of it is public, and not all of it is written down. You can learn how a GPS works, given standard radio and computer components. You can learn how electronic components work, and how computers work, and how operating systems work, and radio antennae, and LCD displays etc. but by the time you have done that most of your knowledge will be obsolete and you still won't be able to build them from scratch yourself starting with nothing but a hand axe. But to build something new you don't have to understand it exactly - software and electronics are modular. You read the application notes and join modules together, only creating new ones from scratch if you can'tÂ  buy them or licence the design. For a big project, you need a team of people with complementary skills. To get hired, you'd probably need an electronic engineering or computer science degree, and to get that you'd need maths and physics at school, though you could just start straight in at the reading application notes and building things stage and eductating yourself as you go by doing research online.
