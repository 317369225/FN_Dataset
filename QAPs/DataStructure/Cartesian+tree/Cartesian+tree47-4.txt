Literary Fiction:Â What's the most heartbreaking novel you've ever read?
SHIVER by Maggie Stiefvater. It's a young adult novel with beautiful language, and characters that are stark and real. It's my job to be critical and somewhat detached from books, but this one ripped my heart out and put it back in sideways so that it didn't quite fit in my chest anymore. Powerful.
