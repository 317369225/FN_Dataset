What are algebraic datatypes?
"Algebraic" refers to the property that an Algebraic Data Type is created by "algebraic" operations. The "algebra" here is "sums" and "products": "sum" is alternation (A | B,meaning A or B butnotboth) "product" is combination (A B,meaning A and B together) Examples: data Pair = P Int Double isa pairof numbers, an Intanda Double together. The tag P is used (inconstructorsand pattern matching) to combine the contained values into a single structure that can be assigned to a variable. data Pair = I Int | D Double isjustone number, either an Int orelsea Double.In this case, the tags I and D areused(in constructors and pattern matching) to distinguish between the two alternatives. Sums and products can be repeatedly combined into an arbitrarily large structures. Algebraic Data Type is not to be confused with *Abstract* Data Type, which (ironically) is its opposite, in some sense. The initialism "ADT" usually means *Abstract* Data Type, but GADT usually means Generalized *Algebraic* Data Type.
