What is the most efficient way to store large amount of GIS data?
Hi, I'm not sure what you mean by "location updates" but I think it may be worth your while to see what Elastic Search and Solr are offering in regards to geo indexing. Both systems behave, at least in some aspects, like document stores where you can add/update documents. Both systems have very strong support for geolocation based indexing and searching. If these are small updates you need to keep track off and you would like to treat the locations as a part of a location tree (street->zip->city-> etc) then it might be interesting for you to look into graph databases. If you do, look into graphs, then you would treat each device and each location as a vertex and each report/update as an edge. That could open up interesting analytic options for you on nearest neighbor, shortest path etc. I would also like to second mr. Roger's PostgreSQL+PostGIS option. I have used it and it served me well. Regards,   -Stefán
