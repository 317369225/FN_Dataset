Python (programming language): What are some cool Python tricks?
Create infinities Infinity, and it's brother minus infinity, comes in handy once in a while. my_inf = float('Inf')99999999 > my_inf-> Falsemy_neg_inf = float('-Inf')my_neg_inf > -99999999-> False Intuitive comparisons A great example of the simplicity of python syntax. x = 23 > x == 1-> False1 < x < 3-> True10 < 10*x < 30 -> True10 < x**5 < 30 -> False100 < x*100 >= x**6 + 34 > x <= 2*x <5-> True Enumerate it Ever wanted to find that damn index when you're inside a loop? mylist = [4,2,42]for i, value in enumerate(mylist):    print i, ': ', value-> 0: 4-> 1: 2-> 2: 42 Reverse it This has grown to become a part of my morning ritual. Reverse. Anywhere. Anytime. All the time. # Reverse the list itself:mylist = [1,2,3]mylist.reverse()print mylist-> [3,2,1]# Iterate in reversefor element in reversed([1,2,3]): print element-> 3-> 2-> 1 Ultra compact list generating Using nested list comprehensions you can save a great deal typing, while having fun impressing the girls. [(x**2, y**2, x**2+y**2) for x in range(1,5) for y in range(1,5) if x<=y and x%2==0]-> [(4, 4, 8), (4, 9, 13), (4, 16, 20), (16, 16, 32)] NB! Crazy nesting should be used with extreme caution. Readability > Girls-> True Splat call '*' is called the splat operator, and may make you smile. It automagically unpacks stuff in a function call. def foo(a, b, c):    print a, b, cmydict = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}mylist = [10, 20, 30]foo(*mydict)-> a, b, cfoo(**mydict)-> 1, 2, 3foo(*mylist)-> 10 20 30 The cute empty string trick By using two single quotes ('') and a dot (.), we have access to all the builtin string functions. This can come in handy, you see. ''.join('I','Want','Just','One','String')-> 'IWantJustOneString' Itertools The itertools module provide some useful and efficient functions for us. For example from itertools import chain''.join(('Hello ', 'Kiddo'))-> 'Hello Kiddo'''.join((x for x in chain('XCVGOHST', 'VSBNTSKFDA') if x == 'O' or x == 'K'))-> 'OK' When Las Vegas just isn't enough Buy in some beer, invite a few (exactly 10) friends over, and copy/paste this sexy line of python code into your favorite interpreter. The rules are: 1. Press Enter 2. The one who gets the least stars have to CHUG CHUG CHUG! 3. Press the up arrow 4. Goto 1. print "\n".join(str(i)+":\t"+"*"*randint(1,10) for i in range(1,11)) Update: Make python enums I like this enumification trick: class PlayerRanking:  Bolt, Green, Johnson, Mom = range(4)PlayerRanking.Mom-> 4 Updated 180w ago • View Upvotes
