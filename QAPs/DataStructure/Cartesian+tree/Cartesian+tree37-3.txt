What is the best logo ever created?
The origins white cross suspended in a red field date back to the 12th and 13th centuries.[1] The dimensions of the cross as represented in the Swiss flag were formally established in 1889. Swiss companies proudly show their nationalism in their branding. For watches, no crosses are needed. It's simply "Swiss Made" — the standard of watchmaking. "To consumers, the Swiss flag is a seal of approval, a visual representation of luxury, quality, precision and trust."[2] What's immediate is that the product is recognized as being Swiss made. Few if any countries use their countries flag or coat of arms in any similar fashion or are more product of their products' origin.   More recently and brilliantly, Target repurposed the target icon as their company logo. Even without knowing the store, people know it's a target not necessarily Target. Flag of Switzerland [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fla...
