What algorithms should a first year computer science student know?
First year computer science students are mainly focused on learning how to program.  MIT's first algorithms course, 6.006, is therefore a pretty gentle introduction.  It covers * core concepts of runtime and asymptotic analysis * divide and conquer * sorting (merge sort, quicksort) * searching (balanced binary search trees, hash tables) * graphs (breadth and depth first search, topological sorting) * dynamic programming (shortest paths, text justification) That's really enough for a first year.  Our next course, 6.046, dives much deeper.
