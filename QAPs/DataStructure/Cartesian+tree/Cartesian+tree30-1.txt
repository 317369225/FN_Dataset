What is the best way to extract the most important image from a web page given its DOM tree structure?
This is a fun open-ended question :) Let's try to break it up in to smaller parts. Finding the most important image amounts to: Removing boilerplate HTML Determining structural importance of images Determining semantic importance of images Ranking and returning the best one. Boilerplate removal is an important step. You can either learn boilerplates from multiple HTML pages of the same site, or go with a heuristic. Arc90.com's "Readability" bookmarklet does a pretty good job at this. Structural importance: As Sunil and Dipen have pointed out, it should be straightforward to pick the biggest image. Something to note is that you want to pick the biggest image that does not have text in front of it, to avoid "background.jpgs". Semantic importance: This is the fun part. First off, important images are usually around important text (measured by cartesian distance, say). There are two key sources of important text. First is the text in your document: look for headers / large fonts / darkest colors / anchor texts / "impactful words"(a la sentiment analysis) that are nearest to the image, or similar to the ALT text. The second is document.referrer, which can let you figure out what link the user is coming from. If they're coming to the page based on a Google search for "handbags", then handbag.jpg would definitely be a good candidate. The last step is to rank based on the importance scores we talked about, and you're done!
