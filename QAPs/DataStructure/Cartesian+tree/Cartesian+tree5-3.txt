What are the algorithms required to solve all problems (using C++) in any competitive coding contest?
To add to this list, I've pulled some from CodeForces blog and a Google Doc that I found online from Bohdan Pryshchenko. Good Blog Post Resources about Algorithm and Data Structures - Codeforces It has literally all the tutorials on blogs of CodeForces. Really hope this helps! It includes: C++ STL String Processing Data Structures Game Theory Dynamic Programming Geometry Graphs Sorting & Searching Number Theory Misc Google Doc from Bohdan Pryshchenko: (written by Poojit Sharma) Programming Camp Syllabus This is a really nice doc with practice problems, overview of all topics for programming competitions. Finally, the extra long list on CodeChef which has tutorials, practice problems, and more :) CodeChef Data Structures and Algorithms A grain of salt with these lists: Practice is key. Understanding is key. Therefore, make sure you understand the algorithms very well, before practicing and always implement to further your understanding. Good luck!
