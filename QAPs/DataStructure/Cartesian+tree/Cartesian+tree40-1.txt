How do I do this math algebra?
Think of a number and try it as an answer for the value of x or whatever symbol is being used to represent the 'think of a number' question. When you choose a number any number the person asking you the question is saying to themselves 'Let the number they think of be x' Now you can take the slow approach and keep thinking of different numbers until both sides of the equation equal the same value or you can try to solve what you are looking at and find value(s) of the unknown. example of an unknown: How high is a specific tree? Now the question is how do I describe a line? We start off with straight lines like y=x. Descartes sat in his bed and wondered how to describe the position of objects in relation to himself and created Cartesian co-ordinates to solve this very problem. Let x be the wall behind me and y be a line along the length of my body. Now I can tell my servant to take five steps from me in the direction of the wall to my right and 5 steps in the direction of my feet. Then he realised that he had invented a way or describing a line without he need for numbers as all the numbers he could think of where already in a line. and this is a way of understanding algebra.
