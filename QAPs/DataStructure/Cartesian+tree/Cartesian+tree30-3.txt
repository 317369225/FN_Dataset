What is the best way to extract the most important image from a web page given its DOM tree structure?
Extracting most relevant content is not easy, but there are some libraries that will help you with that. Take a look at Readability JS library. You can find it on Github. Some poeple ported in to other languages too. Regarding images. The project I'm working on has an algorithm that does the following: - extract from document urls of images with extenstions jpg, png only. I consider other extensions most likely page design elements. PNG still steps on that area but there is good amount if ligit png images that are part of the content. - I check aspect ratio of the image. If it's 3:1 I consider it ad image (horizontal or vertical) - check perimeter of the image. Ignore images smaller than 250px or just give it appropriate score. - also, check position of the image in relation to some important HTML tags. For example image located below and closest to H1 tag will get higher score. - each image will be tagged with a score and then one with highest score will be chosen as the "beauty shot" :)
