What is the most efficient way to store large amount of GIS data?
One of the previous answers suggested that you may have a lot of data, while the question only mentions 26M updates a day (which is not much), but not the total working set size. So, before going any further, what is the amount of data which you would like to efficiently work with? As for geo index, Tarantool in-memory database has an RTREE index (tarantool/tarantool) with nearest-neighbor and within-a-rectangle search functions. This is not nearly as rich as PostgreSQL GIST API, but then again, the question doesn't specify what else is necessary to be able to do with data, beyond store.
