What is the meaning of this saying? "If it's in the V, it's in the tree and if it's in the arc, it's out of the park"
This particular statement is derived from sports like, Golf and Baseball. 1) "If it's in the V, it's in the tree.. ": When you are having a stroke in golf, most novice people don't follow up the proper technique and they tend to have an incorrect back lift of the golf stick. That awkward position if looked in the direction of facing the golfer creates a "V" and causes to have less power in the stroke making the shot to go at random place (mostly in trees). Hence the statement. 2)  "... if it's in the arc, it's out of the park.":  It means, if you have a proper arc in your shot, a proper swing of your golf stick and connect properly, it is more than sufficient to put the ball out of the park. This is something which every golfer practices and applicable to cricket ball as well! Cheers! Updated 1w ago • View Upvotes
