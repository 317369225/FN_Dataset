I feel like my life is going on the wrong way and I don't know what to do. What can I do?
Just stop doing whatever you are doing. For a moment. Go to a place of solitude, like your terrace on a winter night. And think. Think about what have you done so far, the best things you did. Then, think about what you are doing right now, and is there any of it that you want to keep doing? Think, if there there are things that you don't want to do, then why exactly do you have to do them? What is at stake, and are the stakes high enough? Lastly, Think, what do you want to do in life? Can you do it, are you capable of doing it? Can you keep doing it, without loosing focus? If the answer to all of it is YES, and make this the last moment you spend thinking, and just go for whatever you want to do. Hope it helps!!
