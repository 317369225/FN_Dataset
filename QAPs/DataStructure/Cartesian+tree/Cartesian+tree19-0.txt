What are some good tutorials to implement lowest common ancestor of an undirected acyclic graphs?
Thanks for the A2A. Widest path problem This link talks about LCA for undirected graphs in brief. Cartesian tree This link talks about binary tree construction from a sequence of numbers. As I understand, even in undirected acyclic graph with reference to any two nodes a Castesian tree is constructed which in principle is a binary tree. So that explains why your search results were about LCA with binary trees. Hopefully there is no other variant of LCA for undirected acyclic graph.
