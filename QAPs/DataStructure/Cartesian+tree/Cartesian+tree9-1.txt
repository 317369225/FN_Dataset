What are good ways to learn Algorithms and Data Structures using Python and Programming contests like Codechef, Codeforces?
Algorithms are not language specific, if you are good with the logic and pseudo code any language would be cool. If you are good with Discrete Mathematics, learning algorithms would be very easy. Cormen and Sidgewick are two great books to start with. If you are not interested in the theory behind algorithms and just want to learn and implement them, then, "How to solve it by Computer" by Dromey is a wonderful book. It is one of the most direct approaches to algorithms. The choice of learning materials depends on your commitment and purpose. If you are only interested in online competitive programmingÂ  Dromey is your book. It is however advised to learn the science behind them for better understanding of the subject and efficient usage of algorithms. While studying these, simultaneously solve problems to gain confidence and expertise.
