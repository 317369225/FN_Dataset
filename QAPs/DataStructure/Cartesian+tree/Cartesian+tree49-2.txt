How can l learn exactly how a GPS is made without any prior knowledge?
First of all, GPS is a system owned and operated by the US Department of Defense. GPS is a technology in the realm of Geodesy. I assume what you want to know is how a GPS device or sensor is made. Any such device or sensor requires a network link to either the GPS or comparable systems such as the Russian GLONASS. If you want to learn how such a device or sensor is made, you will have to understand electronics, more specifically, analog and digital communication. If you just want to find out how such devices are made, a Google search will turn up the best links. Try "Building GPS devices" for starters.
