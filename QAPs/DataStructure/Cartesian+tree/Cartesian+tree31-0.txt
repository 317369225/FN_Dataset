Does acceleration cause spacetime curvature?
This is what I know: Special Relativity makes some corrections on Classical Mechanics. From this corrections, it is possible to demonstrate two things: Consider two systems of tree-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, one (A) moving respect to the other with constant velocity (B). Consider too a fact that happens in a interval of time and an object. Then: 1. The interval of time in which the fact happens is smaller in B. 2. The dimension of the object parallel to the velocity of B is larger in B. These are in fact a contraction of time and an elongation of longitude. I suppose that if you consider space and time like the same dimensions, these effects will be noticed as a curvature.
