Homework Question: What makes m and c constants and x and y variables in a straight line graph?
Y is defined as the distance up or down from the X axis X is defined as the distance left or right from the Y axis M is the slope of the line C is the point on the Y axis where the line crosses it, where X = 0 If you have a straight line that is not perfectly horizontal or vertical, then the value of Y will change as the line gets higher or lower, and the value of X will change as you go left to right. However, if it is a straight line, the slope will not change, so M is a constant. Also, the line will only cross the Y axis at X = 0 once, so there is only one possible value for C. ... (more)
