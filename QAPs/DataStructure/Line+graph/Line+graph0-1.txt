What is the difference between line graph and stacked line graph?
A stacked line graph is a line graph in which lines don't overlap because they are cumulative at each point. A stacked line graph displays series as a set of points connected by a line. Values are represented on the y-axis and categories are displayed on the x-axis. A line graph is a type of graph which displays information as a series of data point called ‘markers’ connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of graph common in many fields.
