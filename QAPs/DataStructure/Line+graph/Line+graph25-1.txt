Do scales along x axis and y axis matter while constructing a line graph?
The short answer is "Scales always matter." In general, the x and y axes could measure different things and there is no need to coordinate the scales. For example you might plot pressure against volume. Gradients will seem to change depending on the scales you use. But for a frequency polygon there is a relationship between the x and y axes. The measurements could be in kg or mm or ohms, the y axis scale has to be such that the area under the curve is 1, so it must have units of 1/kg or 1/mm etc. In practice we wouldn't bother to write the units, but I suppose you really should.
