What is a line graph and what is its purpose?
One way to think of a line graph is as a two-dimenstion picture of a relationship. A straight line graph comes from a relationship between two variable numbers, x and y (the letters are a mathematical habit). Let’s say the relationship is y = 2x–5, an equation. We are looking for all values of x and y that will make the statement y = 2x–5 true (very important idea). With a little fumbling around you can find that if x = 3, then y = 1 (if you substitute those values for x and y in the equation, they make the statement true.) The pair of numbers, x = 3, then y = 1, are a solution to the equat... (more)
