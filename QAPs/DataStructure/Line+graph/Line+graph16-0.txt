What is a line graph? What is the importance?
A line graph displays data points (represented as markers) connected by lines. It is one of the most commonly used chart types, and highly versatile, supporting linear, non-linear, time-series, and logarithmic data. The below line chart displays the acceleration of three different rockets against a logarithmic scale. You can interactive with the line chart demo here: https://demos.zingchart.com/view... The importance of a line graph ultimately depends on the type of data or information you are trying to convey. A line chart is one of many x/y-axis charts, and so sometimes chart types such as bar, area, scatter, bubble, range, or stock may better represent your data. Line charts can also be combined with other chart types to create mixed charts. In the below chart, a line is used to represent the stock price and bars are used to represent the volume.
