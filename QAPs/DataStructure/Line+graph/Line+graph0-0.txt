What is the difference between line graph and stacked line graph?
A line graph only has one line of data. To be more explicit, the independent variable, usually time, is marked on the x-axis, and the dependent variable, whatever it is you’re studying over time to monitor changes, is marked on the y-axis. Once all points are plotted, a single line is drawn through the points from left to right to show change over time. A stacked line graph will follow the same structure — x-axis, independent, y-axis, dependent, plot and connect — but will consist of more than one line plotted on the same graph. Each line represents a different “thing” that was studied. A go... (more)
