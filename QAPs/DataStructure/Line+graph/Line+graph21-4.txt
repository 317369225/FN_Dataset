Homework Question: What makes m and c constants and x and y variables in a straight line graph?
Nothing but convention.  In fact, if you view x  x and y  y as constants (a point), then in b-m space it maps to the line b=−xm+y  b=−xm+y .    A line y=m 0 x+b 0   y=m0x+b0 maps to a point (b 0 ,m 0 )  (b0,m0) in b-m space. Quora thinks this is insufficiently lengthy.   So I'll relay that when I first learned about b-m space there was a kid in the class who would snicker every time the term was mentioned.   Like Beavis and Butthead, he'd laugh at the scatological reference -- b.m. is sometimes used as a shorthand for "bowel movement."  But this wasn't third grade, it was graduate school. 91 Views · 1 Upvote
