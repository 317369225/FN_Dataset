Homework Question: What makes m and c constants and x and y variables in a straight line graph?
In line graph,the general equation is: y=mx+c In line; x is varying i.e. its value is changing with every value of y and value of y is also varying (changing) therefore these are called variables. Now lets consider m i.e. slop of line given by change in y divided by change in x and that is constant,you see,because x and y are linearly dependent.Comin to the c,the intercept, i.e. where the line crosses y-axis, as visible that is only one point therefore c is also a constant.
