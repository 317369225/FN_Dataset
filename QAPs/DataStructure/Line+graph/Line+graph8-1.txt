What is misleading line graphs?
Line graphs that deliberately display data in a way that visually shows data that is contrary to what an analysis of the raw data would tell you. One way is to have two different vertical axis labeled to display different data sets if my left vertical access is labeled 1–10, and my right 1–100, I can visually make the left axis display more dramatic than my right axis. It works. Your eye can deceive your brain. But once you've caught it, it never works again. Here, both sales and revenue grow at 10% but your eye is drawn to the slope, and revenue looks to be growing faster. 47 Views · Answer requested by Dion Poindexter
