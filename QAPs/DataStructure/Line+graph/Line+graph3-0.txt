What does a straight line graph indicate?
A straight line graph results if you plot a function with a constant rate of change. Any function can be expressed with the basic formula, f(x)=y  f(x)=y . The question is, what does the function “do” to x  x , so that y  y results. If the graph is a straight line, the answer is, “probably not much.” So, for example, let f  f be the function that determines that y  y will always be equal to x  x . Then the equation can be y=x  y=x , and the result is a purely horizontal line, intersecting the y-axis at whatever value we give to x  x at the time. For example, for y  y =0  =0 , the line would be superimposed on the x-coordinate. If we want a straight horiz... (more)
