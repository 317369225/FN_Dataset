What is the intercept of a straight line graph?
If you plot a straight line graph, you will find a part that will cross the y-axis. This is the y intercept. The y intercept is also the ‘c’ when you look at the equation : y=mx+c. If you substitute the x and y with any one of the points on any part of the straight line, you will find c is equal to where you line intercepts. I probably didn’t give a clear explanation so let me give an example. e.g. Let us imagine 2 points on a line that are (2,5) and (7,15). First step: Gradient (the m in the equation) the formula for gradient is y2-y1 divided by x2-x1. In this case we have 15–5 over 7–2. Th... (more)
