Homework Question: What makes m and c constants and x and y variables in a straight line graph?
Let the equation y=mx+cÂ  y=mx+c represent a line. Being the inclination and intercepts respectively, m and c will have to take fixed values for a fixed line. x and y can be chosen from an infinite set of points lying over the line! I can define m and c as some kind of variables, dependent on another variable, say t. But then, t needs to be independent of x and/or y. Why?, because otherwise, the slope - represented by m, would vary with x and y, and the equation will no longer be representing a straight line. When we do take t as an independent variable, the equation will then be representing a set of s... (more)
