Do scales along x axis and y axis matter while constructing a line graph?
Yes, Scales along the X and Y axis do matter a lot for construction a graph. The concept of Scales were introduced to reduce the complexity of drawing the graph as it is very difficult to go with the original measurements. Scale is nothing but the ratio of the size of the model to the actual size of the object. For Example, If we need to represent a building of height 200 meters and length 50 meters in a graph. We can't draw that on a paper since 200 meters is a huge number. So, We introduce the concept of scaling here. By considering 10 meters as 1 inch on graph we can represent the whole ... (more)
