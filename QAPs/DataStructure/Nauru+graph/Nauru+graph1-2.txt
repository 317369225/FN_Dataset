Should Easter Island become independent from Chile?
I know of no pressing reason why they should want independence. They are too far away for Chile to actively exploit them ... and they have very few raw materials that would inspire a government to do so. If Easter Island became independent, could they become self-sufficient? Can a tiny ecologically depleted island in the middle of the Pacific become self-sufficient? I would suggest no. But it is of course up to the local people to say. Thanks for the A2A, Odysseus.
