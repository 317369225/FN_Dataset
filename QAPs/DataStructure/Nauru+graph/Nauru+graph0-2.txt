Where in the world is cancer least pervasive?
As you can see from Ian York's map, we have a lot of cancer cases here in New Zealand and also in Australia.  I believe it is because we have the least cover from the sun.  There is a hole in the Ozone layer directly above us and the UV rays are deadly.  We have a very high incidence of Melanoma due to this.
