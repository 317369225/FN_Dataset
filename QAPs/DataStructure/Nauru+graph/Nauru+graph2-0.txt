Mayotte (1 follower) Heard Island and Mcdonald Islands (1 follower) Includes all ISO 3166-1 countries, dependent territories, special areas. Data scraped 11/13/13. For the four areas with 1 follower each, I created those topics and followed them myself, so data is present and they show up on the log scale (without adding 1). Comments I'll be pursuing some extensions of this. One I want to pursue is understanding which countries are over- or under-followed with respect to population. Always open to comments and suggestions about what I should look at next (for this dataset or another one!)
