Should Easter Island become independent from Chile?
Easter Island's post-1860 history, marked as it was by mass death in the 1860s and subsequent colonization and assimilation by Chile, is tragic.Â  Speaking sentimentally, it would have been nice if the island's history had seen much less of that, if it had managed to retain more independence and see less devastation. We live, however, in an actually existing history where Easter Island has been part of Chile for almost a century and a half. Looking at various demographic statistics, the majority of Easter Island's population is of Chilean background. The island has been deeply integrated with Chile for that long period of time. As others have noted, the track record for small and isolated islands that are also politically independent is not good: Nauru's example should inspire no one. I think that the best outcome for Easter Island at this stage would involve it acquiring a certain amount of autonomy and self-governance while retaining the advantages of being part of a larger and wealthier state. Political independence is an unworkable luxury.
