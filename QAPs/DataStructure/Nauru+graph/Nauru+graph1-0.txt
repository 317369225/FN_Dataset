Should Easter Island become independent from Chile?
(A2A) Disclaimer: I'm Chilean. I really don't mind about Isla de Pascua (Rapa Nui) becoming independent from mainland Chile. But I think it isn't worth the effort. The island's area is 163.6 km2, its population is 5,761 people. In 2002, 60% of the inhabitants were native Rapanui (1). The least populated independent nations today are the Vatican City (839 inhabitants) and Nauru (~10000 inhabitants) (2) Political independence requires: writing a constitution, creating a justice system, a mint or obtaining coins and bills from another country, the establishment of a police force, writing legislation, among other things. I think the gain for the Rapanui people is little in comparison to what they would lose. Regarding the island's economy, it may become a tax haven, like Nauru was (3). It has little natural resources, besides fishing. I think tourism may be the only way for the Rapanui people for obtaining currency. If Nauru is the closest example, I think it's not the way to go, since it's near the bottom of the U.N. GDP chart (4) and the CIA World Factbook (5). Maybe Palau is a better example (6), but it seems to be facing similar struggles in its economy.
