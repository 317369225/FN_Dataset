If reality is chaotic (e.g waves crashing on a rock forming a truly random pattern each time) then why, if I flip a coin 100 times, do the results trend to 50/50 heads/tails?
In your coin example, you're simplifying reality by reducing the action of flipping a coin to just one variable. And since that variable has only two possible outcomes, each being equally likely, you can expect that your results will be close to 50/50. The wave example is extremely complex, hence each result seems unique, but we could simplify this just like we did with the coin. If we only look at, say, whether the water splashes more or less than 30cm into the air with each wave, then we will have reduced the wave to 1 variable. Although, in this case, it may not be 50/50 odds. Conversely, we can complicate the coin flip by making it realistic. The original wave example examines a natural phenomenon in its totality, so let's do the same for the coin. We could look at not just heads/tails, but also distance travelled from your thumb after you flick the coin, the height of the flip, the coin's trajectory/angle in the air, whether it rolls when it lands, how far it rolls, whether it spins/wobbles, its pattern of movement on the ground (accounting for all bounces and rolls), final location at rest, etc. Looking at the entire phenomenon opens up vast new possibilities, just like the wave splashes.
