What is the list of some of incredible coders who are from Tier 2 and 3 colleges in india?
1. Anudeep Nekkanti He is one of the guys who has made ripples in the competitive programming. He ranks amongst the best from the world!!! His profiles are one of the best in India in  India. You can check for yourself, handle: anudeep2011. He is currently yellow on topcoder but his rating graph shoots up on 45 degrees. Phew!! If there is someone after the likes of greats that India has had(e.g. Rudy, Ajay Somani, Nadeem, PGM, NG and others who I am forgetting) then its him. I hope he goes for ICPC this year !!! EDIT: His team Randomly is going for ICPC world finals 2014. Congrats Man!!! CodeChef User | CodeChef 2. Uday Jalan "Guy who got 1.33 crores!!!"  (media crap.) All of us know him. He hails from MNNIT Allahabad and  media made him a rockstar after he got placed in facebook. He has great passion for coding and it shows from the fact that even after one year into facebook he still participates in competitive programming regularly. 3. Vaibhav Mittal He is from NSIT and he an incredible coder. He also got placed in facebook. These guys have given their all to excel in competitive coding. One thing that is common in all of them is perseverance. I remembered a quote while writing this answer: Hardwork beats talent when Talent doesn't workhard. PS: NSIT is a very good college and cannot be said B-grade given the amount of good coder that it is producing. Updated 108w ago • View Upvotes
