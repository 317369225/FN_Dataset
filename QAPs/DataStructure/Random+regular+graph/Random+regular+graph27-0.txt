What do interns do at secretive quant funds or HFT (high-frequency trading) firms?
At Jane Street, it's a mix of things. Technical interns work mostly on projects related to tooling and infrastructure, often not things directly related to finance. I worked on things like a tool for graphing live time series data and a Unix tool for managing network filesystems. Trading interns largely worked on projects that involved either working with some provided data or researching something pretty specific (ie specific details about some random, possibly foreign, exchange and how they affect trading there). Research interns are somewhere in the middle. They worked on everything from optimizing internal libraries to coming up with models for data to experimenting with specific technologies like certain machine learning algorithms. None of this is directly related to day-to-day trading, but much of it either helps or will get incorporated eventually. Some of the intern projects are basically blue-sky research to "test the waters" and explore completely new ideas without tying down any full-time employees. There is also a major education component of the internships. Interns regularly attend lectures on technical and financial topics as well as mock trading classes which involve betting games designed to teach a trading mindset. There was also a mock electronic exchange where interns worked in teams to write a simple bot and compete with other teams. For the most part, the work seemed relevant although there were, inevitably, some projects that felt a bit contrived. And you obviously can't expect to have immediate impact like you would at a small startup, where you can see your work in production while you're still there, but I don't think anyone expects that anyhow.
