A gun shoots bullets towards infinity at a constant rate for an infinite time. The speed of each bullet is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Whenever two bullets collide they disappear. What is the probability that a bullet would reach infinity?
​ ​Fig1) The paths of 100 bullets projected on a logarithmic cone, shot in a circular timeframe with a counter clockwise orientation. Each black line visualizes a relatively fast bullet that overtakes a relatively slow bullet (red line) leading to an annihilation. TL;DRInstead of answering the 'infinity question' I was interested in the distribution of how far the average bullet would get, and of I was able to make a nice visualidation. I did a numerical simulation for a finite but periodically repeating set of bullets, suggesting that: The bullets that on average got the most far, had a velocity of ~75% of the maximum speed. This equals the expectation value of the (average) velocity of two bullets, when their travelled distance [math]d[/math] is much larger than the absolute time difference [math]|t_2 - t_1|[/math] between their shooting times. The maximum travelled distance [math]M[/math] increases more than linearly with the number or simulated bullets [math]N[/math]: [math]M(N) \propto  {N}^{1.35}   [/math] Regular vs circular time structureWithout a circular temporal frame, a detail of a typical simulation looks like figure 2.    ​ ​ Fig 2. Detail of a simulation as it would look like with an infinite amount of bullets. When a fast bullet (black) overtakes a slow bullet they annihilate. With a circular timeframe, the results look like those depicted in figure 3, giving an impression for a simple case with only ten bullets:  ​ ​ ​Fig 3) Illustration of a simulated circular temporal structure for just ten bullets. The graph is at the right side connected to the left side (wraps around like in the Pac-Man game). It is equivalent to an infinite number of bullets, however, with an ongoing repetition of one N random velocities. Numerical resultsWith the circular time frame, we can get some numerical results: Maximum travelled distance versus number of bullets In figure 4 you see the maximally travelled distance [math]M[/math] for 100 simulations, where the number of bullets [math]N[/math] was gradually increased from ~300 to ~3000. The linear trend in the log-log scaled plot suggests a power function, and with linear regression is was found that [math]M[/math] increases more than linearly proportional with [math]N[/math] :         [math]M(N) \propto  {N}^{1.35}   [/math] The 1.35 is a rough estimate.   ​ ​ ​Fig4)  The maximally travelled distance in 100 simulations for an increasing amount of bullets (blue line), together with the fitted power function (red line). The distribution of travelled speed versus the velocity of the bullets In figure 5, you see the results when 2000 (upper row) and respectively 8000 (lower row) bullets are shot in such a circular time frame. For N = 2000 the bullets flew on average about 40 distance units. This seems far, regarding that most bullets are annilihated in about a second, however, the distance distribution has a heavy tail. This average, however, varied a lot over the simulations. Of eight simulations (N = 2000), the minimal average was 15 distance units, and the maximum 90. This is mostly caused by the last two remaining bullets. If they have almost the same speed, they may travel a long distance before they finally collide, which increases the average distance significantly.  ​ ​ ​Fig 5) Annihilation distances (log-scaled) versus bullets speeds (left: regular scaled, right: log-scaled). The upper row is for N = 2000 bullets, the lower row for N = 8000 bullets. The 'trace of red dots' in the left lower part are bullets with such a low speed, they are annihilated already 'in the barrel of the gun' by the next bullet (black). This black bullet can be found at equivalent y-coordinate but more to the right in the graph. The average speed of 'successful' bullets In general the speed of the bullets that travelled the farthest, was slightly higher than 75% of the maximal speed. The histograms in figure 6 shows the total distance travelled for bullets with different speed, for four simulations, each with 2000 bullets:  ​ ​ ​Fig 6) The total distance travelled by bullets with different speeds, shown for 4 simulations with 2000 bullets. Bullets with roughly 75%-80% of the maximum speed on average travel the most distance. This exceeds slightly the expectation value of the (average) velocity for two bullets that collide, at a distance [math]d[/math] which is much larger than the absolute time difference [math]|t_2 - t_1|[/math] between their shooting time. With the velocities uniformly distributed over [0,1], it can be shown that the travel time [math]T_{travel}[/math] to reach a certain travelled distance [math]d_{travel}[/math] is distributed as: [math]P(T_{travel}=t) = \frac{d_{travel}}{t^2}[/math]  with [math]T_{travel} \ge d_{travel}[/math] For a collission of two bullets, known to happen at distance [math]d_{anihltn}[/math]  with  [math]d_{anihltn} \gg  |t_2 - t_1|[/math] the distribution of the travelled time before collission [math]T_{anihltn}[/math] is distributed as: [math]P(T_{anihltn}=t) = 3\frac{d^3}{t^4}[/math]  with [math]T_{anihltn} \ge d_{anihltn}[/math] The expected velocity of these bullets is then obtained by integrating the PDF of the travelled time multiplied with the corresponding velocity of the bullet for that travel time [math]v=\frac{d}{t}[/math]:   [math]\int_d^{\infty}P(T_{anihltn}=t)v dt [/math] [math]=\int_d^{\infty}3\frac{d^4}{t^5} dt  = 0.75 [/math] So the expected velocity of two bullets that collide 'far away' is 75% percent of the maximum velocity. This holds only for two isolated bullets, however, figure 5 suggests that for many bullets, this expected value shifts to a slightly higher speed.   Most hits between direct temporal neighbours Most annihilations (67%) occur between 'temporal neighbors' (bullets fired directly after one another). The a priori chance that a bullet collides with a bullet separated with 3 time units is about 13%. Discussion / conclusionFrom this small investigation, we can not draw too many quantitative conclusions, but it seems that: The maximally travelled distance grows faster than the number of simulated bullets. So instead that on average the ultimate collision distance doubles, it grows with [math]\frac{4}{3}\cdot 2 =\frac{8}{3}[/math]. This suggests that the velocity distribution of the bullets becomes smaller, the further they get, making that they do not only have to make up for the doubling in expected time delay, however, that they also must do this with a decreased difference in relative speeds. In figure 5 it is clearly seen that over the distance this velocity distribution indeed becomes smaller. An initial numerical evaluation suggests that at a distance [math]\frac{8}{3}[/math] farther away, the standard deviation in velocities between the bullets which make it that decreases with factor 1.10. This may not seem sufficient, but since two bullets are 'drawn' from this deviation, this may explain the observed overlinear increase in expected maximal distance.    So if we let N grow to infinity, the maximally travelled distance grows harder. Can we then conclude that the chance that a bullet reaches infinity becomes 1? Well, we can conclude that for each exteremely large distance, there is a number of bullets that can be simulated so that it is expected that a bullet will fly beyond that distance. A bullet with about ~3/4 of the maximal speed has the best chance on travelling the farthest, which is equal to the expected velocity of two bullets colliding at specific distance. Another result is that about ~2/3 of the bullets collide with their direct neighbours. A quick and dirty explanation is that if a bullet is fast, then it will overtake its right neighbour, leaving its left neighbor unharmed. If it is relatively slow it will be overtaken by its left neighbour, and its right neighbour can escape. So roughly out of each three bullets one will pass on to the next round of overtakings. Sort of.To simulate the behavior of N in the order of 1,000,000 bullets, it would be more efficient to follow a multiresolution strategy.
