How can one keep oneself updated about all the things happening around?
The answers on this page are fantastic. I won't repeat them.   I will add something though, something you have figured out and you shouldn't underestimate. Admit you don't know and be open to learning.   People get in their own way.  Their insecurities.  (I do: What is something that seems to make sense to everybody else but you?) When confronted with new data, they feel acutely what they don't know and reassert knowledge rather than take in new knowledge.   This helps nothing. Instead, do this:   1. When you're with people - ask questions.  Yes, admitting you don't know makes you vulnerable.  But you are NEVER stupid if you ask questions. And these super knowledgeable people, learned too, right? Through questions.   2. When you're reading  - don't think "I should know this, why should I know this?" Think "Fantastic, now I know this too! What else should I know?"   3. When you're sitting there wanting to learn, be proactive. Write down questions, ask on Quora, Google it. (Email me, I'll send you credits to A2A people.)   4. As you learn, don't just take in facts, be a critical thinker. Even if you don't think you are smart enough to be critical - you are. How can I start thinking critically and responding appropriately?   5. Be open to suggestions, debate, other opinions. You'll never improve your thinking without help. (If they intend it or not).   Good luck! You'll be teaching and amazing others in no time. People wondering how you got so knowledgeable!
