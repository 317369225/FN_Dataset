What's a good "scripting" functional programming language?
Take a look at Elixir (Elixir ). It is a dynamic, functional programming language that runs on the Erlang VM - good for scripting as well as large, high-scalability applications. It has a Ruby-like syntax and has many good libraries useful for scripting, including (but not limited to): - Handling files and directories (File, Path) - Handling text (String, Regex) - Handling command line input/output (OptionParser, System, IO, IO.ANSI) - Handling JSON parsing (Poison, jsx, etc.) - HTTP clients (HTTPoison, HTTPotion, etc.) - Launching, controlling, and communicating with external OS processes (Porcelain) It has a large ecosystem of 3rd party libraries on hex.pm. You can write small single file scripts and run them in interpreted mode, or compile them into standalone executables (escripts) that include all the library dependencies (except the Erlang VM itself). Elixir inherits all the reliability, scalability, and excellent concurrency that Erlang is known for. I've written scripts (and larger programs) that have gotten an order of magnitude faster simply by using Elixir's concurrency libraries. Fast to prototype and test with.
