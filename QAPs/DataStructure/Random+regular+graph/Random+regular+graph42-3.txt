A gun shoots bullets towards infinity at a constant rate for an infinite time. The speed of each bullet is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Whenever two bullets collide they disappear. What is the probability that a bullet would reach infinity?
Here's my attempt at this.  I am not saying it is right and it could be made tighter.  Also, I am making the assumption that the gun is fixed and always shoots in exactly the same direction. The number of bullets fired can be mapped in one-to-one correspondence to the set of counting numbers.  While there would be an infinite number of bullets this quantity is said to be countably infinite.  However, the velocity of the bullets does not have this correspondence.  The number of possible velocities is uncountably infinite. Now let's consider a single bullet from the infinite set of all bullets fired. Suppose that the interval of possible velocities is open.  The bullet will collide with another bullet if there is a slower bullet in front of it that has not been eliminated.  Given there are an infinite number of bullets such a bullet must exist.  However, even of we assume that all bullets in front of it have been eliminated (or it is the first bullet fired), there is a faster bullet that is behind it that has not been eliminated itself that it will collide with. Now suppose that the interval of velocities is closed.  In this circumstance we consider the probability that a bullet has velocity of exactly 1.  If there are no bullets in front of it then such a bullet cannot be eliminated.  This is not an impossible event but it does have probability zero since there is a countably infinite number of bullets but an uncountably infinite number of of possible velocities. So, regardless of whether the interval of velocities is open or closed no bullet will reach infinity.  The probability is zero. Updated 58w ago • View Upvotes
