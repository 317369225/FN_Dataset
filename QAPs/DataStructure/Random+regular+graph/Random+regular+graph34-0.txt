If reality is chaotic (e.g waves crashing on a rock forming a truly random pattern each time) then why, if I flip a coin 100 times, do the results trend to 50/50 heads/tails?
What you're looking at is a binomial distribution with p = 1/2 and n = 100.  With probability p = 1/2, you'll flip heads, and with probability 1 – p = 1/2 you'll flip tails.  The number of repetitions is n = 100. The distribution is the green graph below.  There are two other distributions included in the figure you can use for comparison.                       Image from Binomial << CPN Tools Homepage. You can see from the graph that the highest green bar occurs at 50.  Roughly 8% of the time that you repeat this experiment of flipping 100 coins you'll find exactly 50 heads and 50 tails.  Note that 51 heads and 49 tails comes up almost 8%, too.  Most of the time the number of heads will be between 45 and 55, but numbers as small as 40 and as large as 60 come up about 1% of the time. Now the question is: where do these figures come from?  Consider what sequences of length 100 can be composed of the letters H and T (for heads and tails)?  The first can be H or T, the second can be H or T, and so forth, in all combinations, so we have to multiply 2 100 times, that is [math]2^{100}.[/math]  Each sequence is equally likely (since H and T each have probability 1/2 of coming up on each coin flip), so the probability of any one sequence occurring is [math]1/2^{100}.[/math] A lot of these sequences have exactly 50 H's and 50 T's.  How many?  Choose 50 out of the 100 places to put the H's, and put T's in the remaining 50.  How many ways can you do that?  The answer is given by the binomial coefficient  [math]\binom{100}{50}=\frac{100!}{50!\,50!}[/math]  (The ! symbol signifies the factorial function.)  Since there are [math]\binom{100}{50}[/math] sequences with 50 H's and 50 T's, and each has probability   [math]1/2^{100},[/math], therefore the probability of getting exacty 50 heads is [math]\binom{100}{50}\bigg/2^{100}[/math]  which is 0.7958..., about 8%. Likewise, the probability of getting exactly  k  H's and exactly  100 – k  T's is                                                  [math]\binom{100}{k}\bigg/2^{100}.[/math] Those numbers give the green graph above. That graph has a "bell shape".  It's very close to the graph for a normal distribution, and as n approaches infinity, the graph approaches a normal distribution exactly.  That's a particular case of the Central Limit Theorem in probability.  Your general question could be paraphrased as "If reality is chaotic, then why can we see that something regular is going in the long run?"  One good answer is the Central Limit Theorem.
