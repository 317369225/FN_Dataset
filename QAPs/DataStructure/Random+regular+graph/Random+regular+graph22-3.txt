What is the best website very few people know about?
I don't know if anyone has picked this one or not: The Ambitionbox. Discover Companies. Prepare for Interviews | AmbitionBox This is the most helpful website I have ever gotten for preps of interviews, company's in depth information. It is a startup of two IIT M students. This is how it works: The website contains some real interview experiences, GD topics, technical question, interview tips. You just enter a company's name and it will provide you all information helpful for interview prep. Like if I search for Google, It gave me Nine different results. All of them contains the experiences of different students who faced the selection process of Google, all genuine. Like this you can search for any company, startup, MNC or even PSU and government organizations. If you do select for any company than, you can even share your experience by signing up which will be helpful to other fellas in coming years. Also if you scroll down a bit, there are plenty of option available including we are hiring. Thanks Akshay.
