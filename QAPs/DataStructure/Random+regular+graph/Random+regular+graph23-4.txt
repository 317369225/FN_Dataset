What's the significance of the clich√© "six degrees of separation"?
6 Degrees of Separation is the theory that everyone on earth is connected to everyone else on earth by no less than 6 steps. This means, for example, that there is a person in Africa right now that through some form of relationship is connected with me in the US in 6 steps or less. Maybe I met someone in an international airport who flew to Spain and they ran into someone who does business in Africa.
