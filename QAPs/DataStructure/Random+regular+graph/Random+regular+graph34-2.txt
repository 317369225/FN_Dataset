If reality is chaotic (e.g waves crashing on a rock forming a truly random pattern each time) then why, if I flip a coin 100 times, do the results trend to 50/50 heads/tails?
Michael explained this very well (reducing to a binary variable). Additionally I may add: If you watch a wave crash against a rock, there are many ways it can crash, correct? Similarly, if you flip a coin 100 times there are 2^100 different outcomes (approximately 10^30) that are all equally likely. People seem to treat coin flips as an event that is "predictable" or not so "random", but this is only because we know the probability of each event. Suppose you repeat 100 coins a day and record the number of heads/tails. You do this experiment every day for 10 years, then yes you are very likely to see the results "trend" to 50/50. Now go to a beach and watch the waves crash on a rock 100 times a day. Repeat this for 10 years and you will be likely to see a "trend". Also, the way your question is phrased is crucial. You are implying there is a pattern in coin flips that is not existent in waves. Conversely I may ask you why are waves stronger/higher in the winter while lower in the summers (a clearly cyclical pattern)?
