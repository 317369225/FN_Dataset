What's the significance of the clich√© "six degrees of separation"?
I'll try! Let's say you've worked on a political campaign. One of the people you worked with, "Joe" (1) printed posters for a local politician, Mayor John Smith (2). Whose spouse (3), knows the local newswoman (4), who met Brian Williams (5) of NBC news, who interviewed President Obama (6). That's six degrees of separation.
