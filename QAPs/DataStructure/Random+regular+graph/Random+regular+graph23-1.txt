What's the significance of the clich√© "six degrees of separation"?
First of the all the observation of six-steps of separation is due to Milgrams work in 1963 and it was an observation that two totally random people are (usually) not separated by more than six steps (degrees). This observation led to the definition of the "Small-world paradigm" in which we say that most people in the world are not separated by more than 6 steps. The reality is social networks like Facebook and Twitter do have people that are more than 6 steps apart - probably closer to 16 steps apart. Though most people will not have many connections that are more than 6 degrees apart. My above comment discusses more the "social side" of the small-world property. From a computational side, the small-world property presents an additional challenge. If most people are 6 steps or fewer in distance to you, there are many algorithms and analytics that would require traversing the entire graph/network. This can be more computationally demanding than desired.
