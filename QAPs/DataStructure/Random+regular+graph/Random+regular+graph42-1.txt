A gun shoots bullets towards infinity at a constant rate for an infinite time. The speed of each bullet is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Whenever two bullets collide they disappear. What is the probability that a bullet would reach infinity?
I have seen the following claimed (without proof) to be the solution to this problem...  I don't know whether or not it is true (although it seems to apply for at least a few small even numbers of bullets). Suppose for some [math]n\in \mathbb N[/math], [math]2n[/math] total bullets are fired at a rate of 1 per unit time.  If their velocities are chosen IID uniform(0,1) then probability of no bullets "escaping" (because they all collide) is given by [math]p_n = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{2i-1}{2i}[/math].  (Of course the probability of escape is one if an odd number are fired since there must be one left over even if the maximum number of pairs collide.) To understand this probability for large [math]n[/math], here are some quick and dirty approximations:  [math]\ln p_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \ln \left(1-\frac 1{2i} \right) \approx \sum_{i=1}^n -\frac 1{2i}[/math] [math]\implies p_n \approx e^{-\frac 1 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}} \approx  e^{-\frac 1 2 \ln n} = \frac 1 {\sqrt n} [/math] So we see that the probability that they all annihilate each other decreases with the square root of the number of pairs of bullets (assuming that the claim is true).  So as the number of pairs goes to infinity, the probability that they are all destroyed converges to zero which implies that the the probability that a bullet escapes goes to one.
