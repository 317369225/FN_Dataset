What do interns do at secretive quant funds or HFT (high-frequency trading) firms?
Like others have said, it depends from firm to firm. A lot more places like to hire for software development than trading, due to the issue of intellectual property, strategy secrets, etc. Out of those who do hire trading interns, you will most likely be researching a new potential strategy that your team wants to look into (but haven't been able to get to it for a variety of reasons). It will be pretty self-contained and will hopefully give you some good experience on how to develop a basic trading algorithm.
