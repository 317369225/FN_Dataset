What algorithms do data scientists actually use at work?
In all honesty, most of the time a data scientist is cleaning or setting up tables/data to get the covariates right. Which means that most of the time the algorithms are the simple ones like summing, counting/frequency, determining uniques, averaging, quantiles, and a lot of other very basic query-like operations.  If you set the data up right and you ask good questions you shouldn't find much of a difference between logistic regression, SVM or CART or any other fancy pants model solvers (unfortunately, what is helpful and what I see make a difference is the implementations => C5.0 or xgboost). Most of the time data scientists are trying to find relationships in the data and hoping to ask the question correctly, not hooking up fancy algorithms to data. You are definitely taught differently in engineering/stat schools, or at least I and some others that I've known where. Probably for good but various reasons. The best thing to do is read a lot, a whole lot.  It is worth while to learn the new algorithm stuff but I think it is better to understand what is happening in different types of business entities, governments, health care, or technology. I've learned more about how to think about data from reading and understanding what people are currently doing to measure phenomena in various places than I did from learning the details of different algorithms.
