What are some useful computer related technical skills I can learn within a day?
Here is my list. Learn basic formulas, pivot tables, and conditional formatting in Excel. Read about the Dunning–Kruger effect. Learn to move files around with SCP. Learn how to SSH with a certificate instead of a password. Play with grep, cut, sort, sed, and wc until you can use them without really thinking about it.  (These crack a lot of hard problems.)  Play with STDIO and STDERR redirection.  Tattoo 2&>1 somewhere on your body.  (or write it down.) Learn to build a bow drill and make fire with sticks.  Then learn first aid for blisters. Write a "Hello World!" app for your phone. Read about SQL injection attacks, and learn how to use prepared SQL statements in your favorite language. Take a CPR/AED/First Aid Class. Use Hyper-V or your virtualization platform of choice to build a small lab. Grow something.
