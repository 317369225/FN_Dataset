Is there any "bad advice" in Edward Tufte's data visualization books?
I think there is a lot of bad advice in Edward Tufte's data visualization books.  There is also a lot of good advice.  Tufte knows data visualization - but he is completely irrational when it comes to discussing PowerPoint and he doesn't appear to understand the role of visuals in an oral presentation.  He equates the tool with the product - and that is harmful thinking. He is focused on producing data visualization that a viewer can have in front of them on paper and can spend as much time as needed studying, savoring, and enjoying.  Tufte's ideas aren't practical for a visual and short presentation.  His visuals are way too crowded for use in a presentation.  He doesn't seem to appreciate that visuals can and should be expanded upon by the person speaking. He also seems to be a Vulcan, and doesn't appreciate the role of emotion in a presentation.
