If I got lost on an African safari and came face-to-face with a growling lion, what should I do to garner the best chance of survival?
Not a direct answer to the question, but I feel I must point this out: Statistically, Hippos kill more people in Africa (average/year) than lions.  So do  humans, elephants, snakes, crocodiles, etc.... On most "top killers of Africa" lists, Lions usually rate a 7 or 8, sometimes being beaten out by Great White Sharks, if you count the coasts of Africa as well. Statistically speaking, mosquitos are usually responsible for more human deaths in Africa than any other animal, and that's also usually true of the rest of the world (with humans themselves usually running a close second)
