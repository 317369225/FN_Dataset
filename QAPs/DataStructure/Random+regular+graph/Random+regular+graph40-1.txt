What's it like to work at IDEO?
IDEO is a culture based on highly collaborative project teams of T-shaped[1] generalists.  The organization is truly flat and roles are fairly fluid meaning it's not uncommon for a project manager to also design at the same time, and a designer may also do human factors or biz dev within the same project.  In this environment, to be successful, you need to be a good communicator, an advocate for yourself and your ideas, a consensus builder, an intimate collaborator, and someone who truly believes that the best quality work comes from building on the ideas of others and not from the individual.  If you're the kind of person who wants to lock themselves away to work on the best idea possible, are incredibly attached to the ownership of your work, and appreciate the efficiency of authority, then IDEO will probably not be a good experience. Other agencies tend to be more hierarchical and have firm roles and boundaries. A project team may consist of a visual designer, copy writer, and information architect reporting to an art director who reports to a creative director and producer.  In this environment its odd for a visual designer to do information architecture or copywriting whereas, at IDEO, people on a project team may  swap photoshop/illustrator/... files and revise each other's work.   Maybe another way of thinking about IDEO's project team is to think of them as a team of hands on creative directors. [1] T-shaped people are people who have deep expertise in one particular area, but also have a good level of skill across a broad range of areas. [2] disclaimer:  I haven't worked at IDEO for a long time, so, I'm sure its changed a lot since when I was last there. [3] disclaimer:  Not every office environment or project is as I've described it.  I've just tried to highlight the most differentiating characteristics. Updated 235w ago • View Upvotes
