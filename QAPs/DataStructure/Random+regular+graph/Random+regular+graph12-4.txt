Is there any "bad advice" in Edward Tufte's data visualization books?
Tufte is opposed to powerpoint presentations for a number of reasons, including dumbing down of data, but he uses a projected slideshow for his own class. Projected presentations do two important things: 1) Visual projections give the rest of the meeting, class, or audience something relevant to focus on. Watching someone else talk, depending on their style, can be very boring. (Tufte himself can be guilty of being rather long-winded). Having a chart, a data set, a bulleted list, whatever it is, can help keep the rest of your group engaged (especially visual thinkers). Tufte gives his class in a darkened room, with the projection and a small desk lamp as the only illumination. After lunch in a warm dark room, listening to someone drone on... You get my drift. 2) Visual projections organize time, and keep everyone on the same page. You're going to discuss topics one at a time. Having the same graph or list visible for people to reference is really handy. Instead of having everyone find the graph, "on the back of the handout, second from the bottom on the right", you can just have one person bring up the relevant reference. That said: His data-dense handouts are a great idea. If you have smart, engaged people who care about what you need to share, they can be a great starting point for tackling a difficult problem. Sometimes, you need to share what you've been working on for discussion with people who don't really care, but want or need to be in-the-loop. Then it can be easier to give out a handout to follow along with or take notes on, present your initial ideas and data, then have a follow-up conversation.
