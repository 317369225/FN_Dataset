What are some classic papers in mathematics?
1. All the papers (and books) mentioned on the webpage Great articles and books, with an emphasis on those by Serre (whom I personally consider the greatest expositor of mathematics of all time, going back to Euclid and beyond). 1'. To emphasize a particular selection from (1), Tate's article The arithmetic of elliptic curves 1''. Really, really, really you should read Serre's papers "GAGA", "FAC", and his book Local fields. I can barely conceive of what modern algebraic geometry and number theory -- not to mention other disciplines influenced by these -- would be like without these works. He is a great writer and a great teacher; he even started out in a totally different area (homotopy theory), where I suppose his expository contributions are just as important, although I don't know for sure. 2. The writings of Bernhard Riemann. It's difficult to overemphasize how fundamental these are, and I think there is value in reading the originals. 3. To re-emphasize another point from #1, Grothendieck's Tohoku paper on homological algebra. 3'. In case it isn't clear by now, mathematicians are well aware of which writings in their subject are best. Ask your own teachers and mentors whom you should read. 4. Gelbart's summary of the Langlands  program http://www.ams.org/journals/bull... 5. Gauss's  Disquisitiones: http://www.autistici.org/sitosov.... Again, truly fundamental stuff. 6. Look for talks on Youtube that explain classic ideas in  analysis, topology, geometry, and number theory better than the originators of the subjects did. Excellent expositors of deep mathematical ideas include (from my own biased perspective): Serre, Tate, Dick Gross, Mike Hopkins, Joe Harris, and anyone from a former Soviet-bloc country. (Perhaps the cold winters and harsh political conditions made them into better teachers.)
