What is the highest degree of human network?
Thank you for the A2A but I'm not sure whether I'm a suitable candidate to provide an answer for this question. :) My brain works in such a way that when I saw this question, the first thought that popped in to my head was 'Why would one needs to know everyone?". Because that life seems exhausting. I guess you can weave a web by degrees that would interconnect the whole world. But I don't think that after the 5th intermediate the level of strength of that connection could be of much use in the practical world. This is because intangible aspects such as human emotions, cultural inhibitions etc comes in to play in forming networks. The only occasion which I think this level of distant interconnection comes of use in Marketing and Social Media. When you want to spread the word about a product, perhaps you can determine your target market and the ways to reach them through networking. This is how I understood your question :D Perhaps Eivind Kj√∏rstad would be able to provide a better and more technical answer.
