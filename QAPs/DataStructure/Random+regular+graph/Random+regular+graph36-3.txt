How does one get accepted to Caltech as an undergraduate?
Despite the size of the Caltech applicant pool, it is also self-selecting; i.e., not many people apply who know they have no chance of getting in.  Therefore, having great test scores and great high school grades is a necessary, not a sufficient, condition. It is NOT necessary to have taken a bunch of AP classes in high school; Caltech does not want to deny admission to students who come from schools where these opportunities are unavailable. So what distinguishes an applicant who meets the numeric qualifications?  Daniel Lo in his answer has got a large part of it right -- they look for evidence of a passion for science.  This can be determined in part by extra-curricular activities.  Faculty interviews, which used to be an important part of the admissions process, evidentally aren't any more!  Thanks to a reader for pointing that out. Caution: I do not participate in the Caltech admission process, I'm just an alum who has talked to some of the folks who are involved in the process. Updated 244w ago • View Upvotes
