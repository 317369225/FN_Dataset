If I got lost on an African safari and came face-to-face with a growling lion, what should I do to garner the best chance of survival?
On an African Safari you should always walk with anklets full of little bells. The bells will make a noise that scare away the lions. This is a reliable technique learned over many years by the indigenous African people. Only the very large male lions won't be scared off, but there is a way to tell if there are any of these dangerous lions in your vicinity. The secret - Examine the lion scat: You should always look for the presence of lion scat when you are on an African Safari - it provides the clue to whether there are any dangerous lions present, as opposed to ordinary lions. The ordinary lion scat looks much like domestic cat scat, but is larger. The scat tends to be more pointed on one end than the other. This indicates the presence of lions that are not dangerous. The scat from lions which are dangerous looks much the same, but it has small bells in it. Updated 60w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
