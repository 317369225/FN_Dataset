Who is your favorite Fields Medal winner?
Grigori Perelman Grigori Perelman who was awarded the Fields medal in 2006 for "his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci Flow" declined to accept it stating "I'm not interested in money or fame, I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo". He was also awarded the 2010 Millenium Prize which he also promptly turned down stating that "he considers his contribution to proving the Poincaré conjecture to be no greater than that of  Richard Hamilton who introduced the theory of Ricci Flow with the aim of attacking the geometrization conjecture" Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gri...
