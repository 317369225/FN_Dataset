What are some brain storming/puzzle questions asked in a data scientist/analyst interview?
Here's a simple probability question, and a variation. If it rains on Saturday with probability 60%, and it rains on Sunday with probability 20%, what is the probability that it rains this weekend? Solution: You first have to clarify if the event of raining on Sunday is independent of the event of raining on Saturday. If so, then the probability that it rains this weekend is equal to the probability that it rains on at least one day, which is equal to 1 minus the probability that it rains on neither day. Thus the answer is [math]1 - (1 - 0.6)(1-0.2) = 0.68[/math] Alternative Problem: If the two days are NOT in fact independent, then the probability can range from anything from 60% (if it only rains on Sunday if it rained on Saturday) to 80% (if it never rains on the same day).
