What is the highest degree of human network?
You will never know "everyone" no matter how many intermediaries you use. Because people exist who are not connected to the rest of humanity, for example isolated tribes which have no regular contact with any outsiders. But if you instead ask how long the average "chain" of relationships is if you pick other human beings at random from all around the world, then I think (excluding the tiny minority where no chain exists) you'll end up with an average of 5-7 links. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si... For some reason "6" has stuck as the standard answer for it, but I've seen little actual evidence that precisely this number is the right one. Interestingly, places like Quora are important in such networks. The pattern you get is many small clusters of mutual friends, and a few hypernetworked individuals who provides direct connections between otherwise distant parts of the graph. (distant in terms of connections, not in terms of kilometres) The important part of these individuals is not necessarily that they have so many friends. The important part is that they have friends that would otherwise be highly distant and thus provide "shortcuts" trough the graph. (I'm using CS jargon here, a "graph" is a set of nodes with connections between them)
