How does one get accepted to Caltech as an undergraduate?
I got a full-ride merit scholarship to Caltech, and my advice is to Do research!  Getting a fourth-author publication takes relatively little effort and substantially improves your chances of getting into college.  The better a school you do research at, the more likely you are to get published.  I would even suggest flying out to Caltech or MIT for a summer to do research there.  You can also participate in summer research programs such as RSI.  And even if you don't get published, you can still get great letters of recommendation. Place well in competitions such as the International Science Olympiads or the various international science fairs (Intel, Siemens, etc).  You don't have to win medals at the international level, even qualifying for national rounds like the USAMO is impressive.  If your high school doesn't offer these tests, try to take them at another school or ask your teacher to order a test for you. Learn your AP-level math and science very, very well.  This will help you get good test scores and place well in competitions.  It will also help you survive once you actually come to Caltech.  I did this by basically ignoring my classes, reading the textbooks on my own, and doing a large number of unassigned problems.  Sometimes I would even use different textbooks from my school.  It helped that most of my science classes didn't assign homework. Take AP Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.  At Caltech the freshman classes pretty much assume you've taken them.
