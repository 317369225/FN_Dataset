I am passionate about almost nothing. I don't have an aim in life. I am from one of the IITs. Is it okay?
Here's Claire J. Vannette's answer to the question How can I be more passionate? How can I find my passion? "Here's what the motivational speakers don't want to tell you: Not everyone has a passion, and not everyone needs one. This whole idea that you should "follow your bliss" or whatever is an incredibly modern idea, and one that only the most privileged can actually put into action. If you don't have a passion, that's fine. Get a job you don't hate, treat people well, have fun, and keep your eyes and ears open for new experiences. Maybe you'll wake up one morning and feel passionate about something. Maybe you won't. You can live a good life either way." Well-said, I would say!
