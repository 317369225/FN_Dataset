What is the highest degree of human network?
Charles Gretton and Eivind Kjørstad have great answers.  I won't disagree, but add to them orthogonally: Most humans are equipped with roughly the same capacity for tracking details about other people's personalities and lives.  Some call this capacity in the human brain "the monkeysphere."  On average, as a crude estimate, we can keep close dibs on 50 people and have a strong sense of who another 500 are in detail.  Give or take an order of magnitude. So let's just assume we all know exactly 550 people.  What then?  How could we compare across such a level playing field? I submit that the most powerful social network, would be the one which spends its 550 slots on the greatest range of sexes, races, ages, creeds, languages, locations, skill sets, and so on.  If this person's 550 people were the only ones to survive a planetary catastrophe, how much of humanity would be lost?  And how strongly would these surviving 550 all be bound peacefully together through that one person?
