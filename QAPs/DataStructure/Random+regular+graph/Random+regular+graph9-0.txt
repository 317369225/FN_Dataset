What is the expected cover time for a random walk on a periodic square grid?
(A2A) Apparently bounds [thanks Justin Rising] are given for this problem (including the generalization) in chapter 7 of "Reversible Markov Chains and Random Walks on Graphs" by Aldous and Fill, currently available here: Aldous-Fill book (I didn't actually read it, though.) UPDATE: For the two-dimensional, [math]n \times n[/math] case, the following paper gives an asymptotic result of          [math]\frac{4}{\pi} n^2 (\log n)^2[/math] Dembo, Peres, Rosen, and Zeitouni.  Cover times for Brownian motion and random walks in two dimensions.  Annals of Mathematics, 160 (2004), 433–464. http://annals.math.princeton.edu... (Again, I didn't actually read the paper.)
