How does one get accepted to Caltech as an undergraduate?
Starting off, Daniel Lo's answer is the main point: show a passion for math and science. Caltech is hard. The best way to get through it is to have a joy for discovery in your field of passion that you understand you're getting one of the most rigorous educations possible to accelerate yourself into the upper echelons of the research community. Without that passion, Caltech won't and shouldn't take a risk on you. You will be doing graduate level coursework by sophomore year, junior year at the latest. You will be expected to do near-graduate level research throughout your summers or the equivalent in industry. You need to be able to hack it. How do you demonstrate that passion? Dick Karp is right that extracurriculars are important, and I'll add that these extracurriculars are not standard clubs from school. Sometimes, it's joining a lab or finding a research mentor and doing original research or at least participating in the research process as a high schooler. As an example, I was a bit of an odd fit with Caltech, but my 'passion' re: Tech was co-founding the school's robotics club and doing some awesome tinkering and competing. The other key part is as Anon says, you need to pass the bar of respectability. You can't ditch classes for research entirely; you need to be well-grounded in a range of backgrounds to be a top-notch scientist. Good grades are a must in challenging classes—prove you're always pushing yourself to learn more—and to handle Tech, standardized tests should be near-child's play for you. They're not enough to get you into Tech, but they're enough to get you filtered out of the applicant pool.
