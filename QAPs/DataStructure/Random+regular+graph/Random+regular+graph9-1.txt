What is the expected cover time for a random walk on a periodic square grid?
In general, the expected time until a random walk on a graph visits every vertex is known as the cover time.  I haven't been able to find an exact result on the complexity of computing the cover time for an arbitrary graph, but according to [0807.3632] How to Compute Times of Random Walks based Distributed Algorithms, the best known algorithm has exponential running time, so it's probably not easy. There are bounds on the cover time given in terms of how electrical current would flow between nodes in a graph if there were a one Ohm resistor at every node.  This graph is regular enough that you might be able to get something that way if you're comfortable with those sorts of calculations.  Look at the references of the paper I linked for the details.
