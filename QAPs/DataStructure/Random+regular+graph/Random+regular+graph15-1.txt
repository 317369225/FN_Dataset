What would be the effect to inject a methamphetamine-like input to an artificial neural network?
Interesting question. I'd go on and burst your bubble here. Artificial neural networks are not even remotely comparable to human brain. It is just a mathematical model inspired by brain's computational mechanism. Therefore, we can't have parallels in Artificial neural networks for everything our mighty brain is capable of undergoing.
