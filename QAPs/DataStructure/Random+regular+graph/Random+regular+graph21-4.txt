What algorithms do data scientists actually use at work?
Before diving into which classification algorithms to use, it is better to concentrate on getting the features right. From my experience features are everything. If you get your features right you may not need a classification algorithm at all, you can just use rules with heuristic thresholds. I use logistic regression a lot with manual discretisation (to introduce non linearity). The good advantage in this method is it is very easy to debug and tune. At least at my work I don't have too large labeled sets for training so running training algorithms on R/Weka in a single node is not a problem.
