What is the highest degree of human network?
Practically its impossible to know everyone out there. Through multi level marketing (mlm) you could acheive acheive a chain of people unless the downlink are known to you (else they'll form a hierarchy under you) you could form a biggest chain of everyone . The only disadvantage which is the main drop is that there is only one boss for each and everyone except the creator. So the highest degree depens upon the longest chain which you form with your successors.
