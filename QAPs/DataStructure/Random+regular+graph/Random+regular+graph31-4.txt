What do eigenvalues and eigenvectors represent intuitively?
First of all, it helps to restrict the explanation to a very basic case: A 2x2 matrix (let's call it A) being multiplied on the right by a nonzero 2x1 column vector (let's call it v). So we can think of v as an arrow pointing from the origin in R2 out into R2 itself, i.e. v specifies a location in the plane. When you multiply A times v, you get another vector in R2 -- another location. So multiplication by a 2x2 matrix, in other words, causes points in the plane to shift their locations in a certain kind of way. Technically, we call this a linear transformation, but that verbiage is not important for the explanation. When we have such wholesale change happening in R2, it's helpful to know not only how vectors change but which vectors essentially do not change with respect to their locations. Just like in life, when you experience change, it's helpful to have fixed reference points to guide you. So we may ask, which vectors in R2 remain "essentially unchanged" in their locations when we multiply them by A? Those vectors, once we define "essentially unchanged", will be what we call eigenvectors. It may be enough just to know this much, intuitively. But read on for a more precise description. We can't always leave vectors in R2 totally fixed, but we often have situations where the initial vector v and the transformed vector Av end up pointing in the same or exactly the opposite direction -- i.e. v and Av lie on the same line. This is what we will mean by "essentially unchanged with respect to location": That v and the transformed vector Av lie on the same line in R2. Any vector that satisfies this description is said to be an eigenvector for A. So in other words: An intuitive way to describe eigenvectors is that they are vectors which remain pointing along the same line they originally pointed along after being transformed by the matrix A. This notion can be generalized for higher-dimensional spaces if you replace "line" with "subspace". (For example, some eigenvectors for 3x3 matrices might move around more liberally but never leave the plane on which they originally sat.) Now a little more playing around will reveal that, once a vector is established as an eigenvector for A, it may not be totally fixed (i.e., Av = v)Â  but the most that could happen to it is multiplication by a scalar -- i.e. [math]A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}[/math] for some scalar [math]\lambda[/math]. That [math]\lambda[/math] is called an eigenvalue for A. With a little more playing around, you discover that if v is an eigenvector for A with eigenvalue [math]\lambda[/math], then any scalar multiple of v is also an eigenvector for A with the same eigenvalue, [math]\lambda[/math]. There are some intuitive approaches to explaining this, but simple algebra works better. To make a long story short: The most intuitive way to explain eigen-stuff is to use simple geometry. Use lots of pictures and keep the notation to a minimum.
