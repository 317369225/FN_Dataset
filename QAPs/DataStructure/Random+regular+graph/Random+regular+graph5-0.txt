What is a good reason to use "stochastic" in lieu of "random" in regular conversation?
As technical terms, "random" and "stochastic" are completely synonymous.  Sometimes there are established conventions for which is used where -- you always say "random variable" and "random graph" but "stochastic process" and "stochastic differential equation" instead of vice-versa -- but these conventions are purely historical. In non-technical conversation, most people have an extremely shaky understanding of randomness, and might believe that "random" means "uniformly at random" or try to tie in some kind of conscious-observer nonsense.  Using "stochastic" in these contexts might help get past these mental blocks (simply because the word is likely unfamiliar), but I don't know if it's really that useful. My advice would be always to use "random" unless it's part of an established phrase where "stochastic" is used by convention.
