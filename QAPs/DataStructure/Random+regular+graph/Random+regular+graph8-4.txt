What software exists for visualizing and analyzing large networks?
As far as I know, there is no software package which has both: best visualization feature sets and powerful data analysis functions. I'm a core developer of Cytoscape ( http://www.cytoscape.org ), but still I think it is better to use it with graph analysis packages like igraph: http://igraph.sourceforge.net/ Data round-trip between Cytoscape and igraph is easy.  You can use graphML or simple text table for data exchange.  One of our TODO item is writing a glue code (plugin) to directly connect Cytoscape to igraph.
