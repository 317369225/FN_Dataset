What is the best website very few people know about?
Well recently i found an amazing website, which shows the current location of any flight(in air or on ground) on the google map. The best thing about this website is, it just don't shows the location it tells us following things: Destination airport Real Time Altitude Real Time  speed Real Time latitude and longitude. It also shows ground vehicle movements of few airports (like schiphol airport Amsterdam) How this website works ?? : The primary technology that Flightradar24 use to receive flight information is called automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B). The ADS-B technology can be best explain through this image below: Aircraft gets its location from a GPS navigation source (satellite) The ADS-B transponder on aircraft transmits signal containing the location (and much more) ADS-B signal is picked up by a receiver connected to Flightradar24 Receiver feeds data to Flightradar24 Data is shown on Now you can enjoy watching your loved ones safe journey on your laptop screen and who knows you may solve the mystery of many airplane which are missing like Malaysia plane MH370.!!!
