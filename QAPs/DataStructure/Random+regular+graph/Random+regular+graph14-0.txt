Is there any way to choose a random node from a tree without searching all nodes in the tree?
Make the parent-child edges undirected, give every node a self-loop, and run a random walk starting at the root.  This has some limiting distribution, but it's not necessarily uniform. I'm speculating here, but I think that you can make the limiting distribution uniform by modifying the probability of choosing the self-loop.  According to http://www.cs.unibo.it/babaoglu/..., the limiting distribution will be uniform if the graph is regular.  If you assign the self-loop at each node enough weight that all the graphs have the same number of outgoing paths (viewing an edge of weight [math]w[/math] as [math]w[/math] edges of weight one), then the graph should be regular in the limit.  But this is just a guess on my part, so you should ask someone who's familiar with the area. There are probably also tricks you can do with hierarchical uniform sampling and reweighting.  I'll have to think about that a bit.
