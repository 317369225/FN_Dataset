What are the most mathematical areas of statistics?
A2A. This is quite an open ended question actually. With my limited experience in working in stats, some of the most challenging mathematics did indeed come in the context of time series analysis and modelling, but to say that it is the hardest would be doing injustice to several other topics. For example, statistical learning theory requires extremely sound knowledge of distributions, their spectral characteristics, estimation theory and analysis. Another area that I used a lot of interesting stats is in experiment design. Being a topic with such diversity in terms of applications, statistics allows for enough mathematics to keep a mathematician interested and is grounded in the real world enough to keep (potential) engineers like me interested too.
