How do I solve this SAT math problem?There is exactly one way to travel from Bayview to Quaryton. So every round trip has to go through Richfield. There are 3 ways from Quarryton to Richfield. For each of these 3 ways, there are 2 ways from Richfield to Bayview So there are total of 3*2 = 6 ways from Quarryton -> Richfield -> Bayview And then there is 1 way from Bayview to Quarryton So a total of 3*2*1 = 6 ways from Quarryton -> Richfield -> Bayview -> Quarryton Now, you can also reverse the order Quarryton -> Bayview -> Richfield -> Quarryton and that gives 1*2*3 =6 more ways So total ways are 6+ 6 = 12 Answer is (D) 12 187 Views  View Upvotes
