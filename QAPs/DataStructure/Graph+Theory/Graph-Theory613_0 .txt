What is the difference between a "Minimal Spanning Tee" and "shortest paths"?I take minimal to mean shortest.A minimum spanning tree is the smallest subtree of a graph which spans that graph. See Spanning tree. The shortest path between two vertices is the path between the two vertices using the smallest number of edges. See Path (graph theory) They both aim to minimize the edge count, but the requirements are not the same. 84 Views
