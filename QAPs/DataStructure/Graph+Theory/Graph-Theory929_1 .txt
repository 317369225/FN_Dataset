What algorithms are used by Google Maps to make route finding so fast?Google Maps actually uses Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path, which is one of the most elegant, fast, and simple algorithms for the shortest path problem. We treat every city as nodes and roads as edges, which make up a road network. Then we run Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between those.
