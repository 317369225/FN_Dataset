Can a graph have two tangents at a given point?We are doing calculus (highschool) level and I’m wondering if a graph can have two tangents. I worked out, x^2+2, and the tangents, 6x+3 and 5x+2 (through algebra/geometry) do intersect at -1,-3, however do both or even one of the straight lines qualify as a tangent ?Most people are saying no but your question says “graph” not “function” which are very different things. A function means that for every their will be exactly 0 or 1 y value. On the other hand, a “graph” has no such inhibitions. Because of this, you can define some graph, say myGraphWhichIsNOTAFunction(x), as the graph created by putting the 2 functions, y = log(x) and y = -log(x) together And creating two mappings of x and y which are defined as the same “graph”. Now you again said “tangents” and did not explicitly mention derivatives which are specific to functions meaning that this graph does have 2 tangents at certain points (actually all points > 0). The derivative for these 2 functions on their own are f’(x) = 1/xln(10) and -1/xln(10) respectively; Meaning that at the point (1,0) the 2 tangents would be of slope 1/ln(10) and -1(ln10) respectively because x = 1. So 2 tangent lines with different slopes for the same “graph” there you go 81 Views
