Is there some form of mathematics that can be used to predict resonance structures and double bond patterns on a large sheet of fused cyclic alkenes?When I try to draw out these structures, I find the constraints of where double bonds can form to lead to some very interesting, but seemingly chaotic patterns. Is there a way to model these patterns with respect to where the double bonds can form and what resonance structures they give?The mathematical area would be graph theory. The corresponding mathematical problem is the matching problem (since every atom/vertex is to have exactly one pi bond and therefore exactly one partner). But I don't know of a general solution. 84 Views  View Upvotes
