What can be the challenges in implementing graph coloring algorithms?You will face issue in time complexity . its a NP problem . Considering you have m colours and n vertices in your graph . So each vertices has got m different ways to get coloured . So total possible ways = m * m* ....n times = m^n times . (exponential) so the challenge is to reduce this time complexity and come up with a good tme complexity . 179 Views
