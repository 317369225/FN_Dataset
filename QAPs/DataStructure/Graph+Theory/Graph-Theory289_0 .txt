A person cycles a route in the shape of a square. What does the speed-time graph of the cyclist look like?Measure it. There are too many variables left open here to give an answer. To see why, do this simple thought experiment. First, imagine that the square is a quarter mile long on each side, the path is the width of a city street, and the corners have a radius of 60 feet. Turning the corner itself will probably not reduce the cyclist’s speed at all. Now imagine that the square is a quarter mile long on each side, but the path is only six inches wide and the corner radius is one inch. Turning each corner will be an excruciatingly difficult operation, requiring the cyclist to come to nearly a complete stop. By manipulating edge lengths, path widths, corner radii, cyclist skill, road surface, and other variables you’re going to get all sorts of different curve shapes. To work this problem, you are either going to have to measure a single specific situation or make some simplifying assumptions. 222 Views · View Upvotes
