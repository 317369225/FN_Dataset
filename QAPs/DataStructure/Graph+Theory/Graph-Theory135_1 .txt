How do you print cyclic path reconstruction of a graph in C?For example, cyclic paths can be detected by using Floyd-Warshall algorithm. How to modify path reconstruction of this algorithm such that it prints cyclic paths, like the following: 1->2->3->1Doing that in C isn't drastically different from doing that in another language (except for the manual memory management in C and the available data structures offered by other languages, but you aren't asking about those). My question is what have you tried so far? 186 Views
