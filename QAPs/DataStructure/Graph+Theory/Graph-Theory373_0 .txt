How do I find topological sort of a weighted graph?Topological sorting is generally concerned with reachability only, not with weighted optimizations. Topological sorting can be used as a preliminary step to finding a shortest path, however the weights are not considered in the sorting phase. Could you clarify how you would expect weights to affect the sort? 76 Views  View Upvotes
