What is the meaning of a horizontal line in a distance versus time graph?If time is the horizontal axis, a horizontal line means that the object stays at the same place as time goes on, which means it's standing still. Not to be confused with time being the horizontal axis, in which case a horizontal line means the objects appears out of nowhere for one instant located everywhere at the same time, and then disappears into nothingness again. Needless to say, it's probably the first option. :) 112 Views
