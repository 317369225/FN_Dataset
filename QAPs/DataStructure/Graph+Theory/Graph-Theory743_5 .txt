What do the matrices represent in the following pictures?Thank you very much,I am learning R language by myself right now,and now I feel it's a little difficult for me... Is there any good books for beginners? Thank you very much!The matrices represent the edges on the associated graphs. Matrix A1 has 4 rows, one for each node in the diagram below it (V0 to V3). The columns also represent the 4 nodes from V0 to V3. That is why the matrix is square (4x4). A 0 means that there is no edge that connects the row node with the column node. That is why the diagonal is all zeros. No node in the graph has an edge that connects back to itself. You can also see that V0 and V1 (first two rows) have 3 connections as shown in the diagram and V2 and V3 (last two rows) have only 2 connections (also as shown in the diagram). Matrix A2 is similar. The diagram below it has 5 nodes and the matrix is 5x5. However, this diagram has directed edges (one way from a node to another node) and the numbers in the graph represent edges directed away from a node. So, as in the first diagram, no node has an edge that leads back to itself so the diagonal is all zeros again. You can also see that node V2 has no incoming edges so the middle column in matrix A2 is also all zeros. No other node has an outgoing edge that goes to V2. Sorry, I don't know anything about the R language. But I have done some work with graphs. 16 Views
