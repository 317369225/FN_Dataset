What is the difference between hamiltonian path and spanning tree?Hamiltonian path : It is a path that passes through every vertex exactly once. Spanning tree : It is a subtree which contains all the vertices. Q1) Are they same? A) No, because both are different data structures. Hamiltonian path is a sequence of vertices(or edges) whereas spanning tree is a graph. Even if you consider the hamiltonian path as a graph,ie, a tuple of vertex set and edge set, the answer is still no(Why? See Q2 and Q3) Q2) Is every hamiltonian path(converted to graph type) a spanning tree? A) Yes, because a hamiltonian path can't have any cycles(if it had cycles, a vertex would be visited more than once) --> it is acyclic --> it is a tree. Also, it covers all the vertices. Hence it is a spanning tree. Q3) Is every spanning tree a hamiltonian path(converted to graph type)? A) No. Consider the following counter example: The blue colored edges form a spanning tree but not a hamiltonian path. Hope this helps.
