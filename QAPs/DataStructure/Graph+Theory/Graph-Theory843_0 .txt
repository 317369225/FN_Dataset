How do I solve this SAT math problem?With counting questions, you have to ask yourself how many choices you have for each decision. And this time, you have to realize that you can go "clockwise" or "counter-clockwise". Say you go clockwise starting from Quarryton. You start out with 3 roads to choose from. Then once you are in Richfield you have 2 choices and then in Bayvile you have only 1 choice. So there are 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ways to make the round trip clockwise. But you could also do each one in reverse (counterclockwise) so it's 6 x 2 = 12 paths. 731 Views  View Upvotes
