Are Graph Theory and Dynamic Programming required for Machine Learning?*A2A* There is an area of Machine Learning research called as Social Network Analysis, where people try to analyse social graphs for data mining and prediction purposes. Many a times, knowing graph theory can be very useful in that field. As for dynamic programming, any programmer worth his salt should know DP. Occasionally, some optimization methods can be solved with DP. For example, Viterbi algorithm which is used to find most probable path in a hidden markov model is actually dynamic programming algorithm. 604 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Samriddhi Sinha
