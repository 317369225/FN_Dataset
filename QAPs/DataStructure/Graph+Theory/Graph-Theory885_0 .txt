What is your favourite algorithm for computing an integral maximum flow?There are plenty of algorithms for computing an integral (integer-valued) maximum flow (e.g., some are listed here, Maximum flow problem ). Do you have any particular favourite? It doesn't have to be the most efficient one, but it may be the most efficient one for a problem that interests you.It is funny that I came across this question, because my overall favorite algorithm is the Push–relabel maximum flow algorithm. I was so surprised by how I loved learning about it that I even created a poll in my university's institute of informatics Facebook group asking people which algorithm was their favorite one. What I love about the push-relabel algorithm is that the way in which it works is surprisingly intuitive. Some algorithms rely on names or anecdotes to illustrate how they work, but the way that the push-relabel algorithm works is actually analogous what would happen in the physical world if you built a network of pipes (the graph's edges) connecting elevators (the graph's nodes) and were to update the elevators' heights (relabel operation) according to the algorithm's instructions, prompting the flow of water through the pipes (push operation). 382 Views · View Upvotes
