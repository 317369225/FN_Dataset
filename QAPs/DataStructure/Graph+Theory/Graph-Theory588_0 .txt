Why use a scatter graph?As an economic student they are very useful for 3 reasons. 1) They show how data Deviates from each other. say for instance, . 2) They show relationship between variables whether positive(up-ward sloping) or negative(down-ward sloping). 3) They show how data are scattered. it can be few data or a vast amount of data. for eg. the research on the consumption of coca-cola over the past 4 months(Jan, Feb, Mar & Apr) the data collected are plotted on the scatter diagram. from this you will be able to identify the the time frame people brought coca-cola, the direction of the points whether scattering in a upward pattern or down-ward pattern and the majority of consumers consuming coca-cola.
