What is the relationship between belief propagation and factor graph?In my mind, factor graph is a graphical expression of belief propagation. However, factor graph also can describe process other than belief propagation.Thanks for the A2A. I'm hardly an expert in this, but it's interesting that you should ask. I was just studying Judea Pearl's book Causality - more for the philosophical underpinnings of probability and its relationship to causal inference. Great book, BTW. Anyway, factorization of a probability distribution is used to more efficiently compute marginal probabilities. Factorizations can be represented by a factorization graph. The belief propagation algorithm computes marginal probabilities and requires factorization represented by a graph that is a tree or poly tree. So, for example, we couldn't use believe propagation for the factor graph in the example here: Factor graph 226 Views  Answer requested by Jun Lai
