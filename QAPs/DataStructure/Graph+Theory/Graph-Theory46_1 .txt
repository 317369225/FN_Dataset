Do matching theory only applies to bipartite graph?Can matching theory be also apply to any other graphs, such as complete graph? Additional Question: Is the use/sense of the matching in other graphs the same with the bipartite graphs(which is a special case of a network flow problem)?Of course, there are algorithms for matching in general graphs (not only bipartite), and there are even polynomial ones ! For example, the Blossom algorithm is one of those. Beware : they are usually far harder to code than in bipartite dase ! 126 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Melanie Atendido
