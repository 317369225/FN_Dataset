Why aren't there any limits on a break in a graph?I just got done with my first calc class of the semester and my professor stated that there aren't any limits on a break in a graph. He didn't get a chance to explain because class ended and said we would discuss it the following class. But I was just curious as to why.By break in a graph I'm assuming you mean a function that is discontinuous on some interval or points. A limit is the value of a function that is the same when approached from the left and the right. If both values are the same, the limit exists, if they are different then it doesn't. A graph that is broken will have a different value when you come from the left and the right. 176 Views  View Upvotes
