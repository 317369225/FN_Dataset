How do you label each axis on a line graph with ratios?For every 1 minute, I burn 15 calories on the treadmill. Minutes are the independent variable, right? Do I put the independent variable on the x or y axis on a line graph?It doesn't really matter. But yes, by convention the independent (user changeable) variable is placed on the horizontal axis, which is normally the x axis. So in your case, I'm guessing you'd have minutes on treadmill on the x-axis, calories burned on the y-axis, and then a "goal" line, which is a straight line with a slope of 15 (15 calories per minute). You might then plot your actual calories burned over time, which will likely be a somewhat jagged line (due to differences in run speed, heart rate, breath rate, etc.) to see how you did. 177 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Zoe Soltis
