Is it planar a graph with 16 edges and 8 vertices with all degree 4?The answer is maybe. As Dung Nguyen has shown there certainly is a planar graph that satisfies the requirements. However, start with K3,3 where V = {A,B,C,D,E,G} and E = {AD,AE,AF, BD, BE,BF, CD, CE,CF} Now let's add two vertices and 7 edges to obtain V = {A,B,C,D,E,G,H,G} and E = {AD,AE,AF, BD, BE,BF, CD, CE,CF, HA, HB, HC, HG, GD, GE, GF} We see a graph that satisfies the requirements of 8 vertices, 16 edges and all vertices have degree 4 that certainly not planar. 72 Views
