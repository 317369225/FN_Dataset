Why do I keep forgetting how djikstra algorithm works?I'm a software engineer in bay area company which does not deal with graphs. I study algorithms out of curiosity. Whenever i study these algorithms, i understand them and i have implemented them in code, but these concepts never stick in my head. They vaporize soon. How do i study them better?Always start off by getting to know the algorithm :) Read wikipedia it's always easy to get a jist of the algorithm first. Then try to do the algorithms by hand. Draw yourself a graph on paper! Do dijkstra right onto the graph. This will definitely help you remember how this algorithm works. Do it once or twice. When you are implementing, now look back onto the paper. This will solidify your understanding and follow the steps a lot easier (you did it yourself). Doesn't hurt to look at other people's implementation: [C++] Dijkstra - Pastebin.com And get some practice: SPOJ.com - Problem EZDIJKST . Usually only one problem isn't enough. Sometimes, you just don't implement enough, but if you do it so often all of a sudden you will be doing it from your heart. All algorithms should be done by hand, not only implemented. It will stick in your head a lot easier. Good luck! 652 Views  View Upvotes
