Which is the best algorithm to find the shortest path in MANET?There are many shortest path finding algorithms and each algorithm performs better for different scenarios, constraints and requirements. For now, start learning shortest path algorithms using BFS(fastest), Dijkstra(fast) and Ford Fulkerson(okay). They are used widely. 76 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Akshaya ML
