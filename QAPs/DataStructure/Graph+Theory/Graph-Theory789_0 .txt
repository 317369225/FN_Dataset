What is a vertex in math?There're probably a lot of areas of math that use the word vertex, but the most general notion of a vertex is in graph theory. A graph is an object which has vertices and edges. An edge always connects two vertices, and it can either be undirected or directed. That's all the definition consists of, and it turns out a lot of mathematical objects can be modelled as graphs. 83 Views
