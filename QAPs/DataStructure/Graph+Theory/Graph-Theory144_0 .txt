In my CS courses I studied graphs and passed with excellent score. I looked at math book about graphs and barely understood anything, is this bad?Very bad. Somehow you picked up the impression that studying a foundational branch of mathematics for a few weeks in a non-math class would allow you to read the technical literature without difficulty. I have at hand Gross and Yellen’s Handbook of Graph Theory. All 1,167 pages of it. Chapter 8.2 covers Random Graphs, which started just in 1959. That occupies only 15 pages of the entire book, followed by references to 86 of the most important papers in that particular field. You could easily spend two years just getting up to speed on that one area. And you’d still be lost if you moved very far outside that subdomain. 8k Views · View Upvotes
