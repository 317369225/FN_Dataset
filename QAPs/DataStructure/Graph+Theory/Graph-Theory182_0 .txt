Graph theory: What does the statement 'G has a matching of A into B' mean for a bipartite graph G(A, B)?I know the meaning of a set of matching lines. I encountered the statement while studying P Hall's theorem.Bipartle graph means it is graph whose vertices are divided into two disjoints sets A and B such that every vertex of A connects to only one vertex of B for G (A,B). Matching A into B means there should be one to one releationship between the two sets of vertices . Bipartile is special case for this . 28 Views
