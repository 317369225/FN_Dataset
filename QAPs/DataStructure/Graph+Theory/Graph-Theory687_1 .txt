How many number of circles that you can draw on the surface without creating more than one region?If we draw a circle in the plane , we separate the plane into 2 regions , inside and outside. Determine the maximal number of circles that you can draw on the surface without creating more than one region : Sphere, Torus , Pretzel(double -doughnut), Klein bottle and a projective plane.It is not possible to draw a circle (with radius > 0) on a sphere without creating more than 1 region. A circle on a sphere is a Sphere-plane intersection [1]. So if you draw a circle on a sphere you will create 2 regions, one above the plane and one below. Now for the torus: ​ The pink circle isn't splitting the torus in two regions, you can move everywhere in the torus without having to cross the line. It's the same for the red circle. With those two circles you can still go everywhere on the torus without crossing a line. But if you add one more circle it's over, you have split the torus in regions. So I'll say 2 for the torus ! Klein Bottle: You can draw one circle for sure on a Klein bottle without splitting it into regions. For example, draw a circle around the handle (inside or outside). But can you draw two circle without creating regions ? My guess is no because if you try to cut a Klein Bottle in half you'll get two mobius bands (see this video). I'll go for 1 for the Klein Bottle ​ [1] Circle of a sphere 207 Views · View Upvotes
