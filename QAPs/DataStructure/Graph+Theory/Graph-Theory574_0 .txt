Distributed Graph: What is the most effective way to distribute the nodes of a graph across different servers in distributed system?I have a graph with billions of nodes and millions of edges between them.I am trying to find a way distribute the nodes across the servers so that the load is uniform while processing.Your basic premise is wrong. You should not distribute the nodes but you should distribute the edges. I know, distributing the nodes sounds like such an intuitive idea. However, if you consider a graph as its connectivity matrix, then distributing the nodes corresponds to a one-dimensional distribution of the matrix, and numerical analysts have known for decades that that doesn’t scale. Distributing the edges corresponds to a two-dimensional distribution, which does scale. If you’re talking billions of nodes, then your problem is big enough that you should worry about scaling effects. Like I said, numerical analysts have known this forever. But since we are not doing “big data” or whatever buzzword-of-the-day, people who think that they are doing something radically new (like big data, or biocomputing people) don’t talk to traditional computation scientists. As a result of which they waste years in re-inventing the wheel. Sorry, had to get that off my chest. 493 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
