What are the best graph tools to show growth of a social network?I am looking for a tool that allows to show how dyads, triads, etc. connect through time with some sort of play, pause, fwd, rwd buttons. There should be an option to show decaying relationships as well.One of the tools I found that take care of showing the growth of a social network over time is Gephi. They call it exactly “Networks over time” and also refer to it as “dynamics”. See: Features. 57 Views
