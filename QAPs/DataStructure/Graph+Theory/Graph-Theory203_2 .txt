What is the reason that An An contains the number of walks of length n?Let A be the adjacency matrix of a graph G=(E,V). why is it that An An contains the number of walks of length n? Whats the proof and intuition? Is there a way to make this obvious?A represents the links between its rows and columns so that A xy =1  Axy=1 if there is a link from x  x to y  y . A 2 =ΣA xp A py   A2=ΣAxpApy has a link if there is a p such that there is a walk from x  x to p and from  p to y. Each term that you add allows a longer walk and each walk adds one to the corresponding term. A 3 =ΣA xp A pq A qy   A3=ΣAxpApqAqy etc I have used the convention that the sum goes over all indices that appear twice. 341 Views · View Upvotes
