What are the real life applications of minimum product spanning tree?Suppose that we have distinct V cities which could be connected by constructing E highways, now there is a cost associated with construction of a highway. We optimize the city network in such a way so that we can reach to any city from any city and the total cost occuring in construction of highways is minimal. Since minimum spanning tree is a tree after removing some edges from the graph, there is a path between any two vertices, therefore every city is connected. You can extend this same example in building a network of computers, connected by costly optical fibre. 128 Views
