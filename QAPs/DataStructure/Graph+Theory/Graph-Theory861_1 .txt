Can every statement in set theory be translated to one in graph theory?If you are happy with a directed graph, you can simply interpret ∈  ∈ as connectedness rather than set membership. If you want an undirected graph, you can resort to some ugly tricks.  For example, let the vertex set (technically a class) be all pairs of sets, together with a new element called 1.  The graph will be bipartite -- pairs of sets are never connected to one another, but they are sometimes connected to 1.  In particular, say that E((x,y),1)  E((x,y),1) holds in your graph just in case x∈y  x∈y as sets. There is a theorem in model theory (which I can't find a reference to...) which says that any model theoretic structure (such as a model of set theory) can be interpreted as a graph.  407 Views · View Upvotes
