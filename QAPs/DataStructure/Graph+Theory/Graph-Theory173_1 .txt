How do you prove that in a connected and acyclic graph, between any two vertices there is a unique path?By contradiction: Suppose that there are two paths between two vertices. Of these two paths, take the least path length that has two vertices in common. Concatenation of these two paths now forms a cycle in the graph. Which is a contradiction, as the premise was that it is acyclic. 192 Views  View Upvotes
