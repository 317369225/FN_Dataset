Is the null graph a tree?I checked several sources. Here are some equivalent conditions for an undirected graph to be a tree: A connected graph in which removing any one edge disconnects it. (Such edges are called bridges, so every edge in a tree is a bridge.) A connected graph without a cycle. A graph with no cycle in which adding any edge creates a cycle. A graph in which any two vertices are connected by a unique path (path edges may only be traversed once). The null graph has no edges and no vertices. It satisfies all of them. Here are some theorems about trees: A nonempty tree has one more vertex than edge. Every connected graph with one more vertex than edge is a tree. Every tree with at least two vertices has two leaves. (A leaf is a vertex of degree 1, also called pendant vertex.) A rooted tree is a tree in which on particular vertex is specified to be the root. There is no empty rooted tree. 418 Views  View Upvotes
