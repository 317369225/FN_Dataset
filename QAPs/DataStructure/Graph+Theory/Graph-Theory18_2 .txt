Why does the parent graph √x result in only positive y values?When we take the square root of a number it returns both a positive and negative value. Why do we exclude the negative values when we graph the √x . Note: I understand the graph would no longer be a funtion of x.It shows only positive values because you are only graphing positive values. If you are more precise then If y^2 = x then y = (+/-)sqrt(x) Not, y = sqrt(x). So, if you want the full graph you should plot it with the plus or minus. This will not be a function, though. You have to restrict the image to make it a function. To answer your question, we are not ignoring the negative values. We are simply graphing y = sqrt(x) instead of y = (+/-)sqrt(x). If you wanted just the negative part you can graph you = -sqrt(x). 64 Views
