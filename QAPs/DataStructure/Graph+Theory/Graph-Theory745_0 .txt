MS CS: Machine Learning or Graph Algorithm, Which course should I select?I would say machine learning, for the following reasons (disclosure: I did my PhD in ML, so obviously I am biased): When I look at my daily work, I use machine learning knowledge much more frequently than my knowledge of graph algorithms (though I have studied both). If you look at which is easier to "pick up", it is clearly graph algorithms; you can pick up a text on graph algorithms and understand the algorithms pretty easily. Machine learning is different. Machine learning is really an engineering discipline: there is some theoretical foundation, but a lot of it is a grab bag of different approaches that you have to learn how to apply to new problems. An assignment in graph algorithms is not going to teach you as much as an assignment on ML. 807 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Pooshan Vyas
