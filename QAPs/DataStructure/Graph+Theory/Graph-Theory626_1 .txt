What is the maximum number of edge of a planar graph?This is a pretty interesting question. First, let's clarify that we consider a simple graph, i.e. we forbid loops and multiple edges. So assume that we have a simple planar graph on v  v vertices and we want to maximise e  e . Firstly, if we have a planar graph with the maximum number of vertices then every face is a triangle*, because otherwise we could add a new edge in such a way that the graph would remain planar. This means that 3f=2v  3f=2v . Let's insert this in Euler's formula v−e+f=2  v−e+f=2 to obtain e=3v−6  e=3v−6 . Notice that this is an equality for any triangulated graph, so the bound is achieved. *This is not the case when we have 0, 1 or 2 vertices, and the answers for them are 0, 0 and 1 respectively. 232 Views · View Upvotes
