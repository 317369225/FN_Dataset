How can we prove that every simple graph with n vertices and m edges has a increasing trail of length at least (2m/n)?Each edges has a unique number from 1 to m. We call a trail increasing if the sequence of number of its edges are increasingLabel the vertices a 1 ,…a n .  a1,…an.   We will construct n  n different trails t 1 ,…,t n   t1,…,tn that satisfy the following : (i) The trails are increasing (ii) They end with different vertices (iii) Their length sum to 2m  2m At first each trail is just a single vertex. List the edges in increasing order and add them to the trails one by one. When adding edge ab  ab , we simply add the edge to the end of the two trails that currently end at a  a or b  b . (i) and (ii) are invariant throughout the process. Each edge add two to the sum of lengths of the trail, so at the end we have (iii). One of the trails must have length at least 2m/n  2m/n 213 Views · View Upvotes
