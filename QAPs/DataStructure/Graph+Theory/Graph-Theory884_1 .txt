Is there some form of mathematics that can be used to predict resonance structures and double bond patterns on a large sheet of fused cyclic alkenes?When I try to draw out these structures, I find the constraints of where double bonds can form to lead to some very interesting, but seemingly chaotic patterns. Is there a way to model these patterns with respect to where the double bonds can form and what resonance structures they give?As we all know from basic chemistry, every carbon likes to form 4 bonds. In a hexagonal lattice like this, every node (carbon atom) has three connections, meaning exactly one of those lines has to be a double bond. That line extends another node, mean that next node cannot have any other doub bonds, because it already has 4 bonds. Which means that you follow one of the single bonds, there are two possible configurations for the bonds after that- either you follow the cycle (do that three times, and you return to where you start), or you take the cis-configuration (doing this forever produces a straight line) - since every node has two of these "neighbors", (horrible term, I'm really tired), that means each node can have both be cyclical, both be cis, or one of each. If we were only to use cyclical configurations, it'd look like this: On the other hand, if we only used the cis configuration, it'd look like this: Obviously, we can mix the two together, and it becomes less regular when we do that, but every double bond has those relations with its neighbors - some of them have one type with one neighbor, but the other type with another. 181 Views  View Upvotes
