Is there any way to represent the degree matrix with the adjacency matrix?As we all know, given a graph, the laplacian matrix is defined as L = D - A, where D is the degree matrix, A is the adjacency. I was wondering can we construct a few matrix operations to represent D with A, e.g., D = XAY. Then define the laplacian matrix with only the adjacency matrix.One way would be D=diag(Aj)  D=diag(Aj) , where j  j is the vector of all ones and diag(v)  diag(v) is the diagonal matrix whose i th   ith diagonal entry is the i th   ith entry of vector v  v . You cannot write down D  D in the form XAY  XAY in general. To see why, suppose A  A is the adjacency matrix of the cycle on four vertices C 4   C4 . This is a regular graph of degree two, so D=2I  D=2I and we have XAY=2I.  XAY=2I. But the adjacency matrix of C 4   C4 is ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0110 1001 1001 0110 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟   (0110100110010110) which has rank two. Thus, XAY  XAY , which has rank at most two, is equal to 2I  2I , which has rank four - a manifest contradiction. 310 Views · View Upvotes
