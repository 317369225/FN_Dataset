What is the difference between traversal and walk in a graph?I think that you might find different answers for this question based on the specific community looking at the problem. We usually refer to a traversal as an access of edge e=(u,v) . A walk would probably constitute a series of traversals such as (u,v1), (v1,v2), (v2,v3),â€¦ Note that (u,v1), (v4,7) would not be a walk as these do not make a path. 37 Views
