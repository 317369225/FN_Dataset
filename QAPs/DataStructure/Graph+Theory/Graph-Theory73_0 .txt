Is there any company that specializes in applied social graph analysis?I am looking for jobs where I can use the techniques I learned in social network analysis. I couldn’t think of companies other than the major social networks like Facebook and Linkedin.What is your background in social network analysis? I’m no expert in hiring practices, but my intuition says that many companies appreciate the ability to analyze social graphs mainly in the context of a general aptitude for being able to solve problems. Do you have much experience with algorithmic design and analysis? Do you have experience in web development or graph databases? Because I think companies like Facebook and LinkedIn will be more interested in these things than someone who may have studied social graphs in a math context (barring some exceptions). As a rephrasing of the questions above, what skills do you as someone experienced in social network analysis have that someone with a reasonable aptitude for algorithmic design and other technical skills do not have? If you can’t point to anything tangible, perhaps you should focus on those skills and see if some companies might see your experience in social graphs as an added bonus. In particular, focus on graph problems in general and see if that helps you widen the net. 103 Views · View Upvotes
