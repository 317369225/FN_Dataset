How do you graph y = (x+1)(x-5)/(x-2)(x+3)?y = (x+1)(x-5)/(x-2)(x+3) What are some significant things to find (like x and y intercepts) and how do you find them?If you have a graphing calculator just plug it in. Other wise you know there will be vertical asymptotes at +2 and -3, because that is where the denominator will equal zero, so the function will be undefined. You also know the function will equal zero at -1 and +5, because that is where the numerator will equal zero. Now evaluate some values close to the vertical asymptotes, Make a table of values for x values like -6,-5,-4,-3.5,-3.25, -2.75,-2.5,-2,-1,0,1,1.5,1.75, 2.25,2.5,3,4,5 18 Views  Answer requested by Isabella-Marie Cullen
