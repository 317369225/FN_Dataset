A random subset of a large graph contained a giant connected component, can someone explain why without complex mathematics?I generated a random subset from a graph that contained over 70k nodes and 500k edges. The random graph contained a giant connected component in the middle and I can't figure out why. Is there a theory behind this that can be explained without too much maths?The minimum number of edges needed for a graph to become connected is (n-1) i.e. a tree, where n is the number of nodes. Your graph contains 70k nodes and 500k edges. Therefore in the best case, you already have a connected component to begin with and taking a subset of this will also yield another connected component. In the worst case, you will still have connected components but the graph itself may not be connected. In conclusion, there exists at least one connected component in the graph you have described. All that is left now is a formula for determining, given a graph which contains k connected components, what is the probability of a randomly selected subset of n nodes also being connected? This will involve slightly complex math, so I rest my case. 51 Views  View Upvotes
