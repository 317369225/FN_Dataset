In theory, can you mathematically graph anything?Excluding plotting every individual point.No. Consider the function that is 1 on the rational numbers and 0 on the irrational numbers. This graph is discontinuous at every point. If you were to try and graph it then it would look like the combined graph of y=0 and y=1. There are other “undrawable” mathematical objects. For instance the Cantor set is a fractal with dimension less than one. While it is possible to draw the intermediate steps there’s no way to draw the set itself. Perhaps the “best” representation would be to not draw anything at all. 948 Views · View Upvotes
