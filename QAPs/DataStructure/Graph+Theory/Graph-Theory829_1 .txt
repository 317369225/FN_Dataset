In what ways does Palantir utilize graph theory?I would say, the most useful one from the NSA's perspective would be to see who is connected to whom, and who could become a big national risk. Based on YouTube videos, I can say they analyze phone calls, emails and other contact flows - as well as monitor payment flows. This would be used to figure out whom to neutralize to prevent certain kinds of organizations from booming. There may be other domains where graph processing could be applied by Palantir, but this caught my eye. 499 Views  View Upvotes
