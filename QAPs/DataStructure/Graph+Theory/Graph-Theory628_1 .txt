What does the term "folklore" mean in mathematics?At the end of chapter 1 in Stanley's Algebraic Combinatorics: The connection between graph eigenvalues and the enumeration of walks is considered "folklore". By this does he mean that this connection is generally known but unpublished? I'm not sure.A mathematical result might be referred to as folklore if it's been known for a while but nobody knows who first came up with it. Perhaps it's been passed around in mathematical circles for years, during which time a number of variants have popped up. Unlike literary folklore, mathematical folklore is typically known to be true. Referring to a result as folklore is a way to make it clear that you don't deserve credit for coming up with it even if you don't have a good citation for it. 794 Views  View Upvotes
