How do you solve and graph y=-2x-4?A non cheating way :) is this: Draw an x and an y axis on a sheet of paper. Find the y for x=0: y = -2X0 -4 or y=-4 Draw a dot at (0,-4). Now find the y when x is for example the middle of your x axis, let's say x=5: y= -2X5 -4 or y= -14 Draw a dot at (5,-14). Now take a ruler and draw a straight line through the 2 dots. Explain why the line is straight. 133 Views
