What does cryptography have to do with graph theory?It’s a very weird connection between two of my most favourite branches of Computer Science. To understand that, you must first need to understand what Expander graphs are. And expander graph is technically a finite graph, (undirected, mind you) which has a low degree parameter and a high expansion parameter, meaning that it’s basically a very strongly connected version of a normal graph. So these graphs, along with a very queer little thing called a Cayley graph, are mostly used in setting up rigorous cryptographic protocols, based on properties like graph isomerism, coloring, etc. It’s a long stretch but you can connect these to modern cryptic mechanisms like MD5, SHA1, AES, etc. Also, the superhero for us computer scientists, a certain Srininvas Ramanujan, created an eponymous graph which is an excellent spectral expander. The Ramanujan graph is extensively used in topology, security, etc. For further reference, be sure to check out this presentation by Jean-Jacques Quisquater, one of the pioneers of modern cryptography. https://www.win.tue.nl/diamant/symposium05/absracts/quisquater.pdf Hope this helps.
