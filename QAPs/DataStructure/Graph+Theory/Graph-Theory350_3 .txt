How do you graph y = (x+1)(x-5)/(x-2)(x+3)?y = (x+1)(x-5)/(x-2)(x+3) What are some significant things to find (like x and y intercepts) and how do you find them?find the value for y if x=0,and find the value for x if y=0,find the domain and range,this is how you graph and find x or y intercepts, i can do these for you,sorry buddy,because im not sure if it’s your homework, so only the method. Btw, you can solve graph problems in Desmos(it’s not an ad,it’s very useful,sorry) 22 Views · Answer requested by Isabella-Marie Cullen
