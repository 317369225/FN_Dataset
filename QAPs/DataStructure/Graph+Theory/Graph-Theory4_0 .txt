How are algorithmic trading and graph theory related?How can graph theory be used in high frequency trading and algorithmic trading?Algorithmic trading is about finding patterns in data and trading on them in future. In this qplum tech talk, we discussed the benefits of causal inference in modeling, pertaining to but not limited to financial modeling. A good way to infer and visualize causal inference is graphical models. Let me give an example of how graphical models lead to more robust models that simply speaking, make more money in future. You see we care about making money in future. We don’t really care about getting great results in backtests of past data. However, we can only learn from past data since we don’t have future data! However, we need to make models from past data that actually work in future data. That is where graphical models help. In the above models the distance between entities is based on the strength of their relationship. This is a very relevant question in today’s high data density world. Thanks for the A2A.
