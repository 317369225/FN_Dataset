How do I apply graph theory in social network analysis?I am not an expert in the area. But I have studied the subject quite a bit and participated in research with people who are officially experts on this. First, my advice is that you should make a clear distinction between Math and Modeling (true in general but I will explain you my view w/respect to this subject). Namely, all the math that you would learn in an intro graduate level course in Graph Theory is not as relevant to Social Network Analysis. Such general Graph Theory goes through abstractions that in the majority are not (so far) applicable to what you would like to model for large systems of people. How it came to be actually is first to look at the data (plot degree dist, diameter or whatever metric you are interested in), run experiments and propose some models. In fact, the graph theory part (so far) of Social Network Analysis is much more user friendly than pure Graph Theory. It is not really ‘pure’ graph theory, there are elements of statistical physics or dynamical systems embedded (percolation, point processes, scaling theory). But as I said, this is all kept to the minimum of complexity compared to the pure fields. You already have enough trouble explaining the real data, no need to get fancy unless it is the only way. In my opinion, the true difficulty of Social Network Analysis is the Data Analysis part (“Data Analysis” very roughly speaking of course). The models are often simple enough to understand or develop without much sophistication or background on those fields. Then, other statistical and optimization tools become quite important, more in this Data Analysis side, (depending on which generation of research you look at) such as survival analysis, sub-modular optimization, convex optimization among others. You might want to have a look at Stanford Network Analysis Project . Whatever your specific question is, you will probably find it there. 187 Views
