Is it possible to draw the shape below without taking your pencil off the paper?Sorry for the poor image. This is the best i could draw in paint!Yes you can draw this without taking pencil off the paper. You can draw this if you can draw two parallel lines. You can draw parallel lines if you draw the alphabet "U". If you remove the lower curverd portion of U you will have two parallel lines. From there you can go on draw your desired image. 1.3k Views
