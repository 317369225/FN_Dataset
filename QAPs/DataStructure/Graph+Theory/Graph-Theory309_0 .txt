Can you graph the ackermann's function?It’s a pretty boring graph. Keeping in mind that, commonly defined, Ackerman’s function is a two-variable function, I’ll discuss the single-variable variant f(n)=A(n,n)  f(n)=A(n,n) below. What it’ll look like is a line of dots almost at zero, then one dot at the top of the graph in the upper right corner. The number of dots almost at zero will depend solely on the scaling of the y  y -axis. It most likely won’t be more than 2 or 3, but it can be as many as you want, if you make the scale big enough. It’ll look virtually the same on a log graph as well. Rethinking this, I think a slight correction is that depending on scale, the one dot on the right can be at any height, including not there. The rest of the dots will be close to zero. It will look like this because: Ackermann’s function is not continuous, but is discrete. This means that it’ll have one value per integer, so you’ll get dots instead of a curve. Ackermann’s function grows extremely fast. f(0)=1,f(1)=3,f(2)=7,f(3)=61,f(4)=2 2 2 65536   −3≈10 10 10 19728     f(0)=1,f(1)=3,f(2)=7,f(3)=61,f(4)=22265536−3≈10101019728 . For that last, the number of digits of the number of digits is more than a google to the google. Wolfram Alpha lists A(4,4)  A(4,4) as “too large to represent”. f(5)  f(5) is so big that even on that scale, f(4)  f(4) is as zero. Even looking at the 2-variable form, the only interesting part of the graph for A(m,n)  A(m,n) is near that narrow strip of m<4  m<4 . Even A(3,n)=2 n+3 −3  A(3,n)=2n+3−3 is exponential in n  n , so it gets out of control quick. 990 Views · View Upvotes
