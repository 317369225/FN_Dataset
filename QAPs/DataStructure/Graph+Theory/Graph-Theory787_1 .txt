Is this statement true every time, weight of any spanning tree is less than 2 times weight of minimum spanning tree?I would like to add two more details the graph is complete n follows triangle inequalityConsider the list of 6 points: (label,coordinates) (A,(o,1)) (B,(0,2)) (C,(0,3)) (D,(100,3)) (E,(100,2)) (F,(100,1)) Say an edge exists between any pair of points and the weight of that edge is the Euclidean distance between then The tree defined by V={A,B,C,D,E,F} and E={AB,BC,CD,DE,EF} has weight 1+1+100+1+1 = 104 The tree defined by V={A,B,C,D,E,F} and E={AF,BF,BE,CE,CD} has weight greater than 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 500 This example shows that the statement is not true every time. 109 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Apoorva Sahay
