What is the upper bound on the number of edge disjoint spanning trees in a complete graph of n vertices?An upper bound is simple to obtain. Each spanning tree has n−1  n−1 edges and there are n(n−1)/2  n(n−1)/2 edges in a complete graph, so there can be no more than ⌊n/2⌋  ⌊n/2⌋ edge-disjoint spanning trees by the pigeonhole principle. I believe this bound can be attained for prime n  n with a little bit of light number theory using the following paths as trees: 1, 2, 3, … 1, 3, 5, … 1, 4, 7, … etc. 50 Views
