Is someone building a graph database based on video?For example to find connections within videos and between parts of different videos. Are Netflix, Google/YouTube, Facebook, etc, doing this? Startups?Not sure about whether applications are being built that do this sort of thing, but I wouldn’t be surprised. One thing I should mention is that such an app wouldn’t be much different from any other type of app using a database, graph or otherwise. In this case, I’d guess the app would build its structures by doing some sort of mining of the videos and images and creating links. Assuming a graph database engine was the best engine for their purposes, the app would load these links and other identifiers that can be mapped to actual video - which is Very Unlikely to be stored in the database - into the graph db’s dataworld. The part of the app that’s using the links would then navigate the graph datastore like any other application, and would use the identifiers to fetch the video as needed. Graph database Naturally, as with all image or video processing, the above “mining” is the main “secret sauce” of this application. 261 Views · View Upvotes
