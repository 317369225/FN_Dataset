Why can't we run Bellman Ford from the source and relax edges out from the neighbours recursively and do a single pass through the edges?At each kth iteration, we can only find shortest paths that are k long.Then, why not only relax edges that are directly connected to the source on the first iteration, the neighbors' edges as well as the directly connected edges on the second iteration, and so forth?You may find this question helpful: What does the relaxation procedure do in the Bellman-Ford Algorithm? 212 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
