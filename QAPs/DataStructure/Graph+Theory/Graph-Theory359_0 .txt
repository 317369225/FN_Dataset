How do I Draw the graph of [(x-4) (x-1)] / [(x-2) (x-3)]?First find out the points where the numerator and denominator goes to zero.Points where numerator is zero they are zeroes of function and points where denominator goes to zero ,value of function tends to infinity. Check the sign of the function depending on the interval in which x is lying. so zeroes are at x=1,4 at x=2,3 values tends to infinity,make straight line parallel to y-axis at x=2,3. then find out the value of function at x=0,+infinity,-infinity. f(0)=2/3;f(+infinity)=1 (it's an indeterminant form,i.e.,inf/inf)=f(-infinity).Then check the changing sign of function. f(-inf)=1; f(x)->positive when x<1; f(x)->negative when 1<=x<2;sign changes from positive to negative it means there is a local minima exists. f(x)->positive when 2<x<3;sign change from negative to positive it means local maxima exists. f(x)->negative when 3<x<=4;sign changes from positive to negative it means local minima exists. f(x)->positive when x>4 and when x tends to infinity value saturates,i.e.,f(+inf)=1. 237 Views  View Upvotes
