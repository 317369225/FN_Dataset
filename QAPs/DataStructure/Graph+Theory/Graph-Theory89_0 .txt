What is the procedure to graph the equation of a line 2x+4y=6 using the slope-intercept method? Is there more than one solution?Method 1: to draw a straight line you just need to join any 2 points. Set x=0 and solve for y. Then set y=0 and solve for x. Now plot and join these 2 points (0,y) and (x,0), which are basically the intercept with y and x axes. Method 2: rewrite the equation of the line in the form y=mx+b (make y the subject). The y intercept is b; plot this point. The coefficient of x is the slope so from point b you can draw a line with gradient m. In your case b=3/2 and m=-1/2 Both methods give you the same graph. 82 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Paul Robinson
