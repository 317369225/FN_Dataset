In modern mathematics or physics is distance ever defined as the number of discrete steps between starting point and ending point?Irrespective of the way spatial distance is ordinarily measured in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.As soon as you approximate your space by a lattice, number of steps becomes the natural definition of the distance. This is routinely done in statistical physics where they study many lattice models describing various phenomena. A good example would be Ising model 192 Views  View Upvotes
