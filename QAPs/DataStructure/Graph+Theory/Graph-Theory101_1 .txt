Is there any algorithm to find shortest path between two nodes with negative cycle?NO, There are two main algorithms to determine the shortest path between any two nodes in graph (1) Dijistras: It fails on negative edges, because it relaxes edges only once, so Dijistras algorithms’ will determine shortest path, taking negative edge only once (however it will return a answer but will be incorrect), (2) Bellman ford algorithm : This algorithm take graph as input and return weather a given graph contains negative edge or not, if it contains negative edge then will return 0, 37 Views · View Upvotes
