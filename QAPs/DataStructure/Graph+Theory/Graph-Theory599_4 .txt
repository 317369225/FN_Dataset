What is the Dijkstra shortest path for the following graph?The source for the Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is A. I wanted to know how to proceed in case there are multiple contenders to update a vertex ?I think here you are talking about the parent of the vertex (v). I also assume that you know the algorithm. We choose the vertex(u) having minimum value from the minimum-priority-queue. So after relaxation of the vertex(v) if the condition is true for relaxation then the vertex(u) is the parent of the vertex (v). Relex(u,v,w){  If(v.d<u.d + w(u,v)){  v.d= u:d + w(u,v);  v.parent=u;  } } And now if there is some other vertex(u) which are capable of being parent of vertex(v).The vertex (u) will be the parent of vertex (v) because if you see the code in function Relax(u,v,w) the condition  v.d< u:d + w(u,v);v.d is less than ,not less than equal to. So here vertex (u) will be the parent of vertex (v) rather than vertex (u). If you have any questions please feel free to ask. 37 Views  View Upvotes
