What is the difference between a y and an x graph?When using the Cartesian coordinate system, we typically use horizontal and vertical intersecting axes to show the relationship between 2 or more variables. Within a graph with 2 variables (x and y in your question) we usually name the horizontal axis the x axis and the vertical axis the y axis. Further to this, the x axis will usually be the 'independent variable' (a typical example is given as time) and the y axis will measure the 'dependant variable'. 45 Views
