Why don't we use a stack in breadth first search (BFS)?A stack is not simply an expandable storage location; it hands back what gets put into it in a specific order. When we do a search (BFS or DFS), we need to store the list of things to search next and retrieve them in a specific order. A stack does not return the things to search next in the right order for a BFS. A queue does. The really neat thing about BFS and DFS is that despite the differences between them, I can use the same code for both, using a stack for a DFS and a queue for a BFS. 130 Views  View Upvotes
