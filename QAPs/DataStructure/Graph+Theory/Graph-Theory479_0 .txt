Given start and target position of a robot on a 2D grid with obstacles. What is the shortest path length, if robot can remove at most 3 obstacles?Robot can move up, down, left and right.If an obstacle occupies a single cell, it is a straightforward BFS problem. Imaging your maze is three-dimensional, with levels one above another. All levels are identical with respect to the placement of obstacles. You can move within the level avoiding obstacles, or you can step onto the obstacle simultaneously being teleported to one level above. The { X, Y } coordinates are how far have you reached, and the Z coordinate, “up”, which starts from zero, is how many obstacles have you removed (or rather “went through”) so far. Naturally, as you are standing on the obstacle at a point with positive Z, you can step off it to the nearby unoccupied cell at no level increase. Assume for simplicity removing or walking through obstacles is free in terms of time; we just can do it no more than three times. In this case, just start the BFS from the origin and wait until it reaches the destination — at any Z coordinate not exceeding three. Naturally, as you don’t need to consider robot’s trajectory after removing more than three obstacles, the range of your Z coordinate is just 4 — { 0, 1, 2, 3 } — where 0 corresponds to no obstacles removed, and 1, 2, and 3 correspond to 1, 2, and 3 obstacles removed respectively. Alternatively, one can treat the Z coordinate as “how many more obstacles can I remove”, begin from Z = 3, go down in levels, and add a constraint that going below Z=0 is unacceptable. The number of steps on the iteration of BFS that first reaches the destination { X, Y } point at any Z level would be the answer to the original problem. 999 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
