What are the vertices of a triangular pyramid?The vertices of any solid are its corners; the places where the edges meet. A triangular pyramid (tetrahedron) has four vertices, six edges and four faces. Any four arbitrarily chosen points in three-dimensional space will be the vertices of some triangular pyramid, unless all four points lie on the same plane. If the choice of points is completely random, the chance of the latter would be very small. [Some would say even the planar figure formed by joining four such points is a special case of a pyramid with zero height :) ] 178 Views  View Upvotes
