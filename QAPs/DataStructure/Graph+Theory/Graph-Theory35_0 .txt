What mathematical knowledge do you meed to study graph theory?There is a lot of graph theory that is pretty elementary. If it’s your first course, you won’t need much. If you start investigating the properties of adjacency matrices (see Algebraic connectivity) you need some linear algebra. And you can get pretty wild with topological graph theory (https://www.amazon.com/Topologic...) which will require a healthy amount of topology as background. 380 Views · View Upvotes
