What are popular graph matching algorithms for tuples of varying length in python?I am new to this area. the problem is, I have tuples of varying length, each tuple contains some words. I have to match similarity of each tuple with other based on the number of words matched and return that number. Can anyone tell me the in a step by step manner how to approach this problem.Step 1: Let’s say you have a function called compare_tuples that takes two tuples as arguments, compares them based on the number of words they contain and how they match, and returns a suitable result. def compare_tuples(tuple_a, tuple_b): # match and score return score Step 2: Iterate over all possible combinations of the list of tuples taking two at a time. Call the function compare_tuples for each pair and save the score (in a dictionary or suitable data structure where you can identify each result with its matched pair of tuples) from itertools import combinations   tuple_pairs = combinations(list_of_tuples, 2) for each pair in tuple_pairs: score[each] = compare_tuples(pair[0], pair[1]) One of the many ways possible. 91 Views
