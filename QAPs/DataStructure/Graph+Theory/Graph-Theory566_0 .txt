Why did my graph give infinity as the pagerank for each node?I am using Gephi to calculate pagerank, everything was working fine until I decided to remove a few edges, at which point I got infinity for the pagerank score of every node. Note that there are no leaf nodes, I removed 10 edges out of a total of 65.Maybe there was a division by zero or some invalid operation involved. Gephi is open source, anybody can contribute to it, but I'm not informed to say anything further. 85 Views
