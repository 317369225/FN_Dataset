How do I graph y=113x y=113x ?The above question can be framed in two different ways. y=(1/13x) if this is the case then the curve of the graph will be same as the curve of y=1/x just the curve will be contracted a bit as you can see previously we get y=1 when x=1 but in this we will get y=1 when x=1/13. y=(1/13)x In this case now its a case of straight line as we can compare it with y=mx+c where 1/13 is the slope of the graph and no 0 i.e no intercept on y axis. 16 Views
