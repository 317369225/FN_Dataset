How do you solve and graph y=-3x-6?Well it can be solved in two ways. Firstly, the equation of a straight line of the form y=mx+c  y=mx+c interprets m to be the slope or inclination of the straight line and c to be the y-intercept. Now from this equation we find that c = -6, i.e. the straight line cuts the y-axis at -6. The slope of the line is -3, i.e. angle it makes with positive y-axis is tan −1 x  tan−1⁡x Alternative method is, another form of the straight line equation xa +yb =1  xa+yb=1 a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept. Reducing this equation to the same form x−2 +y−6 =1  x−2+y−6=1 Therefore it cuts the x-axis at -2 and the y-axis at -6. 98 Views
