What is the best way to implement a graph in Java for competitive programming? Are there any Java graph libraries that could be used in competitions?No, you would not require any library. You can use simple array and class(or structure) for nodes most of the times and sometimes you wouldn’t even require any extra data structure. Just go through the links below, it will explain everything about graph in Competitive Programming. 1.Graph Theory 2 Flood Fill See some examples of implementation of classical graph questions. For eg: Question: Knight Moves Solution: UVa 439 Knight Moves Solution (SCU - 1073, POJ - 2243, HDU - 1372, ZOJ - 1091) There are many variants of graph problems, in some questions you will not even make a node, like in above problem. Try searching and implementing some basic graph question first on Codeforces and Hackerrank. 135 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Anuj Khandelwal
