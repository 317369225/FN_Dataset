Why do companies like Quora ask potential employees to know Number Theory, Graph Theory if it's not required to build the site in the first place?Did Adam D'Angelo have this knowledge while building Quora or is he more focused on the bigger picture and acquiring talents that have certain skill sets ?I can't answer the specifics of why Quora does it, but I can explain why we do something similar. It depends on the job role: for junior / front-end devs, then we don't require "mathematical / coding sophistication" in the abstract. for senior devs, we require a lot of mathematical knowledge, because a lot in our world is inherently mathematical. By asking questions in a few areas around this, we are filtering candidates for ability in, and interest in, mathematics - in the sense of things like reasoning, abstraction, and the like. The questions we ask are a lot less detailed than the things we ask about, say, CSS, Javascript or SQL refactoring... ... which is why I give that part of the test rather than one of the existing senior devs :-) 402 Views  View Upvotes
