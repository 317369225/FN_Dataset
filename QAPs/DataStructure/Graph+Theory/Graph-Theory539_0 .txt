What are some open problems in graph theory that if proved, solve many other problems?From a Computational Complexity perspective, I think Evan Oman’s answer is pretty much on the right track, stating the generic trend of Algorithmic hardness in Graph Theoretic problems as being of fundamental importance in the P/NP question. However, the power of the best of these Algorithms often utilizes results from various Extremal and Algebraic Graph Theory techniques. Here is an exhaustive list of problems that relate to many Algorithmic problems in Computational Complexity. The conjectures stated herein are of a purely Mathematical nature, that when proved, would directly translate to Algorithm design : Problems in Graph Theory and Combinatorics Now, I would like to add 1  1 more problem explicitly to this list : Graph Isomorphism : Isomorphic Graphs — This problem holds central importance, and late last year, Dr. Laszlo Babai came up with the fastest known Algorithm for Graph Isomorphism. It runs in Quasi-Polynomial time and talks in detail about a class of graphs called Johnson Graphs as the major obstacle to achieving a Polynomial-Time Graph Isomorphism Algorithm. ([1512.03547] Graph Isomorphism in Quasipolynomial Time) — This paper is a good example of the use of Group Theory and Combinatorics to solve Graph Theory problems. Notice that Graph Isomorphism < P   <P String Isomorphism , and so, Babai’s result mainly referenced an Algorithm for the latter, which also conveniently solves GI. (A Quasipolynomial Time Algorithm for Graph Isomorphism: The Details) Graph Isomorphism is NP, but not NP-Complete (or atleast, is not shown to be, yet), so insights into solving it would not imply P=NP  P=NP or vice-versa, but give important mathematical insights in general. 423 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Alaleh Adn
