Given an N vertex graph with m1 one way edges and m2 two way edges, how can we direct the two way edges such that we won't have any closed walks?If it is impossible, tell that it is impossible to do such thing.I’m not convinced it is always possible. For example if N = 3 and m1 = 0 then reversing one of each two way edges gives a cycle. Reversing one or two still gives a cycle around the three vertices. 48 Views · View Upvotes
