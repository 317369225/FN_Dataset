What is the complexity of the fastest method to k-color any graph?The answer isn't good, as the problem is NP-hard for any k>3 k>3 . So we don't even know whether the fastest method will be polynomial or super-polynomial. According to Wikipedia , there is an algorithm to decide whether a coloring exists in O(2nn) O(2nn) time, and you can also do it a bit faster if k k is 3 or 4. You can probably tweak that to actually find the coloring as well, but it's not going to scale well with any known algorithm. 207 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Abdullah Khan
