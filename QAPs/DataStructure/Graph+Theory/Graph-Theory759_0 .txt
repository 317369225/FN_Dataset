Where do I start (from basic calculus) to understand/practice basic graph theory?Basic graph theory requires no calculus. Know what a matrix is. Know how proofs work. Know what a set is, and how to read set notation. Be able to draw (although you don't have to be an artist). Understand ordinary high-school level combinatorics and permutations.And then you can dive in without delay. More advanced graph theory concepts, such as random graphs, do require familiarity with statistics and the associated calculus. Initially, though, this is not a requirement. 385 Views  View Upvotes
