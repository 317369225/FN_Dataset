Is it possible to have a connected cyclic graph with no. of edges = (no. of nodes) -1?prove with exampleFirstly, a *continuous* graph holds no meaning in Graph Theory, as far as I know. If by continuous, you mean *connected*, then NO. Such a Graph is a Tree. However, if the graph G=(V,E)  G=(V,E) is such, that, G=G 1 ∪G 2   G=G1∪G2 ∪  ∪ ..  .. ∪  ∪ G m   Gm , where G i   Gi is a connected component of the Graph, then YES. Any disconnected Graph G=(V,E)  G=(V,E) having |E|≥3  |E|≥3 can possibly have a cycle as a Sub-Graph. 232 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
