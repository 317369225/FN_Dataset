Why is using admissible function for A* search guarantees to find shortest paths?Admissible heuristic is used to estimate the cost from particular state to the goal state it guarantees that the solution is the shortest path. Letâ€™s take an example. suppose we want to go from S to G. here the steps: Expand S and add its neighbors(G & A) to the queue The cost of S->G is 5 plus 0 for heuristic(5+0=5) The cost of S->A is 1 plus 6 for heuristic(6+1=7) In the next loop will pop up the smallest cost which is S->G The A-star stop and return the path S->G which is not the shortest path The problem is the heuristic value of A is bigger than the true cost. Try to repeat the steps but this time make the heuristic value of A <= true cost (2 for example) 63 Views
