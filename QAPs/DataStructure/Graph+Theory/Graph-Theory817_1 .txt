How many faces, edges and vertices does a hexagonal pyramid have? How are they determined?Because your base is hexagonal, the pyramid will have one additional triangular face for each edge of the base. That makes for a total of 7 faces: 6 triangular faces plus one hexagonal face. The base provides 6 vertices, and the top of the pyramid adds 1 more, for a total of 7 vertices. There are 6 edges made up by the base, and 6 more shared edges extending from there to the top for a total of 12 edges. The expansion of it would look like this (Note that some edges and vertices are shared and can only be counted once):  141 Views
