What is number of graphs you can have on n (n is even) vertices where degree of each vertex can only be 1?I'm assuming here all vertices are distinct. Well, if all are same, the answer's 1  1 . If a mix of same and distinct, you can use some theorem which can be left for some other time. Order all the given vertices from 1  1 to n  n randomly. Start with vertex 1  1 . There are n−1  n−1 options for its "partner". Suppose we select any one of them. Now move to the next vertex with lowest number which is unpaired. There are n−3  n−3 options for its partner. So, as we go on, by multiplicative rule of P&C, we get the answer to be (n−1)(n−3)(n−5)...1  (n−1)(n−3)(n−5)...1 This product is the product of all odd numbers less than n  n . 72 Views
