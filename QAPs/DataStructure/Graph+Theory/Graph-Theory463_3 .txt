Is the total distance and total displacement in a time graph the same?Is the formula to find total distance and total displacement in a linear motion graph the same? (It's a velocity - time graph)A2A: Cameron is right. Total distance implies a non-negative path length that represents, for example, what the odometer of an automobile would show. Total displacement is a vector sum, which represents the final distance from the starting point. Depending on the context, displacement might refer to the vector from origin to destination, or it might refer only to the length of the vector. Displacement does not refer to the length of the path that you actually took to reach the destination. 55 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Ana Amalia
