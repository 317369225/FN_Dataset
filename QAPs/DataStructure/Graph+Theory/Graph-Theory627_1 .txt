What is the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with n n vertices?In the non-trivial cases, that is we assume that there are no self-incident edges (This would lead to an unbounded maximum for any planar graph), we can see through inspection that the maximum number of edges for a triangle-free planar graph is: For the proof please see Alexander Farrugias answer to this question. 111 Views
