How can I find outdegree and indegree number of a vertex of a directed graph?For a directed graph, the in-degree of a vertex v, deg − (v)  deg−(v) , is the number of edges with vertex v as the terminal vertex. Similarly, the out-degree of v, deg + (v)  deg+(v) , will be the number of edges with v as the initial vertex. Also keep in mind that if a vertex has a loop, it will contribute 1 to both the in and out degrees of that vertex. 298 Views · View Upvotes
