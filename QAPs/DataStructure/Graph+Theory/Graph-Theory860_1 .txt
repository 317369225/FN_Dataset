Why does the neighborhood of a given vertex of a graph not contain the vertex itself?By this I mean, in the equation, N(5) = {4,2,1} where 5 is the vertex or origin node of the neighborhood, it does not include itself. I'm giving a presentation about this and I thought this might be an interesting question.I think that having 5 in the set of neighbors can mean that there is a self-loop at that vertex. Think: If you had another exact graph where vertex 5 had a self-loop. Then the neighborhood set would be identical for both graphs which is incorrect (Try solving graph isomorphism using just the neighborhood set and this approach will show that the graphs are isomorphic whereas they aren't). 223 Views  View Upvotes
