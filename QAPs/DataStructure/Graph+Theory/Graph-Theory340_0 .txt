Do directed acyclic graphs (DAG) have a specific graph?My classmates and I have read about Topological Sorting using graph theory. The only problem we have is what kind of directed acyclic graph, a specific graph, should we use. Please help.Your question makes no sense. Topological sorting means sorting graph nodes in a certain way. In order for this sorting to be possible, your graph needs to be directed and acyclic. Are you looking for an example of a DAG? Here’s how you make one: Decide on a size n. Make an integer (or boolean) matrix of size n×n  n×n Put random nonzeros in the upper triangle of that matrix, that is, in locations (i,j)  (i,j) where j>i  j>i . Now make a permutation of the numbers 1…n  1…n Permute the rows and columns of the matrix with that permutation. Now you have your graph: there is an edge i→j  i→j if there is a nonzero in location (i,j)  (i,j) of the permuted matrix. 198 Views · View Upvotes
