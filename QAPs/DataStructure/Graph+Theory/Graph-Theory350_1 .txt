How do you graph y = (x+1)(x-5)/(x-2)(x+3)?y = (x+1)(x-5)/(x-2)(x+3) What are some significant things to find (like x and y intercepts) and how do you find them?You find x intercepts be putting y=0 Y intercepts by putting x=0 Vertical asymptotes by putting the denominator =0. Horizontal/oblique asymptotes by long division. In this case you will have a horizontal asymptote since the degree of the numerator is the same as the degree of the denominator. Oblique asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. You can also find the stationary points on the graph by differentiating y and setting the differential =0. Also the nature of the stationary points by finding the second differential i.e. differentiating the first differential. To find the nature you just sub in the x value of the stationary points into the second differential and check if the resulting value of the second differential at that x value is positive or negative. If it is positive then the point is a minimum and if it negative, then the point is a maximum. These should help you plot the graph fairly accurately.
