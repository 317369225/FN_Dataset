What can I do to keep skills I learned in my degree sharp?Majored in Chem & Math. Due to a poor job market I haven't been actively using the skills as much as I'd like. My focus: Organic and Physical Chemistry, Calculus, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra. Sometimes this phase feels like a slow mental death. What can I do/use to fix this? (Apart from Quora)I have found in the past that offering my services as a tutor helped me learn more thoroughly what I had supposedly already learned. It's better than free; students expect to pay something. The jargon and notation change over time. This isn't a problem for tutoring because my role is to guide, not teach. I get the student to explain to me what the words and symbols mean. If he can't make me understand, I ask whether he remembers where to look it up (or how to find it in the index of his textbook). It's good to let the student teach you what he knows, even if you already know it. If you can afford it, join a professional organization that publishes journals in your areas of interest. Buying a textbook from time to time is also helpful. You might even decide to read more advanced texts as an alternative to formally continuing your education. Some journals include thorough critical reviews of new textbooks. Best of all, think of a project that uses your knowledge. Think of questions, and try to derive answers rather than looking them up. Or think of simple experiments to answer some questions. 447 Views  View Upvotes
