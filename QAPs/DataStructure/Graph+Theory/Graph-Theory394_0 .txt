Is there an off-the-shelf scalable implementation to find Strongly Connected Components?I have a graph with about 3â€“4 billion edges and 500 million vertices. I want to find Strongly Connected Components in it within reasonable amount of time and memory requirements.Still fits one machine, and the algorithm is O(E). Rent a beefy on RAM box from AWS for a few minutes and you're done. 195 Views  View Upvotes
