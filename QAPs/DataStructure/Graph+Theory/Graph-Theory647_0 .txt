If we negate the edge weights in a graph G=(V,E) G=(V,E) and then run Bellman Ford, does this compute longest paths?If its does not, then what does this compute? Why wouldn't it if shortest paths now correspond to shortest paths?Yes, for a suitable definition of "longest". If a graph has no cycles, then your algorithm will work. If the graph has (for example) a cycle of (initially) positive total weight, then you can create longer and longer paths by going around that cycle repeatedly. So there isn't really a longest path. Bellman-Ford will keep finding longer and longer ones (that go around the cycle more and more often) and will never converge. 1.2k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
