What is the difference between Tree & spanning tree?Definition Definition of of a a tree: tree:  A tree is a connected graph in which no cycles are present (Can be simply called an undirected acyclic connected graph). An important property of a tree is that every pair of nodes in a tree has exactly one path between them. Spanning Spanning tree: tree: Given a connected graph G, a spanning tree is a tree whose vertex set is exactly same as that of G and edge set is a subset (may be equal) of that of G. Informally speaking, a spanning tree is a tree T formed by deleting some edges of G but preserving the fact that every two nodes in original graph have a path between them in T also. A graph can have multiple spanning trees. Adding weights to edges of graphs makes them more interesting which lead to MST etc. These are highly useful in networking and so on. 143 Views  View Upvotes
