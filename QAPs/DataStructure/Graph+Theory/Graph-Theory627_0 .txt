What is the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with n n vertices?By Euler’s planarity theorem, n+f=m+2  n+f=m+2 , where f  f is the number of faces and m  m is the number of edges. Hence m=n+f−2  m=n+f−2 . Since the graph is triangle-free, every face has at least four edges. Hence 4f≤2m  4f≤2m , or f≤m2   f≤m2 . Thus m≤n+m2 −2  m≤n+m2−2 m2 ≤n−2  m2≤n−2 m≤2(n−2).  m≤2(n−2). Note that this upperbound is attained by the complete bipartite graph K 2,(n−2)   K2,(n−2) for any n>2  n>2 , and K 2,(n−2)   K2,(n−2) is triangle-free (because it is bipartite) and planar (put (n−2)  (n−2) vertices in a row, place a vertex above them and join this vertex to each of these (n−2)  (n−2) vertices, then place another vertex below them and join it to each of the (n−2)  (n−2) vertices. The resulting graph is K 2,(n−2)   K2,(n−2) which has 2(n−2)  2(n−2) edges.) In the case n=1  n=1 , the number of edges is zero. For n=2  n=2 , the number of edges is one. Hence the maximum number of edges in a planar triangle-free graph on n  n vertices is zero if n=1  n=1 , one if n=2  n=2 , and 2(n−2)  2(n−2) if n>2  n>2 . 270 Views · View Upvotes
