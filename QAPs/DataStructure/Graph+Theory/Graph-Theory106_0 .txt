How can I I learn to draw graphs on LaTeX?If you want to learn, it depends on your needs. Tikz is a good candidate. There’s also Pstricks, which includes several (sub)packages for different fields (chemistry, electronic…). On the other hand, if you want to draw by yourself and then export your drawings, you can look for LaTeXdraw, jpicEdt, or Xfig (the last one I think is available only on UNIX-like platforms) 85 Views · View Upvotes
