What is nature of a displacement-time graph for a body at rest?A body is at rest, implies its position is not changing with time. Conventionally on a graph we plot independent variable on x axis and dependent variable on y axis. Since time is independent variable here, it is plotted on x axis. For every value of time, corresponding displacement is zero. So displacement time graph is nothing but x axis itself. Cheers, — 244 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Gurpreet Singh
