Is it possible to draw the shape below without taking your pencil off the paper?Sorry for the poor image. This is the best i could draw in paint!Yes, put pencil on the paper, draw the shape with a pen. Proper answer: there are 4 vertices (points) that have an odd number of lines coming out from it, and the path the pencil take should go "in" and "out" from those vertices, which is not possible since we have 4 of them. 1.1k Views
