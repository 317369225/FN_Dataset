How many maximal shortest paths can a planar graph with n nodes have?A maximal shortest path is a path that is not part of any other shortest path. Formally, in an indirected graph, the shortest path between u and v is maximal if there are no two nodes w,z such that {u,v} != {w,z} and the shortest path between w and z includes both u and v.In case I got your question correctly, example by Timothy Johnson is a good one, but we can do even better - by getting exponential instead of polynomial :) I’ll provide you with a simple example. Imagine a line graph: 1 - 2 - 3-…-n. How many shortest paths are there between vertices 1 and n? OK, and what if we split vertex 2 into 2 and n+1, so we have diamond-shaped figure there (and two possibilities to go from 1 to 3, either through 2 or through n+1)? OK, and what if we’ll make another split, changing 4 into 4 and n+2, so now there are two ways to get from 3 to 5?.. And what about changing 6 into 6 and n+3?.. As you can see, each such split multiplies number of shortest paths between 1 and n by 2, and for a given graph of size N you can make O(N) such splits (resulting graph will have size O(N) as well). 1.6k Views · View Upvotes
