When we remove an edge from a tree it seems obvious that we are left with two trees, but how would we go about proving this?Why aren't we left with 3+ trees?It can be proved by showing proof to any of the properties of tree. A graph having no cycles is said to be acyclic. A forest is an acyclic graph. A tree is a connected graph without any cycles, or a tree is a connected acyclic graph. The edges of a tree are called branches. It follows immediately from the definition that a tree has to be a simple graph (because self-loops and parallel edges both form cycles). Property:A graph is a tree if and only if there is exactly one path between every pair of its vertices. Proof: Let G be a graph and let there be exactly one path between every pair of vertices in G. So G is connected. Now G has no cycles, because if G contains a cycle, say between vertices u and v, then there are two distinct paths between u and v, which is a contradiction.Thus G is connected and is without cycles, therefore it is a tree. Conversely, let G be a tree. Since G is connected, there is at least one path between every pair of vertices in G. Let there be two distinct paths between two vertices u and v of G. The union of these two paths contains a cycle which contradicts the fact that G is a tree.Hence there is exactly one path between every pair of vertices of a tree. Similarly we can prove by other properties or definition of tree you can see definition of tree at Tree (graph theory) and poof for many properties at http://compalg.inf.elte.hu/~tony... But instead if we remove any vertex then it may lead to many trees i.e., forest 275 Views  View Upvotes
