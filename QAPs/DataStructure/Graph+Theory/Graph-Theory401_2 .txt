How can I I learn to draw graphs on LaTeX?As others have noted you can use Tikz (and any of its related packages) to produce quite sophisticated graphics. You can also do this with PsTricks (Post Script Tricks), but personally I find the syntax for it to be more complicated than that for Tikz. However, if you can master the appropriate PsTricks packages you can create amazing graphics. Both of these allow you to write the code for generating the graphic inside your LaTeX source file: when you compile it the graphics are generated and included. If you are interested in graphs of functions, and aren’t going to get too complicated, you could also look at the GeoGebra program. You can generate graphs in it rather easily, and then save them as JPG files or export the appropriate Tikz commands as a file, which can then be inserted into your LaTeX source. 137 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
