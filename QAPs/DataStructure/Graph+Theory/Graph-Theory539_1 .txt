What are some open problems in graph theory that if proved, solve many other problems?The most obvious answer would be finding a Polynomial Time algorithm for any of the NP Complete Problems which happen to be Graph Problems. Some of these include: Hamiltonian path problem Clique problem Vertex cover Graph coloring These problems are all NP Complete, which means that they are NP and every other NP problem can be reduced to these in polynomial time. Finding such a polynomial solution would be very significant, for reasons why see these fantastic answers here: What would happen if someone proves P=NP or P!=NP? 175 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Alaleh Adn
