What does this graph mean?Why does Pseudoacceleration equal Total acceleration? can you also explain this formula?I will not go into the details as this is a topic currently of importance in academia and has no significance in structural engineering. The term pseudo acceleration and acceleration do not differ. As a matter of fact, they are equal when damping is not considered. the calculation of this vs that is close to the analogy between relative and absolute. Don't forget that damping in a building is taken in seismic design to be 5 percent. To make your life easier, the graph you see is usually follows the essential diagram all dynamics' books begin with which includes a mass, damper, and a spring leading to the main formula ma + cv + mx = 0 Your graph is now dealing with a simple SDOF structure with a gravitational mass (reason you see the g). but both equations are equal because if you of the tendency of g to zero. Hence pseudo - no pseudo: Purely Academic. If you are getting into that for research purposes then I would suggest many articles online. Otherwise, forget the terms. They are just terms and practically mean nothing. 224 Views  View Upvotes
