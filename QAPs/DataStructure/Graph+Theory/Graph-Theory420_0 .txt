Is the graph isomorphism problem going to be in P?Is Graph Isomorphism going to be in P (on the basis of recent result given by laszlo babai).It is impossible to tell. Babaiâ€™s new quasipolynomial algorithm for Graph Isomorphism is not evidence that this problem will end up in P. All we know is that this problem is at most NP-intermediate (assuming the Exponential time hypothesis). 236 Views
