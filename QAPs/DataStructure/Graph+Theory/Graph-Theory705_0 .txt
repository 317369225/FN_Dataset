How do you detect ancestors of a particular node in an unweighted graph?Can one figure this out with start and finish times?Keep a parent[] array. Do a BFS/DFS and append the neighbors in. That should take care of it. After that, you can literally make recursive calls on the array of the node to get the ancestors. If you want to be even more efficient, you can create paths of the array, and find the ancestors from the path. Nonetheless, the most efficient way is going to be the length of the path. For a graph G = (V,E), the maximum possible length of a graph is |V| - 1 => The best case is O(|V|) 155 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
