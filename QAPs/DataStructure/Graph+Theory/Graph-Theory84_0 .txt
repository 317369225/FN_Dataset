I want to study Information Propagation (videos) in OSNs. I am a novice to the subject of SNA. Can you please guide me on how to proceed? Thanks.I have downloaded a few ACM research papers on Social Network Analysis and have been reading them frequently but most of the portions seem very abstract to me. I am a Computer Science undergrad. So, I have intermediate knowledge of Statistics and Graph Theory.You can follow Prof. Lada Adamic’s course offering on SNA. The assignments and projects can referred from her website. In case coursera has removed videos from the course, use the flickr link : https://www.flickr.com/gp/pagal_... . you can also refer the answers from quora question : What are the best short courses on social network analysis? 174 Views · View Upvotes
