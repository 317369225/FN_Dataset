Is the total distance and total displacement in a time graph the same?Is the formula to find total distance and total displacement in a linear motion graph the same? (It's a velocity - time graph)no the displacement concept is mathematics final coordinate minus initial coordinate, so if you go and come back the displacment is zero but you have covered a great distance. In a V,t graph, the area bellow is the displacement when you consider negative all the part bellow the x axes, but if you dont consider it negative and continue adding it to the possitive area, then you obtain the distance. 29 Views  Answer requested by Ana Amalia
