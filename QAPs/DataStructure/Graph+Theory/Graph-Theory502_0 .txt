How do you represent a graph containing two edges of equal weight connecting the same pair of vertices on a distance matrix?For the distance matrix, the complexity of these two edges can be reduced into just one copy of the same. Complications could arise if, for example, in network optimization, there is a capacity to each edge. If the two edges need to be distinct, it can be represented with an incidence matrix. 54 Views  View Upvotes
