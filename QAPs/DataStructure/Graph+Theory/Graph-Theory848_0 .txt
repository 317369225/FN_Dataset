Has anyone studied the organization of tree branches and the relationship to climate?Especially in order to find connections between formation type and environment. It might be insightful for other areas of science to know in a more abstract way. See below to get an idea of what I mean.Yes, there have been studies examining the relationship between tree branch structure and environment. Here is one such study: http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/co... It compares the branch arrangements and other aspects of plagiotropic and orthotropic species. Hope this helped! 132 Views  View Upvotes
