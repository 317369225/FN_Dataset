What is the best way to explain to someone why a graph with two y-axes is misleading?Use a misleading graph with two y-axes to get them to believe something that's not true, then reveal what you did. If they are too smart to fall for that do a study (or find one on the internet) of a number of people being shown a misleading graph interpreting it. Be aware though that using two y-axes is not necessarily misleading and sometimes necessary to convey information. 38 Views  View Upvotes
