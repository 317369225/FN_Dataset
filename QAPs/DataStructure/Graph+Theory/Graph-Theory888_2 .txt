Is it possible to draw the shape below without taking your pencil off the paper?Sorry for the poor image. This is the best i could draw in paint!NO..! When you enter a node you have to leave the node. Except for when you start and end. So a node should have even number of lines joining it.(except for the start and end nodes). You can trace it only when number of nodes which have odd number of lines joining is<=2. In this drawing number of odd nodes = 4.(> 2) Further Reading: You may refer to this.
