What is the correct way to shade regions on a graph?i.e. what is the correct way to shade mathetmatically? Is it okay to draw stripes? Or do you have to literally colour the whole area with your pencil?There is no mathematical convention for this. As long as you make it appear that it's shaded. Mathematics doesn't concern itself with matters of personal preference. :) 69 Views  View Upvotes
