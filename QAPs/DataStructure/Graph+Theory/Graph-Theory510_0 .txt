How do you read a SIAR isotopic diagram?I found the article here: Spatial Variability of Stable Isotope Ratios in Oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and Primary Producers Along an Estuarine Gradient (Bay of Brest, France) The diagram is from Figure 5 which is the results of Stable Isotope Analysis with R (SIAR) oysters diet modeling along the estuarine gradient. The graphic is a boxplot showing the data with confidence intervals: 95% in dark gray boxes 75% in medium gray boxes 50% in light gray boxes MPOP is marine particular organic matter TPOM is terrestrial particular organic matter Data Analysis: All statistical analyses were performed under the R software (R development Core Team 2005). Normal distribution ofdata and homogeneity of variances were checked using Shapiro-Wilk tests and Bartlett tests. When these tests were nonsignificant, one-factor ANOVAs were conducted (one-way test if the homoscedasticity is invalid). Otherwise, Kruskal–Wallis tests were used. If differences were high-lighted, a pairwise test was conducted with Holm method.
