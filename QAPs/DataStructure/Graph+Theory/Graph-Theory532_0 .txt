How many maximal shortest paths can a planar graph with n nodes have?A maximal shortest path is a path that is not part of any other shortest path. Formally, in an indirected graph, the shortest path between u and v is maximal if there are no two nodes w,z such that {u,v} != {w,z} and the shortest path between w and z includes both u and v.There can be O(n 2 )  O(n2) maximal shortest paths even for planar graphs. For example, a star graph with n  n nodes will have (n−12)  (n−12) maximal shortest paths. 370 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Netal Jubalín
