What data structure is used to represent vertices and edges?You can always use matrices (X) where for 'n' vertices, you have an nn matrix and edges are represented as X_ij entry in the matrix. Interestingly, for directed graphs, the sum of all entries(X_ij) of any row (fix value of i and j increasing from 0 to n-1) is the total outdegree of that node and the sum of all entries of any row is the total indegree of that node. 159 Views  Answer requested by Priscyla Hammerl
