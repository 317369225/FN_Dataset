What is the concept of an infinite loop (in programming) in graph theory?I believe recursivity has a role to play, but I am not sure. Also, does Turing completeness and transitive closure have anything to do? Thanks.Infinite loops are often at the core of embedded processes or operating systems. The processor performs initialization tasks then enters an infinite polling loop searching for work elements residing on various queues etc. In some applications when there is no work to be performed the processor may go into an idle state and simply wait for an interrupt event to wake it. This may not always be an optimal technique however. A for loop with no exit test is one simple method of establishing such an infinite loop. 50 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
