What is the reason that An An contains the number of walks of length n?Let A be the adjacency matrix of a graph G=(E,V). why is it that An An contains the number of walks of length n? Whats the proof and intuition? Is there a way to make this obvious?The result is fairly easy to prove by induction.  Consider n=1  n=1 .  Then A ij   Aij is one if i→j  i→j and zero otherwise.  So if we sum over the entire matrix, we see that the total is the number of ways we can go from any starting node to some ending node. Now, assume the (i,j)  (i,j) element of A n   An represents the number of ways to go from i  i to j  j in exactly n  n steps.  Again, summing over the entire matrix would then tell us the number of total n-step walks. Next, consider element (i,j)  (i,j) of A n+1   An+1 .  Because A n+1 =A n ⋅A  An+1=An⋅A , we see that: A n+1 ij =∑ k A n ik A kj   Aijn+1=∑kAiknAkj Now, by the inductive hypothesis, A n ik   Aikn is the total number of ways that we can go from i  i to k  k in n  n steps.  Furthermore, A kj   Akj is either zero or one to indicate a connection from k  k to j  j .  So the product of these two terms is either zero (if you cannot go from k  k to j  j ) or A n ik   Aikn (if you can go from k  k to j  j ).  So summing over all k  k , we see that A n+1 ij   Aijn+1 represents the number of ways you can go from i  i to j  j in n+1  n+1 steps.  And if we sum of the entire A n+1   An+1 matrix, we get the total number of paths from any starting point to any stopping point of length n+1  n+1 . That completes the inductive proof. 288 Views · View Upvotes
