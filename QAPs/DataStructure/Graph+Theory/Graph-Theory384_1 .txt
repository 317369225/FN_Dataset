What is the procedure to graph the equation of a line 2x+4y=6 using the slope-intercept method? Is there more than one solution?No there is only one solution, that solution is a line. The line will contain an infinite number of points. So you might think there are multiple solutions because you may be looking at non-infinite but different segments. There are however many different ways to arrive at the line. Here are two methods I like: Slope-Intercept, also known as y = mx+b 2x+4y = 6 Subtract 2x on both sides 4y = -2x +6 Divide both sides by 4 y = -x/2 + 3/2 Start on the y-axis at the point 3/2, then go down 1 and right 2. Then repeat. Method #2: You can find both the x and y intercept by setting the other variable = to zero. So 2x = 6 implies x = 3, and 4y = 6 implies y = 3/2. Now plot 3 on the x-axis and plot 3/2(or 1.5) on the y-axis and connect the two points. 33 Views
