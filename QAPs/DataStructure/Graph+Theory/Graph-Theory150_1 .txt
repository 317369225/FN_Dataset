Where can I find NP complete real world problems in graph theory to create heuristics?I have to choose a NP complete problem to create a heuristic for my graph theory assignment and I don’t know where can I look for, can someone indicate some interesting problem to work on?The traveling salesman problem is probably one of the most interesting NP problems and you have the opportunity to create several different heuristics for it. If the TSP is not allowed because “it is not a graph” (it actually is) then you can resort to the Hamiltonian Cycle problem which is also NP and is a special case of the TSP, where adjacent cities (nodes) have distance 1 and non-adjacent cities have distance = inf. The TSP is really a fascinating problem so I hope you can enjoy working with it. 257 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Mateus Coutinho Marim
