Can a graph have two tangents at a given point?We are doing calculus (highschool) level and I’m wondering if a graph can have two tangents. I worked out, x^2+2, and the tangents, 6x+3 and 5x+2 (through algebra/geometry) do intersect at -1,-3, however do both or even one of the straight lines qualify as a tangent ?Let’s say our graph is of the function f(x)  f(x) . If the derivative f ′ (x)  f′(x) is defined at a given value x 0   x0 , then f ′ (x 0 )  f′(x0) gives the slope of the tangent at (x 0 ,f(x 0 ))  (x0,f(x0)) . There’s only one. If the derivative is undefined at the point, then there’s no tangent line. (There’s one exception: if the function is going straight up at x 0   x0 , we get an infinite slope, or the tangent line x=x 0   x=x0 .) In our case, f(x)=x 2 +2  f(x)=x2+2 , so f ′ (x)=2x  f′(x)=2x . So f ′ (−1)=−2  f′(−1)=−2 . We know f(−1)=3  f(−1)=3 . So the tangent has slope −2  −2 and passes through (−1,3)  (−1,3) . Thus the tangent line is y−3=−2(x−(−1))  y−3=−2(x−(−1)) or y=−2x+1  y=−2x+1 Neither of the lines you listed are tangents to f  f . Check: That line obviously has slope −2  −2 . At x=−1,y=3  x=−1,y=3 , so we’re touching f  f at the right place.  ✓    ✓ 1.1k Views · View Upvotes
