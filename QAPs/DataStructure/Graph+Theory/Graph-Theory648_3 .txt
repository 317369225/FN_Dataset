Is Graph Theory a nice-to-have course to have for machine learning?Yes, graph theory is very useful if you work on developing new methods for learning and inference in probabilistic graphic models. The work on using graph-cuts to do exact and approximate inference on graphical models with particular applications in computer vision is extensive. Additionally, there is an important area in data mining called graph analytics. The ability to do any non-trivial analysis on web-scale and planetary-scale graphs and have theoretical guarantees that your computational method is approximately correct also needs graph-theoretic knowledge. I have read a fair number of papers on approximation algorithms in a graph-theoretic context applied to solving machine learning problems and I don't even work in that area. 441 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Dong Liu
