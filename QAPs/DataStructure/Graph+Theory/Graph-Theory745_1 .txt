MS CS: Machine Learning or Graph Algorithm, Which course should I select?Both courses are really important to get a better understanding about computer science. However, Graph Algorithms is more theoretical; so, the problems are more abstract and you will be proving stuff. On the other hand, Machine Learning is more applied and focuses on more realistic problems. If you are hesitating and do not know if you are a theory person or application person, I'd say start attending both of the courses then take the one you find more interesting. 171 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Pooshan Vyas
