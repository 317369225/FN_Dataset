How do you prove that in a connected and acyclic graph, between any two vertices there is a unique path?If a path doesn’t exist then the graph isn’t connected. If two distinct paths exist they form at least one cycle. Specifically there’s a cycle between any points where the paths diverge and reconverge. So there’s at least one path and that path must be unique. I’m assuming the graph is undirected, otherwise the statement isn’t true. 874 Views · View Upvotes
