Which one of the following algorithms should be preferred for calculating single source shortest path, where weights for all the edges are same?BFS without any doubt. All other shortest path algorithms uses BSF at their core and these algorithms are build to find shortest path along with some factors like different weight edges, negative weight edges etc. When u have no factor to bother about other than just finding the shortest path then BFS is best algorithm to use. Having same weight edges is as good as having weightless edges. Hence BSF! 507 Views  View Upvotes
