Why can't we run Bellman Ford from the source and relax edges out from the neighbours recursively and do a single pass through the edges?At each kth iteration, we can only find shortest paths that are k long.Then, why not only relax edges that are directly connected to the source on the first iteration, the neighbors' edges as well as the directly connected edges on the second iteration, and so forth?That would be valid, and this is a reasonable optimization. However, that wouldn't be "a single pass through the edges" as you say. That's because you would examine: For paths of length 1: edges from the source vertex For paths of length 2: edges from the source vertex and all its neighbor vertices For paths of length 3: edges from the source vertex, all its neighbor vertices, and all the neighbors of the neighbors, ... See what the pattern is? For each length, you re-examine all the previously-examined edges, and then add more. So it's not a single pass through the edges. The way Bellman-Ford is often implemented, even more optimization is done. Not only can we do what you suggested, but additionally, we can avoid re-examining edges from vertices whose cost from the source was not reduced in the previous stage. These are important optimizations in practice, but do not improve the worst-case asymptotic performance. 432 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
