How do you prove that in a connected and acyclic graph, between any two vertices there is a unique path?You can prove this by contradiction. If there were two different paths between two given vertices, V1 and V2, you could take one path from V1 to V2 and the other from V2 to V1. But then you’d have a cycle. This contradicts the fact that the graph is acyclic. 340 Views · View Upvotes
