Is complexity of finding the exact cover time of a graph, NP-complete?Cover time of graph is the expected amount of time to visit all nodes starting from a node. Several bounds about it is known but I couldn't find any information about the complexity of finding exact calculation. I read a few comments mention it is exponential, but that is itThe Cover-Time of a Graph G=(V,E)  G=(V,E) is E[|steps(G)|]  E[|steps(G)|] , ∋  ∋ , E[|steps(G)|]=|V|  E[|steps(G)|]=|V| . This is basically the number of steps one would need to walk in order to cover all the vertices of a Graph in a random walk. It is not exponential. Specifically, we have: C u   Cu = O(nlogn)  O(nlog⁡n) Reference: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/course... 272 Views · Answer requested by Sameer Bisoyi
