If I make a online course on graph theory can I make any profit from it?I am comfortable in making web applications. I do notice a lot of MOOC’s gaining popularity. I was thinking of making a course on graph theory. Can I make profit of it also? How will I make sure that I will find students ?You are correct, there are websites and often You Tube videos offering free courses. Khan Academy comes to mind. You should research them and other sites to see if the topic is covered well. To see the potential audience size, select some keywords that apply and test them through Google. They will tell you the number of searches you can expect for those keywords. How to find students? Well, SEO comes into play. How well your site is set up to rank high in search results. Maybe pay for some ads on Facebook and or Google. There are sites out there that offer online courses through their site. A collection of training. This would eliminate your need to build a site. One is Udemy. They offer many courses with revenue sharing. Hope that helps….Steve 67 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
