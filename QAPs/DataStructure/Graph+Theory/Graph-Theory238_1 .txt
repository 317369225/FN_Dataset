What is the best algorithm to find a shortest path that must go through some given nodes?You are looking for the solution to the famous Travelling salesman problem which is a well known CS problem, falling in the class of NP-complete problems for which - long story short - we are unable to produce an algorithm which will provide an exact solution to an arbitrary set of input data, in polynomial time. We are able to generate exact solutions in super-polynomial time for small and special-case data sets and we are able to reach a good-enough solution for other data sets using heuristics and oher algorithms which try to reasonably prune the search space. An exact algorithm would permute the list of required nodes and evaluate the cost of the trip as defined by each specific order of visits, constrained by available routes. Obviously, this becomes very slow very quickly, as the number of nodes increases. 442 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
