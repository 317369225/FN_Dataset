Is a pentagram star an example of a complete graph?Not at all. A pentagram star consists of 5 vertices, and yet, every vertex has degree 2. A complete graph is called so because it has the maximum number of edges possible in a simple graph, i.e., every vertex is connected to another vertex. So, for a graph of 'n' vertices, the degree of every vertex would be 'n-1'. The total number of edges in such a graph are n(n-1)/2. The number of edges in a pentagram star are 5, which is 5 less than the maximum number of possible edges for a graph of 5 vertices (5(5 -1)/2 = 10). The number of edges in a connected graph are [n-1, n(n-1)/2]. If |edges| < (n - 1), you have a graph of more than 1 connected component. 149 Views  Answer requested by Chris Purrone
