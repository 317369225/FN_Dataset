Why are 3-regular graphs called cubic?The 3-regular graphs are called trivalent or cubic graphs! I can't see the similarity between 3-regular graphs and cubes! why are they named like that?You don't see a similarity between 3-regular graphs and cubes. But I see a similarity between cubes and 3-regular graphs. The cubical graph (pictured above) is an example of a cubic graph. Below are various different depictions of the graph above. Note that just because a graph does not look like a cube, it does not necessarily mean that it is not a cube. Maybe we're not drawing it in the 'right' way. Obviously, not every cubic graph can be drawn the 'right' way to look like a cube. The complete graph K4 K4 on four vertices can be drawn like a tetrahedron, for instance, so the tetrahedron is cubic. But I would think that the reason we call all 3-regular graphs 'cubic' is the graph above. 322 Views  View Upvotes
