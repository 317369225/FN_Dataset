What is the Dijkstra shortest path for the following graph?The source for the Dijkstra’s Algorithm is A. I wanted to know how to proceed in case there are multiple contenders to update a vertex ?From state A ,the shortest value is 7( comparing with 10) so transition occurs A->D now we are at D, you can go to either B or E as the cost is same (3) ,so we take B . now the cost from A ->B is 10(through D) which is equal to A->B =10(directly), so the cost A->B direct link is removed as it will increase cost of A->D from 10 to 12(10+2,through B) now we are at B, the only link is to C cost is 2. and cost of A->C is 12 now ,both through node B(7+3+2) and node D(7+5) so we can remove link of either B to C or D to C. now we are at C, cost of transition from C to E is 6 ,which is higher than the cost of D to E=3 ,so we can remove the link from C->E. now we are at E, there are two links ,first E to C which cost 4 but the we don’t need that link as there already exist a link from A to C. and the other link is A to E and we don’t need this link either. so the shortest path will be as follow: A->D (7) D->B (3) B->C (2) D->E(3) TOTAL COST= 15 84 Views · View Upvotes
