The points (1, 2) and (1, 6) are two vertices of a rectangle. Where are the other two vertices?I am sorry to tell you that it is not possible to answer your question unless you have the third vertex. You got two points of a vertical line. If you complete a rectangle, you will have unlimited number of rectangles, plus that line could be the diagonal of the rectangle that connects opposite points. 184 Views  View Upvotes
