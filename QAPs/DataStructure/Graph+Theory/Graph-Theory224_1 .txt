What would the graph of a^(bx) +b^(ax) =a^ab^b look like?When a and b have the same sign the derivative of the left hand side doesn't vanish so presumably there is at most one x for each pair a, b. When a and b have different signs the derivative may vanish and you might find a pair of x for some values of a and b. It is not clear that a,b -> x has a proper graph. 60 Views  Answer requested by Saqib Yasin
