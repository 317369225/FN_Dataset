What is a good resource for making graphs with nodes and edges for Latex?Graphs as in G = (V,E).I personally use Inkscape, which is a free software package that allows you to draw diagrams in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. These diagrams may then be converted to PDF using Inkscape itself and imported in LATEX LATEX using the \includegraphics \includegraphics command from the graphicx graphicx package. The advantage of using SVG is that, as its name suggests, you can enlarge your diagram as large as you want and no pixelation occurs. 82 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
