How do I tell the multiplicity of a zero of a polynomial graph when only shown the graph?As it is a polynomial, it is both continuous and infinitely differentiable. It is also a theorem that if a root has multiplicity greater than one then it is a root of the derivative. Using this one can see for multiplicity of 2 a root must have its derivative also zero when evaluated at the root and the second derivative must be non-zero.Translate all this into geometrical facts(use the fact that derivative gives the slope at a point) and you can (very roughly and inaccurately) determine the multiplicity using graphs. 153 Views
