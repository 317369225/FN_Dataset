How can I detect cycles in undirected graph using BFS?I always see code for DFS not BFS. so can i have a code or pseudocode for BFS? Thanks.You need maintain an array par[i] = parent of node i , now start bfs from node 1 and go on level wise. If a condition occurs when we are exploring neighbours of a node u and it is visited node but is not parent of u , then this is certainly a edge leading cycle. You can see the code for reference:Ubuntu Pastebin 136 Views  View Upvotes
