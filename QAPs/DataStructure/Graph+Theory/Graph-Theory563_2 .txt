In modern mathematics or physics is distance ever defined as the number of discrete steps between starting point and ending point?Irrespective of the way spatial distance is ordinarily measured in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.Yes. For example, there are geometries where there are a discrete array of points. For example, think of an 8x8 array of points in a square array. There are only so many possible distances between such points, and some of these geometries may only define the orthogonal vectors instead of distances, which would only have integer values on each axis.
