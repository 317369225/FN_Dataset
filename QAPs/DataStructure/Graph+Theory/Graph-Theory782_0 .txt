If a connected graph has no subgraph without a hamiltonian circuit would the whole graph have one to?If a connected graph has all its subgraphs having at least one hamiltonian circuit , what can you say about the graph itself?If all the connected subgraphs of a connected graph X had hamiltonian circuits then X can be partitioned into two subgraphs A and B ( A and B having all the vertices of X yet A and B distinct graphs) both with a hamiltonian circuit. Let A have vertex C and B have vertex D such that C and D are connected by an edge so one has a hamiltonian circuit ending at C then connected to D is another hamiltonian circuit that covers all the vertices of X. Therefore if a connected graph X has all its subgraphs having at least one hamiltonian circuit the X has one also.. This implies if a connected graph has no hamiltonian circuit then at least one of its subgraphs has no hamiltonian circuit.. 22 Views
