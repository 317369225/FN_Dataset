What are the applications of disjoint set data structure?It can used for implementing Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. They are useful in applications like “Computing the shorelines of a terrain,” “Classifying a set of atoms into molecules or fragments,” “Connected component labeling in image analysis,” and others.[1] Labeling connected components. Generating a maze. Alias analysis in compiler theory. Maintaining the connected components of an undirected-graph, when the adges are being added dynamically.
