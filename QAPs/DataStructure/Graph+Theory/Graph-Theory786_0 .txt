What is the best way to implement a graph that represent a subway network?What is the most efficient way to store the graph ? The graph as to be oriented cause their is a few case were the edge are not bidirectionnel... Excepte this, it is very dense...what is the best way to implement this in c++?For a finite number of stops, you can store this data as either a matrix or vectors. For 'N' stops and 'K' trains, you can create a KxN matrix or k* (1xN) vectors. I would recommend this because there are a lot of libraries in c++ (armadillo, Eigen, PETSc, Blitz, uBLAS, Elemental, etc) which makes matrix/ vector computations much faster. I have used vectors most of the time in some similar situations (combined with Armadillo/ Eigen - when using Armadillo, instead of using BLAS, try using OpenBLAS). Since the edges are not always bidirectional, dealing with matrices may not be very useful since there are a lot of good properties that can be used when matrix is symmetric (computation wise) but in this case, it wouldn't be symmetric. 190 Views
