How do I tell the multiplicity of a zero of a polynomial graph when only shown the graph?You can't accurately but if the curve is of a polynomial of degree n then If you see n crossing points they are degree 1, if k crossing points are missing then there are k, not necessarily distinct, points where more than one crossing takes place. If an even number of crossings happen at a point the curve just touches the axis. This usually is enough but if not you will need to do some analysis. 266 Views  View Upvotes
