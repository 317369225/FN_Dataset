Is there any use in treating a function f:A→B  f:A→B as a bipartite graph?Interesting question! So you’re asking if there are any theorems in graph theory about bipartite graphs which, when applied to a function (viewed as a bipartite graph) reveal something new? Not that I know of, but others may know of some examples. The problem is that graph theory is incredibly general, in that almost any mathematical structure can (in some way or another) be represented as a graph. So you ask the same question about almost any area of mathematics (does treating X as a graph reveal anything new about X?). And the more general a theory is, the less it can explain about each individual case (this is not a fact or a theorem, just an intuitive idea). Graph theory and category theory are two of the most general theories in mathematics, but cannot explain all of the intricacies of any individual theory. For example, a Lie group can be viewed as a group object in the category of differentiable manifolds, but this doesn’t tell you much about lie groups. 176 Views · View Upvotes
