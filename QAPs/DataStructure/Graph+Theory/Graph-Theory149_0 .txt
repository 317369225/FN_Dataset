What are vertices? How many vertices does a cuboid have?What are vertices? This depends on which subject we’re talking about. I don’t just mean Math. I’m talking about Graphs and Geometry, which are two different subjects that fall under Mathematics, that I pulled from the question’s tags. Graphs: A Vertex (also known as a Node) is one of the building blocks of a Graph. The other component being an Edge. Graphs can be used to represent all sorts of information. For instance, we can create a graph with 50 Nodes where each Node represents on of the 50 states in the United States. We can then connects the Nodes together with edges that represent some kind of relationship that is shared between Nodes. We could connect every Node that is in the same country (creating a full graph), or we could just connect Nodes that share a border with each-other. We could also connect Nodes that have public Air Ports with direct flights to each-other. Graphs are used in all sorts of things in Computer Science and Programming. Geometry: Here, a Vertex is where two (or more) lines, curves, or edges meet. It’s common for a Vertex to represent a point in space. This is where Cuboids fall into. Cuboids can have an infinite number of points, but all those points will fall along the edges of the Cuboid they belong to. One thing we can’t get around is that a Cuboid will have a minimum of 8 points. We need at least one vertex for each corner of the Cuboid, of which there are 8. 192 Views
