Can zeta function be presented in a graph presentation?Nope. Because it is a function with complex values with respect to complex variable, which has four dimensions if you want to graph it. In application, we often graph the absolute value function for such complex functions, in which case, we only deal with the absolute value function which is a real number function with two variables, in three dimensions. 231 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Rudi Bric
