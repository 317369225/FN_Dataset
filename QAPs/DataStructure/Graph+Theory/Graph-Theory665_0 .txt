Is there any algorithm in graph theory for a scenario where nodes ("x" nodes) in different positions in a large graph ("n" nodes) are joined (x<n)?Assume there are 20 nodes in a graph. Now I select 5 random nodes from the graph. Is there any way ( an algorithm ) to connect these 5 nodes such that a path can be generated amongst the 5 nodes.Do you want to find nodes with a certain number of incoming or outgoing edges, (or just edges if you don't have a directed graph)? Else, your question is unclear. Not so sure what you mean by x-nodes. An algo, not necessarily very efficient O(#Edges), is as follows: Number all nodes from 0 to n-1. Make an array/vector/list for every node. Initialize the integer value with zero. Loop through the list of edges, increment the counter for both end nodes. Once you are done, loop through the array with counters for the nodes and take from it whatever you want/need. For directed graphs the algo becomes somewhat more complicated, but essentially the same. Depending on what questions you want to answer, you can only take the beginning or "end" end point and increment only one counter per edge, or maybe you need two arrays for start and end points. 62 Views  View Upvotes
