How do I solve graph theory questions in hackerrank (difficult and advanced)?You should learn graph algorithms first, here is the link that I find best: Algorithms - GeeksforGeeks Study the algorithms, and find problems based on that algorithm. I think there are at least 2 problems for every single graph-algo on hackerrank in greedy/dynamic programming/graph theory section. For more advanced implementation try to solve problems from Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ). All the best!!! 571 Views  View Upvotes
