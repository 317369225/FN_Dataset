When we triangulate a polygon to solve an art gallery problem, why can we not create a convex subpolygon to solve the problem?A2A. I assume that you're asking why one of the standard algorithms for triangulation partitions the polygon into monotone polygons, rather than partitioning it into convex polygons. The following paragraph is from Computational Geometry, Algorithms and Applications: So a possible approach to triangulate a non-convex polygon would be to first decompose P into convex pieces, and then triangulate the pieces. Unfortunately, it is as difficult to partition a polygon into convex pieces as it is to triangulate it. Therefore we shall decompose P into so-called monotone pieces, which turns out to be a lot easier. I must admit that I'm unsatisfied by this claim, which is made without proof, and I don't know of a more complete answer. 186 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Apoorva Sahay
