What is in degree and out degree of a graph?Graph Theory dates back to times of Euler when he solved the Konisberg’s problem. Any graph can be seen as collection of nodes connected through edges. Mathematically this is represented as G = [V,E] (a notation, nothing to worry about if it doesn’t make any sense) If edges have direction then graphs are known as directed graphs else undirected graphs. In case of directed graphs, number of edges going into a node is known as in degree of the corresponding node and number of edges coming out of a graph is known as outdegree of the corresponding node. For any graph sum of total indegree should be equal to total outdegree. (Why ? Think !) Assumptions: Self loops contribute to both indegree and outdegree.
