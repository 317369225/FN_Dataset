How do I find the no. of N sided polygon regions in a graph?Given an undirected planar graph G. Find no. of N sided polygon regions i.e., Number of regions which are bounded by N(N>2) vertices. I want to know the algorithm to solve this problem for any given N. Is this a hard problem or medium ?The question is ill-defined because, in general, the planar embedding of a graph is not unique. As an example, consider the following figures: The two figures have the same vertices and the same edges, and hence are planar embeddings of the same graph. The embedding on the left has three triangles whereas the embedding on the right has only two. Counting the number of polygonal regions is thus ill-defined, except for a restricted class of planar graphs. 1.6k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
