Why do the lines from one vertex to the opposite vertex in a regular hexagon bisect the angles?Drawing such a line changes the 120 degrees angles into two 60 degrees angles… Why do they bisect? In a parallelogram they sure don’t. I know it has something to do with its regular nature.The diagonals from one vertex to the opposite vertex divide the hexagon into two trapezia. Three of the edges of one trapezium must be equal to three edges of the other, because they are all edges of the regular hexagon. The fourth is the same edge (the dividing line). Two angles of each trapezium are the 120-degree angles of the hexagon. Three sides and two included angles of a trapezium fully define its shape (imagine it as an assembly of rods with braces at the corners fixing two angles; the assembly would be rigid). Therefore the two trapezia are fully congruent Therefore the adjacent acute angles of each trapezium will also be equal. Since the sum of each of these pairs of angles is an angle of the hexagon, then the dividing line - the common edge of the two trapezia - must bisect the angles. A similar congruence argument holds for any bisected regular polygon with an even number of sides. 43 Views  Answer requested by Usman Khan
