How can I understand graphs? How can I understand how to use is it in problem solving?I understand the representation of a graph but I'm still not able to solve problems using it.You'll need a problem that needs graphs... Road maps, railway schedules, airplane routes, electronic circuits or project schedules are good examples of problem domains that might need graphs. How would you write an algorithm that finds a route from A to B? How would you find the path of least resistance in a circuit? What is the "critical path" in a project that would delay everything? Lots of applications if you look for them. 228 Views  View Upvotes
