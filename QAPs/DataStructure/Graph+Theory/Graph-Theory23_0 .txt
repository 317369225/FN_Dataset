How do I get the extreme vertex of a graph?DEF. A vertex v in G is an extreme vertex if the subgraph induced by its neighborhood is complete. My question is, how to get the extreme vertex of graph G?Actually, I believe, though the generic problem of finding a k-Clique requires O(n k k 2 ) time (NP), and the max-Clique problem is NP-Complete, this may be easier. Given: G = (V,E) Simple solution : ∀v∈V : // O(|V|)  construct n(V)=adj(V)  construct E ‘  , ∋ , ∀ e ∈ E ‘  , e = (v i ,v j ) and v i ,v j  ∈ n(V)  Check if G ‘  = (n(V),E ‘ ) is complete // O((|E| ‘ ) 2 ) if Complete -> mark v as “Extreme” This solution takes ≤ O(|V| 2 |E| 2 ) time to determine all vertices that are “Extreme” in the Graph. The reason this problem can be solved in Polynomial time as opposed to being NP-Complete is that looking *only* in induced neighborhoods of the vertices severely limits the the size of the sub-graph AND the number of sub-graphs to search in. Essentially, there is only 1 sub-graph per vertex we search in. 161 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Melanie Atendido
