How can I make a graph with ranges in excel?Like this one, where there is a clear line between major divisions. I'm not worried about the text, just how to cover different quantized areas. (Is that even the right word?) I.e. area under one function is color X, under another is Y, above that is Z, and so in.Not sure if it is its intended purpose originally, but I would say an area graph is the easiest way of achieving this. The first step is to create a table describing the upper weight limits for each category, i.e. obese, overweight etc. In your example, height starts at 142 cm and increments by ~5 cm up to 212 cm so let’s pick this range. Once you’ve done this, you have to calculate the maximum weight allowed at any given height to belong to a certain category. BMI  BMI is [Weight]/[Height] 2   [Weight]/[Height]2 (measured in kgs and metres, respectively), so at any given height the weight should be [MaxWeight]∗[Height] 2   [MaxWeight]∗[Height]2 . In the table below, C3  C3 would equal $B3∗(C$1/100) 2   $B3∗(C$1/100)2 , Q5  Q5 would be $B5∗(Q$1/100) 2   $B5∗(Q$1/100)2 etc. Once you have this table, graphing it is easy. Insert an area graph and create a series for each category, choosing category as the series name and the weights as the data points. For labels, choose the height measurements, i.e. range C2:Q2  C2:Q2 . Now you have the basic graph and just need to polish it. Add a title and axes titles, as well as max/min-ranges for the axes. Then, select each data series and add data labels. Select the data point in the middle → format data labels → check “Series Name” and uncheck “Value” and “Show Leader Lines”. Lastly, you can change the fill color of each series, edit the format of the data labels etc. This leaves you with the following graph - voíla! 539 Views · View Upvotes
