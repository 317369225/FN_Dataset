How can I compare two datasets differ in size on the one MS graph?First column shows countries merchandise trade value (USD) and second shows oil price (USD) by year. There problem with dispersion - data mean from first column bigger than from second. I need to show interconnection between this indicators. Is there way to average numbers from each column?Use secondary axis for one of the datasets. Click on the data in chart, choose properties, and then secondary axis. I also recommend choosing two different chart types, like bar (column) and line types for a chart with two axes. 30 Views  Answer requested by Aidos Taibekuly
