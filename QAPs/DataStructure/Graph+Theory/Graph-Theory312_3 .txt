Why does the parent graph √x result in only positive y values?When we take the square root of a number it returns both a positive and negative value. Why do we exclude the negative values when we graph the √x . Note: I understand the graph would no longer be a funtion of x.I don’t agree with Brad Price’s answer sqrt(16)=/=4,−4  sqrt(16)=/=4,−4 It is only equal to positive four. The reason is pretty simple. It is that the square root of a real positive number is always a positive number. So sqrt(x 2 )=|x|  sqrt(x2)=|x| I get what you’re trying to say. When y 2 =x 2   y2=x2 , then x=+yor−y  x=+yor−y . That is always true but there are never two real values of sqrt(x 2 )  sqrt(x2) . You can draw curves with two values of y  y for each value of x  x on your computer program although it is not going to be a function. It will only be geometrical curve.
