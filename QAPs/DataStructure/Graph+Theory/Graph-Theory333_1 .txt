Given 3 colours, how can I prove that there is a monochromatic rectangle with its sides parallel to the axes?I have three colours, i.e. a function f:ZxZ- {red,green,blue}. I have to prove that there is a monochromatic rectangle with its sides parallel to the axes i.e to prove that for some choice of a,b,c,d (Integers) with a ≠ b and c ≠ d, all points (a,b), (a,d), (b,c), (b,d) have the same colour.We can prove it using the pigeonhole principle. First notice that if we take four consecutive points in a line, say, (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), then some pair of them must be the same colour, by the pigeonhole principle. But how to find two more vertices for the rectangle? Notice that there are only 3 4 =81  34=81 different ways to colour four points. If we look at (x, 0), (x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3) for x = 0, 1, 2, …, 81, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be x 1 ≠x 2   x1≠x2 such that (x 1 ,0),(x 1 ,1),(x 1 ,2),(x 1 ,3)  (x1,0),(x1,1),(x1,2),(x1,3) have the same colours as (x 2 ,0),(x 2 ,1),(x 2 ,2),(x 2 ,3)  (x2,0),(x2,1),(x2,2),(x2,3) , respectively. If (x 1 ,y 1 )  (x1,y1) and (x 1 ,y 2 )  (x1,y2) have the same colour—and such y 1 ≠y 2   y1≠y2 are guaranteed to exist—then the desired rectangle is (x 1 ,y 1 ),(x 1 ,y 2 ),(x 2 ,y 1 ),(x 2 ,y 2 )  (x1,y1),(x1,y2),(x2,y1),(x2,y2) . As Apoorv points out, this is easily generalizable to the case of any number of colours. 1.2k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Chetan Pandey
