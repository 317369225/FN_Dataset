How do I solve this SAT math problem?It's 12 obviously.According to the question, the time every road you can go through is once. If you choose to go directly to the destination, then you have 2*3 choices to go back, it's 1*2*3=6; if you choose the upper ways to the destination ,you have 3*2 and only one way back , so it's 3*2*1. Totally, 6+6=12. D is the right answer. 530 Views  View Upvotes
