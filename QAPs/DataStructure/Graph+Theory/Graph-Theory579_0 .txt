What is the use of graph theory for designing of efficient routing protocols?Hopefully, you get that graphs describe a topology. That computing on a graph is a relatively straightforward computational problem and that the application of Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First algorithm solves about 99.99% of your problems. Then, the advantage of graph theory is that you are now completely accustomed to dealing with graphs. It’s true, there is no theorem from graph theory that you will need. The Bridges of Konigsberg will never come up in computer networking. But you will think of writing networking protocols and dealing with topology as completely second nature. And that could be a very good thing. 237 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Owen Mkandi
