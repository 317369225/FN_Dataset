Is saying that the number of "hops" between two nodes in a graph is at most k, the same as saying its shortest unweighted path is at most k?You are given a fixed graph G=(V,E) and some pair of nodes (u,v). If I say that the number of hops between u and v is at most k, does that mean that the shortest paths using BFS between them should be at most k?Yes, that is exactly true. Number of "hops" means number of jumps to get to the destination without considering weight. It is usually used in graph algorithms related to networks in which passing nodes (hubs, routers, ...) is more costly than passing the links. 52 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 2 people
