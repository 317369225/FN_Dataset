What are the ways to graph antiderivatives?Firstly you need to realise that when you differentiate a quartic, you get a cubic and when you differentiate a cubic you get a quadratic and when you differentiate a quadratic you get a line equation. (as shown below….) Now to do this in reverse, just follow the instructions below… I have provided the solutions to the following cases….. This topic does get quite tricky when we have points of inflection but I think the above logic will certainly get you started. 134 Views
