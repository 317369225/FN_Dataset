Is it possible to draw the shape below without taking your pencil off the paper?Sorry for the poor image. This is the best i could draw in paint!As far as I know, its not possible. But a little out of box thinking I seen was, to bend the paper and hijack your pencil while there is a need to redraw a line. So bend that paper you are drawing, shift your pencil to that bent part so you are constantly keeping the pencil in the paper. Then traverse your pencil back to the point where you want to reach. Thus you can avoid redrawing a line. 2.5k Views  View Upvotes
