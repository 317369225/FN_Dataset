How can you find the horizontal translation of a sine graph, given a data table?How would I find the value of c, in T=asin(b(t-c))+d?I'm going to take without technology to mean paper and pencil. The first step is to plot the values on a grid. You should end up with something that looks like a sine graph that is displaced upward and a to the right. In the equation a represents the amplitude. Therefore the difference between the the peak and valley is going to be 2a. My in the head calculation is that a =6.5 The value d the value that add to move the curve upward. I'd find it by averaging the peak and valley numbers. My in the head calculation is that d =20.5 Now distribute b to the term in side so that you have sine(bt+bc) Now assuming that the frequency is 1 cycle/ year then, since t is in months and starts with 1 you want 12b = 2pi or b = pi/6. Why 2 pi. Because the sine function repeats every 2 pi. Now to find bc which is the amount that the sine curve is displaced to the right. They way I'd go about it is to draw the line T=d onto the graph. I would then drop a perpendicular to the time(x) axis this time is bc is I have my signs correct. You know b so you can calculate c. My in the head calculation is that bc =5. therefor c = 30/pi The final check is to start substituting numbers into the equation to make sure that there isn't an error somewhere here. In particular I may have made a +/- error in this calculation somewhere. I'm going to say that using a calculator to check the numbers isn't using technology as you could look the values up in a table or even use the Taylor series expansion to calculation the values of the sine of the various months. It would be tedious but doable. My numbers are an approximation/guess. 57 Views
