Why don't we use a stack in breadth first search (BFS)?Just as a fun twist on the other answers, you can use two stacks to implement breadth first search if you use them to simulate a queue. Think about how you would implement enqueue-ing and de-queueing elements from your simulated queue using these stacks and you’ll see that while one won’t do, two stacks make a queue. 125 Views
