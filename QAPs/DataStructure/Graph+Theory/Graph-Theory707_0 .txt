Why does the loop in bellman ford algorithm ( to find shortest path to all nodes from source ) goes v-1 times ONLY (where v is no. of vertex) ?I mean why by relaxing the set of edges to max v-1 times we can find the shortest distance.why not earlier or later ?I have seen the answers that tell "The required number of iterations is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path" but i want to know how it works at the basic level ?The required number of iterations is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path. Without any special knowledge about the graph, you can only say for sure that the shortest path doesn't have cycles, and therefore is of length at most V-1. If you know the shortest path has at most k edges, or if you only want to find the shortest path out of paths with k edges or less, then you run the loop k times. 261 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
