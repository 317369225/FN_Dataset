If you own a business and have a customer list (first/last name), what would be the most useful data about these customers to help grow your business?In no particular order: Social media profiles Deal size Company size Position Lead priority Phone number for followup calls This is the basic information you can most likely find on your customer with a little research. With this information, you can get in touch with them and get more information about who they are. Your relationship with the customer should be personal and a basic list of details will not fit all. Things like do they have kids, where do they live, their challenges etc. You want your customers to feel like close friends that would be more than happy to talk about your business with others. That's how you scale.
