In an undirected graph, what is the degree of a vertex with a self-loop?My professor said the degree would be 2. But I don’t see how. I can understand that a single vertex has degree of 0. But when that vertex connects to itself, shouldn’t it be degree of 1?In Kenneth H Rosen’s “Discrete mathematics and its applications”, seventh edition it says:”the degree of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges incident on it ,except that a loop at a vertex contributes twice to the degree of that vertex” 66 Views · View Upvotes
