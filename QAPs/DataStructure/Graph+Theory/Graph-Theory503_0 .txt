Why do the lines from one vertex to the opposite vertex in a regular hexagon bisect the angles?Drawing such a line changes the 120 degrees angles into two 60 degrees angles… Why do they bisect? In a parallelogram they sure don’t. I know it has something to do with its regular nature.The same is true for any regular polygon with an even number of sides. So it holds for a square, a regular octagon. Such shapes have reflectional symmetry about the lines joining opposite vertices and such a line must bisect the angle. 136 Views  View Upvotes
