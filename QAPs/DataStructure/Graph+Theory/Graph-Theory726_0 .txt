What is the difference between Tree & spanning tree?Given a graph G, a spanning tree is a subgraph of G that is a tree, and has all the vertices in G. There can be many spanning trees for G. If you put weights on the edges, one of these spanning trees will have a minimal sum of weights. This is the minimal spanning tree. Regular tree is just subgraph which is a tree - it doesn't necessarily have all the nodes in G. 296 Views
