I am a beginner and want to start learning graphs. Is it necessary to study trees before graphs? What are the requirements to study graphs and trees?This question is asked by a newbie like me on another platform. I am not qualified enough to answer this. But the fact is: He is a beginner. He might asked something stupid. Itâ€™s the responsibility of experts to correct him or show him a way. So, I want your kind answer to give him as a gift.Neither needs to come before the other, although it might help you grasp data connections and hierarchies better to start with trees. 52 Views
