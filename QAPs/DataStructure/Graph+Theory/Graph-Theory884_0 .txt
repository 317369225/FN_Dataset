Is there some form of mathematics that can be used to predict resonance structures and double bond patterns on a large sheet of fused cyclic alkenes?When I try to draw out these structures, I find the constraints of where double bonds can form to lead to some very interesting, but seemingly chaotic patterns. Is there a way to model these patterns with respect to where the double bonds can form and what resonance structures they give?  The mathematical tool to deal with the structures of fused cyclic alkenes is graph theory. For a nice introduction of the topic, I recommend N. Trinajstić's Chemical Graph Theory, v.1 and v.2, CRC Press.   There is a hybrid of graph theory and simplified molecular orbital theory, called Hūckel theory, which handles the structures of alkenes very well. For instance, the simplest case is a benzene molecule, which also works as a building block for fused cyclic alkenes,    There are two resonance structures, both represented by the same matrix. The matrix is not diagonal. When the matrix is diagonalized, it gives the energy levels of the resonance structures and shows how the structures are stabilized by resonances. In this simplified quantum theory of Hückel structures, there is no distinction between single and double C-C bonds. Each bond is represented by a matrix element 1. Had we localized the double bonds and assigned 1 for the matrix elements of double bonds only, the energy shoots up and the structure becomes unstable. This is an evidence that Hückel theory works. You can google Hückel theory and download the software to play with and find out about the energy levels of different fused cyclic alkenes. P.S. This kind of fused cyclic alkenes is what graphites (more stable and resilient than diamonds) and graphenes are made of.
