What is the procedure to graph the equation of a line 2x+4y=6 using the slope-intercept method? Is there more than one solution?since all the coefficient are divisible by 2 first divide the equation by 2. The equation becomes x+2y=3 Convert in the form of y=mx+c as y=3-x/2 Give only odd numbers (1,3,5,-1,-3..)you get the value of y. Draw the straight line easily. It cuts x-axis at (3,0) and y-axis at (0,1.5) 22 Views
