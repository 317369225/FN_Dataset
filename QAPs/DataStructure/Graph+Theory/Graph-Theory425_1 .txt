What is the use of graph database?For understanding the relations between the two entities and strength of their relation. We at ChalkStreet use Neo4j for mapping our courses to topic and mapping topics to channels. Neo4j is an amazing graph database. We have users as nodes and courses as nodes. We have similarity and ranking among the relationships between the users and courses. There by we have a better understanding of how the user is learning.
