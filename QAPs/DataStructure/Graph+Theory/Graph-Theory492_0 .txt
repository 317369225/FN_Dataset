Is it possible to find an exact solution of a minimum vertex cover problem in semi-bipartite graphs?Yeah! Its possible… The only situation you can’t find a solution is when the graph has an odd length cycle. Its easy to understand why as i try to explain the logic of building a solution. Build a dfs/bfs from any vertex, consider it as the root for all its connected components, push the root into a partition, all the vertexes you visit next from the root put them into another partition, so every alternate node of the graph while traversal goes into a partition and thus we have two partitions with a node belonging to each edge of the graph. Now what if you have an odd length cycle, if you start from a vetex V on the cycle pushing into say partition A and you start pushing elements alternately, when your cycle terminates, you are at a situation when you have to push the node connected to initial vertex V into partition A since its an odd length cycle, which poses a contradiction as you have already pushed vertex V in A. 91 Views
