Why does Dijkstra's Shortest path algorithm not work for graphs with negative weights?If there are no negative weight cycles, does Dijkra's alg still work? Can someone give an intuitive explanation rather than just counter examples?Actually, Dijkstra works wrong with negative edges even without negative cycles. Follow the example in the picture. It will give wrong answer for node b. The intuitive explanation is that having negative edges makes us change our choices in the future. But in the case of Dijkstra we wanted every node that was visited until to be reached with minimum possible distance from source. However, having a large negative edge from a node that we haven't visited yet will change everything. 174 Views  Answer requested by 2 people
