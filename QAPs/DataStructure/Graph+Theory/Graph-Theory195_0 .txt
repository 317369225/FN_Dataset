How can I transform a directed graph into many linked lists?I guess this is a follow up to a question: how to represent a graph in a program? The answer is it depends on how the graph was given to you. In competitive programming graphs are often given as a list of pairs of vertices (u, v) thath have an edge between themselves. So when you get the information that there is a directed edge between u and v you would put v in a linked list of neighbors of u. If the graph was undirected you would also put u in a linked list of neighbors of v. There you have it. You need a linked list of neighbors for every vertice. That's it. 220 Views  View Upvotes
