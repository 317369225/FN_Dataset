Why is using admissible function for A* search guarantees to find shortest paths?Admissible functions guarantees under-estimation (or, at least, exact equality) to the actual shortest path. It means, they are chosen so they will less or equal then the path along edges. Usually they are chosen to be simple L2-norm, which satisfies general norm properties (positiveness, scale, triangle inequality). You can either choose L1 or Linf norms, depending on your graph metric structure. Having Dijkstra or A* relaxation step with such admissble function (in additions to currently collected path) gives us strong guarantee of under-estimation the actual path. The good thing with heuistics is that they tend to give you the vertices along shortest path (according to norm function you choose). The bad thing - it is just an heuristic, and there are cases when it performs the same as generic Dijkstra. Plese read here: Admissible heuristic And here: A* search algorithm 159 Views
