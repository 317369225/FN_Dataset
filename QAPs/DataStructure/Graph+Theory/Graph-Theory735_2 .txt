What is an simple explanation of why bi-directional BFS runs in Θ(n  √ )  Θ(n) ?Also, is this runtime general worst-case time or is there a caveat?Plus, bidirectional BFS may visit (almost) all nodes whenever the target node is not reachable from the source node. However, you can optimize it a little bit: Suppose A A is the connected component containing the source node, and B B is the connected component containing the target node. If, in your implementation, you expand the smaller of the search trees, your worst case time is proportional to 2min(|A|,|B|) 2min(|A|,|B|) . 116 Views
