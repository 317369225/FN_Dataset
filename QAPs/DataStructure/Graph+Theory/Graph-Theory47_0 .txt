What are some ideas or topics for a research paper on number theory/combinatorics/graph theory/algebra/mathematics?I am a college student taking up a Mathematics course. Our field only accept the topics about number theory/combinatorics/graph theory/algebra/mathematics. But I don’t know what topic I should use. I’ve been rejected many times by our professor. Please Help.Have you tried digging around the Wikipedia pages for ideas? Why has the professor rejected your ideas so far? Only you know the kind of stuff in these fields you are interested in. So look around on Wikipedia and just write down a bunch of ideas for topics, then ask your professor which he/she thinks are appropriate. 158 Views  Answer requested by Melanie Atendido
