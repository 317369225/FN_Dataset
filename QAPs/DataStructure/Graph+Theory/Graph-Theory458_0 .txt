What are good books for graph theory?I’m about to start on a half-year long project where the main areas will revolve around Tarjan's algorithm and graph theory and also some numerical analysis. I’m in need of both a general intro to GT as well as the sub-domains of GT relevant to Tarjan’s algorithm.You may find it useful to pick up any textbook introduction to Algorithms and Complexity. Many of the paradigms introduced in such textbooks deal with graph problems, even if there’s no explicit division of material into different parts of graph theory. We used Kleinberg and Tardos’s Algorithm Design in my class. It seems from your mention of Tarjan’s algorithm that your studies will be algorithmic in nature. That being the case, you’d probably do well to learn general complexity analysis from a textbook like the above. Here’s a list of popular texts you might try: Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (MIT Press): Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein: 9780262033848: Amazon.com: Books Algorithms (4th Edition): Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne: 8601400041420: Amazon.com: Books Algorithm Design: 9780321295354: Computer Science Books @ Amazon.com Is this project with a professor? Are you a math or computer science student? Are you going to be working with a computer science or math professor? Math and Comp Sci have different flavors of graph theory, so be wary of diving too deeply into something that isn’t tailored to what your project deals with. 257 Views · View Upvotes
