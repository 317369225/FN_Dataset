Why does Dijkstra's Shortest path algorithm not work for graphs with negative weights?If there are no negative weight cycles, does Dijkra's alg still work? Can someone give an intuitive explanation rather than just counter examples?Thanks for A2A. Dijkstra's algorithm does not work on graphs with negative weights. The algorithm works in a greedy manner. Once it selects the minimum edge weight, it cannot replace it for better choice. At each iteration, it extracts the minimum edged weight by assuming that in the next iterations there won't come any other lesser edge weight for the shortest path. 275 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
