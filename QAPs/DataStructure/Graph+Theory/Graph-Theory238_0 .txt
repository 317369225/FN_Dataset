What is the best algorithm to find a shortest path that must go through some given nodes?There are quite a few algorithms that handle this one rather well. Wikipedia has a wonderful page dedicated to this very question. Shortest path problem The most important algorithms for solving this problem are: Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem. Bellman–Ford algorithm solves the single-source problem if edge weights may be negative. A* search algorithm solves for single pair shortest path using heuristics to try to speed up the search. Floyd–Warshall algorithm solves all pairs shortest paths. Johnson's algorithm solves all pairs shortest paths, and may be faster than Floyd–Warshall on sparse graphs. Viterbi algorithm solves the shortest stochastic path problem with an additional probabilistic weight on each node. The simplest algorithm in this list would be A* (star) with Dijkstra's algorithm coming in at a very close second. 241 Views · View Upvotes
