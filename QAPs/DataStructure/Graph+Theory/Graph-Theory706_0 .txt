How did you learn graph theory from scratch?If you are asking it from programming point of view I would like to say you to go to the site GeeksForGeeks and learn those given algorithms, implement them and try to visualize them. If you think yourself prepared then it is time to solve some problems. Choose any Competitive Programming site (I personally prefer Codeforces) and go to their Graph related problem section, randomly pick up a problem (problems with more submissions will be good for a newbie), try to solve them, if it seems hard then spend some time, if it seems harder then see the editorial and try to find what new tricks they have used that you are not thinking of. Now take some rest and go for another problem. N.B: Abstract Graph Theory is a different thing. This answer is mostly for a sport programmer. 293 Views  View Upvotes
