How would I contact someone who could develop a rigorous description of a new type of complex network that doesn't seem to fit graph analysis methods?Contact your local university mathematics department and mention that you'd like to pay for some consulting. That might lead to a 15-minute meeting with the department head who would then give you a few recommendations for people who are competent in that area. Taking a wild guess, I'd expect you'd need to pay on the order of $200/hr for non-tenured faculty and at least $50/hr for graduate students. The number of hours should be negotiated, but I think ten is a sane minimum. If you wanted someone to look at this for free.... well, probably best if you started taking classes yourself. 309 Views  View Upvotes
