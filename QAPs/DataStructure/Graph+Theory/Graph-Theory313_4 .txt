What does cryptography have to do with graph theory?Modern cryptography is heavily reliant on mathematics. Although group theory is perhaps the most directly relevant to the study of cryptography, there are many branches of mathematics such as graph theory that can be peripherally related. In the case of graph theory, I could argue that computationally complex graph problems such as traveling sales person could potentially be used as the basis for a public key cipher. The other idea that came to mind immediately was that, since cryptography is about keeping things hidden, there is relevance in the ease with which one can use graph theory to reconstruct the labels on a network that had been masked via cryptography. A web search yields plenty of other overlap, such as hashes based on expander functions. 35 Views  View Upvotes
