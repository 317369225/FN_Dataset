Why in each scientific article there should be a graph?Measuring the world is innately human. For example, if you witness a man steal candy from a baby, your moral outrage will increase. Perhaps your vitals will rise, your eyes may twitch, and your face may feel flush. These are physically sensations, one way to measure the world. Consider your emotional measure, you may feel sad, angry, or nothing at all in regards to the seemingly evil act. These types of sensations are inherently subjective. Science by nature is objective. While we cannot say for certain everyone will be outraged by the man stealing the candy, we can certainly say that a raise adrenaline will cause your heart to pulsate faster. How fast? Well that is where scientific papers shine. Much of the language of objectivity is mathematical in nature. Graphs are simply synonyms for equations that help us to see the results in different ways. 155 Views
