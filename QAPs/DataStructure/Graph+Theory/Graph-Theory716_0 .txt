How do I build or design entities for a knowledge graph?It is not clear to me what you mean by "design entities" or "build entities". An entity could be defined as a thing that is uniquely defined and relevant in your body of knowledge. As example, a book, a movie, an actor, a record uniquely defined, a reference, a fact. Might two entities have same names but different meaning, your design for an architecture might want to be able to interprete which entity is related to which. For already ingesting curated de-coupled entities of public knowledge domain, look at wikidata dump as a starter. Wikidata:Database download Any knowledge domain (QA sites, academia, books, movies, etc.) will have its own dump you could start to download and design a service upon it - if this answer your question. 350 Views  Answer requested by Jerry Wind
