What is the difference between a histogram and a bar graph?A bar chart is a particular data visualisation, where for each x value, you visualise exactly one y value. A histogram is something that can be visualised as a bar chart. For each x value (which represents a range of values in your original data), you have exactly one value (the number of values in that range). So while many histograms are presented using bar charts, they are actually two different kind of things, one is a visual, the other an analysis tool. 2.5k Views  View Upvotes
