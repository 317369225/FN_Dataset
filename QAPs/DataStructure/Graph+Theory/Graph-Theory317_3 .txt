In an undirected graph, what is the degree of a vertex with a self-loop?My professor said the degree would be 2. But I don’t see how. I can understand that a single vertex has degree of 0. But when that vertex connects to itself, shouldn’t it be degree of 1?Your professor is right, a vertex looped back on itself is a special case and has a degree of 2. Since we are referring to undirected graphs, we need to count the edge from both end. ( Think of it as having two ways to reach the vertex over the same edge (the loop in question) ). 125 Views  View Upvotes
