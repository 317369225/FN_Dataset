How many number of circles that you can draw on the surface without creating more than one region?If we draw a circle in the plane , we separate the plane into 2 regions , inside and outside. Determine the maximal number of circles that you can draw on the surface without creating more than one region : Sphere, Torus , Pretzel(double -doughnut), Klein bottle and a projective plane.I believe you can draw one circle for each generator of the homology. If two curves on a surface are homologous then they bound a region. That's not formal, and there may be weird cases where this doesn't hold, but I think it does for all of the surfaces you listed. So 0 on a sphere, 2 on a torus, 2 on a Klein bottle, 4 on a genus 2 surface ("pretzel"), 1 on the projective plane. 223 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Ashish Malik
