Is there an equivalent to Wagner's Theorem in Graph Theory for whether or not a graph is toroidal?Wagner's Theorem states that a graph non-planar if it has K3,3 K3,3 or K5 K5 as a minor. Is there any equivalent theorem or rule that deals with whether a graph is toroidal or not (i.e. is there some set of graphs such that if a graph G G has one or more of those graphs as a minor, it is necessarily non-toroidal?)The general statement that answers this is the heavy artillery for all such properties: the Robertson–Seymour theorem. As the family of all toroidal graphs is closed under minors, R-S theorem proves that it can be characterized by some finite set of forbidden minors. The R-S theorem does not actually give a construction of such a set of minors, it only proves its existence. As far as I know, we actually don't know an explicit characterization for toroidal graphs yet. (As of roughly ten years ago, it was known that the characterization will contain over 16,000 different minors.) 629 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Justin Rising
