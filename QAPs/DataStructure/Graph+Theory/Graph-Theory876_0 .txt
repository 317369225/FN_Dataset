What's the best text to teach and learn basic graphing/charting?I would say that one of the best ways to learn basic graphing is through Khan Academy. Graphing lines and slope Here is an overview of the curriculum: Graphing on the coordinate plane Solutions and graphs of two-variable equations Graphing with intercepts Slope of a line Graphing linear equations in slope-intercept form Constructing equations in slope-intercept form Graphing linear inequalities This is only in algebra basics. You can up the tempo and difficulty by going to a different level of math, like say differential calculus. 226 Views  View Upvotes
