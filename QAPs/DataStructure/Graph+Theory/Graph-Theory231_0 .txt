Why does a 7-regular graph on 20 vertices have 70 edges?You can count the number of collisions. A collision is a unique pair (e,v) where an edge strikes a vertex (and makes a loud noise) Note each edge has two endpoints so there are 140 collisions Each vertex has seven edges striking it so there are also 140 collisions I think that is what is going on (if I understand the situation correctly.) 117 Views
