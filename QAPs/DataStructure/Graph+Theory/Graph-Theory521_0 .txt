Given a bipartite graph, how can I find its subgraph that is a complete bipartite graph and has the most vertices?This problem is solvable in polynomial time. First of all, let’s take the bipartite complement of the input graph G  G : we will still have the same partitions A  A and B  B , but in the new graph G ′   G′ two vertices a∈A  a∈A and b∈B  b∈B are connected if and only if they weren’t connected in G  G . Complete bipartite subgraphs of G  G correspond to independent sets in G  G : sets of vertices that aren’t connected by any direct edges. Hence, in G ′   G′ we are looking for the maximum independent set. This can be found as follows: Find M  M : the maximum bipartite matching in G ′   G′ (see Matching in unweighted bipartite graphs) Use that matching to construct one possible minimum vertex cover of G ′   G′ (see the proof of Kőnig's theorem (graph theory) for an algorithm) The complement of that vertex cover is a maximum independent set in G ′   G′ , in other words, your maximum complete bipartite subgraph of G  G . 846 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Bin Arrow
