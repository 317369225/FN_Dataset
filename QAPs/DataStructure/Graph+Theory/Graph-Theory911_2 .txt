Is there an easy method to determine if a graph is planar or not?I can't find a subgraph that is K5 or K3,3 to use the kuratowski theorem .Is there another way to determine if it is not planar?Originally Answered: What is the methodology to prove if a graph is planar or not? Kouretoski's Theorem ( forgive spelling) ; if a graph on a 2 dimensional plane can have a complete graph K5 or the bipartite graph K3,3 embedded in it then it is not planar. If these subgraphs can not be embedded then it is planar. (I think this is correct; if not I'm sure someone will revise this..) 189 Views
