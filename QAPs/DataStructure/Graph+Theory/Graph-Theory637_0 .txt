What is a "graph trend"?I think you're referring to a trend line. Trend lines can be straight or curved, and they're used to highlight the overall direction or movement of data over time. Trend lines can be drawn based on observation or mathematical formulas. The below trendline examples were drawn using ZingChart's JavaScript charting library. The first is drawn using scale markers and the second is drawn using a mixed chart type. You can interact with the demos using the below links. http://demos.zingchart.com/view/... http://demos.zingchart.com/view/... Disclosure: I'm on the ZingChart team.
