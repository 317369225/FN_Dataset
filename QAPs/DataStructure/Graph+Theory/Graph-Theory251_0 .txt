How can I understand graphs? How can I understand how to use is it in problem solving?I understand the representation of a graph but I'm still not able to solve problems using it.Graph problems normally have types like i) Graph Traversal ii) Single-Source Shortest Paths iii) All-Pairs Shortest Paths iv) Minimum Spanning Tree and so on. It is a bit tough and time consuming to come up with a brute force solution for graph problem. In case of graph problems you need to know the representation of graph and graph traversal algorithms(BFS,DFS). Then for shortest path problems you need (Dijkstra,BelmanFord) for single source and (FloydWarshall) for all pair shortest path. For more advanced algotrithm, you might need (kruskal) for Minimum Spanning Tree problems. If you practice problems of these topics,you may have an idea of using which algorithms to which problem. 340 Views  View Upvotes
