What is the difference between a histogram and a bar graph?Difference between Histograms and Bar Charts Bar Chart The columns are positioned over a label that represents a categorical variable. The height of the column indicates the size of the group defined by the categories. Histogram The columns are positioned over a label that represents a quantitative variable. The column label can be a single value or a range of values. Here is the main difference between them. With bar charts, each column represents a group defined by a categorical variable; and with histograms, each column represents a group defined by a quantitative variable. One indication of this distinction: it is always appropriate to talk about the skewness of a histogram; that is, the tendency of the observations to fall more on the low end or the high end of the X axis. Differently, bar charts' X axis does not have a low end or a high end; because the labels on the X axis are categorical - not quantitative. Therefore, it is less appropriate to comment on the skewness of a bar chart. Refer to the following diagram to see a visual comparison between them. 6.7k Views  View Upvotes
