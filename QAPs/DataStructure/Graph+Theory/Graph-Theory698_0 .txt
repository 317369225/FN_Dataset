How is graph theory used in music theory?Music theory is really mathematical. A lot of the notes are somehow connected, usually by multiplying by a constant to get from one pitch to another. I bring to you: combinatorial music theory. This video is based on this paper: Combinatorial Music Theory It takes musical notes and creates a graph out of them. The relations of scales and chords are really cool on graphs, and the paper covers these. Finally, if you are interested, I came across a really cool beat system that uses graph theory (more like graphs). You can watch a tutorial here: The app is here: NodeBeat 392 Views  View Upvotes
