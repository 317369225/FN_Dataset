How do I make a graph using two separate charts in Excel?I'm testing Selection Sort and getting the time it takes for the algorithm to sort some elements. I'm supposed to put that info into a chart and plot a graph with it but the things is: I have two charts, one for the Best Case and the other one for the Worst case. How to put both into one graph?I usually link external worksheet cells to a data range for the graph using simple formulas. 29 Views
