How do you graph y=(x-2) (x-2)?y = (x^2) - 4x + 4 What you understand from this: It's a parabola Since the coefficient of x^2 is +1 , it's concave upwards. Put x = 0, you get y = 4 => the vertex lies at the point (0,4) Put some value of x and find the corresponding value of y. Remember, the y would be same for the value -x (except for x = 0). Extrapolate your graph. Philosophical Note: For you to get the exact graph of the curve, you will need to evaluate over all the infinite points in the domain of the function. The lesson is more the points, more accurate is your graph. 50 Views
