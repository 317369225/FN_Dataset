Is it possible to draw the shape below without taking your pencil off the paper?Sorry for the poor image. This is the best i could draw in paint!Here is an easy explanations without a graph theory. Only two base figures could be drown by pen - Line and Circle. Line has two ends, circle has no ends. All curve transformations (bending, twisting etc) just add points of crossings with EVEN number of lines (inputs = outputs). So only two types of figures could be drawn without taking the pen off: 1) which have all even points of crossing; there you may start from any point and you'll finish on it. 2) which have only two points of ODD crossing; you should start from one of it and finish on another one. 3.2k Views  View Upvotes
