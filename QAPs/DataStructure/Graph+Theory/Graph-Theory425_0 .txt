What is the use of graph database?Picture your favourite social media app in your head. You, your friends, your posts , likes for a post, shares for a post, your friend’s friend to n level depth. What do you think are the ways to realise this logical data model, physically ? Ofcourse one way is have profiles table, posts table and have detail tables for each relationship like posts like and posts share with foreign keys. Another sophisticated and intuitive way to realise the same is to store it as a graph. Profiles and posts are edges and likes, shares are vertex labels. So “complex relationships at n levels” is the best use case for graph databases like Neo4J. The graph data stores optimises queries and will internally do BFT or DFT based on the query needs. Neo4J has an in-memory option if I remember. Google’s pregel should be a good further read. If there aren't many levels or if the levels are fixed you could even use some thing like a Triple Store. Hope this helps ! 219 Views · View Upvotes
