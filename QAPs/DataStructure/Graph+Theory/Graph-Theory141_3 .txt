Why is time always represented in the X-axis of a graph?It won’t be always once you understand why it is so ! While plotting any graph it is a standard rule or convention you can say to plot the independent variable on the ‘X’ axis and the dependent one on the ‘Y’ axis. So, for example when we plot the graph for the equation , “ y=2x ” since we will be putting values in x to get values of y to plot , x values will go on X axis and y values will go to Y axis. Now if we rewrite the equation as , “ x = y/2 ” . Now it infers that we will be putting values in y to get values of x , that is here y is the independent one and x is the dependent one. Now, it is a general conception that time is an independent entity, being dependent on nothing else. BUT it is not correct, can you tell the situation where time will be depending on other factor, if not then you can ask in comment. 30 Views · Answer requested by Spandan Mallick
