How many faces, edges and vertices does a hexagonal pyramid have? How are they determined?The base of the pyramid is a hexagon, a figure with 6 edges and 6 vertices. Because it's a pyramid, we have an edge extending up from each base vertex, and all of these edges converge at a single additional vertex for a total of 12 edges and 7 vertices. Similarly, we have one face corresponding to each edge of the base, and the base itself is an additional face, so there are 7 faces. 447 Views  View Upvotes
