What would be the rough steps to follow in building a network graph?I have a huge data set containing certain financial data with relationships between various entities (sorry for being a bit vague). What should I think of when selecting the layout, the way I construct nodes and edges? I just need questions to ask myself when I design the graph.All network analysis starts with two questions: > What are the members of the population? > How are they connected? To create a network you need pairs of entities (Vertices) that are connected by a relationship (Edge). Once you define what the vertices and edge types are, you may express each relationship as a single row in a table: Vertex1, Vertex2, Relationship Type, [Optional: additional edge Attributes], [Optional: Vertex1 Attributes], [Optional: Vertex2 Attributes] This table can then be imported into tools like Gephi or NodeXL for analysis, visualization and reporting. 140 Views  View Upvotes
