Is it possible to draw the shape below without taking your pencil off the paper?Sorry for the poor image. This is the best i could draw in paint!2 answers Yes: If you have 2 or more pages it is easy to draw.There are minimum 3 ways which this can be done No mathematically speaking it is impossible to do this. There are rules in mathematics which says you cannot draw such graphs The rule : graphs which have more than 2 odd nodes cannot be drawn without lifting pen Odd node : a point with odd number of paths from it Even node : a point with even number of paths from it this graph contains 4 odd nodes and 1 even node There is another rule about graphs but you don't have to know that for this graph 2.3k Views  View Upvotes
