How do you solve and graph y=-6x+3?If by solve you mean find the x intercept... First substitute the y value with 0 so that you can find the value of x when y is equal to 0. 0 = -6x + 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. -3 = -6x divide both sides by -6 1/2 = x Now To Graph.... since the equation is written in y=mx+b form we know that the y intercept is simply the b value which in this situation is 3. We know both the x intercepts and the y intercepts so we can translate that information into two different points. since the x intercept is 1/2 we can say one point on the line is (1/2, 0) since the y intercept is 3, we can say another point on the line is (0,3) So now all we have to do is connect the dots!!! And our graph ends up looking like.... 541 Views
