What does the term "folklore" mean in mathematics?At the end of chapter 1 in Stanley's Algebraic Combinatorics: The connection between graph eigenvalues and the enumeration of walks is considered "folklore". By this does he mean that this connection is generally known but unpublished? I'm not sure.A result is mathematical “folklore” when it is known to the mathematics community without actually having been published anywhere. The community would know it maybe by attending conferences, or by word of mouth, or by some other means. Based on this definition, I would disagree that the connection between graph eigenvalues and the enumeration of walks is “folklore”. The paper “The spectral approach to determining the number of walks in a graph” by Harary and Schwenk (1979) shows that this topic is not “folklore”. But, let’s not get into an argument with Richard Stanley here! Here’s an (another?) example of mathematical “folklore”: in the paper by Merris “Laplacian graph eigenvectors” (1998), he says: “A part of the Laplacian “folklore”, this result is an immediate consequence of the previous definitions and observations.” (He was talking about the result that a Laplacian n×n  n×n matrix has one of its eigenvalues equal to n  n if and only if the graph representing it is the join of one or more graphs.) The strange thing is that, by definition of mathematical folklore, if you publish a result that is deemed mathematical folklore, then it ceases to be mathematical folklore! 413 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Vineet Apte
