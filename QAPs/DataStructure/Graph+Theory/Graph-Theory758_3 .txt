Why does Dijkstra's Shortest path algorithm not work for graphs with negative weights?If there are no negative weight cycles, does Dijkra's alg still work? Can someone give an intuitive explanation rather than just counter examples?Dijkstras algorithm knows when to terminate when we know that all other paths are longer than our current candidate solution path. Since iterating more times only increases the lengths of the paths (since all weights are positive), we can be certain that we will never find a shorter path than our current shortest candidate solution. If we have negative weights, the paths other than the candidate solution may eventually decrease in length due to the negative weights, so Dijkstras termination condition is insufficient. 329 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
