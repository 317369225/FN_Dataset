Is discrete math (Combinatorics, Graph theory, number theory, etc.) more beautiful than continuous maths (Analysis)?The beauty in discrete math, I think, is that it's applicable, while in continuous math, it's less applicable, and more perfect. We all know the old "beauty is in the eye of..." limit, but I feel that this is a fair definition. We see that when we have something tangible in discrete math we think it's neat and that perhaps we think it's a beautiful (where concise) result. The less tangible jazz people tend to avoid like the plague. For me, I find more beauty in the elegance of an argument than in the result, therefore I find the more abstract continuous math more beautiful. Perhaps this is the most effective way of describing it. For me there's an undefinable beauty in what my first analysis book defined as analysis: drawing conclusions from infinite data that is always supported. I fully understand why one might think the result of fractals or perhaps some problem in combinatorix geometry might be beautiful, but to me, the appeal is more in the argument than the result. In this respect, I'm distinct from a fair number of my peers in having a love for pure math over applied math. I think that distinction should give you the best answer to why many see discrete math as more beautiful. 128 Views  View Upvotes
