What is Minimum Spanning Tree and give a real life example for it? Also what it has to do with Prim's, Kruskal's & Djikstra algorithm?The biggest application of minimum cost spanning trees is connecting multiple nodes to a single network with the smallest cost. This can be seen with computers and a network, using wire to connect each computer, or consider a single phone line that you want multiple phones to be connected to via physical wire. You would want to minimize the costs to connect each computer or phone to the network. More info on applications, including indirect applications, can be found here Applications of Minimum Spanning Tree Problem - GeeksforGeeks I'm not going to fully explain each algorithm because they can be easily Googled, but I'll explain the differences. Dijkstra's algorithm does not create a MST (minimum spanning tree), it is used to find minimum cost between two vertices. However, making a small change in the algorithm produces a decently efficient algorithm that creates a MST. Prim's algorithm starts at an arbitrary vertex, and considers that vertex to be in a set. The algorithm looks to add vertices to this set with least amount of cost, so the first step is choosing the smallest edge between the starting vertex and a different vertex. This step keeps repeating, except now you have multiple vertices in the set and you look at all of the edges between those vertices and the vertices not in the set. Kruskal's algorithm just looks for the smallest weighted edges that will connect to new vertices. It differs from Prim's because it does not have to select edges that stem from already reached vertices. Both of these algorithms use edges as long as they don't create a cycle. All MST algorithms will result in the same answer if there is only one MST possible from the graph. 214 Views  View Upvotes
