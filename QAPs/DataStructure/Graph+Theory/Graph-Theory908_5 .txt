If you own a business and have a customer list (first/last name), what would be the most useful data about these customers to help grow your business?When talking about open data, it really depends on where your business operates. Open data availability varies wildly from one country to the other, sometimes from one region to the other. E.g. in the UK there is much more data about England and Wales than Scotland or Northern Ireland. Then, you should really specify what you think would empower the growth of your business. E.g. if you're selling luxury goods in the UK and you perspective customers are wealthy, you could use the UK census to know where the wealthiest live and advertise there only. If you own a bakery, that's not going to be of much use. === 15 MAR 2016 EDIT === I seem to remember that the original question asked what open data sources were interesting in attempting to grow the business starting from the customer list, hence the answer above. The current edit appears to be more ambiguous. Hope my considerations are useful anyway. 237 Views  View Upvotes
