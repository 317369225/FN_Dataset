What is the difference between a "Minimal Spanning Tee" and "shortest paths"?I take minimal to mean shortest.A spanning tree can, as the name suggests, be a tree and usually it is. Only in rare cases this is a degenerated chain (which can still be considered as a tree). The spanning tree is about finding a solution that connects all dots while the total length is minimal. This is guaranteed by a greedy algorithm that only adds shortest edges. If you have two points, A and B, that are leaves on the spanning tree, it is possible there is a shorter path, maybe straight from A to B. In other cases there can be shorter paths also. 59 Views
