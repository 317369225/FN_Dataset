How would you graph (Triangle) RST with vertices R(4,7), S(1,0) and T (4, -6) and its image after a reflection over x=3?In a reflection over a vertical axis, (such as x=3) the shape only moves horizontally. This means we only need to consider the x in each vertice. But how much should we move each vertice? Well, in a reflection, the distance between the reflection axis and a point is equal to the distance between the same axis and the reflected point. So if the vertices are R(4,7), S(1,0) and T(4,-6), then the distance from the axis x=3 to the reflected points is |3-a| ("a" is the x coordinate of the vertices). For vertice R, we move it |3-4|=|-1|=1 unit away from x=3. For S, we move it |3-1|=|2|=2 units away from x=3. For vertice T, we move it |3-4|=1 unit away from x=3. But this only gives us a distance, and we also need to know where to move each vertice. Since the movement will be horizontal, it can only be to the left or to the right. If a point is to the right of the axis, its reflection will be to the left, and viceversa. Point R is to the right of x=3, (since 4>3) so it will move to the left of x=3 by 1 unit. The reflection of point R has coordinates (3-1, 7)=(2, 7). Point S is to the left, so its new position will be (3+2, 0)=(5, 0). Point T is to the right, so its new position will be (2, -6). Now you only need to graph those points and trace the reflected triangle. Note: It would be easier to solve by just graphing the original triangle and moving the points in the same way, but it's harder for me to explain it that way. 66 Views
