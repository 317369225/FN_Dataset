What is the difference between a y and an x graph?When you first learn about functions you typically model situations where one thing is dependent on another. For example, how many questions can I answer on Quora if I spend a certain amount of time online? It takes me about 15 minutes to find a relevant question and answer it. That means that if I spend 30 minutes I will answer 2 questions, 1 hour would give 4 answers and 1 day would give 96 answers. The more time I spend, the more answers. The time spent would be the x and the answers would be y. What you place on the x-axis depends on ho you formulate the question. If you ask yourself "How many minutes do I have to be on Quora to answer 4 questions?" you have flipped the question to ask how the time is dependent on the number of answers and it would now make sense to have answers on the x-axis and the minutes on the y-axis. In a general sense you place what you want to change on the x-axis and what is dependent on x on the y-axis. 142 Views  View Upvotes
