In an undirected graph, what is the degree of a vertex with a self-loop?My professor said the degree would be 2. But I don’t see how. I can understand that a single vertex has degree of 0. But when that vertex connects to itself, shouldn’t it be degree of 1?According to Introduction to Algorithms (page 1169 of the third edition, for example): “In an undirected graph, self-loops are forbidden, and so every edge consists of two distinct vertices.” Therefore, if you use our definition of an undirected graph, the question is moot. What source does your class use that allows undirected graphs to have self-loops? 8.5k Views · View Upvotes
