What do the matrices represent in the following pictures?Thank you very much,I am learning R language by myself right now,and now I feel it's a little difficult for me... Is there any good books for beginners? Thank you very much!The matrixes represent adiacency between nodes. For example between V0 and V1,V2,V3 there is an edge. Number 1 indicates the presence of edges between two nodes while 0 indicates that there are no edges between two nodes. You can understand better this way ;  V0 V2 V3 V4 V0 0 1 1 1 V1 1 0 1 1 V2 1 1 0 0 V3 1 1 0 0 It is the same for the second matrix where the edges are directed. 150 Views
