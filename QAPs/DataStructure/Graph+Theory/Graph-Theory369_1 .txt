How do I picture the graph of sin(1x )  sin⁡(1x) in an intuitive way?Consider the graph when x is very large. This gives sin0=0. So you know that the graph approaches x axis for large values of x. Then consider small values of x. The information in picture below gives general idea of shape of the graph. Left side is right side multiplied by negative 1 since sine is odd function. 301 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Ann Le
