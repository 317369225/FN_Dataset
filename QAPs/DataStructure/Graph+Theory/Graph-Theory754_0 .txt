Given a positive-weighted, undirected graph, how do I find a path between two nodes which has the sum of weights close to a given value?I'm assuming you meant that you want to find a weighted path from two given vertices given a target weight (for the path). Just apply one of the shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm) and rephrase your problem as this (as I assume you wouldn't want worse paths): Find a shortest path from u to v, add the sum of its weights and if it is less than or equal to the target, return it. Otherwise, return something saying NO_PATH_EXISTS. If you want to make it "within a certain target" you can reformulate the above modification to do this. Now if you want it to instead find worse paths, this paper may interest you: https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Work... 122 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Weizi Li
