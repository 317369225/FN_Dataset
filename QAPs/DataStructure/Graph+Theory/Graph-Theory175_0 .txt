How can I draw the graph of y= 1/2 ({-x})?{.} denotes fractional part of x.What it seems that the curly braces {} might imply something, which I’m not aware of. But if you’ve put it just for fashion, I must tell you that the graph is pretty straight forward equation of a straight line passing through the origin making an angle of tan −1 (12 )  tan−1(12) with the positive direction of the x-axis. Edit 1: The graph will look somewhat like this But the left part of the graph i.e. for all x < 0, the graph will be a mirror image of what is shown here. In other words the graph for the function when x < 0 should be the image of the graph for x > 0 with respect to origin. At all integer points the the function reduces to zero, and is discontinuous as it starts from 0.5 at the next limiting point. 52 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
