Can someone give me an example of undirected graph of Bellman?SO nicely explain it: look over here it says Un-DiGraph is also a directed graph. the graph in image is directed with vertices "S" & "T" it is also UN-directed graph. i.e edges(-4,5) can be twice (two way) = > (-4, 5) and (5, -4). Example Source Slides another very good explanation of the algorithm is in a book by Dr. Ashraf Iqbal view its page number 240. 124 Views  Answer requested by Hannah Mae Calinao
