What are the physical applications of the Tree Matrix Theorem of Graph Theory?Let us consider the Tree matrix theorem Matrix Tree Theorem . I am interested on any simple physical application of this theorem. Any ideas?Traffic congestion. We can represent the roads of some particular town or country as a graph. If the roads of a particular town form only one spanning tree, then expect massive traffic congestion everyday. Building and connecting new road nodes together creates alternative routes to go from A to B, which means that there are more spanning trees in the road graph, which, in turn, relieves traffic congestion. Conversely, if a road needs to be closed for repairs, say, traffic congestion usually increases - this is a direct result of the number of spanning trees in the road graph decreasing. This can also be applied to Internet traffic. The Internet is, essentially, a huge graph linking servers together. For a website to appear on your screen, it needs to 'travel' through several servers until it reaches your device. The path it traverses, travelling from one server to another, is part of one giant spanning tree. If the number of spanning trees of the Internet is small, then internet traffic becomes congested, as a large amount of information passes through only a few possible spanning trees. In a nutshell, the number of spanning trees of a graph is a measure of how 'congested' your network can become: the larger the number of spanning trees, the less congestion can occur. 289 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Francesco Sgarlata
