How do you solve and graph y=-3x-6?Since there is other equation, I have to solve the given equation with respect to X-axis and Y-axis. First let me show you the graph of the given line. Then take x value as zero, y becomes -6. So the line touches Y-axis at (0,-6). Now taking y as zero, x becomes -2. So the line touches X-axis at (-2,0). If my perception about solving is wrong please comment! Thanks! 242 Views  View Upvotes
