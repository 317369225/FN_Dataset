When we remove an edge from a tree it seems obvious that we are left with two trees, but how would we go about proving this?Why aren't we left with 3+ trees?Theorem: Any forest on n  n vertices has k  k components if and only if it has exactly (n−k)  (n−k) edges. Proof: Fix n  n . Start from a forest with no edges, which clearly has n  n components. Introducing an edge to this graph will reduce the number of components by 1  1 . Introducing another edge reduces the number of components by 1 again. Continue introducing edges until you end up with only one component having (n−1)  (n−1) edges. The result is thus proved. The proof of the question you're asking is just a simple corollary of the above theorem. 264 Views · View Upvotes
