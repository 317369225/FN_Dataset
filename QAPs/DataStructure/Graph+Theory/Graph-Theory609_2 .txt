What could be my mistake in this “shortest paths” algorithm?The code works in some test cases, but not in others. I designed it myself, not copying something exactly, so I’m not looking just for “some algorithm”, but rather to find what is wrong with this one. Also, the source graph is undirected.You need to read Dijkstra’s/Bellman ford algorithm before writing such a stuff. Your algorithm is incorrect and inefficient as well. Secondly, your code looks like you are trying to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm. If you are not trying, then have a look and try again. But one word of caution, Dijkstra’s will not work if your graph has negative edges. Pointing errors in your code will be gruesome for anyone, unless you tell us your algorithm and its correctness so that we can attempt to comment on what you are doing wrong. 53 Views · Answer requested by Thomas Johnson
