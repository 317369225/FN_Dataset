What are vertices? How many vertices does a cuboid have?From what I know, a vertex (singular of vertices) is a corner. It could be a 3D corner, or a 2D corner, but it’s got to be a corner. It can be the corner made from two lines that make an angle: It can be the corner of a shape, like a square: It can be the corner of a 3D object, like a cuboid: So, how many vertices does a cuboid have? Count. A cuboid has 8 vertices. 113 Views · View Upvotes
