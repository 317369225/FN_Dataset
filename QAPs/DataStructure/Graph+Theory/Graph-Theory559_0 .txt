How is topology used in graph theory?Topology plays a HUGE role in Graph Theory. It is generally applied in Embedding graphs in surfaces and analyzing graphs as topological spaces. In a less abstract manner, it is applied in Electronics to print Circuit Boards, as well as in the Three utilities problem. If you want to study more into Topological Graph Theory, read J.L.
