Why is time always represented in the X-axis of a graph?It is a convention to represent the independent variable on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis. The simplest graphs with time on the x-axis one may encounter are graphs of displacement/distance vs time, velocity vs time, acceleration vs. time, or even the profits or sales vs time. Note that time is the independent variable in all cases. 126 Views
