Can I plot a single graph for different velocities in abaqus?I am working on a project in Abaqus where I need to plot graph for different velocities of same model onto the one graph. How do I do That?A2A: I'm puzzled by the question, since the answer seems obvious. If this answer doesn't help you, then please clarify your question because perhaps I don't understand what you are asking.... In /Viewer, just do a history plot of the outputs that you wish to plot. If you do not have those variables available to you, will have to use "*OUTPUT, HISTORY" to generate them. If you are extracting from different ODB files, you can create xy data (which stores in that session) and then plot them just as you would history data directly. 227 Views  Answer requested by Sahil Gulati
