If we negate the edge weights in a graph G=(V,E) G=(V,E) and then run Bellman Ford, does this compute longest paths?If its does not, then what does this compute? Why wouldn't it if shortest paths now correspond to shortest paths?No, it does not. The easy way to look at it is to find a graph that breaks everything: Suppose we have a graph G with three nodes: A, B and C. A and B are connected through an edge of weight 1, B and C with weight 1, and A and C with weight 5. Longest path from A to C is clearly through the weight 5 edge, but negating the edges of the graph gives us an infinite loop, and hence there is no shortest path. 40 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
