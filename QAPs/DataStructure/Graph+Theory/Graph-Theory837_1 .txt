We have a simple graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. How can we find the number of edges which produce a bipartite graph after removing them?n <= 10000. m <= 10000. We need an algorithm better than O(nm) , O(n^2) or O(m^2). Note that a edge must be counted if and only if deleting that single edge, leaves a bipartite graph.This is called the bipartite edge frustration ψ(G)  ψ(G) of a graph G  G in the graph theory literature. Unfortunately, obtaining ψ(G)  ψ(G) is NP-hard in general. There are a few results for certain classes of graphs, however. See Z. Yarahmadi, T. Došlić, A.R.
