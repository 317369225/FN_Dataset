Is there some form of mathematics that can be used to predict resonance structures and double bond patterns on a large sheet of fused cyclic alkenes?When I try to draw out these structures, I find the constraints of where double bonds can form to lead to some very interesting, but seemingly chaotic patterns. Is there a way to model these patterns with respect to where the double bonds can form and what resonance structures they give?You understand that resonance is just a way to represent something right? The most accurate representation is actually a superposition of all the resonance structures you can draw for the molecule. There aren't actually single and double bonds in that molecule. All the bonds in aromatic compounds are the same length, between the length of a single and double bond. This has been measured by X-ray crystallography amongst other things. Just wanted to make sure that's clear.  If I understand you correctly, you aren't actually asking about the structure of the molecules, you want to know about the pattern. My guess is going to be yes, there probably is a way to model just the pictures. It's possible that it's a fairly simple problem to solve, if you know how to program. You just need to give the computer all the restraints (like no five bonded carbons etc.). I don't know how to program though. There's probably even fields of mathematics that deal with this. You get all sorts of weird algebras, and knot theory and topology. My sister is just learning about an emerging field where you do data analysis by looking for shapes in the data. I'm not smart enough for that kind of math. I'm just a chemist. 127 Views
