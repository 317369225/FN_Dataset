What is number of graphs you can have on n (n is even) vertices where degree of each vertex can only be 1?If we assume undirected graphs, then we need to find the number of different ways we can pair up n=2k,k∈n  n=2k,k∈n vertices. Analogously, let's say we have a class of n=2k,k∈n  n=2k,k∈n students, and we want to find the number of ways we can pair them up to do a pair project. The answer would be (2k)!(2!) k .k!   (2k)!(2!)k.k! . For example, if we have 4 vertices v 1 ,v 2 ,v 3 ,v 4   v1,v2,v3,v4 , we can pair them up in 3 ways - [(v 1 ,v 2 ),(v 3 ,v 4 )  [(v1,v2),(v3,v4) ], [(v 1 ,v 3 ),(v 2 ,v 4 )]  [(v1,v3),(v2,v4)] and [(v 1 ,v 4 ),(v 2 ,v 3 )]  [(v1,v4),(v2,v3)] . Since the order of vertices in each pair does not matter (i.e. (v 1 ,v 2 )  (v1,v2) is the same as (v 2 ,v 1 )  (v2,v1) ), we need to divide k  k times by a factor of 2!  2! , and the order of the pairs does not matter, so we also need to divide by k!  k! (i.e. [(v 1 ,v 2 ),(v 3 ,v 4 )]  [(v1,v2),(v3,v4)] is the same as [(v 3 ,v 4 ),(v 1 ,v 2 )]  [(v3,v4),(v1,v2)] ). There is also an inductive proof for this formula which I have written about in this answer. What is the story proof for (2n)!2 n n! =(2n−1)(2n−3)…3⋅1  (2n)!2nn!=(2n−1)(2n−3)…3⋅1 ? If we assume directed graphs, then the order of the vertices in the pairs will matter, so the answer would be (2k)!k!   (2k)!k! . 85 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Nishant Verma
