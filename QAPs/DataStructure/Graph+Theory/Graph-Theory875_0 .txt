Is there any difference or advantages or disadvantages between Kosaraju's algorithm and Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected component? Which one is most useful?Well, the answer differs on what you mean by the word "most useful". If you mean which one is most useful in finding SCCs, then you can't do such a comparison. Both solves the same problem with pretty much the same time complexity. Talking about which one is easier to write will not be an answer to your question so, I will skip talking about this. What I will say is that for an algorithm to be useful, it should teach you something that has nothing to do with the problem that it is solving. Tarjan's algorithm idea should teach you something about using the idea of the using the time stamp of visiting the nodes of a graph and the start time of the entering a loop inside the graph, how that should be useful and train you mind of using them in problems. On the other side, Kosaraju's algorithm idea should teach you how to play with bigger modules as is. The graph itself as a module and the DFS as another module and trains your mind with another way of solving problems. So, in my opinion, you should know both very well. 585 Views  View Upvotes
