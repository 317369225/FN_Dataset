How can I find the minimum cut between two arbitrary vertices given as input for an undirected unweighted graph?I have an undirected weighted graph and I need to find the minimum cut that separates two sets of vertices. I can modify my setup so as to reduce the problem to finding the minimum cut that separates two given vertices. Weights are positive and fractional. The Stoerâ€“Wagner algorithm comes close.Please add some clarifications to the question. So far it sounds exactly like Ford-Fulkerson theorem, and I do not see why you do not want to use its strong statement directly. You can make a flow network with one vertex as input and another - as output. Then you can run any type of Ford-Fulkerson-based max-flow algo, and use its duality with minimal cut. I believe I missed some point, because this seems quite obvious and I feel that I just missed something out with your question. 106 Views  View Upvotes
