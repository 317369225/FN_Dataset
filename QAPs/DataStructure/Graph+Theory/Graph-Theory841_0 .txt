How do I show that Kruskal's algorithm returns a spanning tree?I know how to show that it has no cycles, but how do I show it is not connected?You have n  n nodes and you add n−1  n−1 edges between those nodes. Since you don't have any cycles also, the graph must be connected. Let's prove this. We will prove this by contradiction. Let us assume that we have a graph G  G with n  n nodes and n−1  n−1 edges with no cycles, and G  G is not connected. Now, let's split up the graph G  G into the m  m connected components (1<m<n  1<m<n ), G 1   G1 , G 2   G2 , G 3   G3 , till G m   Gm . Each of these subgraphs have n 1   n1 nodes, n 2   n2 nodes, n 3   n3 nodes, till n m   nm , respectively. So, we know that n 1 +n 2 +n 3 +⋯+n m =n  n1+n2+n3+⋯+nm=n . And since each of the subgraphs G 1   G1 , G 2   G2 , G 3   G3 , . . ., G m   Gm are connected and have no cycles (meaning they are trees), they each have n 1 −1  n1−1 , n 2 −1  n2−1 , n 3 −1  n3−1 , . . ., n m −1  nm−1 edges, respectively. So adding all these up, we see that n 1 −1+n 2 −1+n 3 −1+⋯+n m =n−m  n1−1+n2−1+n3−1+⋯+nm=n−m since there are m  m number of connected components. But we know that m>1  m>1 , so n 1 −1+n 2 −1+n 3 −1+⋯+n m <n−1  n1−1+n2−1+n3−1+⋯+nm<n−1 . Thus, we have a contradiction. G  G must be connected if there are n  n nodes, n−1  n−1 edges between those nodes, and no cycles. So we have shown that Kruskal's algorithm must return a spanning tree. Hope this helps!
