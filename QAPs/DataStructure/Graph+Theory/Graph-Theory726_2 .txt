What is the difference between Tree & spanning tree?A regular tree is a tree that may or may not have nodes; however, spanning tree is a subgraph that has all the vertices that are there in the graph, and is a tree. The spanning tree has the same vertex as the original graph. A graph may have numerous spanning trees. Different spanning trees have different lengths, and so, finding the minimum spanning tree can be a task. Also, in a spanning tree, some edges of the graph are deleted whereas some are preserved. There are quite a few algorithms that identify the minimum spanning tree. A spanning tree protocol prevents formation of loop when switches/bridges are interconnected.
