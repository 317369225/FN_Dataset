Is the total distance and total displacement in a time graph the same?Is the formula to find total distance and total displacement in a linear motion graph the same? (It's a velocity - time graph)Yes definitely area under velocity time graph gives you distance and displacement both. But there is a little trick to that. If your v-t curve lies above +x axis, it implies throught out the journey of object its velocity is positive means it has not changed the direction of its motion and hence distance and displacement will be equal and are given by area under the curve. However if the curve cuts the x- axis implying that the velocity has gone to a negative value that means particle has changed the direction of motion and hence distance and displacement will be different and will be given by area under v-t curve. Attached picture will give you the way to calculate these values in this case. Upvote if it helped you. Thanks. 20 Views  View Upvotes
