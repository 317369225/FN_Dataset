How should I practice bar graph for CAT?When these questions are not provided with perfect values how should I assume the values? Say, if the bar’s height is between 200 to 250 which value should I take? Is there any way to follow?Thanks for the A2A. Bar graph are quite easy to understand and there are commonly asked questions in a bar graph set. When the exact figures are not given, depending on the interval, you will have to estimate the value. So if the interval is 200–400 and the bar ends somewhere in the middle, take it as 300. If the interval is 200–500 and the bar ends very close to 200 and you can estimate that it is about 20% of the interval, take it as 260 (200+20% of interval). A good question setter will always make sure that there is no ambiguity in the set. I will take an example to show the kind of questions that are commonly asked and how to quickly answer those: 1. What is the percentage increase in rice production from 2014 to 2015: To solve this, just look at 2014 and 2015 rice figures. They are 600 and 950 respectively. So 350/600 = 7/12 = 58.33% 2. What is the percentage decrease in sugar production from 2012 to 2013: To solve this, look at 2012 and 2013 figures. They are 550 and 450 respectively. So 100/550 = 2/11 = 18.18% To solve percentage increase decrease question, you must remember 1–15 reciprocals and percentage equivalents. It helps you calculate and approximate faster. 3. What is the average sugar production? This can be solved in two ways. One is visually, which will give you approx answer. Here, as 4 values are less than 600 and one is 950, the average will be close to 600. So if you have options for this question, look for a value close to 600. If you want to calculate exact answer, there are again two ways. Take either the exact absolute values (550 + 450 + 550 + 550 + 950) = 3050/5 = 610 or consider number of steps. So 550 is 5.5 steps, 450 is 4.5 steps, 550 is 5.5 steps and the summation of all the steps will be 30.5/5 =6.1 steps and 1 step = 100 so answer will be 610. Other commonly asked questions are ratios between two quantities, CAGR or SAGR, average comparison, percentage comparison, true-false, etc. All the best! P.S.
