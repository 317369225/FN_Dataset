How can I choose 5 of my Twitter friends in a way that maximizes the number of distinct followers they have?Assuming that I have an array of twitter users and their followers, and I want to identify 5 users who have the most number of unqiue followers such that if I ask them to retweet an advertisement for my product, it would reach the most number of users.Yes, the generalized version of the problem is called the Maximum coverage problem. Namely, given a collection of N sets, find the K sets whose union, make up the largest subset of the union of all N sets. This is an NP-Hard problem, so you are better of trying to find an approximate solution. That said, if you need an exact solution, hopefully you don't have too many twitter "friends". 268 Views  View Upvotes
