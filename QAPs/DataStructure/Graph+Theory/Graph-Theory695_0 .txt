Is a pentagram star an example of a complete graph?Hi, no! because you can find 2 nodes that don't have an edge between them. For being a complete graph every two nodes should be directly connected. You can also verify this by counting the number of edges. For an N node graph you should have (N choose 2) edges which is 10 edges for a graph with 5 nodes (like pentagram) 85 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Chris Purrone
