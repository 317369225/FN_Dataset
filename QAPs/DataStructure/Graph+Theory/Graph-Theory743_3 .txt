What do the matrices represent in the following pictures?Thank you very much,I am learning R language by myself right now,and now I feel it's a little difficult for me... Is there any good books for beginners? Thank you very much!The matrices show if vertices are connected with an edge on the corresponding graph. Column and row numbers usually start at 0. So for instance, let's take a generic matrix M with two rows and two columns. The element on the upper left corner could be referred to as M00 M00 , because it is on row 0, column 0. Now, in your given examples we have vertices named V0,V1,... V0,V1,... and the subscripts are used for their positions on the matrices A1 A1 and A2 A2 In A1 A1 we have 1 at position row 0, column 1. What this means is, that vertice V0 V0 is connected with V1. V1. You can easily check this with the other elements of the matrix and comparing it with the graph. In directed graphs, a 1 only shows up at positions, where there is an edge pointing from one vertice to another. Notice that in A2 A2 there is a 1 at row 4, column 3, but not at row 3, column 4. 142 Views
