What is the concept of an infinite loop (in programming) in graph theory?I believe recursivity has a role to play, but I am not sure. Also, does Turing completeness and transitive closure have anything to do? Thanks.Consider the following graph: ​ When you traverse from A to Loop, you get stuck in a state where no progress is possible, as there is no transition to another state. That constitutes one kind of infinite loop. It is simple to work towards more complex/elaborate cases, where you get stuck in a subgraph G' contained in a graph G. As a matter of fact, Loop could be a subgraph. I lack the proficiency to show you a formal proof, so I will stop here. 178 Views · View Upvotes
