How do I graph y=113x y=113x ?We take this opportunity to expand upon the succinct answer provided by Alex Pinto. Our approach should simplify things greatly for students and anyone else who needs to make such plots, while simultaneously inciting teachers to tear their hair out, or at least the good ones to realise that they need to lift their game in casually throwing such routine tasks at students. Either interpretation (y=113 x  y=113x or y=113x   y=113x ) yields a plot that is symmetrical about the origin. The former is a straight line similar to y=x  y=x but at a different scale; the latter is a hyperbola similar to y=1/x  y=1/x but at a different scale. Our recommendation is to draw exactly the plots for y=x  y=x or y=1/x  y=1/x , and then simply change the scale on the axes. Instead of 1 unit along the x-axis, just put 13. Done correctly, this should generate a series of almost-identical plots on any tedious page of exercises, showing exactly how valuable endless reams of such exercises are — not very! (Others have suggested plotting points — yes, that is how to get a computer to do the work for you.) 190 Views
