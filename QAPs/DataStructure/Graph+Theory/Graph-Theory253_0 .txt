Why doesn't Quora show a popup graph of views (like the Stats graph) for an individual answer when you hover over number of views under the author?I would guess primarily because there isn't the demand for it, but also Quora is about the answers and finding helpful advice rather than the popularity of the author. You can find those stats if you want, but I think most people care more about how useful the advice is. Upvotes show support from others (many of them potential answerers themselves). 94 Views  View Upvotes
