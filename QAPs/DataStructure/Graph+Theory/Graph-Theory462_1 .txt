What graph goes negative against x-axis?One that starts at let’s say, 1,9 and only goes negative to the x-axis. What is it called? What would the Equation look like? Thank you.y=-e^x is asymptotic to the x axis as x increases without bound and negative. But I’m not certain if that’s what you mean. y=-e^x is defined for all real numbers so it doesn’t “start” at 1 or at 9. Maybe draw the graph you have in mind and post a photo. 13 Views
