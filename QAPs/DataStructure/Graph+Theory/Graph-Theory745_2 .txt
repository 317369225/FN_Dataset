MS CS: Machine Learning or Graph Algorithm, Which course should I select?It will totally depend on what you want to pursue on a long term career. I personally have more interest in machine learning. You can always look at the course content and decide what interests you more cause both of those courses will have great benefits of their own. At some point they may have some common topics as well. My advice will be to learn about the course content and talk to the professors too. Hope my answer leads to any direction for you. Good luck. 363 Views  View Upvotes
