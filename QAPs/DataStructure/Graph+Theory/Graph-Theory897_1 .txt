How can I choose 5 of my Twitter friends in a way that maximizes the number of distinct followers they have?Assuming that I have an array of twitter users and their followers, and I want to identify 5 users who have the most number of unqiue followers such that if I ask them to retweet an advertisement for my product, it would reach the most number of users.I'm assuming that the greatest number of unique followers means the fewest shared followers of all of your friends' followers. If that's not what you mean by unique, then please rephrase to clarify. Here's how I'd solve it off the cuff in shitty pseudocode/Java/whatever the fuck. A thorough explanation is below. Followers is a 2D array containing your friends and their followers. func mostUnique(int[][] followers){  int[] uniqueFollowers = int[followers.length];  Hashmap uniqueTable = new Hashmap(); // however the hell this is done  for(int i=0;i<followers.length;i++){  for(int j=0;j<followers[i].length;j++){  if(followers[i][j] is in uniqueTable && uniqueTable.get(followers[i][j]) != -1){ uniqueFollowers[uniqueTable.get(followers[i][j])]--;  uniqueTable.set(followers[i][j], -1);  }else if(followers[i][j] is not in uniqueTable){  uniqueTable.add(followers[i][j], i);  uniqueFollowers[i]++;  }  }  }  return the indices of the highest 5 values of uniqueFollowers;  } I may have made a slip up or something, not sure. Actually kind of a cool problem. It goes through every follower's follower, as you have to check all of them. It maintains an array with the number of unique followers. Basically what you want to do is tell if something's unique. But I didn't want to have to make more passes over the entire thing, which I think would make it maybe O(N^4) instead of O(N^2) time, but don't quote me on it. So I have it use a hashmap that can retroactively unflag a follower as unique if it discovers the same follower later in the list of friends. Beyond that it just needs to know if it's in the list, so it sets it to -1 so it just won't decrement the original duplicate too many times; you just need to get rid of it once. Then obviously it adds it; if it's not in the map, then just add it to the hashmap for the first time and increment the unique followers count. I didn't do anything fancy with getting the top 5, but since they're added one at a time, you could probably figure something out managing another list and adding them to one end or the other to be more efficient and not require a sort.
