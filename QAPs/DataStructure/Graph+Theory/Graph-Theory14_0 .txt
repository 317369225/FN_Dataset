What is the equation of a sinusoidal graph having minimum point at (0,3) and intersects the mid line at (5π,5)?I got -2cos(1/10x) +5 which is obviously wrong as I checked in GeoGebra.Start with graph of y=cosx  x Amplitude is 2 so y=2cosx  y=2cosx Minimum value is shifted from -2 to 3. That's a vertical shift of 5 units. So y=5+2cosx  y=5+2cosx Minimum point should occur at (0,3).  (0,3). The above equation has a minimum at (π,3)  (π,3) so shift it π  π units to the left. This gives y=5+2cos(x+π)  y=5+2cos(x+π) Graph should intersect middle line at (5π,5).  5π,5). So 5+2cos(ax+π)=5  5+2cos(ax+π)=5 . cos(ax+π)=0  cos(ax+π)=0 . 5aπ+π=π2   5aπ+π=π2 . a=−110   =−110 cos(ax+π)=−cos(ax)  cos(ax+π)=−cos(ax) Our final equation is therefore y=5−2cos(x10 )  y=5−2cos(x10) 83 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Usman Khan
