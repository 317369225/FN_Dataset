What is the best way to implement a graph that represent a subway network?What is the most efficient way to store the graph ? The graph as to be oriented cause their is a few case were the edge are not bidirectionnel... Excepte this, it is very dense...what is the best way to implement this in c++?The most straightforward way to do this would be with an Adjacency Matrix. Entry (i,j) (i,j) would be set to 1 if there i i is connected to j j , and 0 otherwise. There are plenty of options for implementing this. The easiest would be to use a two dimensional array and set the value of adjMat[i][j] accordingly. However, unless your graph is close to complete (which I doubt it is), you will "waste" a lot of memory on entries that are just 0. You can cut down on memory waste by using a Sparse Matrix like this one provided by boost. Otherwise you could simply use a hash map like the std::unordered_map provided by STL. The keys would be the positive (i,j) (i,j) tuples (ie the tuples representing a connection) and the value for each key would just be 1. When you query the map for tuples which have not been entered, the default int value of 0 will be returned, providing the required behavior. 91 Views
