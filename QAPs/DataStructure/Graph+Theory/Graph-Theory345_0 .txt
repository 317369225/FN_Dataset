Is there any better way to find complement of graph with complexity better than O(n^2)?No. You have to look at every edge at least once, which means you have to traverse the entire Adjacency list to create the complement. So it takes O(m+n) time. The worst case is still O(n^2). EDIT : The lower bound to build an adjacency list of the complement graph is O(n^2). That is irrespective of the order of number of edges(m). You will need O(n^2) time to build the adjacency list. 45 Views  View Upvotes
