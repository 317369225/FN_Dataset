How can I sort 64 children (35b,29g) into two classes so the number of friendships is maximised?I have 64 children (35 boys, 29 girls) to sort into two classes. I need to balance the number of boys and girls, so half the boys are in each class. I ask each child to nominate 3 friends. Is there any programmatic way to sort these children so the number of friendships in each class is maximised?I am fairly sure this is at least an NP computational problem! Unfortunately I can not remember the name of this one (if someone could comment it this would be interesting, it was something similar to this, in which you must invite guests to a party, minimising enemies). If someone could provide an efficient algorithm for this, they would have just displayed that N=NP, claim your 1 million millennium prize! (but contact me first please). 79 Views
