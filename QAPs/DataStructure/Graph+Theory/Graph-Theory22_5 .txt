In an undirected graph, what is the degree of a vertex with a self-loop?My professor said the degree would be 2. But I don’t see how. I can understand that a single vertex has degree of 0. But when that vertex connects to itself, shouldn’t it be degree of 1?Think this as each edge has 2 degrees. If an edge is between two vertex then both vertex have degree of one. Now see that edge loop back to itself thats how a loop has two degree. degree is not dependent on vertex but on edges. 85 Views  View Upvotes
