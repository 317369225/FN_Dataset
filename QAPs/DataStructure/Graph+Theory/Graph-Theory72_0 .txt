What would a graph for cos3x look like?So the standard cosine graph has a value of 1 at 0 radians, a value of 0 at (pi/2) radians, a value of -1 at pi radians, a value of 0 at (3 pi/2) radians and a value of 1 at 2 pi radians. This pattern continues, a value of 0 at (5 pi/2) radians, a value of -1 at 3 pi, a value of 0 at (7 pi/2) and a value of 1 at 4 pi. Notice how the value changes by +/- 1 every pi/2 radians. When you change from the standard cosine graph, cos x, to the new graph, cos 3x, the period is divided by 3. So now cosine 3x has a value of 1 at 0 radians, a value of 0 at (pi/6) a value of -1 at (pi/3), a value of 0 at (pi/2), a value of 1 at (2 pi/3), a value of 0 at (5 pi/6), a value of -1 at pi, a value of (7 pi/6) and so on where the value now changes by +/- 1 every 1/3 times pi/2 or every pi/6 radians. 42 Views
