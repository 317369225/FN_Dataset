Can a graph have two tangents at a given point?We are doing calculus (highschool) level and I’m wondering if a graph can have two tangents. I worked out, x^2+2, and the tangents, 6x+3 and 5x+2 (through algebra/geometry) do intersect at -1,-3, however do both or even one of the straight lines qualify as a tangent ?If a function is “smooth” meaning that it is differentiable at a point then it can have only one tangent line at that point and the gradient of that tangent is equal to the derivative of the function. Although the 2 lines you mention intersect at (−1,3)  (−1,3) , if you solve the equations x 2 +2=6x+3  x2+2=6x+3 and x 2 +2=5x+2  x2+2=5x+2 you will find that both lines cross the function at two points. Thus, by definition, they are not tangent lines. 115 Views · View Upvotes
