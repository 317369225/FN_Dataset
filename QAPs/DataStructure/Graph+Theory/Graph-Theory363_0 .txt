What is a scatter plot graph? How you elaborate one?A scatter plot graph is one in which you only put dots on your graph for each answer. You do not try to connect the lines in any way. Let’s say that you want to see what the noon time temperatures were for the next few weeks. At noon each day, you would check the temperature, then on a graph, you would find that day’s date across the bottom of the graph and put a dot above that date, level with the temperature you observed. It is also possible that you could make a scatter plot that might have more dots in one column. For example, you might make a scatter plot showing how much allowance each person at your school receives. For that plot, you might have ages below the x-axis and various dollar amounts to the left of the Y-axis. Then for each answer, you would put a dot where the column (age) and row (allowance) intersect. You could also use blue dots for boys in your class and red dots for girls in your class. Whatever your scatter plot is used to document, you might use a paragraph or more to explain what you observed, and possible to explain the outlier answers, the data that does not seem to fit in with the rest. For example, you might feel the need to explain that it rained on a day where the noon temperature was too low, or mention the income levels of the parents where an allowance was way too high or non-existent. Of course, your teacher might mean something different regarding elaborating on a graph, but to me, it means some kind of explanation, including how you came up with the idea, how you got your data, and what you think the data means. Good luck with your scatter plot. And if you’re looking for an idea for such a graph, you might ask adults around your community for how much they got as an allowance at age ten, and what year that was, then plot allowance year and amount for your two axes. Have fun with whatever you decide to use as your subject. 37 Views
