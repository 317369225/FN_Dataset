How did you learn graph theory from scratch?I learned Graph Theory purely out of interest. Abstract and generic things have always fascinated me. My major was actually Physics, but Mathematics has been my real fascination. I like the application of Algebra to subjects, and Graph Theory is no exception. Here are my subjects of interest (in Graph Theory): 1) Graph Theory (As a subject in its own right) 2) Spectral Graph Theory (Laplacians, Linear Algebra) 3) Extremal Graph Theory (A subset of Extremal Combinatorics) Here are the books I've used, I hope they are of help: a) A First Course in Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics): Gary Chartrand, Ping Zhang: 9780486483689: Amazon.com: Books b) https://courses.engr.illinois.ed... c) Extremal Combinatorics - With Applications in Computer Science | Stasys Jukna | Springer I just realized I didn't actually tell you the order in which I learned. Well, I first did Zhang & Chartrand's book, with the problems. The problems were very nice. I then headed for Spectral Graph Theory, after seeing a talk by Nikhil Srivastava (who was a student of the legendary Dan Speilman, and recently solved the Kadison-Singer conjecture). I was able to use Prof. Kolla's slides with the occasional google-ing for that, as I was quite familiar with Linear Algebra. I'm studying Extremal Combinatorics when I get time these days, and I'm also using Diestel's book on Graph Theory. But, I'd say this is all Graduate (Masters) level work. Start from the basics. Start with Chartrand & Zhang. =] If you have any more questions, I'll be happy to answer. 602 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Shubham Marathia
