Why should we use a recursion stack in spite of a visited boolean array when we determine cycle in a graph(directed/undirected)?Using Boolean array for determining cycle, works only with undirected graph. This is because if we visit a node twice in an undirected graph, we can be sure that the graph is cyclic. A directed graph, requires use of stack. Take for example: visited array initially: 0 0 0 0 visit A: 1 0 0 0 visit B: 1 1 0 0 visit D: 1 1 0 1 Traceback D -> B -> A visit C: 1 1 1 1 visit D: Now D has been visited before so the algorithm will declare the graph to be cylic, but the graph clearly is not cyclic. 109 Views  View Upvotes
