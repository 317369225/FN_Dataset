Can a graph have two tangents at a given point?We are doing calculus (highschool) level and I’m wondering if a graph can have two tangents. I worked out, x^2+2, and the tangents, 6x+3 and 5x+2 (through algebra/geometry) do intersect at -1,-3, however do both or even one of the straight lines qualify as a tangent ?Hopefully you learned about tangents in geometry. There are lines that don’t touch a circle at all, there are lines that touch the circle twice which are called secants, and finally, there are lines that touch the circle once which are called tangents. With a circle, there is exactly one tangent at a given point. Sure, there are other lines that intersect that point, but only one of them touches it exactly once. Only one of them intersects without going inside the circle. The broader definition of tangents for curves other than circles is similar. Basically, at the local level, the line touches the curve at the point of tangency, but doesn’t cross over it. Edit: Steve Ryan correctly pointed out that in calculus the definition is more rigorous than what is described here, and on occasion you will see a tangent line pass through the curve locally. But the geometric definition will suffice to get you the intuition. With this definition, there’s only one line that is tangent to a curve at a given point on the curve. Here’s an example, take the graph y=x 2   y=x2 . There are several lines that can be drawn through the point (1,1), but the only one that doesn’t pass through the curve locally (or in this case, at all) is y = 2x - 1. Here’s come other lines for comparison: You’ll notice, these lines all cross over the curve when they touch. These lines aren’t tangent lines. 583 Views · View Upvotes
