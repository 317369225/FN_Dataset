Where can I find a directed graph data structure library, implemented in Javascript?The details for the question are not entirely specific, but I will try to answer. The best way to hold a directed graph is either an adjacency list, an adjacency matrix, or an edge list. We will use the below graph as an example: (Source: File:Directed acyclic graph 2.svg) Adjacency list: For every node, an array holds the neighbors of that node. In a directed graph, it would just be all the nodes that are adjacent to the current node (pointing from current to adjacent). For the above graph the adjacency list would look like the following: Node -- [Its Neighbors] 2: [ ] 3: [8,10] 5: [11] 7: [8,11] 8: [9] 9: [ ] 10: [ ] 11: [2,9,10] Adjacency matrix: This is a matrix of size N by N (where N is the number of nodes) and the value at (i,j) is 1 if there is a path going from i -> j and 0 if not. We can see (3,10) is 1 because there is a path from node 3 -> node 10. Finally, Edge list: this is an array of pairs of integers (a,b) which denote an edge from a -> b. An example is: { [3,8], [3,10], [5,11], [7,8], [7,11], [8,9], [11,2], [11,9], [11,10] } You can read up on the implementation of these (in JavaScript) here: Data Structures in JavaScript and a Github project here: chenglou/data-structures Good luck! And if you need help understanding the concepts, you can just comment below or PM me. 1.2k Views  View Upvotes
