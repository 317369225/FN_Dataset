Is there any way to represent the degree matrix with the adjacency matrix?As we all know, given a graph, the laplacian matrix is defined as L = D - A, where D is the degree matrix, A is the adjacency. I was wondering can we construct a few matrix operations to represent D with A, e.g., D = XAY. Then define the laplacian matrix with only the adjacency matrix.Yes. Let G=(V,E)  G=(V,E) be a undirected, simple graph over n  n vertices and m  m edges. Define x∈R n   x∈Rn to be a mapping from the vertex set to the reals, i.e. x:V→R  x:V→R .  Now let us consider the linear operator   A:R n →R n   A:Rn→Rn over the binary field 0,1  0,1 . When we apply A  A to x  x , the resulting value at a vertex a  a is the sum of the values of the function x  x over all the neighbors, b  b , of a  a .  Hence the action of the operator A  A on x  x at a  a can be captured as (Ax)(a)=∑ b:ab∈E(G) x(b).  (Ax)(a)=∑b:ab∈E(G)x(b). We refer to A  A as the adjacency matrix of G  G . It is usually defined as: A ij =  Aij= 1,  1,   if  ij∈E(G)  ij∈E(G) 0,  0, otherwise. Now, one may write the degree matrix as: D ii =diag(d i )  Dii=diag(di) where d i =−∑ j=1,j≠i A ij .  di=−∑j=1,j≠iAij. Meaning that every diagonal entry of D  D is equal to a row sum of the equivalent row of the corresponding adjacency matrix. 285 Views · View Upvotes
