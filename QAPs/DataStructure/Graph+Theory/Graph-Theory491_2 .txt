Where can I find NP complete real world problems in graph theory to create heuristics?I have to choose a NP complete problem to create a heuristic for my graph theory assignment and I donâ€™t know where can I look for, can someone indicate some interesting problem to work on?Applications of the graph coloring problem in register allocation. Optimal register allocation reduces to graph coloring, but in practice, compilers use heuristics to solve this problem in a suboptimal way. 75 Views  View Upvotes
