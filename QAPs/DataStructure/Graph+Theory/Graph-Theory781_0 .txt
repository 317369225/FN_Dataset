What would I lose by not doing graphing exercises in my Grade 12 math course?I know the general shapes of all the functions I graph and the graphing exercises only differ in coefficients. As I'm homeschooled, I can decide what exercises I do for myself. Will I miss any skills beneficial for university if I stopped practicing the graphing exercises?Graphing is a very important part of mathematics, and there are many different types to be encountered in your mathematical education. There are various techniques which must be mastered or you will surely experience difficulties down the road . The graphs that you will come across are from algebra, calculus , geometry, trigonometry and statistics , and should be mastered. There are also graphical calculators which can help you check your working, and are well worth getting. 13 Views
