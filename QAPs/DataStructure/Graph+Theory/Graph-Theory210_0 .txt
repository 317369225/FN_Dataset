When we remove an edge from a tree it seems obvious that we are left with two trees, but how would we go about proving this?Why aren't we left with 3+ trees?Imagine you start with n  n isolated vertices = n  n connected components. Now, one by one, add all edges of the original tree except for the one you want to remove. As there were no cycles in the original tree, adding each edge connects two components into one. Thus, after adding all n−2  n−2 edges we must be left with exactly two connected components. 1k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Adamo Carolli
