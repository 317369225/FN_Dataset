How can I find the correct adjacency matrix given a particular graph?Yes, its definitely correct. Adjacency matrix is a square matrix(say A) having rows and columns equal to the number of nodes in the graph, and is used to represent finite graph. If there is an edge from node i to node j in the graph, then elementA[ij] A[ij] of the matrixA matrixA is 1 else it is 0. And given that, it is an undirected graph, the adjacency relation is symmetric i.e., if node i is adjacent to node j, then node j will also be adjacent to node i. 73 Views  View Upvotes
