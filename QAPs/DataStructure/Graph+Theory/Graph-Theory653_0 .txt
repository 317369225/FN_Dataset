Where can I find good problems on graphs to get clarity on graph concepts?I did most of the proof problems from Chartrand & Zhang's book. It's a great book in that it's accessible, and yet, as it goes on, it covers most of the fundamentals of Graph Theory and leaves you at a place where you can dig deep into some of the more advanced topics : A First Course in Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics): Gary Chartrand, Ping Zhang: 9780486483689: Amazon.com: Books For more advanced Graph Theory, I use: i) Algebraic Graph Theory (Graduate Texts in Mathematics): Chris Godsil, Gordon F. Royle: 9780387952208: Amazon.com: Books ii) Topological Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics): Jonathan L. Gross, Thomas W. Tucker, Mathematics: 9780486417417: Amazon.com: Books Solve Chartrand & Zhang, and you'll be good to go wherever you want with a bit of Linear Algebra + Topology. I also use a book on Extremal Combinatorics to study Matching Problems and Algorithms, as they are a part of Extremal Graph Theory : Extremal Combinatorics: With Applications in Computer Science (Texts in Theoretical Computer Science. An EATCS Series): Stasys Jukna: 9783642173639: Amazon.com: Books 274 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Suryavamsi Tenneti
