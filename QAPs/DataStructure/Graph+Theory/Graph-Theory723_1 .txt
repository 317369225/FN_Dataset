How can you find the horizontal translation of a sine graph, given a data table?How would I find the value of c, in T=asin(b(t-c))+d?They annoyingly start time at 1 instead of 0, so t=1  t=1 means Jan, t=2  t=2 Feb, etc.   They're also being vague about whether t=1  t=1 means the start or the middle of January; let's assume the middle. Anyway, this is a yearly temperature chart, so presumably the period of the sine wave is 1 year, or 12 months.  The sine argument has to traverse 2π  2π over this period, so we see b=2π12 =π6   b=2π12=π6 . The sine function has its maximum at 90 ∘ =π2   90∘=π2 and minimum at −90 ∘ =−π2   −90∘=−π2 .  The table has the minimum in Feb=2 and maximum in July=7, 5 or 7 months apart instead of the expected 6.  We're not supposed to use technology here, so we could just say min in Jan=1, max in July=7 and go.  Let's try to be slightly more accurate by eyeballing the average of every pair of adjacent months, giving a tie for min at Jan/Feb (t=1.5  t=1.5 by my assumption at the start) and Feb/Mar (t=2.5  t=2.5 ) and a max at July/Aug(t=7.5  t=7.5 ).   So let's just go for min at t=1.5  t=1.5 and max at t=7.5  7.5 and not fret further. We know b(t−c)=π2   b(t−c)=π2 at the max, so c=t−π2b =7.5−π2π/6 =4.5  c=t−π2b=7.5−π2π/6=4.5 .   Checking t=1.5,b(t−c)=π6 (1.5−4.5)=−π2   t=1.5,b(t−c)=π6(1.5−4.5)=−π2 , the min point as expected  ✓   ✓ . We might as well finish the problem.  The range of the data goes from 14 to 27 and the range of sin goes from -1 to 1, so  (−1)a+d=14  (−1)a+d=14 and (1)a+d=27.  (1)a+d=27.   Adding, 2d=41  2d=41 or d=20.5  d=20.5 , so a=6.5  a=6.5 .  Putting it all together: T=6.5sin(π6 (t−4.5))+20.5  T=6.5sin⁡(π6(t−4.5))+20.5 Recreating the table from the formula, we get Jan  t=1  T=14.2  t=1  T=14.2 Feb t=2  T=14.2  t=2  T=14.2 Mar t=3  T=15.9  t=3  T=15.9 Apr t=4  T=18.8  t=4  T=18.8 May t=5  T=22.2  t=5  T=22.2 Jun t=6  T=25.1  t=6  T=25.1 Jul t=7  T=26.8  t=7  T=26.8 Aug t=8  T=26.8  t=8  T=26.8 Sep t=9  T=25.1  t=9  T=25.1 Oct t=10  T=22.2  t=10  T=22.2 Nov t=11  T=18.8  t=11  T=18.8 Dec t=12  T=15.9  t=12  T=15.9 It seems biased a bit high, but pretty good given no technology, so I'll leave it. 194 Views · View Upvotes
