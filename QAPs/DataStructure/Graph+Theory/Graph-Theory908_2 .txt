If you own a business and have a customer list (first/last name), what would be the most useful data about these customers to help grow your business?These are by far the most important questions you should be getting the answers to: How often they need what you sell, whether they'd prefer to save time, energy, or money on fulfilling the need your offerings fulfill, and how much they're willing to pay for said offerings. Lastly, an email address so that you can: remind them about your offerings as often as they need your stuff, Tell them when/how you've innovated to accommodate their time, money, energy requests Hope this helps! 234 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
