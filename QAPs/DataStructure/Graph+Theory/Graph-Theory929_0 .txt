What algorithms are used by Google Maps to make route finding so fast?It's unlikely to have one single implementation of an algorithm in a very competitive product like Google Maps to find Point B from Point A. As I mentioned here in this answer (What algorithms are used by map services to find directions?), there won't be a source to confirm what algorithm is being used. However, it's not a secret either to explore and find a feasible algorithm for shortest path problem. While to make the product respond well to different cases and cover bigger range of areas, there might be a hybrid implementation of graph algorithms. I listed few of them in the mentioned answer such as A* and Floyd-Warshall or Jump Point Search. Some of these algorithms can perform almost better with a little bit of help and smart heuristics. This is a toy test case, but using a tool like PathFinding.js , can tell you a lot about the nature of Dijkstra or A* with heuristics and how they behave.
