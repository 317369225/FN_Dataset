In an undirected graph, can an isolated node be considered a cycle?An isolated node can only be considered a cycle if you allow the degenerate case of cycles with no edges. This is usually not particularly interesting, because at that point, all nodes are part of at least one cycle: the cycle of just that node. The only circumstance where I might consider this useful is if you’re generating a mapping from nodes to the largest cycles they are part of, in which case being able to express the single-node cycle as part of that valid output may make further transformations easier. 55 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
