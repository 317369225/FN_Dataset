Where do I start (from basic calculus) to understand/practice basic graph theory?There are so many applications to graph theory that it can be quite overwhelming to any student. The thing to remember is that graphs are composed of paths, nodes, branches that decompose to specific algorithms to solve complex problems. In other words, graphs in essence are pictorial representations to problem solving; especially in the domain of solving problems in electrical circuit network analysis. 37 Views
