What are some good resources to look at to learn more about graph theory, specifically for computer science applications?I'm taking an introductory algorithms and data structures class. I'm finding graphs (and their applications) very interesting. Where should I look if I'm interested in the CS-side of graph theory (as opposed to more rigorous mathematical theory of graphs)?Your best shot may be Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al. It is mathematically precise and favors algorithms over proofs. Below I suggest some alternatives that are either math-heavy or CS-heavy. There is a very good book by Adrian Bondy and U.S.R. Murty, Graph Theory (Graduate Texts in Mathematics): Adrian Bondy, U.S.R. Murty: 9781846289699: Amazon.com: Books. Beware, it’s from Springer’s Graduate Texts in Mathematics series, but I’ve found the book to be awesome. It talks extensively about algorithms, but at the same time it’s heavy on proofs (proving the algorithm correct, etc.). A less CS-oriented book is Graph Theory by Reinhard Diestel. It’s a very good book, also graduate text in math, and the exercises can be extremely challenging. I used Diestel book to study for a graduate graph theory class that covered proofs of Menger’s theorem, Brooks’ theorem, discussed perfect graph theorem (didn’t prove it), covered a bit of the probabilistic method, etc. The book was extremely useful, but I have to admit that very many of the exercises I wasn’t able to solve in reasonable time. For a very CS-centric view of the subject I recommend Robert Sedgewick’s book Algorithms. (See also book website: Graphs.) It provides implementations of all the algorithms it covers. 131 Views
