Why don't we use a stack in breadth first search (BFS)?Just as the name suggested, BFS starts from a node and explores it’s neighbor nodes first, then next level and next level until all vertex are visited. Using a queue, you can fetch vertex level by level, that’s the point. Try to visualize the algorithm on Graph Traversal (Depth/Breadth First Search) step by step, you’ll have a deep understanding for these algorithms. 149 Views
