For a basic graph, what does the degree sequence of that graph means? And does it change if the graph was directed graph or undirected?I’m literally para-phrasing from my post for this answer : Let me now introduce the Degree-Sequence of a Graph : - Given G=(V,E)  G=(V,E) , a Graph has a sequence s G   sG = deg(v 1 ),…,deg(v n )  deg(v1),…,deg(vn) One can reverse-sort this sequence. A simple Theorem that helps validate whether a Degree-Sequence represents a Graph is : Th m   Thm : A non-increasing sequence s  s : d 1 ,d 2 ,…,d n   d1,d2,…,dn , where d i ≥0  di≥0 , ∀i  ∀i , is graphical iff:  s 1   s1 : d 2 −1,…,d d 1 +1 −1,d d 1 +2 ,…,d n   d2−1,…,dd1+1−1,dd1+2,…,dn is graphical. Basically, the degree sequence is a representation of the degrees of ALL vertices in the Graph. It is conventional to write this degree sequence in a reverse-sorted manner so that you can use the theorem above for validity of representation. In the event of a Digraph, as Daniel R. Page rightly points out, we use pairs of vertices to signify the sequence. 248 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Karem Emad
