What are nonconsecutive vertices?This question is extremely vague without more context, and certainly we may be able to guess the context you have in mind, but I'll answer the vague question with a generalized response. Suppose you have a set of things. Let's call them 'vertices.' Now suppose further that you have a way to order, or sequence these vertices, so you can put them into an ordered list, perhaps such that the ordered list is circular, meaning that when you get to the end of the list, the next one would be the first again, etc. Then nonconsecutive vertices would be any that are not adjacent in that list. Now, if you apply this to the vertices of your polygon (here I'm guessing your intended context), you can determine nonconsecutive vertices. 205 Views
