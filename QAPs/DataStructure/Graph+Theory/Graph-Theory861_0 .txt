Can every statement in set theory be translated to one in graph theory?Yes, formally, but not in any meaningful or interesting way. Every set is the vertex set of a graph, so you can take any statement about sets and replace any occurrence of a set A by "the vertex set V(G) of some graph G". This completely "forgets" the edge aspect of the graphs, so it's not illuminating or useful in any way, but it is, officially, producing statements about graphs. 3.8k Views  View Upvotes
