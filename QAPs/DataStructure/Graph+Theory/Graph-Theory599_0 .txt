What is the Dijkstra shortest path for the following graph?The source for the Dijkstra’s Algorithm is A. I wanted to know how to proceed in case there are multiple contenders to update a vertex ?When you apply Dijkstra’s from a source you get shortest path from that source to all other vertices. It also gives you a shortest path tree which contains all shortest paths from source to all the other vertices. In this case there are 3 different possible shortest path trees depending on subtle diffrence in the way you insert vertices in priority queue although the shortest path values will be indifferent. Here are the 3 shortest path trees possible here - AD,DE,AB,BC AD,DB,BC,DE AD,DC,DE,AB. All the three give same shortest path value from vertex A to any other vertex i.e → Let shortest path distance from A to vertex V be SP(V). SP(A) = 0 , Path A→A. (1,2,3) SP(B) = 10, Path A→D→B (2)or A→B(1,3) SP(C) = 12 ,Path A→B→C(1), A→D→B→C(2),A→D→C(3) SP(D) = 7 , Path A→D(1,2,3) SP(E) = 10, Path A→D→E (1,2,3) Hence here is all the variety of results that you may get by the virtue subtle differences in which you implement Dijkstra’s Algo. but whichever way you go for , it is notable that the results do not change, i.e SP(v) values are always same. The path from which you arrive to these values may vary, hence leading to different shortest path trees as a result. I hope all your queries are satisfied. 87 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Vibhanshu Biswas
