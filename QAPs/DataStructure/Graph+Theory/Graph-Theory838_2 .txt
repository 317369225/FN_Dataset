How can the amount of faces, edges, and vertices be determined on a hexagonal prism?A hexagon has 6 sides. When you have a hexagonal prism, you have 6 faces which are  on the sides which are rectangles, and one hexagon face on the top and one on the bottom. This makes 8 faces. The vertices are double the amount of sides on the base shape of the prism(in this case hexagon). 6∗2=12  6∗2=12 vertices. The edges of the prism are 3 times the amount of sides on the base shape(hexagon). 6∗3=18  6∗3=18 sides. Remember these rules are only for prisms. 85 Views
