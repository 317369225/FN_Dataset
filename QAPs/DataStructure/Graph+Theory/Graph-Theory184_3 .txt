Can a graph have two tangents at a given point?We are doing calculus (highschool) level and I’m wondering if a graph can have two tangents. I worked out, x^2+2, and the tangents, 6x+3 and 5x+2 (through algebra/geometry) do intersect at -1,-3, however do both or even one of the straight lines qualify as a tangent ?Unless they are parallel, two tangent lines will always intersect. However, this is not a special property of tangents, rather just definition of non-parallel lines, which when coplanar will always intersect. Both the lines you found do qualify as tangent lines, but a single curve has an infinite number of tangent lines, at each point along it, which is infinitely many. To address the different tangents at a single point, it is possible in functions that cross over themselves, like lemniscates. I don’t have in depth knowledge of these, but here’s the wikipedia page: Lemniscates 226 Views · View Upvotes
