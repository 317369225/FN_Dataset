Why aren't there any limits on a break in a graph?I just got done with my first calc class of the semester and my professor stated that there aren't any limits on a break in a graph. He didn't get a chance to explain because class ended and said we would discuss it the following class. But I was just curious as to why.When you say "break in a graph" do you mean a discontinuity like this? If so then it's easy to see why the limit of the function as the dependent variable approaches 3 (the 'break') does not exist. If you approach from the left you the result is 1, but if you approach from the right then the result is 4. These to values disagree, so the limit does not exist. 209 Views  View Upvotes
