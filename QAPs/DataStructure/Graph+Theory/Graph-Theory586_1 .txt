Is data structure graph and graph theory different?Well we really have three separate topics to discuss. Graph Theory: The mathematical and computer science based formal theory of graphs and algorithms related to graphs. Data Structures: Underlying containers that hold data and allow for meaningful operations to be performed efficiently on that data. Abstract Data Types: Interfaces/Concepts modeled by underlying data structures and meta information, coupled with algorithms. Graphs from graph theory are abstract data types that can be implemented via a variety of data structures. For example, a Graph can be stored in an adjacency list, adjacency matrix, edge list, or it can be implicit. Independent of its storage, the interface for a graph, with certain exceptions, can be generic. Ie, addEdge(), removeEdge(), bfs(), shortestPath(). This ADT models the graph from graph theory while the data structure is the container of info. In general, the graphs in graph theory are realized in physical form by the Graph objects that wind up in CS programs for finding your relation to Kevin Bacon. 87 Views  View Upvotes
