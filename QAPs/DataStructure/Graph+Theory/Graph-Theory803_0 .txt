A random subset of a large graph contained a giant connected component, can someone explain why without complex mathematics?I generated a random subset from a graph that contained over 70k nodes and 500k edges. The random graph contained a giant connected component in the middle and I can't figure out why. Is there a theory behind this that can be explained without too much maths?Very large graphs tend to have a Giant CC, the easy way to explain this is to think what would happen if we have two CCs instead of one. Imagine we have not one but two CCs, there's absolutely no link between them, if you add a new link to the graph it is very very likely the new link will connect a node from CC1 to CC2 merging the two CCs into a single one. You asked about no complex mathematics and I haven't used a single formula! 209 Views  View Upvotes
