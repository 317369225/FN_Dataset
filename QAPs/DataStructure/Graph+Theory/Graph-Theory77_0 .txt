How is a graph used to show an economic shortage?Cumulative graphs. That's the master idea. Draw a curve with time on the abscissa (horizontal scale). Start at any point in time you wish, now or in the past. Draw cumulative needs since the beginning of your time scale. On the same 2 dimensional graph draw cumulative resources, with possible stock of these resources at the beginning of your time scale. If the curve for cumulative resources is not always above the curve of cumulative needs you will be in trouble at the point where they intersect. 29 Views  View Upvotes
