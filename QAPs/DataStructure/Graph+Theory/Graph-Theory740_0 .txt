What is the point of graph algorithms?I know the material well, but I want to have a deeper understanding.. I feel like someone who understands/knows the text, but should understand the sub-text..I don't quite understand your question but I'll try to explain point of Graph algorithms as a student in CS. Why we use graphs? As you know graph(-ic) representations of things are intiutive yet sufficiently explanatory. So we , humans , like infographics more than a bunch of text. But from an algorithmic point of view what makes them strong is that they are highly applicable to any kind of problem. You can represent many things as a graph. Such as roads in a city( check Google Hashcode's preliminary question this year), electrical circuitry( Graph representation of electronic circuits) and finally social networking comes to my mind. So WHY we use graphs? Matrices and graphs has been in use for a long time. But computer was invented like 70 years ago. These two common representations of data in CS was studied in depth by great mathematicians. They found them, studied them them they ran into problems. From there they established their theories and stuff. Finally, they polished these representations of knowledge and and created many method,tools or algorithms whatever you call them. So, in computer era, while creating solutions for problems we just form our data as a graph (It is quite easy to do) and run the graph algorithm to get an answer. What made them popular? Social networks. You have users/people as nodes and relations between them as the edges of a graph. You have millions of users maybe, no problem, graph algorithms are more scalable then conventional methods ( And also they are said to be fast.). Check out where the graph algos are used!
