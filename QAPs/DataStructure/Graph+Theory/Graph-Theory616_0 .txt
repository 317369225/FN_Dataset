What's the quickest way to tell if the results of one function will always equal those of another?In general, it's not possible. If we have functions f  f and g  g in some representation, then this is equivalent to determining if f−g=0  f−g=0 . This is undecidable for even basic representations. (Specifically, by Richardson’s Theorem, if we have arithmetic operations, x  x , log2  log⁡2 , π  π , exp  exp , sin  sin , and absolute value, determining whether an expression built from the above is 0  0 is not decidable.) For the specific case of analytic functions, check that their Taylor series are equal. For the specific case of linear operators of real vectors, check that the matrix representations are equal. Or check that all basis vectors spanning the space in context map identically under each operator. 333 Views · View Upvotes
