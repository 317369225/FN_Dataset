What are the sources to learn graph theory if I have no knowledge about it?Here I’ll give you a list of links. Follow them sequentially while practicing the following advises: Read the tutorials, draw the figures on paper by hand if you need to get the idea. After that, if you already know basic data structures (array, linked list, stack, queue) then try implementing the algorithms by your own. If you fail, then see the code given with every tutorial, but don’t copy paste. Read, understand, then again implement by yourself. After going through the whole list, you’ll have a strong basic on basic graph theory. Then solve some problems on these algorithms from Codeforces Graph Theory , HackerRank Graph Theory.
