Why does the parent graph √x result in only positive y values?When we take the square root of a number it returns both a positive and negative value. Why do we exclude the negative values when we graph the √x . Note: I understand the graph would no longer be a funtion of x.Are you familiar with the vertical line test? If not, it basically just tells you whether or not you have a graph of a function. If you drag a vertical pencil over this curve, would it intersect in more than one point? If yes, your graph isn't a function. So when you graph f(x)=sqrt(x) f(x)=sqrt(x) it only gives the positive y values so your graph is a function. If it gave both the positive and negative, the plot would not be a function. So to recap, even though there IS a positive and negative answer, your graphing device assumes you want a function, so that's what it gives you. 284 Views  View Upvotes
