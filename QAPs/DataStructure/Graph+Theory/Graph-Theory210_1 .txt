When we remove an edge from a tree it seems obvious that we are left with two trees, but how would we go about proving this?Why aren't we left with 3+ trees?Removing an edge from any connected graph creates a graph with at most two connected components. The original graph doesn't need to be a tree; it just needs to be connected. Why? Because an edge connects just two vertices. So if you have a graph with three or more connected components, adding an edge may connect two of them but it can't do anything for the third. This third component was disconnected from the rest of the graph before the new edge was added, and it is still disconnected afterwards. Playing this backwards, removing an edge from a connected graph (tree or not) can't yield a graph with three or more connected components. (Warning: removing a vertex from a connected graph may well create a graph with a million connected components.) 2.8k Views  View Upvotes
