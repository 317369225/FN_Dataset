What data structure is used to represent vertices and edges?Data* Structure - Graphs. A graph G = (V, E), is a 2-tuple of a set of vertices and edges. Graphs can be simple or complex. Simple graphs are not allowed to have self edges. Obviously, an edge connects two vertices. Usually, there are two ways to represent Graphs : An Edge List , and an Adjacency Matrix. Edge List : O(V + E) [space]-> A list/map of a vertex with pointers to a list of edges for every vertex. Adjacency Matrix: O(V^2) [space]-> A matrix where every entry is represented by a 1 or 0. A 1 signifies the presence of an edge, and a 0, the absence of it. Read up on Graph Theory for further information. 175 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Priscyla Hammerl
