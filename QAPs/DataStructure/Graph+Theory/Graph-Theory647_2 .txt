If we negate the edge weights in a graph G=(V,E) G=(V,E) and then run Bellman Ford, does this compute longest paths?If its does not, then what does this compute? Why wouldn't it if shortest paths now correspond to shortest paths?The bellman ford's algorthim needs the graph to have no negative cycle. So, if you are negating the edge weights then the original graph should not have had any positive cycles. So, if your original graph satisfies this condition I suppose it would give you the longest path of the original graph. 40 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
