How do you find the shortest path down a mountain in math?There is no one best way. There are heuristics, such as always taking the next step in the steepest downhill direction, but given a mountain of a complicated, realistic shape, that may not get the shortest route, and may even fail to get to the bottom. The only sure way that I know is to model the entire mountain and use a comprehensive method like dynamic programming. 67 Views  View Upvotes
