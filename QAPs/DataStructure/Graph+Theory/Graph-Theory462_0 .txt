What graph goes negative against x-axis?One that starts at let’s say, 1,9 and only goes negative to the x-axis. What is it called? What would the Equation look like? Thank you.I agree with Susan Donovan. We would need to know more about what you have in mind. However, here’s one possibility out of many. f  f is a Line (geometry) (roughly speaking, half of a line starting with a point). f  f starts at (1,9)  (1,9) and ‘goes negative against (the) x  x -axis’. 22 Views · Answer requested by Matthew Wong
