What are nonconsecutive vertices?Please add more information to your question. It sounds like you were reading (an explanation for an) algorithm. I'm assuming you're talking about graphs because of the tag. But the question can be applicable to polygons and polyhedra. If you were talking about graphs, is likely that you were reading about: bipartite graphs, stable sets (independent set), chordal graphs (triangulated graphs), etc. I can speculate more, but I better leave this as is, until you add more information. 45 Views
