Is there any algorithm to find shortest path between two nodes with negative cycle?If there is a negative cycle in the graph, but you’re interested in some node (or several nodes) which have shortest paths from the source (because, for example, if you start from the source and go such that you reach the negative cycle but then have no edges by which you could come back and continue towards the node in question) then Bellman-Ford will give the results for them just fine, the only addition is that you only need to distinguish if the result for a given node is a real result or a garbage which was there because of some negative cycle which is easy. If there is a negative cycle in the graph and you’re interested in some node which can be reached from the source by some path which touches the negative cycle, then like Ohileshwar explained the very concept of shortest path is meaningless so the question for an algorithms computing them is meaningless as well. 256 Views · View Upvotes
