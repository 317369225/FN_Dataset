How can I draw a directed/oriented graph given a text file?The text file consists of pairs of node names, so that each line represents a “source” and a “target” nodes.I had forgotten using graphviz until Andrew Pam mentioned it. It would be easy to do what you want. Here’s an example. Here’s the input I provided to get this. digraph a_graph { rankdir=LR; size="8,5"; node [shape = circle]; node [label = "Anatole"]; Anatole; node [label = "Sasha"]; Sasha; node [label = "Guillaume"]; Guillaume; node [label = "Bruce"]; Bruce; node [label = "Beatrice"]; Beatrice; node [label = "Tony"]; Tony; node [label = "Alicia"]; Alicia; Anatole -> Sasha [ label = "?" ]; Anatole -> Guillaume [ label = "anything you like" ]; Sasha -> Bruce ; Sasha -> Beatrice [ label = "something here perhaps" ]; Guillaume -> Tony [ label = "a label" ]; Guillaume -> Alicia ; Alicia -> Anatole; Beatrice -> Anatole; Tony -> Beatrice; } rankdir indicates that the digraph should be built from left to right. I think you need to define the nodes first; you could experiment to see if this is really necessary. I’ve defined the labels of the nodes to be the same as the symbolic names of the nodes; I did this mainly because I become more confused by the day. Labels on arcs (such as ‘anything you like’) are optional. I used the program called GVEdit to do this; it comes as part of the distribution IIRC. The editor is pretty limited. If you’re like me you’ll use your favourite editor to create the original source code then make minor corrections and improvements using the editor built into GVEdit. There are various options for saving the graph as a graphic. 222 Views · View Upvotes
