Is it possible that there are two distinct maximum s-t-flows in a digraph?Yes. If a maximum flow contains a cycle, we can remove that cycle from the flow and have a flow of equal value. Here is another stupid example: It is easy to find a flow from s to t of value 1. We know that it is maximum because I can show you a s-t cut of value 1: namely, (V\t,t). There are 2 integer maximum flows. Taking the top path, or taking the bottom path. 102 Views
