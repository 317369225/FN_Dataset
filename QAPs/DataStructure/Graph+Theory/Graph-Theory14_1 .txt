What is the equation of a sinusoidal graph having minimum point at (0,3) and intersects the mid line at (5π,5)?I got -2cos(1/10x) +5 which is obviously wrong as I checked in GeoGebra.Since we have a minimum at x=0  x=0 this suggests fitting, y=A+Bcos(π+Cx)  y=A+Bcos(π+Cx) . The y  y -difference between the mid-line and the minimum is 2  2 , indicating an amplitude B  B of 2  2 . The mid-line is ‘lifted’ from the x  x -axis to y=5  y=5 , indicating that A=5  A=5 . Thus, from the intersection, we have 5=5+2cos(π+5πC)  5=5+2cos(π+5πC) . And so on. 21 Views · Answer requested by Usman Khan
