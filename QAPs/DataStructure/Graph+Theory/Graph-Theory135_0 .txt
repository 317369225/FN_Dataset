How do you print cyclic path reconstruction of a graph in C?For example, cyclic paths can be detected by using Floyd-Warshall algorithm. How to modify path reconstruction of this algorithm such that it prints cyclic paths, like the following: 1->2->3->1S0unds like a homework problem, so I keep it abstract. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is well documented. You’ll find it in pseudo-code on Wikipedia. You just create a two-dimensional array with the size of your nodes on x and y. So: use data structure “array” Then fill out the algorithm. That’s straight forward. About 12 to 13 lines of code. That problem has no depth in it, I won’t do your homework. But with this you should be able to do it yourself. And the cyclic path is the path over nodes so that you find a list of nodes, connected by an edge, that has not crossed the same node twice. Means the list of nodes may not append a node that’s already in there a second time. The cycle is complete if you find a node that points to your start-node. That should help. If that’s not homework, tell me what that is for? To write that code should be a matter of maximal 15 minutes for you. Hm. One could do it in about five, I guess. Okay. Last thing: data structure of the “list” is of course also an array. No need to start working with dynamic memory and lists and that. Because the cyclic path can have a maximum length of number elements. Means a great circle where the last element finally connects to the first. 256 Views · View Upvotes
