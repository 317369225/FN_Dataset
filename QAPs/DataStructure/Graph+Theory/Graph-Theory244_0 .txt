Is there a polynomial time algorithm to find all solutions of k edge-disjoint paths between a source and destination in a directed graph?Finding a solution of k edge-disjoint paths can be done in polynomial time using max-flow.Finding all solutions in polynomial time sounds like a hard task - simply because there can be exponentail number of solutions:) Even if you have k=1 (in this case it's a simple shortest-path problem), still for unweighted graph consisting of 1001 vertices - start, finish and 333 inner layers with 3 vertices each - there will be 3^333 solutions, which is more than 7*10^158. Even if you can easily count solutions for this simplest version of a problem - you already can't print them all in polynomial time, because their number is exponential. 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
