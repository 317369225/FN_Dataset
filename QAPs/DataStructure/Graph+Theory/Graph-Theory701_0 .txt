How do I plot graphs from Excel data where there are different situations?I have 5 speeds[1000-5000rpm], I have around 13 cases of Length / Diameter Ratio, I Have volumetric efficiency for each speed which is shown below, but how to link different speed with volumetric efficiency in graph. I need X axis to be speed, Y axis to be L/d ratio and Color to represent efficienHere's an alternative idea: plot the data as a surface : Then rotate the "3-D" view so that you are looking "straight down" on the data set. Unfortunately, the Excel app on my iPad doesn't appear to give me formatting controls to rotate the view, but it can certainly be done in the desktop version. You can practically use your data as-is, maybe just delete the blank column, 144 Views  View Upvotes
