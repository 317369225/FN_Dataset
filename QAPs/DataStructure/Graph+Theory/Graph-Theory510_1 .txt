How do you read a SIAR isotopic diagram?Thanks to Glenn Rager we can see from the research paper from which you took this diagram that the investigator is interested in the ratio of a stable isotope of carbon and a stable isotope of nitrogen found in a species of oysters along a series of nineteen stations from an upstream estuary to an outside bay. The first thing we can say about this is that, although the water course is two-dimensional the investigator is assuming a one-dimensional model. The diagram is displayed in two rows but it should really be understood as a single row where upstream estuary is the first entry and outside bay is the last. Thus the series is intended to study whether there might be a trend in the isotopic rations from the upstream estuary to the outside bay. The individual diagrams capture oyster diet distribution information for one station in the form of boxplots. So, for instance, the lower left diagram gives the distribution isotope ratios in the various diet components of oysters at the inner bay sampling station. By looking across the six plots at the biofilm items you may be able to discern how the distribution of this ratio varies from one end of the water course to the other. 220 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Hamza Ahmad Shaikh
