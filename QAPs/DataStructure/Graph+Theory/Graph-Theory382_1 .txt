Are disconnected graph different graphs?Suppose, I have a graph containing names which are connected through property synonym. Can it be considered that each connected component is a different graph in itself? Or, are they part of a bigger graph just because they follow same connection logic?You are defining the graph in a certain manner. Even if the graph consists of connected components, it is still one graph. Suppose you wanted a graph in which each vertex is the name of a student in your high school graduating class. And that there is an edge between two vertices if these students have the same first name. Your graph will almost certainly be disconnected. But it is still one graph. At the same time, any subgraph of the graph is itself a graph. But it is a different graph. For instance, there could be a connected subgraph that consists of all the students whose first name is ‘Tim’ (an excellent name, by the way). By the way, because subgraphs of a given graph are themselves graphs, there are a number of recursive algorithms that are used in graph theory. 104 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Puneet Singh
