How do I devise an algorithm to calculate the minimum cost spannnig tree in a graph with not including specific edges?There are few unreliable edges which should not be included in the calculation. I think we can make use of Kruskals Min spanning tree approach but I am struggling with how to by pass these given edges and compute the minimum cost.Input has how many edges and which edges not to be included.I forgot about Kruskal, but recall Prim. Sort all edges based on costs (eg smaller length = cheaper). Now every time add the cheapest edge to your growing tree. If there is an edge you for some reason don't want, then exclude this one from being added. Don't add it to the list of edges to begin with, or skip it and pick the next best edge should it be selected. 26 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
