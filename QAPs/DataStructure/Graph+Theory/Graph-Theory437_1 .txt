How do I generalize convolution of neural networks to graphs?Great question; I’ve currently started digesting papers on this very topic. Specifically on convolutional neural networks and a generalization of those convolutions to graphs. Here is some work from 2013: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.0053.pdf A cool slideshow I found while answering this question: http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/Talks/Shuman_GSP_2016.pdf What I’m building up to: [1606.09375] Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering While I’m not finished reading all of it, I’m somewhat confident that reading through this work yourself will get you closer to answering that question. 140 Views · View Upvotes
