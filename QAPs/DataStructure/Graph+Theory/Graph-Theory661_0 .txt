Are petri nets worth learning?For me learning about Petri Nets was worth it. I use Petri Nets to organize my computer program. I often start with a Petri Net diagram and complement the diagram with a form view of the Petri Net. Then I add annotations. Based on the (Petri) net diagram and annotations, I write my computer program. It is the method I use to write JavaScript programs for PDF forms. If you are interested, the details of the method are found in @http://www.aespen.ca/NetElements... (Chionglo, 2014). ReferenceChionglo, J. F. (2014).
