What is the name of this method in this memory tree structure?Starts right to left with an input of "001101011010111". This tree structure can only collect of every four bits. For example, The MSB for first four would be, "0111". Then it will store bottom to top tree, 1-->1-->1-->0. Then the second will be the same for "1011". Note, each node is a counter.As pointed out by Shivani Goud this is a perfect example of Huffman Coding of binary tree. There can be multiple interpretation of this tree, what I look at it could be a different perspective all-together. Since it's an example of complete tree, so consider the pairs on the base nodes. 0-1 base position will have their root as 0, perform a bit-wise AND operation to determine the node. 2-3 base positions will have their root node as 1 perform a bit wise OR operation. 0-1 -> AND 2-3 -> OR 4-5 -> AND 6-7 -> OR 8-9 -> AND 10-11 -> OR Once you are done with the level one of the all the base nodes, go to the subsequent root nodes and perform the operation. There can be multiple interpretation of this tree though. 164 Views  View Upvotes
