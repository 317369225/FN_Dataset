What is the difference between a "Minimal Spanning Tee" and "shortest paths"?I take minimal to mean shortest.Though Minimum Spanning Tree and Shortest Path algorithms computation looks similar they focus on 2 different requirements. In MST, requirement is to reach each vertex once (create graph tree) and total (collective) cost of reaching each vertex is required to be minimum among all possible combinations. In Shortest Path, requirement is to reach destination vertex from source vertex with lowest possible cost (shortest weight). So here we do not worry about reaching each vertex instead only focus on source and destination vertices and thats where lies the difference. Here is the example to clarify why MST not necessarily gives shortest path between 2 vertices. A———(5)———B———(5)——C |_________(7)_________| In MST case, edges A-B. B-C will be on MST with total weight of 10. So cost of reaching A to C in MST is 10. But in Shortest Path case, shortest path between A to C is A-C which is 7. A-C was never on MST. 58 Views · View Upvotes
