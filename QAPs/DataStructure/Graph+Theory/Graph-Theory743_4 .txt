What do the matrices represent in the following pictures?Thank you very much,I am learning R language by myself right now,and now I feel it's a little difficult for me... Is there any good books for beginners? Thank you very much!A1 and A2 are called adjacency matrices. In the picture, you have two graphs. The one on the left is undirected and the other one is directed. A1 corresponds to the undirected graph, and A2 corresponds to the directed graph. Here, the entry is made in following manner: If there is an edge between vertex vi and vj, then the corresponding entry at row i and column j of the matrix is set to 1, otherwise it is 0. As you can see, A1 is same as its transpose. But A2 is not. This is because of the direction of edge, which is also considered. Unfortunately, I can not name a book. I have learnt R from personal experiments and help from internet. I hope you will be able to find a good book on R. All the best. 52 Views
