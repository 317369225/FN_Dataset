Where can I find NP complete real world problems in graph theory to create heuristics?I have to choose a NP complete problem to create a heuristic for my graph theory assignment and I don’t know where can I look for, can someone indicate some interesting problem to work on?Wikipedia has a nice article about NP-Complete problems, providing a list of them indexed by their area. You can check it here: List of NP-complete problems If you want a suggestion of a particular NP-Complete graph problem, you may check the 2D Euclidean decision problem formulation of the Travelling salesman problem. This is the problem of deciding, for a given set of points in two-dimensional space and a constant K, if there exists a route visiting each point exactly once whose length is shorter than K. This problem is an interesting choice, as TSP and its variations are some of the most studied problems in optimization and the literature is rich with heuristics to find good quality solutions to them. Because TSP is such a popular problem, you can also benefit from websites such as TSPLIB, that provide thousand of TSP instances which you can use to test your algorithms. OBS. Notice that I suggested the decision version of the problem, as NP-Complete is a complexity class defined only for decision problems, and TSP is an optimization one. It is possible, however, that your teacher was coining “NP-Complete” in a less rigorous way and just wanted you to provide an heuristic to any problem whose decision version is NP-Complete. You should check this with them. 264 Views · Answer requested by Mateus Coutinho Marim
