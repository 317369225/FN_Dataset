Graph Theory: Does Dijikstra's algorithm on negative edge cycle always converge?If we have a source A, and a destination B, and a negative edge cycle in between. Since Dijikstra's always marks a node visited after its visit, can we say that the algorithm always stops? Dijkstra's algorithm#1 From: Bellman–Ford algorithm negative (edge) cycle is a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value. #2 From: Dijkstra's algorithm Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between a and b. .    It picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest-distance, .        calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and .        updates the neighbor's distance if smaller. .    Mark visited (set to red) when done with neighbors. Here, since marking visited in Dijkstra's is not dependent on any other operation. So, Yes, Dijkstra always stops after marking visited at most all nodes starting from a source. It is same even if the graph is disconnected or has a negative cycle. Best of luck. 202 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Tehreem Ansari
