The points (1, 2) and (1, 6) are two vertices of a rectangle. Where are the other two vertices?So this question was asked earlier about a square and it could be answered. But now that the question changes “square” to “rectangle” the number of possible rectangles is infinite. There may be 3 distinct pairs of new vertices to create a rectangle. Imagine that (1,2) & (1,6) are consecutive vertices. Then you you can have a rectangle above, or a rectangle below. These two possible rectangles will always exist. If (1,2) and (1,6) represent non-consecutive vertices, then a rectangle can be formed by drawing the circle with (1,2) and (1,6) as the endpoints of the diameter of the circle. Then any point on the semi-circle will create a right angle. Then connect this 3rd point with the center of the circle, and extend this segment. Where the extended segment intersects the other semi-circle will be the 4th vertex. However this third possibility will only work if the length of the side between (1,2) and the new vertex will be less than or equal to (2 times square root of 2). 303 Views · View Upvotes
