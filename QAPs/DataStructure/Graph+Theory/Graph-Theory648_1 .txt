Is Graph Theory a nice-to-have course to have for machine learning?A2A. I concur with Juspreet's answer. Unless you're working on a very esoteric subarea/problem in machine learning that involves performing non-trivial analyses on graphs, having a deep understanding of graph theory is not going to make any difference. The fields are basically orthogonal. I have not done any course on graph theory, and have never felt the need in my few years of working in machine learning. Of course, I assume you know the basics of graph theory from data structures / algorithms course, like basic graph algorithms, etc. They might show up occasionally here and there. But that should be all you need. 172 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Dong Liu
