Is a pentagram star an example of a complete graph?By definition, a complete graph is such graph G(V, E) where for all ni and nj such that ni and nj are distinct and belong to V, there exists an edge e belonging to E. Put in simple words, every node has a direct edge with the other. By this definition, the pentagram is not a complete graph (also called a clique in the Graph Theory). However, every n-gram is a complete graph if it's circumscribed circles' edges' are considered as well. Hope I answered the question! 59 Views
