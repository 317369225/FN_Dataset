In an undirected graph, what is the degree of a vertex with a self-loop?My professor said the degree would be 2. But I don’t see how. I can understand that a single vertex has degree of 0. But when that vertex connects to itself, shouldn’t it be degree of 1?That depends. There is no single correct answer. You should use the version that actually makes sense in your particular case. The more common answer will be 2, because it is more consistent with the general case. Every edge has two ends, hence the sum of vertex degrees is twice the total number of edges. This is a nice property to have, and saying that a self-loop increases the degree of its vertex by 2 preserves this property. (You can view this as follows: “whenever I’m drawing a new edge, I increment the degree of the vertex where I start, then draw the edge, and then increment the degree of the vertex I just reached”.) However, there are also cases where the other option makes more sense. Let’s say I’m using an undirected graph to model how a person explores a city. The edges represent their possible actions during each minute: they can either move to an adjacent location, or they can stay in their current location. In this setting, it is more convenient to say that a self-loop contributes just 1 to the degree of its vertex. Then, the degree of the vertex represents the number of options the person gets to choose from. 575 Views · View Upvotes
