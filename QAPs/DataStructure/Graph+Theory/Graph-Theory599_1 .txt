What is the Dijkstra shortest path for the following graph?The source for the Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is A. I wanted to know how to proceed in case there are multiple contenders to update a vertex ?The shortest path in this case is A>D>E. If you come across more than one shortest value in a row(3rd row in this case. Refer to the picture below) . You can start with any one of them. I have shown both the cases here. The answer is same in both the cases. Note: Sometimes you can find more than one paths which have same shortest weight.Dont worry, if you start with any of them you will get shortest path. 32 Views
