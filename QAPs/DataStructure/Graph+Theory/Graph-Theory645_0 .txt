What is the proof of Graph Isomorphism problem not belonging to P nor NP-Complete provided P! =NP?Can you suggest any reading for the proof?I think you mean (based on the comments) that Graph Isomorphism may be in neither P nor NP-Complete. It is definitely in NP, because a graph isomorphism can be verified in polynomial time. There is no proof of this, it's an open problem. You can read Uwe Schoning's paper "Graph isomorphism is in the low hierarchy" for a proof that Graph Isomorophism is not NP-Complete unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level (which is not enough to merge NP and P.) 560 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Levan Kh.
