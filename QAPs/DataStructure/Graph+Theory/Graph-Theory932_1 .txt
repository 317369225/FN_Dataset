Is there an equivalent to Wagner's Theorem in Graph Theory for whether or not a graph is toroidal?Wagner's Theorem states that a graph non-planar if it has K3,3 K3,3 or K5 K5 as a minor. Is there any equivalent theorem or rule that deals with whether a graph is toroidal or not (i.e. is there some set of graphs such that if a graph G G has one or more of those graphs as a minor, it is necessarily non-toroidal?)Yes. Generally speaking, any property of graphs that is true of a graph if it's true of a minor is defined by a finite set of excluded minors. This follows immediately from the incredible theorem of Robertson and Seymour which says that any infinite set of graphs must contain some graph and its minor. However, the specific list of excluded minors for embeddability on a torus is very large and I don't think it is fully known. This paper cites a partial list of such minors consisting of at least 16,000 graphs. 1.6k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Justin Rising
