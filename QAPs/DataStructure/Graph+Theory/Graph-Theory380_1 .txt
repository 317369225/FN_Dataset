Which are the fastest algorithms for the coloring of edges in a graph with max_degree+1 colors?The Welsh-Powell Algorithm: sort the vertices in decreasing order of their degrees, and for each vertex in order, assign it the smallest color not already assigned to one of its neighbors. Runs in linear time in the number of edges if you use a counting sort. 111 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
