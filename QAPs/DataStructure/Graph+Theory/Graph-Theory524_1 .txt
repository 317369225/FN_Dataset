What is the centerpoint of a graph called? What purpose does it serve?If I assume that “centerpoint” means the origin (0,0), then it serves as a reference point to your graph and helps identify your location on your graph. Without it, we can’t use numbers or figures to express your position on the graph. Besides, it helps to graph functions like y=3x+5 and y=2x^2–7x-4 as it helps identify points and positions. 34 Views
