What is the weirdest problem that reduces to Network Flow?Quite a few problems reduce to maximum flow or some other form of network flow. A few simple examples are minimum cut or placing guards in a maze but also somewhat stranger problems like this one. What are some of the weirdest or most nonintuitive problems which turn out to be about network flow?Read about this in the Algorithms book by Kleinberg & Tardos: During the Cold War, the US government was trying to figure out how to most efficiently (using lowest number of bombing missions) destroy the most important railway links between Soviet cities. They solved it by creating a graph with Soviet cities as nodes, railway links as edges and the importance of railway links as edge weights. If you solve the s-t mincut problem on this graph, you get the solution by destroying the all the edges (railway links) that connect an s- and a t-node (city). In fact, I vaguely remember reading in the same book that DoD funding for solving this problem resulted in one of the famous s-t mincut algorithms… 942 Views · View Upvotes
