Vertex of a tetrahedron is A. From 3 other vertices and the 6 midpoints. How many 3 points combos are there so that they are in the same plane as A?The negative is easier in this case - for the chosen 3 points to not appear in the same plane as A  A , they need to appear on separate edges, so there are 2 3 =8  23=8 cases. The overall is 6 choose 3 = 20, so the answer would be 20−8=12  20−8=12 combos. 56 Views
