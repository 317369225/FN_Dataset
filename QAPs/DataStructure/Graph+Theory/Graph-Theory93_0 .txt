How do you calculate speed from distance time graphs?The slope of the curve represents speed. For any two points on the curve, the average speed between those points is the vertical change (from one point to the other) divided by the horizontal change. If, for example, the vertical axis is measured in meters and the horizontal axis is in seconds, then the division gives you the velocity in meters per second. 64 Views  View Upvotes
