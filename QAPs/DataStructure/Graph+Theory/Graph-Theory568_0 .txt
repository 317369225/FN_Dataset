What is a time temperature graph?You surely know the answer to this question already! A time-temperature graph has temperature on the vertical y-axis and time along the horizontal x-axis. Temperature will be in degree Celsius (C) or degrees Kelvin (K). Fahrenheit temperatures are not used in science today. Kelvin has the advantage of measuring absolute temperature with 0 K being the lowest temperature attainable. A degree K is the same as a degree C. Time may be measured in any units appropriate to the circumstances. In the case of an atom bomb it will be nanoseconds. For boiling a kettle seconds or minutes. For climate change decades or centuries. And so on and so on. 107 Views
