Is dimer of Iodine trichloride a planar structure?Iodine trichloride is an interhalogen compound of iodine and chlorine. It is bright yellow and in the solid state is present as a planar dimer. It can be prepared by reacting iodine with an excess of liquid chlorine at −70 °C. In the melt it is conductive, which may indicate dissociation: Iodine trichloride can be created by heating a mixture of liquid iodine and chlorine gas to 105 °C. It is an oxidizing agent, capable of causing fire on contact with organic materials. 80 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
