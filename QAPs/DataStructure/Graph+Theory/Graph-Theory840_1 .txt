What does visualizer graph represent in audio players?You have shown screenshots of waveform diagrams. They are plotted with wave amplitude on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal. The time scale is always linear, but the amplitude scale is sometimes a decibel scale. That is sometimes helpful because it makes smaller diaphragm excursions a lot more visible. I usually am more concerned with where the attack of a note is, and a linear amplitude scale does a better job showing that. Spectrograms are less useful than waveform diagrams, but used properly they can help you see the frequencies you're hearing. Time is again on the horizontal axis but this time frequency is on the vertical axis. The vertical scale can again be linear or logarithmic (the former is useful for looking at overtone series, the latter is useful for looking at the fundamental pitches beneath them). Finally, the amplitude of each pitch is shown by color. You can search the internet for example screenshots. I don't use these often, because to make them very exact takes up a lot of computing power that I'd rather have free for plugins. But they're fun to play with and help understand the actual shapes of the notes and overtones you've recorded. Spectrograms can also be plotted with pitch instead of frequency, but I don't use that ever. That's what my ears and sheet music are for. Midi and electronic music is a whole new ball game. The time that a sample was triggered is shown on the horizontal, but different workstations treat other aspects differently and I don't have much experience with this. Hope that helps! 21 Views  Answer requested by Sumit Chhetri
