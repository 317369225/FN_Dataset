Can a graph have two tangents at a given point?We are doing calculus (highschool) level and Iâ€™m wondering if a graph can have two tangents. I worked out, x^2+2, and the tangents, 6x+3 and 5x+2 (through algebra/geometry) do intersect at -1,-3, however do both or even one of the straight lines qualify as a tangent ?If it is a function: no. There are for instance parameter curves that can cut themselves, like a third degree bezier that forms an alpha shape. In the cutting point you have two different t-values and thus also two different values for the tangent. 92 Views
