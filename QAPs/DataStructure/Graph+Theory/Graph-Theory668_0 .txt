From 4 vertices and midpoints of the edges of a tetrahedron, pick 4 points so that they are not in the same plane. How many such choices are there?On each face of the tetrahedron there are 6 relevant points. All of them are coplanar; so the number of coplanar sets of four on a face = 4 chosen from 6 = 15. So the total number of such sets on the faces of the tetrahedron = 60. But if your tetrahedron is regular we will also have three square planes that bisect the tetrahedron through sets of the midpoints of four edges (see diagram). These too are coplanar sets of four. Total number of choices of four points out of the ten specified points = 10x9x8x7/4! = 210. So number of non-coplanar sets of four = 210-60 = 150 for the general case, but 210-63 = 147 for the regular tetrahedron. There may be some other irregular tetrahedra for which sets of four edge-mid-points are coincidentally coplanar. So I'd say the answer is any number between 147 and 150. 185 Views  View Upvotes
