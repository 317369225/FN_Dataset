Is not the supply graph in economics directly dependent on the demand graph? Can't the equilibrium price be artificially created?Your question is not clear so as to answer appropriately. Trying to mean what could possibly be in your mind, I would say that demand (in non-technical sense, the need of the people in sufficient volume) may induce an entrepreneur to produce and supply. On the other hand, availability of a good induces people to bring out their latent desires in the form of demand. Many entrepreneurs induce and arouse demand by introducing their product in the market. What is artificial? If I correctly understand, artificial equilibrium is possible to create by hoarding, when the supplier moves away a hefty amount or quantity of the stuff to keep prices high. They create artificial scarcity to exploit. In view of not being able to understand your question properly, I am not writing anything more. 124 Views  View Upvotes
