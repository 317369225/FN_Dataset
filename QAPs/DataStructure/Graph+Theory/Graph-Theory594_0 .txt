How many faces edges and vertices does a triangular prism have?Five faces (three squares* or rectangles, two triangles). Six vertices. and therefore (by Euler’s rule)** nine edges, if you’re fed up with counting them. Three each for the two triangles (total six) and three stretching between the triangles (grand total nine). *A strict geometrical prism, belonging to the class of Archimedean solids, has squares as the quadrilateral faces, but many prisms in real life - eg the glass ones kept in physics labs for refracting and dispersing light - have rectangular and triangular faces. ** Faces + vertices = edges + 2 in all convex polyhedra. 2.4k Views
