How do you solve and graph y=-2x-4?First off, notice that the graph will be a straight line, since any equation of the form y = mx + b is a straight line. And a straight line is uniquely determined by joining any two points on the line. So set x = 0 to get one of the point on the y axis: one gets y = -4 (and x = 0). Now set y =0 and solve for x to get the other point on the straight line. This gives 2x = -4, or x = -2. So two points on the straight line are [x = 0, y= -4], and [x = -2, y = 0]. Take out a ruler and connect the two points, and you'll have your graph of the equation y = -2x-4. 64 Views
