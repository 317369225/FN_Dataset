Is there any software developer profession that uses more-than-basic algorithms in their day-to-day job?Yes. Doing distributed systems and storage among other things I've built replicated state machines with Paxos, invented a transactional array persisted to disk with only sequential IO, and implemented a log structured file-system containing pageable B+ trees. In the near future I'll combine Merkle trees with log structured merge trees. 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
