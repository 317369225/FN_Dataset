How do I find the no. of N sided polygon regions in a graph?Given an undirected planar graph G. Find no. of N sided polygon regions i.e., Number of regions which are bounded by N(N>2) vertices. I want to know the algorithm to solve this problem for any given N. Is this a hard problem or medium ?Initialize the value visited in each node as false. Starting from each node we do a depth first search traversal - check if a cycle is formed , the number of edges in the cycle is 5, and at least one node in the cycle false in its visited variable. If the conditions are satisfied increment the pentagon cycles count. Set the visited variable to true for the nodes in the pentagon cycle. The problem must be NP hard with exponential time complexity. 177 Views
