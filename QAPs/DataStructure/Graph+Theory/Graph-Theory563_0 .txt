In modern mathematics or physics is distance ever defined as the number of discrete steps between starting point and ending point?Irrespective of the way spatial distance is ordinarily measured in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.Although there are other ways of modeling space, the usual model is the same as it has been for over 2300 years. Continuous geometry is the standard model. Between any two points there is a midpoint, and there are lots of other points. But the concept of quasi-isometry suggests that whether space is continuous or discrete doesn’t matter. The large properties of space can be seen as independent of the minuscule ones. Distance is important, but how that distance is derived is not. 785 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Nemo Starem
