In an undirected graph, what is the degree of a vertex with a self-loop?My professor said the degree would be 2. But I don’t see how. I can understand that a single vertex has degree of 0. But when that vertex connects to itself, shouldn’t it be degree of 1?It is really up to you, how you count it. Counting as 2 has advantage of carving out self-loop from various theorems in fewer cases. Many theorems in graph-theory do not work on graphs with self-loop, and many theorems do. If you count the degree as 1, then fewer theorems would work on graphs with self-loop. As an example, Euler’s formula. v-e+f = 2 in planar graphs. If you count self-loop as degree 2, then this formula is applicable with graphs on self-loop too. Planar graph 130 Views
