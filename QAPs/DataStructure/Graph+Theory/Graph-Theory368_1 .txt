Is there any company that specializes in applied social graph analysis?I am looking for jobs where I can use the techniques I learned in social network analysis. I couldnâ€™t think of companies other than the major social networks like Facebook and Linkedin.There are many companies that specialize in social graph analysis. Most of them specialize in different aspects of social networks. Some work on qualitative analysis. Others focus on scalability related issues. Some focus on performance. The field of social network analysis is available for the taking :) 106 Views  View Upvotes
