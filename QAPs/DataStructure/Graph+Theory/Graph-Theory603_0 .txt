What is the application of reflexive graph?A graph is reflexive if for every node v there is an edge (v,v) (a loop). For modelling a practical problem in graph theory you probably want to use simple graphs( graphs without self loops). But in some cases you need consider self loops (pseudographs0)also. For example, consider you are ensuring connectivity of network. By connectivity I mean if a node can ping to any other node then we add an edge there. Like that we need to ensure loopbacking(self loop). If the node cannot ping to itself then there exist some connectivity issue. There may exist other solutions to this example. Anyway you could use reflexive graph for this. Hope this helps. 139 Views  View Upvotes
