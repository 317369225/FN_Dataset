How many vertices will the following graphs have if they contain- 24 edges and all vertices of the same degree?If we don't require that the graph is connected we could have 48 vertices that pair up to each have degree 1, we could also have 4 instances of K4 each of these examples has 24 edges but a different number of vertices. In fact, we can find examples that are connected with different number of vertices. A cycle of size 24 will have 24 edges and each vertex will have degree 2. Start with a cycle of size 12, then for every vertex i in the cycle connect it to i+2 and i-2. This graph has 24 edges and each vertex has degree 4. 160 Views
