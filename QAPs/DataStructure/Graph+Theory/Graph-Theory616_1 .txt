What's the quickest way to tell if the results of one function will always equal those of another?I’m thinking the original question might be asked from a simpler perspective by someone who has no idea what a basis vector or Taylor series is. They may be asking how does one tell that the function f(x) produces output results that are equal to the results produced by g(x). If two functions are always equal then you can set the function equal to each other and simplify the resulting equation until you can prove the equation is true or not. Example f(x) = x + 10 g(x) = 5x +5 If the function f(x) is equal to g(x) then x+10 = 5x +5 subtract x from both sides gives you 10 = 4x +5. solve for x and you get x = exactly 5/4, which means these two functions are only equal when x = 5/4. If the two functions were ALWAYS equal, when you set the functions equal to each other and simplified you would get as a simplified result: x = x. That is the only case of setting the functions equal to each other that means “the results of one function will always equal those of another”. 217 Views
