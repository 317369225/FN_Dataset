How is I understand this physics graph question?The labels on the axes are possibly confusing. The vertical axis is labeled I/mA. The number plotted is the current, I, divided by the unit, milliamp. If the current is, for example, I = 30 mA and then you divide that by mA, you get the dimensionless number 30. So the plot is actually dimensionless numbers. It would be much more common to label the axis I, mA meaning what is plotted is current, I, in the units of milliamps. Now the scale has dimensions of current instead of being dimensionless. This is a subtle difference and a bit unusual. I think it was more common in older books (many decades ago). The horizontal axis is even more confusing because it is labeled V/V. Weird. V divided by V should be 1. The only difference is that the first one is in italics. The first V is the voltage and the second V is the unit, volt. Again, the author has plotted dimensionless numbers by dividing the voltage by the unit of voltage. Most people could care less that the 5 on the graph is 5V/V instead of 5V. Physically, they both mean that the voltage drop across the light bulb is 5 volts. This rare method of labeling the graphs was sufficiently quirky and mildly interesting, so I thought I'd take a few minutes to explain it. This discussion does sort of help answer your question (How is I understand this physics graph question?) although I don't think that is what your main confusion was. Your question details make it clear that you were confused about where the 10^-3 came from. That is because the values on the graph refer to current in millliamps. A milliamp is 1/1000 of an amp. That is, 1 mA = 10^-3 A = 0.001A. The resistance of the lightbulb is voltage (in volts) divided by current (in amps). So you have to convert the milliamps to amps before you do that division. At 6 volts, the current is 40 mA and 40 mA = 40 x 10^-3 A. So that makes the resistance for that operating point of the lightbulb equal to R = V/I = 6V/40mA = 6V/(40x10^-3A) = 6V/0.04A = 150 ohm. 173 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
