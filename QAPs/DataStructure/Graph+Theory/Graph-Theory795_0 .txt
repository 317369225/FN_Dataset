What does the graph of (a+b)^n looks like?Consider "a" and "b" integers and "n" a natural number.The graph of (a+b)^n is not specific. It depends on the value of n that whether n is odd, even , integer , rational number, irrational number etc. For some cases of n, it also depends upon the value of a+b , for e.g - (a+b) should not be negative if suppose n=1/2 and many more values. 65 Views
