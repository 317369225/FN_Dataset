If the end goal is knowing graph theory at the highest possible level, should I enroll in an undergraduate math program or a computer science program?Well... If you truly want to understand it at the highest possible level, undergraduate courses are not going to help much. With that said, pick math. It avoids the implementation that CS students need to do for graph problems, opting instead for an abstracted higher-level understanding of the issue. Also, a math undergraduate degree more strongly prepares you for a mathematics graduate-level program that would go into more detail. There's plenty of CS theory classes out there but they mostly focus on solving problems using graph theory as opposed to understanding graph theory itself, which is the point of a pure mathematics track. 170 Views  View Upvotes
