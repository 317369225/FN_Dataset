What is the weirdest problem that reduces to Network Flow?Quite a few problems reduce to maximum flow or some other form of network flow. A few simple examples are minimum cut or placing guards in a maze but also somewhat stranger problems like this one. What are some of the weirdest or most nonintuitive problems which turn out to be about network flow?This might be one of the amazing problems that can be reduced to network flow. Imagine a 3-D world where each cell occupies a 1×1×1  1×1×1 cube. Now, some N  N (N≤100  N≤100 ) cells have been infected. You need to set up enclosures that will contain all infected cells. Enclosures need to be finished in the shortest amount of time, even if that requires some healthy cells to be enclosed along with the defective ones. The enclosures are formed by panels which can only be inserted between cells (so each individual panel must be axis-aligned), and each panel separates exactly two cells and requires one minute to set up. For full containment, each enclosure must form a closed polytope. Given the integer coordinates(all coordinates lie between 0  0 and 9  9 ) of each defective cell, report minimum time required to build all enclosures.
