How can I understand graphs? How can I understand how to use is it in problem solving?I understand the representation of a graph but I'm still not able to solve problems using it.You should definitely look into HackerEarth tutorials. They go over quite a bit of the basics and hopefully it will clear up some misconceptions and will help you further dive into graph algorithms! The links are as follows: Graph Theory - Part I - Prateek Garg Graph Theory - Part II - pkacprzak Finding All elementry Cycles in a directed graph - gulshan kumar Tutorial on Trie and example problems - Lalit Kundu Simple explanation of Implementation of D.F.S in python - karthic rao I would also look into other problems on CodeForces once you get better. Here's a link for graph-like problems. CodeForces allows you to look at tutorials and other people's code -> more learning! Problemset - Codeforces Good luck learning! 296 Views  View Upvotes
