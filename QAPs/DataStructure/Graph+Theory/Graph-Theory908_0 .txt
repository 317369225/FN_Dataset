If you own a business and have a customer list (first/last name), what would be the most useful data about these customers to help grow your business?I'd say their Intent. But that's hard to define, so let's go with their LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn profiles typically give you insane amounts of information that's relevant to making a sale: where they work and what they do there, their work experience, what's top of mind for them, etc. From this, you can reasonably surmise Intent and relevance, which helps you qualify this person as a lead for your sales team, as well as information that will help you make a more successful sales call.
