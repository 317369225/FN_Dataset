What are the different ways of proving that Reachability is not definable in first order logic?Not a single relation (even equality) is definable in a pure first order logic, i.e. logic without already defined predicate and functional symbols. The thing here is the fact that first order logic cannot quantify over predicates and functions. However, many relations can be defined in first order languages and first order theories which are actually non-conservative extensions of FOL (i.e., one can prove therein more than in “pure” FOL). Why is it so? Because there are vastly more models for pure FOL than for any of first order theories: a theorem of FOL is true in every possible model, while a theorem of some first order theory is true only in the models of that very theory. Example: 1+1=2  1+1=2 is true only in the models wherein arithmetic holds. However, it is not true in a two-valued Boolean algebra over signature +,×,′,1,0  +,×,′,1,0 , because there is no symbol 2  2 there. Hence, it is not a FOL tautology (we have found one model wherein the expression holds and another wherein it doesn’t). In other words, a theorem in FOL is always a tautology, a theorem in a first order theory isn’t. Another example: one cannot prove in FOL for arbitrary binary predicate symbol that it is, say, reflexive. In fact, reflexivity — \forall x_1P 2 1 (x 1 ,x 1 )  P12(x1,x1) (or something else like ∀x 1 P 2 3 (x 1 ,x 1 )  ∀x1P32(x1,x1) ) is only a satisfiable formula because we don’t know the interpretation of a given predicate symbol in pure FOL. Hope, that helps. 160 Views · View Upvotes
