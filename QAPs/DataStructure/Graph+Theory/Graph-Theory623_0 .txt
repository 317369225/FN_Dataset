What are the best tools for visualizing large graphs?By large I mean about 10^6 nodes and 10^9 edges.Are you sure you want to do that? 10^6 nodes and 10^9 edges is really too much! In a research, why we visualise networks is generally to build a hypothesis, to control a research or probably to analyse results at the end. I would advice you to try to extract the important information from this network and then try to visualise that. Very big graphs of the size you are talking about generally end up looking like a hairball and are not at all meaningful. In one of such graphs that I had, I filtered it on a edge strength threshold (I got 12 graphs from the same data) and it looked much much better where I could visualise communities very easily. But this is just one idea. Neverthless, you can try Networkx (python) or Jung (Java) visualisation libraries if you have a system that can handle that and you really want to do it. I would like to see it too if you are successful. Graphs look best when they are interactive, I personally like d3.js or vis.js javascript libraries for this but unfortuantely, a browser today can not handle the amount of data you have, unless you transform it, of course! 480 Views  View Upvotes
