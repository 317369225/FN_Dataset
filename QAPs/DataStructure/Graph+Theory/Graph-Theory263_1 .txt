Why do we remember random instances in the past very well?Typically, we recall events, which are called episodic memories, more easily than various facts. These events often have either an emotion and/or another connection that creates a stronger set of neural responses in our hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for creating memories, and retrieving them from the cortex from long-term memories. Those random memories likely had some emotion or meaning behind them, therefore they resonate and are more easily recalled. This also has to do with adrenaline being released if the event is particularly emotional. 51 Views  View Upvotes
