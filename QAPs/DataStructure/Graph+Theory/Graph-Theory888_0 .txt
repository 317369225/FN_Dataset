Is it possible to draw the shape below without taking your pencil off the paper?Sorry for the poor image. This is the best i could draw in paint!I assume that you require that no line be traced twice. Consider one of the points where 5 lines meet. 5 is an odd number. The trace can pass through that point twice accounting for 4 of the 5 lines, but it can't pass through 3 times. The trace has to has to begin or end at that point. There are 4 points where 5 lines meet, but the trace has only a beginning and and ending, so any trace can only begin and end at two of those points. Thus, the entire figure cannot be traced. For more information about this, see Jeremy Martin's notes at Page on ku.edu or search the web for Euler paths and Euler circuits. 11k Views  View Upvotes
