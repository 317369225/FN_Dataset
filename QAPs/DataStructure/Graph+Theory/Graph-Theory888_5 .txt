Is it possible to draw the shape below without taking your pencil off the paper?Sorry for the poor image. This is the best i could draw in paint!Yes. 1: Draw the shape, with extra bridge lines to teleport you around. Then erase those extra lines. I've kept my pencil on the paper, no? I've just made some adjustments later. 2: Fold the paper over so that you can go onto the other side and return to the original image in a different place. No rules broken here. 3: Put a pencil on the piece of paper. Draw the shape using a pen. Feel free to lift the pen as many times as you want. 1.5k Views
