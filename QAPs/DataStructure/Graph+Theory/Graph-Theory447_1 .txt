What is the difference between traversal of directed and undirected graph (specifically in C)?In my experience undirected graphs tend to be represented with two directed edges. Thus, DFS works on both graphs in a similar manner. With that, I suggest that you really do stuff by hand. It seems like if you don’t understand this basic concept, you are not likely to program it. Also language doesn’t matter, which further reinforces the previous statement. 256 Views · View Upvotes
