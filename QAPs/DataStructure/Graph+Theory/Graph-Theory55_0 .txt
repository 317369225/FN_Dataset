How do you graph y = (x+1)(x-5)/(x-2)(x+3)?y = (x+1)(x-5)/(x-2)(x+3) What are some significant things to find (like x and y intercepts) and how do you find them?The significant features you are looking for in this function are especially the limits, once you find the needed limits you can easily sketch your graph. Limits when x  x tends to infinity, on both directions (proof is left as homework): lim x→∞ y=1  limx→∞y=1 lim x→−∞ y=1  limx→−∞y=1 And since the denominator (x−2)(x+3)=0  (x−2)(x+3)=0 when x=−3  x=−3 and x=2  x=2 , we know that y tends to infinity, we only need to know which infinity? lim x→(−3) −  y=+∞  limx→(−3)−y=+∞ lim x→(−3) +  y=−∞  limx→(−3)+y=−∞ lim x→(2) −  y=+∞  limx→(2)−y=+∞ lim x→(2) +  y=−∞  limx→(2)+y=−∞ Of course, knowing the intercept points will help you sketch a prettier graph! 160 Views · View Upvotes
