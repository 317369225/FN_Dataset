Can maximal matching of a graph be equal to maximum match?By definition, a maximum matching is a maximal matching. However, not every maximal matching is maximum. Suppose you have a graph with four nodes, a, b, c, d, and three edges, (a, b), (b, c), (c, d). Here, (b, c) is a maximal matching because the other two edges are incident on b or c. However, there is a matching (a, b), (c, d) that has more edges. This is why greedy algorithms don't solve maximum matching. 106 Views  Answer requested by Apoorva Sahay
