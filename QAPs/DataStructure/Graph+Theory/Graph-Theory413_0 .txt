What is a linear graph? What is it used for?A linear graph, by definition, is a graph that has a shape of a line. Take, for example, this linear graph on the picture below: As you can see (at least geometrically), all the points that make up this graph are collinear, or, in other words, on the same line. Linear graphs are very good tools for modelling linear equations. It turns out that linear equations are extremely widespread, both in nature and in technology, and so being able to plot linear graphs is a must, if for no other reason than to pass your maths exam. 188 Views
