What could be my mistake in this “shortest paths” algorithm?The code works in some test cases, but not in others. I designed it myself, not copying something exactly, so I’m not looking just for “some algorithm”, but rather to find what is wrong with this one. Also, the source graph is undirected.A couple of things. I assume you’re trying to do dijkstra’s algorithm. Using wikipedia will be helpful. With that, you’re priority queue sorts stuff based on the edge number not the weight which is a problem. Also, you should be adding stuff to the priority queue if it’s better than the current path not for all edges aka queue.add() should be in the if statement. 52 Views · View Upvotes
