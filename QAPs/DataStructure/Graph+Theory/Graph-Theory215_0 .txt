Why do companies like Quora ask potential employees to know Number Theory, Graph Theory if it's not required to build the site in the first place?Did Adam D'Angelo have this knowledge while building Quora or is he more focused on the bigger picture and acquiring talents that have certain skill sets ?Let's see if graphs are not required to build the site; as a window into the inner workings of Quora, we'll use the Quora challenges (https://www.quora.com/challenges/): At Quora, we have aggregate graphs that track the number of upvotes we get each day. Oh.... There exists exactly one path from any question to another, and related questions form undirected pairs between themselves. In other words, the graph of related questions is a tree. Waaait... The topic ontology is given in the form of a flattened tree of topic names, where each topic may optionally have children. If a topic has children, they are listed after it within parentheses, and those topics may have children of their own, etc. See the sample for the exact input format. The tree is guaranteed to have a single root topic. Granted, the rest are machine learning questions, but you definitely cannot say that they don't use graphs. And number theory is just a common sense requirement for all programmers, I mean, it's the study of integers - and integers are kind of important in programming. I guess these topics can also serve as a check of whether you have an university-equivalent education (since there are relatively many self-educated programmers that could be a good fit, but don't have a diploma). TL;DR: When you're working with such huge amounts of data, fundamental computer science is extremely important. 426 Views  View Upvotes
