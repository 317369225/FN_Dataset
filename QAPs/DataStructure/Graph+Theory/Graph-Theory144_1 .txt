In my CS courses I studied graphs and passed with excellent score. I looked at math book about graphs and barely understood anything, is this bad?Not really, depending on the education system, it might even be expected. A typical CS undergraduate program from a US university or from other universities which follow the typical US CS undergraduate curriculum tends to be light on math. Yes, they teach some math, but the math is quite basic. If you read math book, their assumption on your math ability is … well, higher. So I am not surprised that someone who did well on CS graph classes would struggle in math’s level. From my personal observations, even former mathletes who went to CS tend to lose their math skill overtime. So don’t feel bad. 69 Views
