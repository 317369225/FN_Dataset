Why aren't there any limits on a break in a graph?I just got done with my first calc class of the semester and my professor stated that there aren't any limits on a break in a graph. He didn't get a chance to explain because class ended and said we would discuss it the following class. But I was just curious as to why.I'd say it's not correct to say "there aren't any limits" in this situation. As Jorge Sawyer shows in his picture, there are in fact two limits, one on the right and one on the left. Since these limits don't agree, we say there's not a single limit there for the function. So there are limits, but there's not a limit. 174 Views
