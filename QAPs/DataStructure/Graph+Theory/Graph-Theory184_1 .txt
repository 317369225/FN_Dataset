Can a graph have two tangents at a given point?We are doing calculus (highschool) level and I’m wondering if a graph can have two tangents. I worked out, x^2+2, and the tangents, 6x+3 and 5x+2 (through algebra/geometry) do intersect at -1,-3, however do both or even one of the straight lines qualify as a tangent ?If a function is differentiable at a point, it can only have one tangent line at that point. However, if a function is convex and not differentiable at a point, it can have multiple tangent lines at that point. Consider y=|x|  y=|x| . The lines y=x/2  y=x/2 and y=−x/2  y=−x/2 both intersect the function at the origin, and nowhere else. In fact, any line y=mx  y=mx with m∈(−1,1)  m∈(−1,1) will be a tangent to this function at the origin. 277 Views · View Upvotes
