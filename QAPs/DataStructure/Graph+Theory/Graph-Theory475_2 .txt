What are vertices? How many vertices does a cuboid have?For convex polyhedra, vertices are more precisely defined as “extreme points”, i.e. points of the polyhedron that are not obtained as a convex combination of other points. By definition, a cuboid has 8 vertices. Note that two definitions of the word “cuboid” are in use (see Wikipedia page) but anyway they all have 8 vertices. 178 Views
