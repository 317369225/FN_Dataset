How do I answer questions on construct a graph for an equation in interviews quickly?The best method for questions like this is to memorize the graphs of a bunch of elementary functions (like cos,sin,e x ,ln(x),1x   cos,sin,ex,ln⁡(x),1x etc) and be able to preform transformations on these. For example, take the first one you suggested, ln(x+8)  ln⁡(x+8) . This is exactly like ln(x)  ln⁡(x) except you now need to plug in x  x values that are 8  8 less - in other words, shift the graph 8 units to the left. See the link below for a more complete explanation on how these transformations work: http://michelenaja.faculty.mjc.e... 354 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
