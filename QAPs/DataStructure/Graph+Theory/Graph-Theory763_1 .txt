How do I find the no. of N sided polygon regions in a graph?Given an undirected planar graph G. Find no. of N sided polygon regions i.e., Number of regions which are bounded by N(N>2) vertices. I want to know the algorithm to solve this problem for any given N. Is this a hard problem or medium ?Must be simple. A pentagon in this case is a cycle of length 5. The question asks you to find the number of cycles of length 5. A cycle is defined as a path where the starting vertex is same as ending vertex. Now, for the solution, consider a path like this: A-->B-->C-->D-->E. To count this path as a pentagon, we need to check if the extreme vertices are connected to each other. The problem can now be boiled down to enumerating all paths of length 4 and check if the either vertices are directly connected. How do you enumerate all paths of length 4? Check ALL pairs of edges. Consider you have a pair of edges A--B and C--D. These pairs of edges are in a path of length 4 iff B and C are connected by some intermediate vertex say X. vector<pair<int int>> edges; pentagons = 0; for(x: edges){ for(y: edges){ int a = x.first, b=x.second; int c=y.first, d=y.second; if dist[b][c] = 2 //b and c are connected by some vertex. Assuming distance between pairs of edges is 1 if(dist[a][d]==1){ if(a,b,c and d are different from each other) pentagons++; } } } return pentagons; 381 Views  View Upvotes
