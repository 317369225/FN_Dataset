Why are graph databases necessary? Which companies use graph databases?The simple answer is that if your data is a graph then a graph database is a better idea than a relational one. This should be quite evident as the other way is liek fitting a square peg in a round hole. Let's say you store your graph as a list of edges in a relational database so you have a table (from_id, to_id). This looks very nice, now suposse you want to find all the paths of length 2 from one node to another you can join your "edges" table with itself and find the paths. If you want the paths of length 3 then 3 joins and when you want paths of length 5 your computer explodes. 252 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Munam Tariq
