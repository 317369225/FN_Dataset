How do I get a better intuition for combinatorial and optimization problems?As an undergraduate computer science students that took an introductory course in combinatorics, it was the course I struggled the most in.One of the things that helped me was using Pascal's rule, C(n,k) = C(n-1,k-1) + C(n - 1,k) The first part basically says pick the first element in n and generate the remaining k-1 combinations. The second part says don't pick the first element and generate k combinations. Similar method comes in handy while solving different types of problems too like the coin change problem or knapsack problem. As an exercise think of how you'll generate all permutations. 78 Views
