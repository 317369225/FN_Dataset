MS CS: Machine Learning or Graph Algorithm, Which course should I select?Both are interesting. For Machine learning we only have a few ideas how that should be done, it is far from an established science now. There are an awful lot of things you can prove with or about graphs. If you like proving things from axioms, pick this one. If you like to experiment with new approaches or improvements, pick machine learning. 112 Views  View Upvotes
