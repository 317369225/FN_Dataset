Is there an easy method to determine if a graph is planar or not?I can't find a subgraph that is K5 or K3,3 to use the kuratowski theorem .Is there another way to determine if it is not planar?Originally Answered: What is the methodology to prove if a graph is planar or not? Kuratowski's theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it doesn't contain a subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of K5 K5 or K3,3 K3,3 . 437 Views  View Upvotes
