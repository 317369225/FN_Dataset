What is the name of this method in this memory tree structure?Starts right to left with an input of "001101011010111". This tree structure can only collect of every four bits. For example, The MSB for first four would be, "0111". Then it will store bottom to top tree, 1-->1-->1-->0. Then the second will be the same for "1011". Note, each node is a counter.This is a binary tree, as each "parent" node only has two nodes connected to it. The interesting thing about this binary tree is that its nodes are written in binary format. It seems to me that this is an interesting way of visually representing a binary tree, as it utilizes actual binary: a simple aay to remember a complex data structure. Or just a computer science pun. 129 Views  View Upvotes
