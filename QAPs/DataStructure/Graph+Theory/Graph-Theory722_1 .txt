How do you label each axis on a line graph with ratios?For every 1 minute, I burn 15 calories on the treadmill. Minutes are the independent variable, right? Do I put the independent variable on the x or y axis on a line graph?In mathematics the convention is that in a graph of a function, the horizontal axis (X axis) carries the parameter of your function and the vertical axis (Y axis) carries the function value (result). In the language of "dependent" and "independent" you would indeed typically put the independent value on the x axis since this is the one you control or at least is the reason for the dependent one changing. The y axis then shows the result of your function, which is dependent on your parameter/input value. So if the purpose of your graph is to work out how many calories you burnt after a certain time of exercise common convention would be to put minutes on the x axis and calories on the x axis. On the other hand, if you add up all calories of all your meals during the day and your aim is to work out how many minutes to exercise in order to burn all these calories, you might choose to put the calories on the x axis and the minutes on the y axis - it really depends on your perspective! PS: Its important to understand that these are jut conventions - they don't change any of there underlying maths or information conveyed in your graph. Indeed, I have studied economics and there are economics textbooks which put the independent variable on the y axis - that really does your head in! 184 Views  View Upvotes
