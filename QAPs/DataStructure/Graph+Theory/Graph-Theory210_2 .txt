When we remove an edge from a tree it seems obvious that we are left with two trees, but how would we go about proving this?Why aren't we left with 3+ trees?Your original tree had no cycles. Therefore there will be no cycles in resulting graph as well. It means that we'll have a forest (consisting of one or more trees). We know that tree with n vertices has exactly n-1 edge. It proves that we'll have resulting forest consisting of two trees, because it has n vertices and n-2 edges (there were n-1 edges first, then we removed one of them). For a forest consisting of 3 trees with sizes A,B,C, such that A+B+C=n, there will be only (A-1)+(B-1)+(C-1)=n-3 edges. 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
