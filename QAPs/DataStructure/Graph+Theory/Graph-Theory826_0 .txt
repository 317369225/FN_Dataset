When are two edges said to be adjacent (in graph theory)?My teacher is saying that if there are 2 edges then they will be adjacent if and only if there both vertices are common. while my opinion is that if there is atleast one common vertex then the both edges will be adjacent to each other. please give proofs with answer( links or screenshot of any book)Adjacent Edges(or more appropriately Incident Edges):- If two edge share a common vertex. Parallel Edges:- If two different edges have both vertices common. It seems your teacher got those mixed up. Also Adjacent is generally used in context of vertices. You will hardly find definition of Adjacent Edges in any standard book.(It is not in Introduction to Algorithms) For further information check this answer:- http://math.stackexchange.com/a/... 239 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
