Can a directed graph have more than a single dimension?The concept of dimension does not really apply to graphs in any direct manner. It is fair to ask if a given graph can be drawn in 2-space in such a way that no edges cross. The answer is not always "yes". Since the edges are 1 dimensional, the problem does not arise if you are trying to embed the representation of a graph in 3-space. Then you can always make the edges miss one another. 154 Views
