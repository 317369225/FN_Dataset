What do the matrices represent in the following pictures?Thank you very much,I am learning R language by myself right now,and now I feel it's a little difficult for me... Is there any good books for beginners? Thank you very much!The matrices shown are called adjacency matrices and represent the directed graphs below them. They both are a way of communicating the same thing; the relationship between vertices in some graph space. In an adjacency matrix, the rows and columns correspond to some vertex with the value 1 or 0 showing a one way relationship (i.e., connection) between two vertices. 1 shows a relationship and 0 shows none. For example, in the graph below the A1 A1 matrix the V0 V0 vertex is connected to V1 V1 , V2 V2 , and V3 V3 , and when no arrows are shown on the edge it is assumed to be bidirectional. Therefore in row 0 and column 0, you'll see 1s in column/row 1, 2, and 3. Also, since all of the edges are bidirectional, your adjacency matrix will be symmetric. With respect to the A2 A2 matrix, there you have a graph containing edges with arrows indicating specific directional relationships. You can use the same logic to understand this matrix-graph pair as you used with the previous pair, but without assuming all edges are bidirectional. Here's a useful link to better understand these specific structures and illustrations: Graphs. 316 Views  View Upvotes
