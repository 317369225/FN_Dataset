How do I evaluate universal sink for a directed graph in O(V)?Show how to determine whether a directed graph G contains a universal sink—a vertex with in-degree V - 1 and out-degree 0 in time O(V), given an adjacency matrix for G. Don’t give the code .. kindly explain the logic behind that.In a directed graph, G represented as E(u,v), where u->v is an edge in the graph. You can find your universal sink by the following algorithm : -> Iterate over each edge E(u,v) belonging in the graph G. For each edge E(u,v) you visit, increment the in-degree for v by one. -> Iterate on all vertexes, and check for the one with in-degree V-1. After doing these 2 simple loops. You will have only one or no vertex with you. In case you have no vertex with V-1 as in-degree, then there is no universal sink. Else your have your universal sink. 55 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Praffulla Pandey
