What is the point of graph algorithms?I know the material well, but I want to have a deeper understanding.. I feel like someone who understands/knows the text, but should understand the sub-text..Graphs model the real world notion of "relationships" between a group of things. They model the notion of discrete things that are connected in some way but that are nonetheless separate entities. It is a very basic and fundamental concept to human thought and to be able to formalize such a concept however crudely ends up being powerful and/or useful. In other words, if mathematicians had not invented graph theory then engineers would have had to construct it on the job because the problems that graph theory addresses would keep coming up. 277 Views  View Upvotes
