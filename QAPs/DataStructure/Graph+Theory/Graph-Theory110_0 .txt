What is the purpose of the graph provided in this question?Use differentials to approximate the change in the volume of a cube when the side is decreased from 8 to 7.99 cm (in cubic centimeters).Like you, I have no idea what the purpose of this graph is. It appears to show a determination to make a simple thing complex. For small changes (as here) a very good approximation is that the fractional change in a parameter to the power n is xn where x is the fractional change in the base parameter. In this case the fractional change is .01/8 for the base length so the fractional change in volume (to the power of 3) is .03/8. The volume change is therefore 8*8*8*.03/8=1.92 cm3. This is correct to three significant figures. The approximation marginally overstates the change on the downside and marginally understates on the upnside. In this day and age when we all have math calculators and spreadsheets these old fashioned approximations hardly matter. 19 Views  View Upvotes
