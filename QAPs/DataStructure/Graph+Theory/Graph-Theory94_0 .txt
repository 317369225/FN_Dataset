Given a weighted graph of N nodes, is there an algorithm that computes the shortest path between all nodes?Do you mean all nodes should be covered? (Assuming that all nodes have at least 1 edge between each other i.e. the graph is connected) If so, then yes. Try Kruskal’s algorithm or Dijkstra’s problem. You can also look up for Floyd-Warshall algorithm and A* algorithm. These algorithms work when you are given a source node and a target node. If you are familiar with linear programming, there is a very popular LP (because it is integral) which is simple to implement and works just fine. 190 Views · Answer requested by Jayesh Lalwani
