The points (1, 2) and (1, 6) are two vertices of a rectangle. Where are the other two vertices?Any pair of points which are diametrically opposite on the circle (x−1) 2 +(y−4) 2 =4  (x−1)2+(y−4)2=4 plus any of the point pairs Alex Sharp said. Technically speaking this includes the case where the other two points are the same as the two that were given, resulting in a degenerate rectangle, so we can just expressly disallow that case. So, in summary: (x,4±4−(x−1) 2  − − − − − − − − − −  √ )  (x,4±4−(x−1)2) and (2−x,4∓4−(x−1) 2  − − − − − − − − − −  √ )  (2−x,4∓4−(x−1)2) for −1≤x<1  −1≤x<1 OR (x,2)  (x,2) and (x,6)  (x,6) for x≠1  x≠1 249 Views · View Upvotes
