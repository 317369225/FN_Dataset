How do I draw oriented graph of circuit?An oriented graph is a graph with arbitrary or assigned direction of edges. If the circuit has been given with only the active components such as voltage or current sources and passive components such as resistors, inductors or capacitors, we usually approach the problem by arbitrarily assigning the orientation. But the problem mentioned above has clearly mentioned the direction of the edges. in our case the currents. Therefore, one has to draw the graph of the circuit and then assign the direction as given in the figure. 90 Views  View Upvotes
