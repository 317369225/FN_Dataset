What is your favourite algorithm for computing an integral maximum flow?There are plenty of algorithms for computing an integral (integer-valued) maximum flow (e.g., some are listed here, Maximum flow problem ). Do you have any particular favourite? It doesn't have to be the most efficient one, but it may be the most efficient one for a problem that interests you.I am in favour of simplifing my approaches to various problems. So, if an approach I know well, can be used to solve a variety of problems, is prefered. Thus, in this particular case, I prefer Linear Programming, which in addition is pretty effective in this case. 77 Views
