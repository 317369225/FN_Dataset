Given 3 colours, how can I prove that there is a monochromatic rectangle with its sides parallel to the axes?I have three colours, i.e. a function f:ZxZ- {red,green,blue}. I have to prove that there is a monochromatic rectangle with its sides parallel to the axes i.e to prove that for some choice of a,b,c,d (Integers) with a ≠ b and c ≠ d, all points (a,b), (a,d), (b,c), (b,d) have the same colour.We can prove it using the pigeonhole principle. First notice that if we take four consecutive points in a line, say, (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), then some pair of them must be the same colour, by the pigeonhole principle. But how to find two more vertices for the rectangle? Notice that there are only different ways to colour four points. If we look at (x, 0), (x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3) for x = 0, 1, 2, …, 81, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be such that have the same colours as , respectively. If and have the same colour—and such are guaranteed to exist—then the desired rectangle is . As Apoorv points out, this is easily generalizable to the case of any number of colours. 1.2k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Chetan Pandey
