If I'm drawing a graph of percent error and no value is over 40%, do I still have to go up to 100% on the y axis?If it’s for a class, you’d have to do whatever the teacher wants to see but in general - no. In fact, you should not use too wide of a y-axis because it’ll make your errors look small which some people use underhandedly in science to try to make their experiments look better. As to what range you should use - it would depend on context. If absolutely no context is available, you could make it something like 1.5x your biggest error so that there’s a little empty space and it conveys that all of the data points are included, but not too much where errors would appear to be compressed. 31 Views · View Upvotes
