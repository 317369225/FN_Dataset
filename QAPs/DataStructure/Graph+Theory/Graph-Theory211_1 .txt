What does a straight line graph indicate?A straight line graph can also be used where exponentials are involved. Take the equation Q = AP^x , say. Eq1 The data concerning Q and P is available, you know that there is not a linear relationship between Q and P. The problem now is to find a value for A and x. If logs. of both sides of Eq1 are taken ,the problem is reduced from being an exponential to a linear one, as. Q = AP^x. becomes ln Q. = ln A + x ln P call this line L Draw this line 1. Where this line cuts the y axis is the value of ln A ,call it n so if ln A = n then A = e^n . Eq2 2 x above happens to be the slope of line L ,so calculate ,m the slope . Just measure (rise)/(run).= x Slope = x. Eq3 Sub. Eq2 and Eq3 into Eq1. The exponential problem is solved using a log .linear technique 88 Views
