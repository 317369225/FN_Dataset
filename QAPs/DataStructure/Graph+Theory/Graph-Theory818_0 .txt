How do you estimate the area under the graph?To find the exact area, you integrate. But to estimate the area when integration is difficult or impossible, use a Riemann sum. Riemann sums are relatively easy to calculate using sigma notation. The general for a left Riemann Sum is ∑ i=1 n f(x+((i−1)(a−b)/n))(a−b)/n  ∑i=1nf(x+((i−1)(a−b)/n))(a−b)/n Where a and b are your two bounds and n is the number of rectangles used to approximate the area. Therefore the larger your n, the more accurate your approximation. Other Riemann sums do exist but this is the simplest to do. 137 Views · View Upvotes
