How do I graph y=113x y=113x ?y=1/(13x) has a downward sloping curve in the 1st quadrant . It has an asymtope at x=0 , ie , at x=0 ,y tends to infinity As x tends to inf y tends to zero. Those two, give the extreme conditions, then draw a nice smooth curve between them. The rest of the curve can be found by a reflection through the origin as centre of symmetry This will give another (reflected) curve in the third quadrant, corresponding to the negative values of x 62 Views
