What is the reason that An An contains the number of walks of length n?Let A be the adjacency matrix of a graph G=(E,V). why is it that An An contains the number of walks of length n? Whats the proof and intuition? Is there a way to make this obvious?Let's split your questions into 2 parts : What method does the proof use ? (What is it?) AND What is the intuition ? As absurd as this may sound, let me answer part 2 first, it'll make part 1 a lot easier to see: - The intuition is as follows : Graph G=(V,E)  G=(V,E) . Given a vertex v∈V  v∈V , the number of paths to 'v' from all other vertices v i ∈V  vi∈V , such that v i   vi != v  v , is equal to the following :  ϵ  ϵ * ( walks(v 1   v1 ) + .. walks(v n )  vn) ), where ϵ=1  ϵ=1 , iff v i   vi is adjacent to v  v . In English, it is the sum of the number of walks of all vertices adjacent to 'v'. If you notice, the Matrix Multiplication does exactly this. Given a column that is being multiplied, the column serves the purpose of the ϵ  ϵ condition, and the row being multiplied (from some A k−1   Ak−1 ), serves the purpose of having each a ij   aij there represent the number of walks from i -> j. So, in essence, by the laws of Matrix Multiplication, the matrix A k =A k−1   Ak=Ak−1 *A  A represents the equation above, for each vertex  ′ v ′ ∈V  ′v′∈V . Answer 1 (Proof) : The proof primarily uses Induction. The reason for this is that it is a proof that can easily be thought of intuitively as 'building the walks' of a graph, level-by-level. By definition, the number of length '1' walks from a vertex i -> j are given by the Adjacency Matrix, as a length one walk is the same as an edge(ij)∈E  edge(ij)∈E . Assume that , for all k<n  k<n , the Inductive Hypothesis holds, i.e., A k−1   Ak−1 represents a matrix where each a ij   aij represents the number of length k−1  k−1 walks from i -> j. Then, for n=k  n=k , we have that A k =A k−1   Ak=Ak−1 *A  A , which gives us the length 'k' walks from i -> j, for allv i ,v j ∈V  vi,vj∈V . Substitute k=n  k=n , and you get your desired length of walks that you are after. QED Hope this helps! 441 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
