What is the maximum number of edge of a planar graph?If you don't fix the number of vertices of your graph, the answer is of course infinite : take for instance a cycle as big as you want ... What is more interesting is to answer the question at a given number of vertices v  v . Here,  Euler's formule on planar connected graphs (Planar graph) give you the answer : v−e+f=2  v−e+f=2 , e  e being the number of edges of the graph and f  f being its number of faces. Thus, you can maximize the number of edges by maximizing the number of faces. The smallest face you can make is a triangle, and thus the graph maximizing the number of edges has to be made of triangles. Now, what is the biggest number of triangles we can do with v  v vertices ? Well, with 3 vertices you can only make a triangle, so it makes 2 faces (don't forget the outer face). Now consider, you have found the graph for v−1  v−1 vertices. The graph for v  v vertices can be found by adding a vertex in the former graph. This vertex has to be put in a face, e.g. in a triangle. It is not hard then to be convinced that the best you can do is add 3 triangles (and remove one big) by linking the new vertex to the three vertices of the triangle it is in. At the end, we get that the number of faces we can make with v  v vertices is 2(v−2)  2(v−2) , (with v≥3  v≥3 ). Thanks to Euler's formula, the final answer is : e=v+2(v−2)−2=3(v−2).  e=v+2(v−2)−2=3(v−2). 309 Views · View Upvotes
