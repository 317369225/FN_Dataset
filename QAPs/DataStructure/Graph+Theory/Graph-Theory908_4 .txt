If you own a business and have a customer list (first/last name), what would be the most useful data about these customers to help grow your business?Other answers are also good here. Not to be simple, but all of the data can be useful. Where they live, how old they are, gender, income, why they bought from you, or not. What they bought, and why. Please ask permission and then get what you can. Map the data against your business to see if it gives you ideas about where and who to sell to, what to offer existing customers and much more. 226 Views  View Upvotes
