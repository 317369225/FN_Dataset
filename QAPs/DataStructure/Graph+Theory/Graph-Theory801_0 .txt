Can maximal matching of a graph be equal to maximum match?Yes, A matching in a graph is a set of edges that have no common vertex. And a matching is maximal if adding any edge to that set of edges would result in at least two edges to have a common vertex. Besides, maximum matching is itself a maximal matching because adding any edge to the maximum matching will result in two edges having vertices in common (i.e. ruining the matching). In fact a maximum matching is a maximal matching whose number of edges are maximum. 136 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Apoorva Sahay
