Are disconnected graph different graphs?Suppose, I have a graph containing names which are connected through property synonym. Can it be considered that each connected component is a different graph in itself? Or, are they part of a bigger graph just because they follow same connection logic?Any subset of nodes in a graph defines an induced subgraph. A connected component is a particular example of such a subset and it’s handy because you can partition the graph into such subgraphs without losing any edges. Ultimately, it’s up to you whether to consider it one big graph or a collection of smaller graphs. It’s fine either way, just use whatever convention is most convenient for what you’re doing. 192 Views · View Upvotes
