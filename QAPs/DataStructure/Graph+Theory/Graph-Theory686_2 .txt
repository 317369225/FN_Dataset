What can I do to keep skills I learned in my degree sharp?Majored in Chem & Math. Due to a poor job market I haven't been actively using the skills as much as I'd like. My focus: Organic and Physical Chemistry, Calculus, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra. Sometimes this phase feels like a slow mental death. What can I do/use to fix this? (Apart from Quora)I worry about the same things. A professor used to tell me that professional athletes train several times a week and so should professional scholars. I force myself to spend about an hour a day learning a new type of mathematics, physics, or science. Right now I'm working through John Taylor's book on classical mechanics. My vector calculus education was weak, so I view this as a good way to review and improve on it. There's no real point in continually reviewing the stuff you already know. You'll see it again later if you keep learning. You definitely don't want to stop thinking about your discipline. Keep challenging yourself and you'll have no problems remembering. Keep in mind that the big picture is most important. I don't remember the exact statement and proof of every theory I've learned, but I know approximate statements and exactly where I can find the real statement should I need it. I reference my linear algebra book very often. Edit: For you specifically, you might be interested in a physics text. If you like physical chemistry then pick up a book on quantum. Dynamical systems might also be interesting to you. 250 Views  View Upvotes
