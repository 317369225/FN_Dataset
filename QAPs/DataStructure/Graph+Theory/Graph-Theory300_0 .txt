If I'm drawing a graph of percent error and no value is over 40%, do I still have to go up to 100% on the y axis?On a graph you can scale the axes as desired. Usually the scale is set so the data takes up most of the vertical range, this allows small changes to be seen. Suppressing the baseline can also help. Graphing is sort of an art form since you can make small changes look large simply by manipulating the axis ranges. Reading graphs then becomes a skill, allowing you to read between the lines. 122 Views
