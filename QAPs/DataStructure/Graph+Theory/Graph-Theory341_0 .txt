Do matching theory only applies to bipartite graph?Can matching theory be also apply to any other graphs, such as complete graph? Additional Question: Is the use/sense of the matching in other graphs the same with the bipartite graphs(which is a special case of a network flow problem)?You can attempt to find matchings of any graph. Indeed, the Hosoya index is one more than the total number of matchings of a graph. There is also the Matching polynomial, which is a formal power series where each coefficient of xk xk is the number of matchings having k k edges in the graph. (In practice, this will end up being a polynomial.) 237 Views  View Upvotes
