If you own a business and have a customer list (first/last name), what would be the most useful data about these customers to help grow your business?How they found you. This way you know what advertising is most affective and can adapt your efforts accordingly. Also, their demographic information (age, race, etc., sex, etc.). That way you know who you're appealing to. The better you understand your customer the better you can reach them. Hope this helps! 155 Views  View Upvotes
