What is the relationship between belief propagation and factor graph?In my mind, factor graph is a graphical expression of belief propagation. However, factor graph also can describe process other than belief propagation.Factor graph is a type of graphical model. You can convert other graphical models such as a Markov Network into a factor graph. Belief propagation is an inference algorithm, which can be used for computing marginal probabilities of the nodes(variables) in a graphical model. You can use belief propagation to compute marginal probabilities of nodes in a factor graph, Markov network etc. Belief propagation gives exact solution in case of tree structured graphs, and approximate solutions in case of loopy graphs. 252 Views  View Upvotes
