Why does the parent graph √x result in only positive y values?When we take the square root of a number it returns both a positive and negative value. Why do we exclude the negative values when we graph the √x . Note: I understand the graph would no longer be a funtion of x.We ignore because it doesn’t exist. But wait, there’s more! The other side of the graph is imaginary. The other half of the x-values actually don’t fall on the y-axis. They fall on the imaginary i axis. The cool thing is that your question is perfect for explaining imaginary values. One unit of i is equal to \sqrt{-1} This means that at x=-1, the graph is plotted at i=1. Then, when x=2, i=2. The i axis falls in the third dimension so it is perpendicular to both the x and y axis. And actually it is still a function of x. Good question! 14 Views
