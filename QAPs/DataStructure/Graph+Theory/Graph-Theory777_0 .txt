What does the sequence A027624 for "Number of independent vertex sets in the n-hypercube graph Q_n" mean?An independent vertex set is a set of vertices no two of which are connected by an edge. A maximal independent vertex (MIV) set is one in which no vertex can be added to the set without being edge-connected to an existing member of the set. An n-hypercube is the analogue in n-dimensions of the square (a 2-hypercube) and cube (a 3-hypercube). A 0-hypercube is a single point, a single vertex, a single MIV set. A 1-hypercube is a line with two vertices which form two MIV sets (each end). A 2-hypercube has four vertices (the corners of the square) which form two MIV sets (opposite corners). A 3-hypercube has eight vertices (the corners of a cube) which form six MIV sets as in this diagram: An n-hypercube has 2n 2n vertices and the problem of finding independent sets is an NP-hard problem. Hopefully these descriptions at least allow you to get your head around the problem... 153 Views  View Upvotes
