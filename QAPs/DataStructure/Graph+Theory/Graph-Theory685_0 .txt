If a graph G contains a bridge, e, is it possible to construct a spanning tree which does not include this edge?Of course not. A bridge is an edge that disconnects the graph when removed. Just like a bridge between two islands disconnects the two islands when removed. If I have two islands that are connected only by a bridge, how can you visit every place (node) on both islands on foot without using the bridge? Common sense. 496 Views  View Upvotes
