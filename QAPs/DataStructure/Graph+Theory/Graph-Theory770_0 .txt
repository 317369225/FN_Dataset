Can we draw 3-edge-connected graph with 7 vertices?Sure. E.g., the complete graph on 7 vertices is 3-edge-connected. (A graph is 3-edge-connected if the smallest cut has at least 3 edges. Equivalently, by Menger's theorem, a graph is 3-edge-connected if each pair of vertices is connected by three edge-disjoint paths. This is clearly the case for the complete graph.) Another example is the Wheel graph W7 W7 . This one happens to be planar, so it is easier to draw :) 680 Views  View Upvotes
