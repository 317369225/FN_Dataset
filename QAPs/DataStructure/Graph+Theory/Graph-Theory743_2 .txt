What do the matrices represent in the following pictures?Thank you very much,I am learning R language by myself right now,and now I feel it's a little difficult for me... Is there any good books for beginners? Thank you very much!The matrices in the image are often called Adjacency matrices. It is one of the way to represent graphs. First matrix represent a undirected graph which is represented pictorially below it. It is easy to interpret it, if aij==1 aij==1  (aij (aij signifies element in i i th row and j j th column) it means that there is an edge between node numbered i and j (for example since V0 V0 and V1 V1 are connected a10 a10 and a01 a01 are 1). Directed graph can be interpreted similarly , only difference being if there is edge from node i i to j j then it's not necessary for an edge to exist from j j to i i , unlike undirected example, This is the reason adjacency matrix for undirected graph is always symmetric while directed graph may or may not be. 202 Views  View Upvotes
