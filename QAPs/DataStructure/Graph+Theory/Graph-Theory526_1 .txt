How do I tell the multiplicity of a zero of a polynomial graph when only shown the graph?If the curve just goes right through the x-axis, the zero is of multiplicity 1. If the curve just briefly touches the x-axis and then reverses direction, it is of order 2. If it gets briefly flat at the x-axis and then continues in the same direction, it is (probably) of order 3. With higher orders, the amount of "flatness" on the x-axis increases. All higher (odd /even) orders then continue in the (same / reversed) direction. 185 Views  View Upvotes
