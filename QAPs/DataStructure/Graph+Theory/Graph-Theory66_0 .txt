What is an Ab Initio graph an what are its applications?Ab Initio is a suite of products catering to bulk data processing (Extract Transform Load - ETL, GDE), configuration management (Enterprise Meta Environment), metadata management (Metadata Hub), data quality (Data Quality Environment), business rules abstraction (Business Rules Environment, Express It) and data virtualization tool (Query It). Ab Initio’s  ETL applications are capable of processing high volumes of data efficiently and can handle high levels of transformation complexities in large and complex Data Warehouse environments. The transformation logic for Ab Initio ETL applications is written using a GUI called Graphical Development Environment (GDE) and the “code” is called a graph. An Ab Initio Graph is essentially a visual representation of data flow and transformations within. ETL applications are comprised of one or more graphs to accomplish a data processing task in batch or real time mode. 44 Views
