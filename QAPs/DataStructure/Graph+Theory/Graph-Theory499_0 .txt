How can I sort 64 children (35b,29g) into two classes so the number of friendships is maximised?I have 64 children (35 boys, 29 girls) to sort into two classes. I need to balance the number of boys and girls, so half the boys are in each class. I ask each child to nominate 3 friends. Is there any programmatic way to sort these children so the number of friendships in each class is maximised?Without the boy/girl balance, this is a textbook instance of the Minimum cut problem. I believe that it’s NP-hard in the general case, efficiently approximable in the case that friendships resemble an Erdős–Rényi model, and not efficiently approximable in the case that friendships resemble a Scale-free network (which, in general, they should). It’s probably worth computing the distribution of friendship in-links; that is, how many students were named zero times? How many once? How many three times? How many ten? If they’re clustered pretty consistently around 3, then Karger's algorithm is a randomized algorithm for the general min-cut problem, but I’m not quite sure how to modify it to deal with the boy/girl constraint. I’m sure that you could do something heuristic to make it work, and then just run enough trials to try to find something reasonable. 478 Views · View Upvotes
