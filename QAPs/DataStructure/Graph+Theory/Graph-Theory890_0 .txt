Are all graphs constructable in 3-space so their lines don't cross?This is true for all finite simple graphs. Draw the parametric curve (x,y,z)=(t,t2,t3) x,y,z)=(t,t2,t3) in space. Put vertex i i of the graph on point (i,i2,i3) (i,i2,i3) , and the edges are just straight lines connecting those points. The reason this works is the curve that we put the graph on is twisted, any four points on the curve are in general position (not in the same plane) so their line segments don't intersect. 160 Views  View Upvotes
