What is the example of underlying undirected graph?Depending on the context this can mean two things: A synonym for induced subgraph. That is, I want to direct the reader to a part of the graph G for possibly structural reasons. This comes up more commonly when an algorithm takes advantage of a particular structure in the graph (e.g., the graph contains at most one cycle), because its induced subgraph less the cycle is a tree (so you want to remove the cycle). It can be where you replace the directed edges with undirected edges, as shown here Graph Theory (right before Platonic Graphs). They give an example on the page. Hope this helps! 240 Views
