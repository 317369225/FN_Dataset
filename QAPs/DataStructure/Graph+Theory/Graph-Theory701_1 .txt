How do I plot graphs from Excel data where there are different situations?I have 5 speeds[1000-5000rpm], I have around 13 cases of Length / Diameter Ratio, I Have volumetric efficiency for each speed which is shown below, but how to link different speed with volumetric efficiency in graph. I need X axis to be speed, Y axis to be L/d ratio and Color to represent efficienGroup your efficiencies into categories, then enter each category as a separate data series in a speed-by-L/D scatter plot or line chart. Excel doesn't have the facility (that I'm aware of) to plot smooth spectrum of color, but you can at least get some basic color information going on. 48 Views  View Upvotes
