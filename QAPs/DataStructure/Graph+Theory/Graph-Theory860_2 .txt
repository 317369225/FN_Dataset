Why does the neighborhood of a given vertex of a graph not contain the vertex itself?By this I mean, in the equation, N(5) = {4,2,1} where 5 is the vertex or origin node of the neighborhood, it does not include itself. I'm giving a presentation about this and I thought this might be an interesting question.Firstly, there is no neighbourhood of a graph. But there is neighbourhood of a vertex in a graph. Definition here: Neighbourhood (graph theory) I don't get your point. Why do you think that the neighbourhood of a vertex does need to contain that vertex? By the way, according to definition. Neighbourhood of a vertex is a induced subgraph having incident vertexes . So neighbourhood of 5 is a graph G1 = (V1, E1) with V1 = {1,2,4} and E1={(1,2)}. 63 Views  View Upvotes
