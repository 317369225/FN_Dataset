If a graph G contains a bridge, e, is it possible to construct a spanning tree which does not include this edge?The definition of a bridge e = (v, w) is that G' = G - e has one more connected component than G did. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to write a proof assuming that G is connected, and we're just going to analyze the case in which we are creating two components. The general case is easily derived from this. Hence, suppose that you construct a spanning tree T of G such that e is not in T. Since T is a spanning tree, there is a unique path from v to w using edges only in T, call it P. We know that P goes like this: v, p_1, ..., p_r, p_{r+1}, ..., p_t, w. That is, P starts at v, ends at w, and goes through nodes p_k for k in 1 to t. At some point in P (called (p_r, p_{r+1})), we cross from the connected component in G' in which v was, to the connected component in which w was. This means that the edge from p_r to p_{r+1} connects the two components of G'. Hence, we originally had another way to connect these two components, meaning that G' does not have two connected components, and thus e is not a bridge. 50 Views  View Upvotes
