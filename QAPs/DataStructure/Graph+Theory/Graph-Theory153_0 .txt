How do I make a graph using two separate charts in Excel?I'm testing Selection Sort and getting the time it takes for the algorithm to sort some elements. I'm supposed to put that info into a chart and plot a graph with it but the things is: I have two charts, one for the Best Case and the other one for the Worst case. How to put both into one graph?You can use primary and secondary charts to make two graphs of the same x axis, but different chart or different y axis. If you have both the same x axus and y axus, you simply add additional data in the chart. 56 Views
