The opposit vertices of a square are (3,4) and (1,-1).What are the coordinates of other two vertices?Let given points be B and D and we have to determine A and C. First find the midpoint M of BD, slope of BD and length of BD. Now, slope of AC= tanQ= -1/slope of BD. Now find sinQ and cosQ. Let M be (a,b) and MB=BD/2=r. Write equation of AC in parametric form using this information (x-a)/cosQ = (y-b)/sinQ = r For +r you will get one value of (x,y), for -r another. They will correspond to A andC. 223 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Akansha Agrawal
