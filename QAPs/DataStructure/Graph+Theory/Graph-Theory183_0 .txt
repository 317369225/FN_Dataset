How should I practice bar graph for CAT?When these questions are not provided with perfect values how should I assume the values? Say, if the bar’s height is between 200 to 250 which value should I take? Is there any way to follow?Bar graph questions are difficult to read if the numerical value for every bar isn't mentioned. If the bar’s height is between any two range, you should follow the following method. If it is in between 200 and 250, then Firstly, break it into 2 halves. Each measuring 25 units. Then take an estimate of the bar height to be closer to the first half or the second half. Secondly, if the first cut doesn't work, then break each such half into further two halves. Then take an estimate as to the number represented on the bar graph. Usually, when these situations arise, your options are well spaced apart to allow guesstimate/approximation readings to the bar graph lead to the correct option. But, the close-to-correct approximations come with more practise; Keep solving more questions on these type and you will understand how to read these values. To kick-start your preparation, I would recommend you to register at PRAQTISE where your preparation is completely on the lines of Computer Adaptive Testing(CAT) pedagogy. Remember, to crack the test, you need regular practise, strong strategy and belief in yourself. 201 Views · View Upvotes
