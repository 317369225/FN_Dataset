Is there any software developer profession that uses more-than-basic algorithms in their day-to-day job?As a specialization, DSP firmware engineers will often use specialized algorithms to squeeze maximum performance. Another set of software engineers who would use non-basic algorithms would be those engineers who specialize in control systems or physical layer software. I would say that most engineers spend their time in more mundane programming tasks because using specialized algorithms is associated with more mission-critical system features and thus subject to more intense review. 299 Views
