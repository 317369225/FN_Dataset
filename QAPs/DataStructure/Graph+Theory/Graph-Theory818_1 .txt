How do you estimate the area under the graph?Awesome question with many different solutions: If the chart is drawn on chart paper you could estimate by counting the cells underneath. If the chart is drawn on normal standard size paper you could weigh the sheet of paper and figure out what area it represents by the axes. then cut out the chart area, weigh that and determine w-chart/w-sheet * area. If the chart is in Excel, you can try to fit a polynomal trendline and calculate its integral. Also if the chart is in Excel you can approach its shape in a new line built up by triangles and rectangles and adding up those areas. In order to get your chart into excel I recommend using a digitizing program such as digitize-it! 59 Views
