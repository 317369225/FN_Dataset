How can I find largest subgraph G' of graph G in which vertex with lowest degree V exist?One of the ways to store the graph is using adjacency list. While storing the graph, maintain one more array, where the size of array = number of nodes. Each entry A[i] in the array would be storing the degree of the node i. Initialize the array with 0 for all the entries. While you start storing the graph in the adjacency list, for each edge e=(u,v), increase the count in the array for the nodes u and v. After storing all the edges, you can iterate through the array to find the minimum. Once you get the minimum, just iterate your adjaceny list for that particular node. 115 Views
