Why does the neighborhood of a given vertex of a graph not contain the vertex itself?By this I mean, in the equation, N(5) = {4,2,1} where 5 is the vertex or origin node of the neighborhood, it does not include itself. I'm giving a presentation about this and I thought this might be an interesting question.Simply because if asked who are your neighbours, you don't mention yourself. Same thing in graph theory. However, if a vertex had an incident edge looping to itself, then that vertex would be its own neighbour in that case. This never happens for simple graphs though. 186 Views  View Upvotes
