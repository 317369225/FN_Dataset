Why does a 7-regular graph on 20 vertices have 70 edges?This is easy if you know what it means to be 7-regular and what some call the first theorem of graph theory. A graph is said to be 7-regular if every vertex has degree 7. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident with that vertex. The first theorem of graph theory says the sum of degrees is twice the number of edges. So the sum of degrees is given by 7*20=140 since each vertex has identical degree. This is twice the edges so the number of edges is 70. As for why the first theorem of graph theory is true, think of it like this. Each edge connects exactly two vertices (unless your in a hyper graph but I doubt that you are). So if you add up all the degrees, then you counted that edge twice, once on one vertex and once on the other. Since this happens for every edge the sum of degrees is twice the number of edges. 89 Views  View Upvotes
