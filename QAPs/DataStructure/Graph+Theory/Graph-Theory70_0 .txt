How do you find the number of loops in a graph, given number of nodes and number of branches?Theoretically it can be done with this formula: L=B-N+1 where L= loops B=Branches N= Nodes But if you want to solve it graphically it may to simple for small graphs but is laborious with large graphs 32 Views  View Upvotes
