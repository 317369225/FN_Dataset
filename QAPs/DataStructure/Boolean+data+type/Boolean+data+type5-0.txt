Does using bool data type in C++ or boolean in Java actually save memory of compiler pad for faster access?
As a layman: If it doesnot save memory, why would it be in existence. As a programmer: you can try out this C code in your terminal #include<stdio.h> struct sample { int m; unsigned b:16; unsigned c:8; char ch; }; void main() { struct sample s1; printf("\n%d\n",sizeof(s1)); printf("\n%d\n",sizeof(s1.m)); printf("\n%d\n",sizeof(s1.ch)); } Try various combinations by changing the positions of m, b, c and ch, as well as bit values of b and c. You will see the magic. you have my word. :D PS - bit programming is the base knowledge one needs to have in embedded domain, where you are supposed to play with bits.
