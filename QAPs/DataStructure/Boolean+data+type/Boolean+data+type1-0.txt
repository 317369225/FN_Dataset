Why the boolean data type bit depth is jvm specific?
Boolean data type's bit depth is JVM dependent because it depends on the implementation of boolean logic on the specific system. The boolean data could be implemented on a single bit as 1 or 0 or could even hold a byte long space. However, the depth of the Boolean data type though variable on various JVMs really does not matter because implementation of Boolean logic remains constant across all JVMs. You can completely ignore the space it takes on each JVM because anyway there is abundant memory for almost all applications.
