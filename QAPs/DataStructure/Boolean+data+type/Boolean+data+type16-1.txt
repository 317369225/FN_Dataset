What are the advantages and disadvantages of these data types: integer, floating point, string and boolean?Well this is a bit obscure question I think. You can compare the advantages and disadvantages of similar things. Things you used to do the same task. But when it comes to different things you used to do very different things how you are going to compare them ? You use Integers to store numbers like 1,2,3 or -1,-2 as the name implies integers. And floating numbers to store floating values like 2.3. And I hope if not the case Big integers you wouldn't use strings to store numbers. Yeah in that case using string data types for numbers would be a disadvantage. LOL. And if you are using an integer type to store a value which could be 1 or 2 and only those two values. It¡¯s disadvantage, because you could have used boolean right ?
