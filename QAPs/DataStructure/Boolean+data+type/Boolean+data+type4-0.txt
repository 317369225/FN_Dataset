If a single bit (logical 1 or 0) is enough to represent a Boolean value, why is the size of Boolean data type kept on one byte? Does it lead to wastage of memory?
Because the CPU can't address anything smaller than a byte. From Wikipedia:   Historically, a byte was the number of   bits used to encode a single character   of text in a computer and it is   for this reason the basic addressable   element in many computer   architectures. So byte is the basic addressable unit,  below which computer architecture cannot address. And since there  doesn't (probably) exist computers which support 4-bit byte, you don't  have 4-bit bool etc. However, if you can design such an architecture which can address 4-bit as basic addressable unit, then you will have bool of size 4-bit then, on that computer only!
