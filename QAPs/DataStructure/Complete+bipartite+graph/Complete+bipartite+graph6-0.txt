Geometry: Are you able to link each of these 3 triangles with each of these 3 squares with no link crossing one another?
We're trying to embed the complete bipartite graph K 3,3   into the plane.  This graph has six vertices (three triangles and three squares) and nine edges (one for each pair of a triangle and a square, for a total of 3 x 3 = 9). Suppose we can perform this planar embedding.  Since the Euler characteristic of a planar connected graph is 2, we have 2=V−E+F=6−9+F=F−3  so it follows that F=5  . A face has to have at least three edges.  Since K 3,3   is bipartite it doesn't contain any triangles (a triangle would necessarily involve connecting two triangles or two squares), so each face has at least four edges.  On the other hand, an edge is incident to precisely two faces. This motivates us to count the pairs (e,f)  where e  is an edge and f  is a face incident to e  .  On the one hand, since each edge is incident to precisely two faces, there are precisely 9 x 2 = 18 such pairs.  On the other hand, since each face is incident to at least four edges, there are at least 20 such pairs.  But these can't both be true, so the original assumption must have been flawed.
