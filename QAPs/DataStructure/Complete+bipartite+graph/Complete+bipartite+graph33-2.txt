Why is divisibility by two (even/odd) considered an important quality for numbers? Why not divisibility by 3? Or 17?
There are 2 sexes. Human has 2 legs, 2 hands, 2 eyes, 2 ears, etc. That is the main reason. And if you ask further, why there are 2 of so many things by nature in the first place? This probably is because 2 this the simplest form of multiple, and nature is always limited in resource so she prefers 2 as multiple. Even and odd is a partition with 2. So with the same reason of limited or simple, it is preferred by people when it is enough to categorize things. But physics doesn't seem to prefer 2. We can talk about 3 dimensions or 4 dimensions, even though 2 dimensions is also very important. In the solar system you have 1 Sun and 8 (or 9) planets. Earth has 1 moon, not 2. Mathematics is closer to physics, it doesn't seem to prefer 2 as well (unless it is chosen by the reason of simplicity for human). 2 is an unique even prime, because you categorize primes with even and odd concept. If you say prime 2 is the only prime divisible by 2, then you can say prime 3 is the only prime divisible by 3 as well. Prime 2 is only unique as a smallest prime. 0 is unique in sum group, 1 is unique in product group, but not 2. If you are still not persuaded pure mathematics doesn't seem to prefer 2, there is an interesting example. In an arithmetic sum, 1+2+3+⋯+n=n(n+1)2   division of 2 comes up by nature because the problem can be easily resolved with a symmetry of 2. See 2 copies of 1+2+3+4  form a 4×5  rectangle. Then we have square sum, 1 2 +2 2 +3 2 +⋯+n 2 =n(n+1)(2n+1)6   division of 6 is actually division of 3 in disguise. But the numerator doesn't seem to come up as smooth as the arithmetic sum. If we go further, 1 3 +2 3 +3 3 +⋯+n 3 =(n(n+1)2 ) 2   division 4 comes up by nature, but again the numerator doesn't seem to follow any pattern. You may conclude, ah ha, divided by 2 is actually more natural or more satisfying even in pure mathematics. But that's just because you look at the wrong place. If instead we look at, 1×2+2×3+3×4+⋯+n×(n+1)=n(n+1)(n+2)3   as an extension of arithmetic sum, division of 3 comes up by nature because the problem can be resolved with a symmetry of 3. See the example of 3 copies of 1×2+2×3+3×4  form a 3×4×5  rectangular prism. Furthermore, 1×2×3+2×3×4+⋯+n×(n+1)×(n+2)=n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)4   division of 4 comes up by nature because the problem can be resolved with a symmetry of 4. In general, ∑ n k=1 ∏ k+m−1 p=k p=∏ n+m k=n km+1   , division of m+1 comes up by nature because the problem can be resolved with a symmetry of m+1. With the notation of ∏ n+m−1 k=n k=n m ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯     , we define the new default power of discrete mathematics. You can rewrite above equations as, ∑ n k=1 k 1 ¯ ¯ ¯   =n 2 ¯ ¯ ¯   2   , ∑ n k=1 k 2 ¯ ¯ ¯   =n 3 ¯ ¯ ¯   3   , ∑ n k=1 k 3 ¯ ¯ ¯   =n 4 ¯ ¯ ¯   4    ∑ n k=1 k m ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯   =n m+1 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯   m+1   you are in the front door of discrete Calculus.
