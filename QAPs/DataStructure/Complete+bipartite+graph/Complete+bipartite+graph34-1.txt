For a 2k-edge-connected loopless graph, can we show that it has a k-edge-connected bipartite subgraph? (This subgraph must contain all the vertices of the original graph)k-edge-connected graph Bipartite graph
Example 1: Here is a 2-edge-connected graph, and by removing the blue line, we get a 1-edge-connected bipartite subgraph, by taking alternating nodes. So statement seems to be true. Example 2: Let us try with 4-edge-connected graph. If each node has 4 edges, there must be minimum 5 nodes total. In the smallest case of 5 nodes, we must have the complete graph, from which, by removing some edges, we can get the following 2-edge-connected bipartite subgraph, where the partitions are of size 2 and 3. So statement is true for this also. Â We still have to show this for all k and for all graphs for each k.
