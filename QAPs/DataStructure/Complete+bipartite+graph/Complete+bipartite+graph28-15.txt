Originally Answered: I have been doing competitive programming for like 4 months now. I just am not improving. My problem solving ability has not increased even a bit. What should I do?Keep working on it! keep practicing every day.. no matter what happends! Read and learn every day! Ask your friends for help... but don´t quit! Keep working, daily work is the most important thing you have! Don´t think that you are not improving.. you are learning.. each time yo do a problem! My personal experience: 4 months doing competitive programming too... like you! I began doing 250´s DIV 2.. and when i began, i failed everyone of them.. it costed me about 2 or 3 hours to understand a problem :( Then i began to practice EVERY day... working EVERY day on them.. i am writting a blog, then when i finish a problem, i post there trying to explain my approach! Maybe you can use it! TopBlogCoder I have done more than 350 DIV 2.. and i continue doing them... but i am able to do DIV 2 500 too.. but still practicing 250´s. I read everyday, trying to do at least 2 or 3 problems/day! Then.. keep working! you can do it! If you need some help.... look at other people codes.. my blog.. or ask me or some friend of you for help! :) Good luck
