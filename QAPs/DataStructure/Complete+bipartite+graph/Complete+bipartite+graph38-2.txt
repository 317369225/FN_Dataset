What's the relationship between neural networks and quantum computation?
Originally Answered: Is quantum computing in some way a natural platform for what is currently achieved with neural networking?Neurons are like the bird's feathers and flapping wings: They are not essential. Airplanes can fly, but have no feathers, nor flapping wings. Since the Wright brothers, we know that the essence of flight: Lift, weight, thrust and drag. In the same way, neurons are not essential for intelligence: • Mars rovers, autonomous drones and driver-less cars are autonomous and  intelligent. However, they do not heavily rely on brain simulation; • My fundamental approach to knowledge technology (open source: The world's only integrated knowledge technology) is worldwide unique in reasoning autonomously in natural language, because scientists fail to integrate reasoning and natural language. But my system doesn't need brain simulation - nor does it rely on an Artificial Neural Network. What do Mars rovers, autonomous drones, driver-less cars and my fundamental approach to knowledge technology have in common? What is the essence of autonomous intelligence? Answer: The use of a natural source of intelligence. Mars rovers, autonomous drones, driver-less cars use GPS, radar, cameras and a map to navigate autonomously, and my fundamental approach to knowledge technology utilizes natural laws of intelligence in grammar to reason autonomously in natural language. So, to answer you question: Neural Networking is a nice technique for a very specific task, but it has nothing to do with intelligence. Now regarding Quantum Computing: Are computer bits intelligent? Neither is Quantum Computing. However, it might solve some scientific problems.
