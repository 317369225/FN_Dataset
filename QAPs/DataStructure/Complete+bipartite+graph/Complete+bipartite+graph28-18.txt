What is the best strategy to improve my skills in competitive programming in 2-3 months?My knowledge is structure programming  in C++ I solved around 50 problems all of them are basic problems Samuel.Soliman - A2 Online Judge
Originally Answered: How do I start competitive programming?Competitive programming is now a very vast field. Choose your wars, or in this case, choose your platforms. Here's a list of some of the plaforms. Competitive Programming Sites By Popularity 1. CodeChef 2. HackerRank 3. HackerEarth 4. Topcoder 5.  Kaggle 6. LeetCode 7. CodeForces 8. SPOJ 9. Project Euler 10. CodingBat 11. UVA Online Judge 12. CodeEval 13. CoderByte 14. Codingame 15. CheckiO 16. SQL-EX.RU 17. Rosalind 18. CodeAbbey 19. HPC University 20. MLComp  NOTES: -  Most are based on the Online Judge system - TopCoder and Kaggle have their focus on Data Science - Codingame has their focus on game playing programs, so this includes intelligent solutions, Machine Learning, AI - MLComp is focused on Machine Learning - Rosalind is focused on Bioinformatics - SQL exercises is the only one in the list focusing on SQL. I sent a query (pun intended) to HackerRank, and they said they have plans on adding SQL, too.  - HPC Univesity is focused on High Performance Computing (HPC) - CheckiO is focused on Python - Most on the list, especially the commercial ones are pitching employment, just keep this in mind - CodeEval is VERY focused on Employment, has about 150 problems - LeetCode is focused on Tech Interview Problems, has about 150 problems - HackerRank includes other specialties from the other sites like AI (Codingame), Data Science (TopCoder, Kaggle), Python Tutorials (CheckiO), Eulerian Problems (Project Euler). - HackerRank provides a good calendar that contains events from other sites like HackerEarth, CodeChef, URI Online Judge, TopCoder, CodeForces - HackerRank-only features: Functional Programming specialization, Bash specialization, Linux Text utilities specialization Check this Competitive Programming Sites By Popularity from time to time, because it's always being updated.
