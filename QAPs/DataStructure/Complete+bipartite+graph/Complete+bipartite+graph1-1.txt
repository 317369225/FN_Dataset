Consider a bipartite graph. Let the vertex-set be A U B. Is there an efficient algorithm to find the minimum cardinality set (say S) of vertices in B which have all the vertices in A as neighbors, given that such a set S exists?
Seems there is no efficient algorithm to this problem. This problem is just a variant of set cover problem which is NP complete and hence this problem too is NP complete. Lets see how this problem becomes a set cover problem. Lets consider vertices from set B. Each vertex may be connected to zero or more vertices in the set A. So, corresponding to each vertex we actually have a subset of vertices in set A. If at all such a minimal subset of B i.e. S exists then union of sets corresponding to each vertex in B should actually be equal to A. So, this problem reduces to finding the minimum number of these subsets corresponding to each vertex in set B whose union is A. This is exactly the set cover problem which is NP complete.
