Why is Incidence Geometry important?
Incidence geometry was used by Jacques Tits in the study of finite simple groups and a major chunk of it was developed by him then. In some way, he was reversing the trend of studying geometry via group theory. Some of the concepts introduced or studied by him are generalized polygons, polar spaces and buildings. These are important geometrical objects for studying groups of Lie type. In late 70's Buekenhout developed the notion of Diagram Geometries in hope of using a geometrical approach (in the sense of Tits) to classify finite simple groups. Even though the classification was completed without the full use of this approach it is still a very important concept to study the sporadic groups in a uniform manner. Before Tits, Beniamino Segre initiated the study of projective/affine spaces over finite fields. He used some classical algebraic geometry and combinatorial techniques to prove several highly non trivial results. In words of Bueknhout [3] " In many respects all of us, including Tits, were students of Segre". The projective and affine spaces over finite fields are now important objects for combinatorics, coding theory, design theory, etc as I have mentioned in my earlier answer: What is the significance of the projective plane in mathematics?. Finite geometry is also used in the study of finite semifield, aka, non associative division algebras (see [1]). Incidence geometry also plays a significant role in graph theory, as regular near polygons are an important class of distance regular graphs which in turn are important for the study of association schemes. Moreover, generalized polygons (buildings of rank 2) are precisely the Moore graphs of even girth and hence they give important infinite classes of cages (see chapter 3 in [2] and the Section 2.2 in [10]). Description of all known cages is available here: http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graph.... Generalized polygons are also used in constructing extremal cycle free bipartite graphs [13]. As another example, the bipartite graphs formed by taking incidence between points and hyperplanes of a finite projective space form highly expanding graphs with the least number of edges, see [9]. Another application of some structures from incidence geometry, like generalized polygons, is construction of LDPC codes [11], [12]. For a historical overview of incidence geometry see [3] and [4]. In my opinion [5] and [6] are good introductory texts for this subject. Some of the important research topics in Galois Geometry (geometry over finite fields) can be found in [7].
