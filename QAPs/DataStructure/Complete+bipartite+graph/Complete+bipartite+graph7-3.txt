What are some ideas for a research project/paper on number theory/computer science/mathematics?I am a high schooler and really interested in number theory and computer science.
For number theory, one unsolved problem is the Goldbach conjecture. In computer science, the P/NP problem is one such area, and the world still needs faster algorithms for many elementary applications. You can foray into cryptography which uses number theory as well as computer science. Cryptography will seem really fun to you given you're in high school, like impressing your friends by knowing this and that cipher and trust me, it feels way cooler when Nicholas Cage mentions a name of cipher in National Treasure films and you know about it. Apart from proofs, many stuffs need explanations as well, for example, the fifth postulate of Euclid still needs a good explanation. My favourite is graph theory. It can be used to model almost anything, from micro processors to world maps. Many interesting things can be done with it. Once our professor gave us a theorem to prove in the lines of Collatz conjecture, me and my friends were able to insert graph theory into that as well. P.S- it didn't work out. :p
