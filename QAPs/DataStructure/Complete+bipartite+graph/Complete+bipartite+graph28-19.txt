Originally Answered: I am starting with competitive programming. From where should I start?Practice about competitive programming problems in various online judges : - Codeforces  is one example of good sites to motivate yourself, it has rating system which you will get if you join a contest hosted by the site itself. - UVa Online Judge - Home is an example where you can learn specific algorithm as it is integrated with uhunt (uHunt :: UVa Hunting) which will track your progress for a specific material. For the book, I'd suggest you the Competitive Programming book which will train you about all things you need to know before you go into competitive programming environment. This book provides exercises and discussion for each materials and we can track our progress through uhunt. There are many other tools and/or online judges out there filled with beautiful and challenging problems, but I think what I've mentioned above is enough for a starter.
