Originally Answered: Should I get involved in competitive programming? How do I begin?Absolutely. Competitive programming is like going to the gym for your brain: it helps exercise cognitive function (and it's just plain fun =) ). You can begin with online competitive programming. Start by learning the syntax of a programming language (preferably C++ or Java for competitive programming ). Then, learn about data structures. But in all honesty, the best way is to start easy and work your way up. Rome wasn't conquered in a day. The small successes will give you the proper motivation to keep going. Otherwise, it might seem impossible. I highly recommend starting with easy sites like: Codewars.com Coderbyte CodingBat Once you are good with those, you can start learning about algorithms like searching, sorting, pathfinding, etc. String manipulation is also handy. (The Data Science Tutorials below are excellent for more advanced stuff.) Anyway, once you feel confident with the beginner stuff, you can try your hand at the Big Leagues: topcoder CodeChef codeforces.com And if you are in need of some tutorials: Data Science Tutorials Tutorials | CodeChef All in all, competitive programming is a fantastic way to keep your problem-solving skills sharp. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me. Best of luck! =)
