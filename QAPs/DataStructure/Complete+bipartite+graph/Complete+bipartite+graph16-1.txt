I was asked to solve a well known NP-complete problem in an interview. Should I refuse to solve it?
It depends on the problem. Some problems have good approximations, some problems are easily solvable for any practical input structure and size. For example, SAT solvers  are able to solve a CNF with a million variables and hundreds of thousands clauses (and even more). Many practical NP-hard problems can be solved with a modern SAT solver. Many problems can be reduced to  CNF and solved by a SAT solver reasonably fast, and maybe this is what they wanted? Always keep in mind that there is a big difference between theory and practice. For example, in theory the Simplex algorithm is exponential but in practice it beats polynomial algorithms, such as Interior point method, in most cases. This is because the exponential behavior happens only on relatively uncommon input structures.  Knowing theory is great when it advances you, never make it saddle you.
