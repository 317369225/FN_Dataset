What are some unsolved problems in mathematics?
Originally Answered: Which easy to understand mathematical problems are still unsolved and why?Wikipedia has a list of open problems in mathematics: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis... Some of those are "easy to understand", with the appropriate interpretation of "easy". The ones in number theory mostly require very little jargon to understand, and the ones in combinatorics and graph theory may require a little bit of background but not a whole lot. Certainly not all of these problems are "important", as far as we can tell. The abc conjecture in number theory is very deep and has tons of consequences. On the other hand, nothing much will happen when the Goldbach conjecture is verified; in fact, it's "almost" proved. Of course, the *methods* used to prove something like Goldbach could be brilliant and illuminating As to "why", I'd say that nobody knows *why* any problem is unsolved, other than saying that it's probably very difficult. Some of these surely have been worked on less than others, and some have been formulated much more recently than others (abc is, again, a good example of a major but very recent invention).
