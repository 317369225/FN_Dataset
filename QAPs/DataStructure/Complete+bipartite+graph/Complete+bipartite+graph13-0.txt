What are some interesting applications of Hall's marriage theorem?
I'm the kind of person for whom "application" might mean an unexpected use inside of mathematics. A doubly-stochastic matrix is a square matrix with non-negative entries, where every row and every column add up to 1. Here's such a matrix: (51214131319607201413301960) There's a particularly simple type of doubly-stochastic matrices called permutation matrices, where everything is 0 except for a single 1 in every row and every column, like this one: (010001100) Now, if you take linear combinations of permutation matrices with positive coefficients that add up to 1, you'll get a doubly-stochastic matrix. The nice thing is that, in fact, every doubly-stochastic matrix can be represented in this way. This is a theorem of Birkhoff, and it's not really very hard to show if you have the right insight - which, of course, is to use Hall's marriage theorem. The proof goes as follows: given any doubly-stochastic matrix, think of its rows as girls and its columns as guys, and connect a girl and a guy if the matrix entry at the corresponding row and column is nonzero. Now show that this bipartite graph satisfies that Hall marriage condition (every group of girls is connected to at least as many guys). With that, you're guaranteed to find a matching; pick one, find the least element indicated by the matching, and subtract the appropriate permutation matrix form your matrix. Renormalize to bring the row sums back to 1 and proceed by induction.
