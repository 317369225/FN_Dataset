Why is divisibility by two (even/odd) considered an important quality for numbers? Why not divisibility by 3? Or 17?
People define what is important and people are simple creatures. We do best with simple concepts. 1 is a really simple number but then what? 2 is the simplest number that is also distinguishing. It distinguishes between one 1 and another. The number 1 represents existence. The number 2 establishes uniqueness, or the lack of it. Dividing a thing by 2 creates 2 things.
