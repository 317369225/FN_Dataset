What are some interesting applications of Hall's marriage theorem?
Here's one that's similar in spirit to Alon Amit's answer but doesn't use fractions ;) Imagine that you are creating a Latin square. You have already written a few rows of letters/numbers and so far you have no obvious contradiction: each of your rows contains each symbol exactly once, and each column contains each symbol at most once. You still have some empty rows to fill, but now you stop and wonder: is there still a solution, or can there be a contradiction I don't see yet? Hall's marriage theorem tells you that there are no hidden contradictions -- there always is a way to finish your latin square. (Consider the bipartite graph where the left partition are the empty cells of the next row, the right partition are the symbols, and edges represent "this symbol can still appear in this cell". This graph satisfies Hall's criteria, hence it has a perfect matching -- i.e., a way to fill the next row without conflicts.) One final bit of trivia: Consider a more general version of this problem: you fill in some arbitrary cells of the latin square and again you want to know whether there still is a solution. Maybe surprisingly, this version cannot be simply reduced to matchings anymore -- in fact, it is known to be NP-complete.
