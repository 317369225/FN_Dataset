Originally Answered: Should I get involved in competitive programming? How do I begin?I'd suggest starting off small and attending local programming competitions. If you like the experience, odds are as with any other activity, you'll devote more time to it, get better at it, find avenues to interact with like minded people and generally have a good time. Good luck.
