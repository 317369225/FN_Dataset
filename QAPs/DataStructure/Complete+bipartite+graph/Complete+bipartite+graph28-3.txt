Stage 1: Setting up the base.(2 months) Try solving first 200 problems in Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) . for the first 2 months , try to do all the problems on your own. Stick with this for first 2 months till you gain confidence. Stage 2: Moving to Code Chef(2 months) Once you gain some confidence on SPOJ problems, move on to codechef and practice for next 2 months. Stage 3: Moving to Top coder (2 months) Now move to top coder and try competing in SRMs. Practice daily , try solving 2 or 3 problems on your own. It might take an hour or 5 hours but do it on your own . Trust me after 2 months you will have a very good confidence in problem solving . This is a sport , the more you train yourself the better you are.  Hope this helps.
