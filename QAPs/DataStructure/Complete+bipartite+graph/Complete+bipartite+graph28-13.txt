What is the best strategy to improve my skills in competitive programming in 2-3 months?My knowledge is structure programming  in C++ I solved around 50 problems all of them are basic problems Samuel.Soliman - A2 Online Judge
Originally Answered: I want to be good in competitive programming.How should I proceed?You are on proper track. With some more practice, perseverance and better understanding of algorithms, you can excel in competitive programming. Before you start coding, it would be best suited for you to know as many algorithms as you can, in details. Well known books like Introduction to Algorithms, Algorithm Design  would be the best place to begin with. Later, with the help of some websites like A2 Online Judge (Ahmed Aly), Problem classifier for SPOJ.pl (appspot), you can solve problems focused on a particular topic, say greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, segmented trees, etc., available across various programming portals. This would help you to improve your understanding of those topics and eventually upgrade your coding skills. When you would be developing your solutions, try to modularize your codes. This habit would be of great use in longer run. However, it might not be feasible that you would arrive at the solution for each of these problems with just a couple of hours of thinking. Initially, it would be prolonged and might take a couple of days as well. But keep practicing and try coming up with feasible solutions. Remember, practice makes man perfect. Good luck, and wish you all the best. Hope you make it to the ACM ICPC World Finals some day :) Updated 4h ago • View Upvotes
