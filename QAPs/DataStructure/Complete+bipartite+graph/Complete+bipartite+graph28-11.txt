Originally Answered: Should I get involved in competitive programming? How do I begin?Definitely! Like others said below, I'd recommend going with C++ or Java for your language of choice. I started out with competitive programming by solving the most solved questions on CodeForces here: Problemset - Codeforces (if you click the "Solved" button it will toggle between sorting by most solve or not) Victoria Nemkin had a great answer, couldn't have said it better myself! Good luck!
