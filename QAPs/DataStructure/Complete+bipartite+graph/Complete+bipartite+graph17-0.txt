What is the significance of Kuratowski's theorem?
Kuratowski's theorem gives a way of determining if a graph is planar. A given finite graph G is planar iff it does not contain K 5   or K 3,3   , where K 5   is a complete graph with 5 vertices, and K 3,3   is a 3 by 3 bipartite graph. The proof for the theorem is carefully constructed, but a bit detailed.  In theory, this sounds fine, but it turns out it's pretty slow to use this in practice- there exist other linear time algorithms for determining if a given graph is planar. So okay, cool, but why do we care if a graph is planar? There exist fast algorithms for planar graphs (shortest paths with negative edge weights, multiple source shortest paths, and a wealth of flow related problems).
