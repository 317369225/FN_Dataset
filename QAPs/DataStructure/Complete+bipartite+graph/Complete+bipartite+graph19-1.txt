There are n boys and n girls. Each boy has a list of girls he likes. How many arrangements (pairing of a boy with a girl of his choice) can be made such that each boy gets a girl on his list?
In that example, it can be a possiblity of 4 boys has a list in which they marked all 4 girls each but if we start from one he has 4 choices to choose a girl & next has 3, another next has 2 and then last has only 1 choice so there are 4×3×2×1=24 arrangements therefore for n boys and girls there are (n!) arrangements ......
