Given a NxN matrix, what are all the possible Hamiltonian paths from (1,1) to (1,N)?Limit: N<=10 Example: n=2 then 1 path, n=3 then 2 paths, n=4 then 8 paths.... This is a homework, and i hope i can have its running time under 1 second.
Represent your n×nn×n matrix as a grid graph with n2n 2  vertices and 2n(n−1)2n(n−1) edges. Then you need to find a Hamiltonian path between your two vertices in question. Unfortunately, the complexity of the algorithm to find a Hamiltonian path is NP-complete, even for bipartite graphs like the grid graph we're using. However, there is an algorithm that finds a Hamiltonian path of a bipartite graph in O(2n/2)O(2 n/2 ) . Here are some links: Grid Graph -- from Wolfram MathWorld Hamiltonian path problem You might also want to read this paper: Determinant Sums for Undirected Hamiltonicity. EDIT: After giving this problem a bit of thought, I noted that a Hamiltonian path from (1,1)(1,1) to (1,n)(1,n) is not hard to find, for any nn . Hint: fill the left and bottom borders, and continue until you end up at the top right corner.
