There are n boys and n girls. Each boy has a list of girls he likes. How many arrangements (pairing of a boy with a girl of his choice) can be made such that each boy gets a girl on his list?
The question, in an equivalent sense, asks for counting the number of perfect matching in a balanced bipartite graph. This problem is known to be #P-complete (read here: Sharp-P-complete). I do not believe there exists an efficient algorithm to exactly count it without any further constraints.
