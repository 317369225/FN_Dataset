What's the relationship between neural networks and quantum computation?
I am not sure, but this news article just blew my mind away: Launching the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab Probably my dream job after finishing my PhD. I do think that both concepts are unrelated though. Quantum Computing is a computing paradigm (using q-bits instead of bits) while Neural Networks is a subfield in AI. However it might be interesting to see how Neural Networks or Deep Learning problems might be solved in reduced time using Quantum Computing. Currently at ICML (International Conference of Machine Learning), there are already researchers working on Machine Learning with Quantum Computing paradigms. I have a friend at Purdue who is doing research on this. He's a boss. You can check one of his paper presentations here:
