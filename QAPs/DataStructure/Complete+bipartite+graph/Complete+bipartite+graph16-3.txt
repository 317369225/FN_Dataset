I was asked to solve a well known NP-complete problem in an interview. Should I refuse to solve it?
You should mention that the problem appears to be NP-complete and why, and dig down into parameters the solution is required to run under. Bonus points for saying if you had to solve it in the workplace you'd check to find the most efficient approaches devised for it so far. Despite being generally expensive to run, if N is very small these problems can still be brute forced, and provide useful functionality. The interview isn't just about getting the right answer. It's about how you get there, your interrogative thinking to understand parameters of the problem, your problem solving, and general demeanor. It's about how you face a challenge, especially when you know that problem is fraught with perils like intractability. Refusing to solve it or even nibble at the edges would be a no-hire for me, even for a fresh college grad.
