Why is divisibility by two (even/odd) considered an important quality for numbers? Why not divisibility by 3? Or 17?
Here's a mathematical answer. It really isn't considered that important a quality by mathematicians, it is just the simplest example of a modular approach to maths. All integers are even or odd. In the same way all integers are 1, 2, or 0 mod 3, and they are all 1, 2, 3, .... 16, or 0 mod 17. Even and odd have names becauseÂ  the smallest numbers are the most common in general usage, but there is nothing innately more important about divisiblity by 2 than by 17, it's just something we are more familiar with.
