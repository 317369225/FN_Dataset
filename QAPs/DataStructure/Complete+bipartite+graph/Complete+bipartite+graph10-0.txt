I need an algorithm that gives me a set T  of minimum cardinality (T⊆U  ), such that T∩S i ≠ϕ,∀i  , where 1≤i≤n  ?I have a collection of non-empty sets S i   , where 1≤i≤n  , which are constructed from elements of a universe U  . I am not sure whether it is an NP-complete problem and can be reduced to minimum set cover in some way. I thought of reducing it to vertex cover, by taking the sets as vertices, and putting an edge between any two sets if their intersection is non-empty, but that doesn't quite seem to work either.
This is called the minimal hitting set problem. It is equivalent to the Set cover problem. In the set cover formulation, you need to find a minimal family of sets whose union covers all the vertices. Set up a bipartite graph with a vertex on the left per each set, and a vertex on the right per each element. Connect a set to an element if the set contains the element. Now, a "set cover" is a minimal collection of left-vertices that are between them connected to everything on the right, while a "hitting set" is a minimal collection of right-vertices that are between them connected to everything on the left. Obviously, it's the same problem. The problem is indeed NP-complete. There are various standard algorithms that guarantee finding the minimal set, and other algorithms that only achieve approximate results. Which algorithm to choose depends a great deal on the setup: Do you know anything about the sets S i   ? Are they large? Small? Random? Tend to intersect more than expected? Less? In any situation there will likely be a few algorithms that perform much better than the others.
