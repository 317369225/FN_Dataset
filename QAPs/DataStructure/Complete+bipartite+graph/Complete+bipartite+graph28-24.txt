What is the best strategy to improve my skills in competitive programming in 2-3 months?My knowledge is structure programming  in C++ I solved around 50 problems all of them are basic problems Samuel.Soliman - A2 Online Judge
Originally Answered: I am a Computer Science graduate but I am afraid of doing algorithms and competitive programming problems, how could I get through?Keep at it. First make sure you understand the basics: sorting, searching, graphs and trees, programming paradigms like backtracking, dynamic and greedy programming. And then make sure you go over classic problems like the knapsack, various string manipulation algorithms, sorting and searching algos, graph traversal etc. And them code every damn one of them. By now, you should have a catalog (both in a book and in your mind) of what sort of a solution you should try and apply to what sort of a problem. Till here is the preparation part. It'll take a couple of weeks to months, depending on how much productive time you can spend on it. Now comes the next part: practice. Take all the time you need for solving the simple problems to start with. But when you've finally solved it, or looked into the answer, make sure you completely understand the solution. And then code it up. 'Reading an answer' it not the same as coding it up. You will actually see progress if you do this long enough. Coming up with template solutions will become second nature and you'll be able to advance up the complexity ladder faster and faster. All the best! Updated 13 Sep • View Upvotes
