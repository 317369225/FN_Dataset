What is your favourite graph theory problem?
One of my favorite graph theory problems is a problem on increasing paths in edge ordered graphs. Here's the problem: Suppose you assign distinct numbers from 1,2,3,...,\mathchoice((((n2\mathchoice)))) to each edge of a complete graph on n vertices, prove that there is always an increasing path of length at least (n−1) . i.e. a path were all the labels form an increasing sequence. The proof is also as sleek as the problem itself. Here's the argument. Imagine you have n pedestrians standing on each vertex, now call out the edges in increasing order from 1 to \mathchoice((((n2\mathchoice)))) . Each time you call out an edge, the pedestrian currently on the two vertices of that edge swap places. After calling out all \mathchoice((((n2\mathchoice)))) edges, the pedestrians will have moved a total of n(n−1) times. By the piegonhole principle, there is a pedestrian who has moved n(n−1)n=(n−1) times. In fact, this tells us something even stronger, it says that if you label the edges of any graph with distinct integers, there is always an increasing path of length 2|E||V| A more formal proof is given in this paper by Ronald Graham et. al. here. Also, the above proof is due to P. Wilker
