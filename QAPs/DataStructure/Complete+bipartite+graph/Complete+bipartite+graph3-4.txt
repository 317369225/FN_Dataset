What is a bipartite graph?
Bipartite  graphsare a specific kind of graphs  nodes can be decomposed into two disjoints sets such that two nodes in a same set are not connected, therefore those graphs are usually written B=(L,R,E), where L,R (left/right) are the disjoint sets of nodes and E the edges. In this context, a complete bipartite graph is a bipartite graph where every node in one set are connected to every node in the other set Source : http://friggeri.net/blog/a-genet...
