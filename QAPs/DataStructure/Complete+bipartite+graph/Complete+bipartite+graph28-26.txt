Originally Answered: How do I start programming in competitive websites like TopCoder, CodeChef, and Project Euler?As you are a novice in programming, I would say you start practicing from the practice questions section from any of these competitive programming websites. Go from easy, medium and hard level. Once you start getting comfortable in solving most of the easy level questions move to next section. Topcoder and CodeChef (I have never used Project Euler) organizes monthly and weekly (sometimes) competitions on programming, start participating in them. It will help you think in efficient way for solving the problems. During the competition, do not ask anyone about approach on how to do. Try to do the problem on your own. These competitions will help increase your speed of solving and to keep track how you are doing. Try to enjoy the programming. Think of it as a game and play like a sportsman. This mind set will help you in hard times when you feel like leaving the programming. (It happens sometimes !!!). One more thing if you like programming keep doing it. Do not take a long break from it. P.S.: Don't get disappointed if you are not able to solve any problem. Keep trying hard. I am guaranteeing you that making a question acceptable is a very good feeling. (you will get to know about it when you start doing programming).
