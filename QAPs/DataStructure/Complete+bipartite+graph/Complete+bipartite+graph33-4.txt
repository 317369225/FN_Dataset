Why is divisibility by two (even/odd) considered an important quality for numbers? Why not divisibility by 3? Or 17?
I think there are lots of reasons, here's one that I suggest. 2 has the ability as an even divisor.  With 2, the whole number line is cut in half.  One half divisible by 2, and the other half not.  Where as with 3, 1/3rd is divisible and 2/3rds is not.  Other numbers just seem arbitrary, as one group of not, gets much bigger than the group that is (divisible by some number n). For n, there are 1/n numbers that are divisible, and (n-1)/n numbers that aren't.  2: 2k is divisible 2k+1 is not. 3: 3k is divisible 3k + 1 is not 3k + 2 is not Etc.  n nk is divisible nk + 1 is not nk + 2 is not .... nk + (n-1) Then the next number is n(k+1) which is obviously divisible by n.  And the loop begins again. So even though 2 being the rule for even, seeming arbitrary, it seems less arbitrary than all the other possibilities.  Additionally in life so many things come in pairs as many of the other answers have already indicated.
