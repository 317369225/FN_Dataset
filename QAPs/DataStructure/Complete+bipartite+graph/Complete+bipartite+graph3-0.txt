What is a bipartite graph?
A visual way to look at it: It is a bunch of dots which can be either of two colors and lines connecting the dots where no two dots of the same color are connected by a line. The figure below makes it clear, "dots" are more technically referred to as "vertices" and lines are called "edges" The bipartite graph structure can be used to capture a relationship between two types of objects where the distinction between the types of objects is important. A student-applied-to-college relationship can (for example) be stored in the bipartite graph depicted above. Blue dots could be students (e.g. Mary, Jane, Joe) and Red dots could be colleges they applied to (e.g. Princeton, Cornell, MIT)
