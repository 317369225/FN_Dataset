Why is divisibility by two (even/odd) considered an important quality for numbers? Why not divisibility by 3? Or 17?
Alon Amit's answer covers it best, but I'll summarize in two words - natural symmetry. The question isn't really "why is even and odd so important", but rather "why is 2 so intrinsic to nature". Even and odd just came as a result (if "17" was more intrinsic in nature, we would have some other system equivalent to "even" or "odd. It's the same concept as how we use base-10 as our natural counting state, instead of base 2, 3, or 112^3). Symmetry isn't just a visual concept. It shows up all the time in relationships. Think about the real number line - everything to the left of the line has an exact inverse on the right. If you think about this in context of physics or engineering, something being the opposite can have big effects. Consider something as simple as an object in motion. No matter the dimensions of the environment, the object can move in a direction, or in the opposite of that direction. What I mean is that in our (seemingly!) 3 dimensional environment, you can move forward (or backward), right (or left), and up (or down). An object moving forward at a speed of 10ms   is doing something similar but much different than an object moving forward at a speed of  −10ms   --- or "backwards".
