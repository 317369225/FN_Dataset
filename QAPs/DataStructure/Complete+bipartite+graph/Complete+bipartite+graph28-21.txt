Originally Answered: I have been doing competitive programming for like 4 months now. I just am not improving. My problem solving ability has not increased even a bit. What should I do?It seems that you do pretty good on Div2 250, so you should move to 500 and sometimes 1000. You should still do some easy problems from time to time to improve your accuracy. I wrote a long article How to get better? which contains a lot of training advice. As was suggested by Jayesh Chaudhary, you should try to identify what your weaknesses are. Is it accuracy, problem solving ability or insufficient knowledge of algorithms? For each weakness I give advice in the article. I would suggest that you continue to compete, you only started 4 months ago. Other people probably have years of experience, so of course they are better than you now, but you can get closer with hard work.
