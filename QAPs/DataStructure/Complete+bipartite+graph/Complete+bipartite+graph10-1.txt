I need an algorithm that gives me a set T  of minimum cardinality (T⊆U  ), such that T∩S i ≠ϕ,∀i  , where 1≤i≤n  ?I have a collection of non-empty sets S i   , where 1≤i≤n  , which are constructed from elements of a universe U  . I am not sure whether it is an NP-complete problem and can be reduced to minimum set cover in some way. I thought of reducing it to vertex cover, by taking the sets as vertices, and putting an edge between any two sets if their intersection is non-empty, but that doesn't quite seem to work either.
As Alon Amit said, this is the minimum hitting set problem and the problem is NP-Hard. Here is simple reduction from Vertex cover: Let's say we have some instance of vertex cover on a graph G(V,E)  . We can transform this instance of the vertex cover problem  to this problem by considering the set of edges in G  as S  i.e.  S={S i ={u,v}∣(u,v)∈E(G)}  It is easy to see that finding such a minimum cardinality set  T  gives a minimum vertex cover for G  , since such a minimum cardinality set (of vertices) must cover all sets in S  (and hence all edges in G  ).
