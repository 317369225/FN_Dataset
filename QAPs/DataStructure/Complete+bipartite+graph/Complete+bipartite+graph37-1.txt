How should I prepare for competitive C++ programming, if I already know all the basics?
Well if you know the basics it's good but this will not enough for competitive programming(cp) For good in cp firstly you need Knowledge of algorithms like Dynamic programming Divide and conquer Greedy Efficient sorting and searching Pattern matching Graph algorithms Binary serch trees Spanning tree Geometry related algos String manipulation Bit manipulation Number system Etc. After the knowledge of algorithms try to solve basics questions for good understanding in algo. Then pic the tough one because if you solve easy ques. it won't teach you rather satisfaction. After solving a lot of questions one day you will be expert in it. That's it!! Now there are various resourse which can help you to do this like Topcoder Hackerrank Hackerearth InterviewBit Coursera EdX etc. But note programming is one which you have to do with your own.
