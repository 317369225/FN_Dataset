Originally Answered: I have very basic programming skills. How do I become a competitive programmer?For a competitive programmer. You should first understand data structure and algorithms. For that you can try online courses (coursera, udacity) or pick up these books in following order. Introduction to algorithms by CLRS Algorithm design manual by Steven Skiena You must code algorithms from following book in your favourite programming language. You also need to develop approach of how to think algorithmically. For that you should start practicing different problems and see how they are solved if you can't solve them. These are websites where you can try solving programming challenges and are in ascending order. Project Euler SPOJ Codechef / Hackerrank Topcoder Practice / Codeforces Google Codejam Past problems practice You will have problem solving few challenges on these sites. Don't worry keep on practicing, just don't loose hope. You will get solution later on. You can google if problem is too hard.
