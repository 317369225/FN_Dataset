Originally Answered: I have been doing competitive programming for like 4 months now. I just am not improving. My problem solving ability has not increased even a bit. What should I do?Feeling being a loser is the first and most important step to improve. I am not even blue on topcoder but never gave up when I was practicing. I just used to solve DIV 2 250s every day in my semester breaks, although they looked very similar but I kept on solving them in the practice rooms and then started 500s. I think I have completed almost all 250s and 500s of DIV2 upto SRM 450 and after that I certainly started gaining some confidence. Competitive Programming, in my opinion, depends more on your hard work than your talent. So never give up.
