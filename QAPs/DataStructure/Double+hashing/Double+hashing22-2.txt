How should I prepare for a Microsoft Interview?
There are number of things you can brush up. 1. Solid foundation in data structures and algorithms is a must. Pay special attention to problems on Linked lists, binary search trees, heaps and graphs (a reference for good enough problems is http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ ) 2. Operating Systems fundamentals. Process and memory management. 3. Look into the kind of work the team you are applying to is doing and try to read more about the technologies they are using. (e.g. If it's Bing, read about search engines) 4. More importantly, don't panic at any stage. It might happen that you feel stuck at some problem, stay calm and think hard. Suggest what you are thinking to your interviewer. In many cases, the interviewer will be dropping you minor hints and when they do, make sure you pick them and think in that direction. 5. Lastly, a positive attitude doesn't hurt. Best, Navneet
