(Step-2): You should have practical understanding of Data Structures e.g. (Practical use cases related to :when to use circular buffer , or when to use adjacently list ) (Step-3) : You must practice several coding problems to implement the things which learn from Step-1 , and Step-2 (you may do the following choose any coding language for the choice of yours (C,C++ or Java or Python or PHP) However other than programming you might need to understand the main concept for the interview is to keep the interview active and this requires some action from your side, such as the following: You need to talk You need to explain You need to discuss You need to express your views You need to understand clearly the questions given to you You need to understand the interviewerâ€™s expression and mindset to un- derstand those questions You might need to ask appropriate questions to understand the question or any other discussion item. -- and also : Prepare : "Please tell me about your self" , "Your skills related positive/negative further interest" , Basics for the most needed computer science concepts.
