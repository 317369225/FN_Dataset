What are the best websites a programmer should visit?
Most of the answers here are extremely skewed towards "preparing for coding test/software companies/learning to code", there is a definite "development/hacking" aspect of programming that is missed in this list.  My links are Aggregators/Discussion places. Hacker News (YCombinator News) Stack Overflow News for nerds, stuff that matters (Slashdot) Twitter - May seem totally out of place, but most of the good stuff I have learned is by following the projects I work on Twitter. Blogs Essays by Paul Graham Joel on Software Svbtle - The current high quality blog, network, which has lot of good programmers. For a list of Languages : Resources mapping do take a look at Best Learning Material a wiki by National Institute of Technology Calicut CSE Association. Updated 149w ago • View Upvotes
