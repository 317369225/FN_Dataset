What are some hard/medium-difficult programming questions, related to hashing (data structures)?
Here are some possible questions about hashing, not sure they are hard enough for what you're expecting. I won't write matching answers for now, that will allow readers to test the questions difficulties. - What is a hashing function, how is it related to hash tables - What are expected properties of acceptable hashing functions, how should they not behave. - What's the difference between single and double hashing hash tables - What is algorithmic complexity of double hashing - What's the trouble with double hasing hash tables when you remove elements from them.
