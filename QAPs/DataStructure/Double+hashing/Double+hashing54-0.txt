I graduated from a college where everything is taught theoretically. So, you can assume that I have almost no experience in stuff like DP, etc., I now work for a good Indian MNC. I think I can do better than that. What should I do to get into companies like Google for a year from now?
In addition to what Nitin Gupta said, I think you should start competing in programming contests. Performing well in these contests requires you to have excellent implementation skills. Start with Project Euler and Topcoder. From what I have heard, this will help you a lot in clearing tech interviews at companies like Google. Good luck!
