What are hash table collisions? How is it avoided? How frequently does it happen?
Hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map elements(keys) to an index. It offers O(1) amortized time in searching, inserting and deleting. A collision occurs when two or more elements are hashed(mapped) to same value. For example: Let the hash function be hash(x) = x%10. In this case 25 and 35 would be mapped to same value. Hence a collision occurs. The best way to avoid collision is to use a good hash function that distributes elements uniformly over the hash table. There also various collision resolution techniques like open hashing, closed hashing, double hashing, etc. The answer to how frequently does a collision occurs depends on both hash function and input data.
