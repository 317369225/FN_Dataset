How do I get a job at Facebook?
Dream companies like Facebook, google, Microsoft, VMware generally prefer candidates from top tier colleges. So if you have such a profile, +1. In case you don't, its ok, world doesn't stop there. One thing, for sure, there is no alternative to tech skills. You have to be the master of algorithms, data structures etc. They will grill you in these areas. Getting an interview call itself is a big thing. To do that, you have to create your presence. Create accounts on sites like hackerrank, topcoder. Practice your skills there, collect points and be in the top ranks. Stay active on stackoverflow. You will end up mastering your skills and recruiters from such companies always refer to such sites for good candidates. Stay active on LinkedIn, connect to people working in ur dream companies, take their guidance. Once you get a call you have to be 200% prepared for the interview, because you will not get calls from such companies regularly. All the best!! Keep coding..
