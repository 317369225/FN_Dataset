How hard are Facebook's software engineer job interviews?
You can see about 70 or Facebook software engineering interview questions here: http://www.careercup.com/page?pi.... But, the difficulty of the questions is not really the point. You're not evaluated on an absolute what-percent-did-you-get-correct basis. You're evaluated based on how you performed on each questions relative to other candidates who were asked the same question. If you get questions that are really hard, or really easy, it doesn't matter. Your performance is compared to other candidates on each question. So, with respect to that point, the real question is how hard is it to get an offer from Facebook. It's about as hard as it is from Google, and probably a little harder than from Amazon.
