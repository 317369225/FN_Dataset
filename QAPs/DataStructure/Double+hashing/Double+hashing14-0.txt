What is the best advice for an engineering internship interview at Google or Facebook?
The answer to this will likely vary from one interviewer to the next, but here's one datapoint from interviewing with Facebook for an internship in fall 2010. My two interviewers asked algorithms and data structures questions relating to sorting, stacks, queues, and heaps. They were reasonably flexible about the language choice; C, C++, Java, and Python were all fine, and didn't stress the details of syntax and libraries. The questions were the kind you would find in any algorithms textbook; for example, "Find the top k elements of an n-element list as efficiently as possible." The most useful thing I did to prepare was to read Steven Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual cover-to-cover in the two weeks before the interviews on the advice of Steve Yegge: http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/...
