Which are the popular algorithms asked in tech interviews?
Graph problems and algorithms seem to be popular, I think largely due to Yegge's blogpost(s) on "how to get hired by Google" which says you should learn them. And truly, they are important to have some understanding of, but generally so you know they exist and can recognize when to use them, but they are not really used as much as some purists would have you believe (although, it could be they are used less often than they should be, too). For reasons which should be obvious, "computing" is less about actual computation any more than it is moving large amounts of data around quickly, and a lot of algorithms just aren't needed for that from an *application developer's* point of view.
