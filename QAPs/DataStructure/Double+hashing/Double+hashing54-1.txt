I graduated from a college where everything is taught theoretically. So, you can assume that I have almost no experience in stuff like DP, etc., I now work for a good Indian MNC. I think I can do better than that. What should I do to get into companies like Google for a year from now?
You have to start coding as soon as possible and as much as possible. As you have mentioned that you college taught only theory, so I can assume that you are good in that. All you need is practice. Dynamic Programming is most favored algorithm paradigms that any big tech company favors. I would suggest you to read dynamic programming from top-coder community. Solve some DP problems starting with easy ones and gradually increasing the difficulty level. Whenever you see any problem, think about how would you approach the solution? Which data structures you will use to store/represent the data? After this start writing code on sheet of paper or board as top tech companies ask candidates to write working code on paper/board during interviews. Then write same code in any IDE, compile the code, check for errors and try to minimize same type of errors. This will surely help you. Coding is an art, which requires thinking. The more you practice, the more you will become confident. Some good books can be Algorithm Design Manual By Steven Skiena CLRS
