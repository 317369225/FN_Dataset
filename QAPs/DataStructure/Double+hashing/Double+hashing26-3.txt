Which is the best site for preparing for Google interviews?
This site has a very decent collection of interview programming questions along with very exhaustive explanation. Will definitely be of help. http://www.mycareerstack.com/ But while preparing for an technical interview like for Google, Facebook or Microsoft you must keep one thing in mind and that is there is no specific set of interview questions which are generally asked. Each interviewer is free to design his own set of questions limited to a certain constraint. So along with going through the set of questions it is imperative that you concentrate more on clearing your concepts. It is highly unlikely that you will get a repeated question in an interview, but the concept is mostly remains the same. So whenever you go through an interview question also make sure to strengthen the concept on which the question was based. Updated 185w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
