Which is the best site for preparing for Google interviews?
I believe there are tons of answers about how to prepare Google interviews and instead of giving you a list of 100 sites to prepare, I'd like to recommend only several sites that every site is worth to visit. Gainlo - Mock Interview - We've built this site to allow people have mock interviews with experienced interviewer from Google, Amazon, Linkedin etc. and get real feedback to improve. LeetCode Online Judge - Get tons of interview questions and get your code compiled and judged online. Glassdoor â€“ Get Hired. Love Your Job. - You can get tons of past interview questions from Google and it's very helpful to practice with them at the last month/week. How we hire - Google Careers - This is the official page from Google and you can get an idea about their hiring process.
