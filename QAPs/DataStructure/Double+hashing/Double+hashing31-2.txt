What are the best websites/books/resources for Programming Interview Questions?
First you should go through all the basic datastructures and algorithms. After that pick one or few of the interview prep books, websites or apps and go through a hefty list of problems and their solutions. Here is a good list of resources: - Coderust 2.0: Visual Guide for Programming Interview Preparation has a good Good set of more recent interview questions with explanations, quality solutions and interactive visualizations. - GeeksforGeeks: Checkout the solved problems on the site. They also have very good explanations of optimized solutions that have been verified by a pretty big audience. - Careercup: Good collections of questions. Note they are questions only - I wont trust responses on careercup site as I have seen a lot of vague/incomplete answers. - LeetCode Online Judge is great if you need an online judge to verify your problem solutions.I recently did a blog post on what senior ICs are asked in interview. I recommend going through that as well. Updated 5d ago â€¢ View Upvotes
