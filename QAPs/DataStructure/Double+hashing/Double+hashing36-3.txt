What is the best way to prepare for software engineering job interviews in 2 months?
I can't help to share my experience with you because I prepared my interview exactly within 2 months! It seemed that there's much you can do within such short timeline, but actually you can do tons of things to better your chance. If you are already quite familiar with data structure and algorithm, you can skip this point. Otherwise, do spend enough time on this because it's the foundation of all software engineer interviews and most of interviewers assume you already had a good grasp and once they find out that you're not familiar with some basic stuffs, you may be in trouble. Since you don't have much time left, dive into real interview questions as much as you can. There are tons of resources online like http://www.glassdoor.com where you can access countless real interview questions from companies. If you are preparing for particular companies, that's even better since you can target your preparation only to interview questions from that company. Don't expect to have the same interview question you prepared (though it's possible), but practicing with real interview questions will help you be aware of the difficulty, style of each company and what they really care about. Practice with mock interviews. It's a great experience for you to practice in a way where you can't fail. You can do this with your friends and interview them back. I also got my mock interview from http://www.gainlo.co whose interviewers are working at Google, Facebook etc. and gave me tons of feedbacks. Personally I find mock interview the most effective way because you will have totally different feeling when thinking and solving problems in front of a person. You'll be nervous, and you may fail even at the simplest question. However, if you don't have a good foundation of basic data structure and algorithm, please go back to tip #1.
