What skills are needed to get a software engineering job at companies like Google and Facebook?
In short, analytical skills & software development skills. And, the bar for hiring is pretty high in these companies usually. The bar and testing rigor usually applies regardless of your academic background. Appetite for learning is a good thing in general, but cannot help much to convince such companies to hire a candidate. It is simply an intangible at that stage, and the company also of course looks for what it can get from the candidate. And in case of non-CS graduates, the pressure is usually even more to demonstrate a good command of computer science and programming fundamentals. The skills I mentioned in bold above can be further broken down to the below array of skills: problem solving good command of data structures and algorithmic techniques (not necessarily know sophisticated stuff, but know how to best use basic structures and techniques to most efficiently solve a huge array of problems) Thorough coding abilities - translate your approach to code quickly. Debug and get it working for all possible corner cases. And yes, no pseudocode. Syntactic & semantic correctness is required. Comfort with a popular programming language (typically C/Java/Python) is most essential. In case of a reasonably experienced candidate, system design skills (or) solving large scale data problems also become very relevant. If applying for a very specific team (such as mobile development or networking, for instance), of course, knowledge of that domain will be tested.
