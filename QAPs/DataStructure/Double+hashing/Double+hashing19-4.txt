Can I become a really good self-taught programmer?
Disclaimer: I didn't learn any crap from the B.E CSE course that I took. All the programming that I learnt, I did so myself. I would suggest: Focus on learning concepts and the beauty of computers, rather than just the syntax of a trendy language and "building stuff". It's also important to build stuff, because the actual fun starts when you implement your learnings. So keep working on side projects from time to time. Use a feed reader to aggregate some good programming blogs, so you have plenty of resources to read about everyday. It is also good, when you need to procrastinate from writing code. Have a few good books next to your PC/Laptop, to remind yourself to read something new everyday. Best ones are Code Complete and The Pragmatic Programmer. Attend local meetups and get to know more programmers. You never know how they might help you in the quest to learn programming. Surrounding yourself with programmers will motivate you.
