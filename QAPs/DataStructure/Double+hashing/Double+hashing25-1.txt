How should I prepare for my Google interview if I have 1 month left?
Google seems to ask each candidate to pick a language you are good at. Make sure you pick one you know. That means if you pick Java you better know about Generics,Iterators, inheritance etc. The interviewers are selected based on the language of choice. I had my interview scheduled exactly one month after I was informed. I went about reviewing my various algorithms. Used the famous CLRS book. Knowing the algorithm is one thing, coding it is another. Make sure u can write a program for every algorithm. Interviewers expect you to code every question they ask you about and I think this code is also submitted when your interviews are to be rated. Apart from this I think solving some problems on many of the coding interview sites like top-coder and spoj, project euler might hone your coding skills. Also sometimes the simplest of solutions are starting point. I find that for solving many problems starting with a brute force approach and bettering involves a good thinking process which helps you understand a lot of things. Getting your basics right seems like something one should get done. Make sure you understand all your concepts ground up, as the interviewers do ask a few questions to see if you know your basics. The interviews are a very fun process and thinking things in different ways should get you to the solution
