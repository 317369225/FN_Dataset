How should I prepare for my Google interview if I have 1 month left?
Alright, if only one month is left, it sounds like the only thing you can do is waiting and keeping your finger crossed. However, there are tons of things you could do to better your chance of being hired. Let me share my experience, it's more than a month, but still a very short timeline. Be familiar with basic data structure and algorithm. This is the foundation of all software engineer interviews and most of interviewers assume you already had a good grasp and once they find out that you're not familiar with some basic stuffs, you may be in trouble. Dive into interview questions. There are so many sources like http://www.glassdoor.com where you can find tons of real interview questions that you can prepare. It's almost impossible for you to finish all of them, but once you find yourself weak at particular type of questions, do do some investigation, which will help you solve a whole bunch of questions. Also in this period preparation, try write code on whiteboard or at least on papers, which you'll realize how different it is from writing with you favorite text editors. Practice with mock interviews. It's a great experience for you to practice in a way where you can't fail. You can do this with your friends and interview them back. I also got my mock interview from http://www.gainlo.co whose interviewers are working at Google, Facebook etc. and gave me tons of feedbacks.Personally I find mock interview the most effective way because you will have totally different feeling when thinking and solving problems in front of a person. You'll be nervous, and you may fail even at the simplest question. However, if you don't have a good foundation of basic data structure and algorithm, please go back to tip #1.
