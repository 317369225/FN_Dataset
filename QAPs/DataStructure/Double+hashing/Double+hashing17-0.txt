Why is clustering avoided in hashing?
To answer this first, let's try to understand what clustering actually means.. Â In a hash data structure( map, table concurrent hash map), if there are many collisions, it can become less efficient, because, you can end up with long linked lists at certain array indices and nothing at others. This problem is called clustering. Now we know our problem, so lets try to find the solution. We need to do something ( probing {single and quadratic} and double hashing) which can really save us creating long lists at certain array indices. Once we achieve this through double hashing , we kinda make sure we suffer less hashing collision.. HTH. Please let me know if I failed to understand your question correctly or if my understanding is wrong.
