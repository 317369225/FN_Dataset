What are various collision detection methods in hashtables and how do you prevent or fix a collision? What is the best method?
Chaining and linear probing are two well known methods for collision. Chaining instead of mapping a key to a bucket map the key to the linked list of bucket and extend the linked list whenever required Linear probing maps a key to next location if collision occurs at that location i.e deletion becomes tricky in case of linear probing. Which performs better, well it depends on what keys u r mapping it is always better to implement both and the measure there performance
