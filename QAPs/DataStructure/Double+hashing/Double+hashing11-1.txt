Why HashMap not allowing duplicate keys? How it is stored?
While other implementations of Map might allow for duplicate keys, HashMap does not, pretty much by definition. Map defines an Entry type which is basically a key/value pair. Entry is extended by HashMap (in an inner static class) as Node. A HashMap has a field called table which is a linked list of Node objects, ordered by their hash value (the result of applying a particular function to the key). In order that the nodes can be uniquely ordered, it is necessary that the hash values be unique. This in turn implies that the key values must be unique. You can of course see all of this for yourself if you look at the source code.
