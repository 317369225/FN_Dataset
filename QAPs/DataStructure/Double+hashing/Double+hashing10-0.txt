I've got enough hashing power to get 1.5 litecoins per day. How can I turn that into double without having to invest in more hashing power?
Forget the Litecoin. As a small miner yourself, you can not control your mining result as they are POW. My suggestion is, invest on some future, which may make you more coins with the possibility of 50% or less.
