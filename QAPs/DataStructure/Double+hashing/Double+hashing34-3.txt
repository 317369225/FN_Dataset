How can one sharpen their problem-solving skills to prepare for an interview at a top-level software engineering firm?
I think  its a step by step process. 1. Be a master of Data Structures. For this you can read CLRS or Steve Skeina or Narsimha Karumanchi. According to me Karumanchi is a bit easy to grasp. 2.Practice lots of problems based on data structures. You can practice from different sites like Careercup, GeeksforGeeks or there is a book "Coding Interview Questions" by Karumanchi. 3. Some companies ask puzzles. Practice the most asked puzzles, you'll get an idea. BigRiddles is a good site. 4.If you are preparing for a specific comapny, look for the questions asked in past, make a list of questions you find intresting. Just revise them once in 10-15 days or as it suits you. 5.Study a bit of OS, DBMS, Networking.  That'll take aroud a week. 6.And last but not the least solving aptitude problems ( which I never did :P), you can skip this if you have enough confidence on your coding skills. Lets see why ? "Most of the toplevel firms written test consists of 2-3 coding questions and 20-30 aptitude problems. And if you can do all the coding problems, then they'll not look for your capability of solving aptitude problems, 99% chances will be there that you'll get shortlisted" Else you have no other option other than to practice aptitude. There are many good books available like R.S.Agarwal , Arun Sharma ect. 7. Keep Calm and you'll get placed. :)
