Can I become a really good self-taught programmer?
From personal experience, drive and interest areÂ  more important than age. My mom was in her late 40s when she started programming, and she now does it comfortably for a living. Base on your background, I think you will have a lot of fun learning to program. I might suggest you spend a month to follow every example and do every exercise in the first 6 chapters of Dive into Python. It will get you to a point where you can perform typical useful tasks. http://www.diveintopython.net/to...
