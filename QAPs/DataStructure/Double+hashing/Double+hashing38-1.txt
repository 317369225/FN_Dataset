How does Facebook interview and hire top talent?
All these companies e.g. MS,Google,Amazon,Facebook follow an approach on which that measure the thought process of a candidate. And they use different means to evaluate that, but yes most of them uses Algorithms/Data Structures/Open-ended questions as one of the approach to evaluate the talent. To be accustomed with algos/data structure/coding , you must have understood/practiced the minimum e.g. :   (Step-1): You should have practical understanding of the Algorithms (e.g. When to use BackTracking, When to Use Divide and Conquer, Why double hashing required ?,Where brute force concept can be applied ?) (Step-2): You should have practical understanding of Data Structures e.g. (Practical use cases related to :when to use circular buffer , or when to use adjacently list or the combination of both or something else to solve the problem  ) (Step-3) : You must practice several coding problems to implement the things which learn from Step-1 , and Step-2 (you may do the following choose any coding language for the choice of yours (C,C++ or Java or Python or PHP or any one else ) However other than programming you might need to understand the main concept for the interview is to keep the interview active and this requires some action from your side, such as the following: You need to talk You need to explain You need to discuss You need to express your views You need to understand clearly the questions given to you You need to understand the interviewer’s expression and mindset to un- derstand those questions You might need to ask appropriate questions to understand the question or any other discussion item. -- and also : Prepare : "Please tell me about your self" , "Your skills related positive/negative further interest" , Basics for the most needed computer science concepts.
