What are the best websites/books/resources for Programming Interview Questions?
From resources I've found useful so far; I'd love to know about others too. The one book which I find really useful and refer to all the time, especially just before an interview is Programming Interviews Exposed. It has some basic theoretical info on data structures and some common algorithms, and has some good examples. I really like how they consider the various possibilities of that answer and then go on to the most optimal one. I've also found Gayle Laakmann McDowell's book: Cracking the Coding Interview pretty useful, and have practiced additional problems from that. Some more links which I like: Learning Vim from the inside Hacking a Google Interview http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/10... Binary Trees I always use Glassdoor - an inside look at jobs and companies and GeeksforGeeks - A computer science portal for geeks , LeetCode and Programming Interview Questions | CareerCup for company specific problems. I refer to http://stackoverflow.com for reference and  useful answers to a lot of problems I hope this helps anyone looking to brush up or refine their concepts. I'd love other suggestions.
