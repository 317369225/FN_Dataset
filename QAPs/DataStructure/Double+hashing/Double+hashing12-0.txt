Can you advice me some Irc channels where I can find and share support for php, html, css, javascript, ruby on rails development? Or also if you know a different platform instead Irc, let me know, but it should be in real time (as a chat).
The best IRC network for PHP advice (and for almost any technological advice, for that matter) is Freenode: irc.freenode.net There you'll find the following channels: ##php ##javascript #ruby #html5 .. among others. Note that the first two have a double hash sign (it's intentional), but you'll get forwarded to them if you use a single one. To be fair and honest, I've only participated on ##php among those, and there you'll find many notorious PHP devs, including core developers.
