How should I prepare for a Microsoft Interview?
I'm a former Bing engineer, and during my time there I interviewed a number of candidates. First of all, any team in Microsoft (or Google, Facebook, etc.) will demand strong skills in general CS, like algorithms and data structures in particular. Almost without exception, you will also be expected to code solutions on a whiteboard. With this in mind, here is some advice: 1. Read up to make sure you _really_ understand the most important concepts, like how the common data structures are implemented, the basic algorithms for search, sorting, order statistics, etc. The best book for this is the so-called CLRS (http://www.amazon.com/Introducti...). There are also a lot of video courses from top universities like Standford online, for instance on iTunes U. 2. Solve a lot of algorithm problems. There are tons of sites with good challenges out there now (topcoder.com, interviewstreet.com, projecteuler.net, codechef.com, codility.com, to mention a few). 3. Practice with a friend. If you have a CS-literate friend, ask him or her to find some good challenges and ask them to you like it was an interview. Write code on a whiteboard. Make it as realistic as possible (have a 45 minutes time limit for instance). Don't underestimate the time you need for these preparations. Set aside a considerable amount of time on all of the above three points. Worst case scenario: you don't get the job, but you'll be a whole lot more knowledgeable afterwards. A fabulous blog post which has all of the above advice and more is this one: http://steve-yegge.blogspot.no/2.... Updated 179w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
