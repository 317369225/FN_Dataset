How can I improve programming skills?
Come join us on CodeWars: your goal should be to do at least a kata (=problem) each day. No. Days. Off. I started a few months ago and I was rather poor (having to Google even simple syntax in some languages T_T), but then it helped me grow more skilled and learn a bunch of different tricks and neat ideas to solve problem after problem. Oh, and problems are categorized both by difficulty and argument, that makes it much easier to find your best degree of challenge, neither frustrating or too easy.  And once you solve a problem, you get to read other coders' solutions, which makes an excellent learning combo (I mean forcing yourself to solve X, then read other solutions to X). Other quorans reached me there and among them, Russell is surely worth a mention as the best achiever I met until now: he learnt a great deal, is constantly improving his own skills and I must admit reading some of his smartest solutions is now a pleasure. Even or maybe particularly when they are best than mine ;) Final note: if I (an "old" self-taught that started when 35 yo with no formal education, more about my path here) did it to the top 100, surely so can you :) Hope this helps, happy coding :) Updated 35w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
