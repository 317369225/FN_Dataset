What are the best websites/books/resources for Programming Interview Questions?
Good resources can make interview preparation process easier and more efficient. You definitely don't need to check all of them and in fact you won't even be able to do that. So I'd like share the following resources that helped me land my internship/full-time job at various companies including Google and Facebook. Leetcode - One of the most popular platforms that allow you to practice coding questions with online judge. It supports many languages including Python and it's worth to check every question there! Gainlo - Mock Interview with Professionals - I had several mock interviews with Google/Facebook interviewers and it's really helpful. Gainlo provides the same interview experience (as real interviews) and I got a lot of feedback that helped me to improve. Cracking the Coding Interview - The bible for coding interview for sure. If you have no experience about interview preparation, do check this book. Glassdoor - I used Glassdoor at the last step of my preparation. Basically, I searched for questions from past interviews of my target company and practiced as many as possible. Big-O Cheat Sheet - It has a great summary of Big-O! I'm a big believer that we should prepare interview smartly, which means not all preparation resources are necessary to check. That's why I only handpicked 5 websites/books that I believe can help people land their dream jobs.
