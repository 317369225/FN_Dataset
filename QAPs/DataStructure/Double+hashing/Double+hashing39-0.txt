Should I expect questions on design patterns & Java / Spring semantics at an Amazon interview?
Depends on two Factors: (1) The team and the position you are being interviewed for: If it's a team specific opening and they are looking for people who can come and take up the work asap, then definitely they'll be asking questions on java/spring. If it's an opening for java developer than pretty obvious you'll be asked Java. (2) Your relevant work experience: If you are a fresher then it's not expected that you'll be well versed in Design patterns. You will still be asked design problems but what is expected are the class diagrams, interfaces and the sequence diagram with details on functionality, UI and security. Now if at this level you are using design patterns, Wonderful!!Â  But for experienced candidates (2+ years of experience) they will ask design patterns and java. For market hires with relevant experience Designing Skills are a must.
