What are the best websites/books/resources for Programming Interview Questions?
I created an online tutorial for this purpose: Algorithms for Interviews It reviews answering questions, analyzing algorithms, and algorithms strategies. It briefly reviews basic concepts in Data Structures, Trees & Graphs and Recursion, and links to relevant tutorials and challenges on Learneroo. The last two pages review software design and provide additional resources to study. Below are someÂ  additional resources you can check out. Algorithms Here are two textbooks worth looking through: The Algorithm Design Manual - This book consists of 2 parts, a guide to design and analysis of Algorithms, and a catalog of problems and how to solve them (See also this book's Algorithm Repository) Algorithms (Sedgewick & Wayne) - Java-based textbook, which also has an accompanying booksite and Coursera course.Programming Interview Books Cracking the Coding Interview - Lots of practice questions, with short explanations in the back. Programming Interviews Exposed - Less questions, but longer explanations accompany each one.Object-Oriented Design Beginners can go through Chapters 6 and 13 in Objects First with Java, while more experienced developers can read chapters 5 and 6 from Code Complete. If you want to study design in more detail, check out these books: Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design - If you're into random pictures, get this book. Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design - Free online textbook for both Java and Python, with long examples for designing casino games.
