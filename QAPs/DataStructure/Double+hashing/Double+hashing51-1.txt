How can one be well prepared to answer data structure/algorithm questions in interviews?
I interview many people day to day. I have also gotten offers from some very difficult companies. I would recommend to read Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions: Gayle Laakmann McDowell: 9780984782802: Amazon.com: Books I mean really really read it. Sit down with a text editor and write code. Do it without internet. Then read the answers and try to answer the questions again without help. Gayle Laakmann McDowell is also on Quora. Also, I don't think you need to have abnormally high IQ to solve these questions. After some practice, you will become good at figuring out a common approach. You just don't want to be stuck. Always think about What is a naive way to solve the problem? Can I improve the answer by using different data structures? Where is the deficiency? Is it fetching data, can you use map, list, array? How about different algorithm. Divide and conquer. Dynamic programming. Recursions. Updated 34w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
