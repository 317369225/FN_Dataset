How hard are Facebook's software engineer job interviews?
"What makes them so hard?" It's not so much that the questions are "hard," but the fact that they're a super-hyped pre-IPO company (at the time of writing, February 2012) ensures that there are thousands of applicants competing for any one position, especially in the software development teams that comprise their core business. This unhealthy level of applicant interest results in a very unforgiving environment in which one minor mistake may put you out of the running. And a "mistake" doesn't necessarily mean missing a problem entirely (that would be a "disaster"); it could be that you didn't use the most optimal solution from the outset, or you took slightly too long to think of the solution relative to other candidates. These days, Farcebook has no difficulty recruiting world-class programmers, so you truly need to set yourself apart from the competition in order to survive.
