How does a non-computer science IIT graduate get a job in Google, Facebook, or Amazon?
Doubt kills more dream than failure ever will. I'm a Mining graduate from IITKGP, got a year back during B.Tech, didn't get a job in campus placement. After struggling for next 7 months got a developer's job in a startup (btw it was a startup for last 10-12 years :P) for Rs. 22k per month, worked my ass off for next 20 months. For last 8 months I've been working with Amazon. Though the number of non-CS/IT guys are very less, I know 4-5 other guys who are from Chem/Meta/Mech, etc.
