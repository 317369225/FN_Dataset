Which are the popular algorithms asked in tech interviews?
If the expectation is to see an encyclopedia of algorithms or techniques listed out as answers here, you'd likely be disappointed. There are really infinite possibilities for questions in tech interviews across companies in the world. A large number of new questions are invented everyday. There is nothing like a 'list of questions' that when leaked in here, is guaranteed to help you ace through interviews. One's best bet to crack tech interviews, would be to 'try and understand' the fundamentals of algorithms, data structures and complexity calculations, and try and 'apply' this knowledge to problems in tech interviews. Also translate this into code and try that out. Definitely familiarize oneself with the basic techniques (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, graph algos, etc...) and the fundamental data structures (search trees, lists, stack, graphs, etc...). Try and solve as many problems as one can. Best of luck!
