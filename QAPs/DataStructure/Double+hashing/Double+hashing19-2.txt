Can I become a really good self-taught programmer?
Self-taught software engineers are the best ones and all you need is passion, no matter your age. Technology is constantly evolving and so is computer science. Considering this, software engineers constantly need to learn the latest programming framework or system to be on top of the game. Someone who is only able to learn via the classical methodology; by listening to a teacher, will not be able to grow in a technical career. I am so confident about this that I co-founded a school training self-taught software engineers: https://www.holbertonschool.com It's a 2 years program to become a Full Stack Software Engineer, it's 100% hands-on: no formal teachers or lecture, students learning by working on industry level projects and by collaborating with their peers. The idea is that students will learn how to learn which is a skill they will use all along their career. If you have 2 years to invest I'd recommend to check us out, if you can only invest few months start by an online program and then a physical bootcamp. Good luck!
