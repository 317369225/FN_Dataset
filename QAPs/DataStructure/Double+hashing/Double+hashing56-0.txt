Which is the best site for preparing for Google interviews?
Step 1) Improve your programming skills, without worrying about interview preparation. Practice daily or atleast few days a week on CodeChef or TopCoder or SPOJ etc. Step 2) Familiarize yourself with interview questions including careercup, geekforgeeks and leetcode. I am not very sure about   the quality of answers (sometimes even questions) in careercup.  Step 3) Leetcode has a programming test type interface where you can attempt interview questions just like programming competitions. This is important to make sure you handle corner cases well. Step 4) Interview at X, Y, and Google. X and Y are real interviews but they  serve as mock interviews for your real google interview :P Step 5) Accept offer from Google.
