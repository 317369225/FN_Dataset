What type of technical questions does Sapient ask in interviews?
I was interviewed back in 2010 (campus placement). I worked for Sapient Nitro for 2 years. 1st interview Asked me a lot of basic c questions, like pointers, getting ascii value of characters. One question was on database. It involved joins and some set manipulation, like find all employees in A which are not in B. 2nd Interview Was asked lot about Operating systems, like memory management , deadlocks - conditions for them to occur and how you can prevent. Then moved a bit towards behavioral like things that I learnt / memorable incident. Questions on my resume - just to verify that I have actually done the projects that I have listed and also to gauge my technical knowledge.
