Programming Interviews: How should I prepare to get placed in Dream companies (CS product-based)?
Become an expert in data structures & algorithms in a programming language of your choice. This is the single-most important skill to secure a job in the Computer Software industry. Even if you are strong in other areas of computer science & applying for an extremely specific role, it is still expected that you will be extremely proficient with DS & A. To become an expert,  solve problems in Project Euler, Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ), TopCoder (archives), USA Computing Olympiad(archives). Solve problems in these sites if you have the time to prepare(>4 months). At the last 1 month of your preparation, solve all problems in the book Cracking the Coding Interview. & the company-specific questions in the site CareerCup. In fact, check out the contents page & the programming questions in the book before starting preparation to know what should be your level of expertise. Other Resources to learn data structures & algorithms: https://www.coursera.org/course/... https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2 These free courses by Professor Tim Roughgarden of Stanford are theoretical computer science courses but they will massively improve your concepts. However, the CS industry is ambivalent towards the value of the certificates awarded for these courses so do not attach to much importance to them.  The biggest advantage can be derived when you solve the programming assignments. Also on coursera: https://www.coursera.org/course/... https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII If you just want video lectures without assignments: Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503) (MIT OCW) NPTEL PHASE 2 - Data Structures & Algorithms (IIT Delhi) & code at least 1 problem a day, don't just passively watch the lectures. Some companies which will recruit you readily if you are great at data structures & algorithms (& nothing else) are Amazon & Arista Networks(strength ~ 50 in India, in US they recruit from Stanford. They are planning to compete with Cisco ).  Just get someone in your friends' network working at the company to forward your resume to a HR & usually you will get a call. Some companies which are also recruiting but may be looking for more specific skills are EMC2, Microsoft, Google,Zynga. If you are looking for product companies like Cisco, Oracle or DE Shaw where absolute proficiency with DS & A is not required in all Software Development Roles, I cannot really advise you because it is unclear to me what they look for. I myself work in Oracle Financial where I made a Pre-Placement Offer during an internship arranged by my college, which I understand is not possible for everyone.
