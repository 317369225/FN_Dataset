How does Apple interview and hire top talent?
All these companies e.g. MS,Google,Amazon,Facebook,Apple follow an approach on which that measure the thought process of a candidate. And they use different means to evaluate that, but yes most of them uses Algorithms/Data Structures/Open-ended questions as one of the approach to evaluate the talent.( As those are the base to develop the technologies) To be accustomed with algos/data structure/coding , you must have understood/practiced the minimum e.g. :   (Step-1): You should have practical understanding of the Algorithms (e.g. When to use BackTracking, When to Use Divide and Conquer, Why double hashing required ?,Where brute force concept can be applied ?) (Step-2): You should have practical understanding of Data Structures e.g. (Practical use cases related to :when to use circular buffer , or when to use adjacently list or the combination of both or something else to solve the problem  ) (Step-3) : You must practice several coding problems to implement the things which learn from Step-1 , and Step-2 (you may do the following choose any coding language for the choice of yours (C,C++ or Java or Python or PHP or any one else ) However other than programming you might need to understand the main concept for the interview is to keep the interview active and this requires some action from your side, such as the following: You need to talk You need to explain You need to discuss You need to express your views You need to understand clearly the questions given to you You need to understand the interviewer’s expression and mindset to un- derstand those questions You might need to ask appropriate questions to understand the question or any other discussion item. -- and also : Prepare : "Please tell me about your self" , "Your skills related positive/negative further interest" , Basics for the most needed computer science concepts or anything as you presented on your "CV/Resume" Other than that it depends for what position you are called or applied for e.g See this Job Position : The iPhone Quality team is looking for a motivated, highly-technical Telephony QA Engineer with excellent problem solving and communication skills. You will join a dynamic team responsible for qualifying the latest iPhone products. Your focus will be testing the Phone functionality in Apple's innovative new phone. The successful candidate will complete both documented and adhoc testing to ensure high quality releases. Required Experience: * EE degree, CS degree or equivalent * Objective C programming is required in addition to strong C/C++ coding experience * Thorough understanding of location and cellular technologies GSM/GPRS/EGPRS/WCDMA/HSDPA * White-Box testing and tools experience * Good understanding of multi-threaded environments and operating system fundamentals (*nix) * Exposure to iPhone Location API's * Knowledge of AT commands * More than 3 years of experience in telephony space * Must be able to work independently, multi-task and should be proactive * Demonstrated ability to own a complete functional area of an application or product * Good understanding of SQA methodologies & practices * Excellent communication & interpersonal skills * Must be detail oriented * Comfortable with working on hardware and in supporting engineering in debugging/reproducing hard to reproduce issues Preferred Experience: - Experience in automation and scripting(Shell/Perl/Python) - Knowledge of 3GPP specifications - Familiarity with testing drivers - Strong networking concepts ------------------------------------------------ On this Job Position it talks about the GSM/GPRS/EGPRS/WCDMA/HSDPA, iPhone Location API's, SQA methodologies & practices and some other things.. And If you have worked on any one of these or mentioned on your CV, then be prepared to show your skills on that, and also see what the exact demands they have and how you can fulfill those demands by using those skills (So such kind of discussion you can expect).
