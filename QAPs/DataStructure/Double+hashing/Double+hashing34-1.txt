How can one sharpen their problem-solving skills to prepare for an interview at a top-level software engineering firm?
These are excellent references on algorithms and data structures. It is also advised to understand discrete math and operating systems. It is worth to add three more points. 1. Algorithms. by S. Dasgupta, C.H. Papadimitriou, and U.V. Vazirani is another best source on algorithms, focusing on Number theory, Divide and Conquer, Graphs, DP and few more... The recent release of Algorithms 4e by Sedgewick & Kevin is one of the best in its category. 2. Another wiki link on List of Data Structures http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis... 3. We should be able to express our algorithm in one programming language. We need to master that language. Preferably C++ or Java.
