I am good at algorithms, and I am trying to become good at coding. But I am not good at data science and hard core systems (networking, OS, DB) stuff. Am I eligible for Google, Twitter or Facebook software engineer roles?
The big software companies generally don't care if you don't know about one specific domain (like networking, or operating systems or something). They are usually looking to hire capable developers who are good at understanding and solving problems and building the solutions. Occasionally, because of some immediate need, they might be looking for an expert in a specific subdomain. However, most of the engineers these companies hire are hired because they're intelligent, they know how to code, they understand data structures and algorithms, AND they know how to LEARN. They don't hire people just because a candidate knows every last detail about Windows architecture or something. You can build up the skills you need by actually making software. Build apps or contribute to open source projects. Maybe build something that uses the companies platform, like an app that uses Google Maps or something.
