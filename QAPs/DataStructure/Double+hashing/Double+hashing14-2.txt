What is the best advice for an engineering internship interview at Google or Facebook?
Interviews at any company are high variance, so lots of factors are out of your control. The best advice is to know your data structures and sorting algorithms really well, and show up ready to go, sharp and enthusiastic. Also really important is to show the interviewers that you are a hacker. More specifically, mention the side projects you've worked on - those are more important than which CS classes you've taken. Also mention any class projects that were especially cool, and what hacks you do in your spare time. Facebook (and Google too) has a strong hacker culture and I know they look for "culture fit" in interviews. Show that you're passionate about hacking and your goal in life is to build awesome software that makes peoples' lives better, and you'll be in good shape. Of course, if the above is not actually true—i.e., you don't actually like software that much and you don't program for fun—you're probably screwed and aren't going to get the job.
