How hard are Facebook's software engineer job interviews?
They were hard in 2007-2010 they are very easy now They ask you pretty trivial coding questions, several trivial questions about machine learning, some primitive problem solving questions and voi la. if you have at least Google IV you can pass interview at facebook easily.
