What are the best applications of Bloom filters?
As others mentioned on the thread Bloom filter is a way to quickly tell whether an element does not belong to the set. I last used it when I was crawling a billion pages for building an offline search engine. At that we had four 4 GB RAM machines of which just 2.1 GB was accessible to the Java VM. We were doing an Open Crawl (discovering pages on the fly) and we had to ensure that we do not crawl the same pages again and again. Had we used a hashset with the 8 byte key as hash of URL we would have needed more than 2 Gigs just for this set. So we ended up using Bloom filter for this. Another application I can see for something like this is a write once, no update application e.g. a URL shortener service. Here once a Tiny URL has been allocated to a URL that is not going to get updated. So instead of needing to make a database call and using a lot of memory in memcache - this data can potentially also be stored in a bloom filter.
