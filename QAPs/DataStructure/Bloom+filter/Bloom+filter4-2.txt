What is a bloom filter and what are they used for?
Bloom filter is probabilistic space efficient data structure supporting add, find and sometimes delete operation widely used for testing if element is in a set, especially if set is huge. Probabilistic in this case means that there is no 100% guarantee that find won't have false positive result. It's hash table like data structure using multiple hash functions for the same key but unlike hash tables it does not store the actual key value in a bucket it just marks all buckets for all hash functions applied to a key as used. So, it's obviously more space efficient than ordinary hash table. Great source of information can be found Bloom filter Here you may find how false positive rate depends on bloom filter parameters (number of hash functions, number of bits per key) Bloom Filters - the math Really amazing talk about different types of bloom filters by Google engineer. Also it was a first introduction to cuckoo hashing for me :)
