Why are some people so in love with Bloom filters?The extent to which people are obsessed with it is too high. What's the secret?
I agree with most of the other answers, but I'm going to add one: They are easy to understand, reason about, and implement. Don't underestimate the value of this. I once wrote a paper about using a more advanced compressed data structure (one that gave exact answers) in a certain application. The next paper which cited it did the same thing with Bloom filters, citing ease of implementation as an advantage. That other paper wasn't wrong, by the way. That is indeed an advantage, and the tradeoff may be worth it if you can live with the imprecise answers. One more thing: In the 80s, bloom filters were one line of enquiry in document retrieval, in a technique known as "signature files". You probably haven't heard of them because they turned out to be worse than useless for that particular application.
