What are the most common kinds of Bloom Filter, and how do they work?This is a follow-up question to Why are some people so in love with Bloom filters?.
The Wikipedia entry provides a good explanation of the basic Bloom filter and its extensions, including some simple statistical analysis. Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blo... The most common type of Bloom filter is a bitset of size n equipped with k independent hash functions. Each of these hash functions should map to an integer in [1, n]. This Bloom filter only supports adding objects and looking for the presence of an object in the set. The "signature" of an object is computed by calculating the k separate hashes of the object, using each independent hash function. These k integers will correspond to the positions of k bits in the bitset (note that these positions are not necessarily unique). Adding the object involves simply setting these bits to 1, and looking for the presence of an object involves checking that all k bits are set to 1. The idea behind why this works is similar to how a hash table works; however, collisions are ignored for a Bloom filter. The use of multiple hash functions helps by making the probability of a collision much less likely.
