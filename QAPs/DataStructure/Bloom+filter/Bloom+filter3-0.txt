Stable bloom filter implementation for streaming data?
You may be interested in stream-lib (https://github.com/clearspring/s...). "A Java library for summarizing data in streams for which it is infeasible to store all events. More specifically, there are classes for estimating: cardinality (i.e. counting things); set membership; and the top-k elements. One particularly useful feature is that cardinality estimators with compatible configurations may be safely merged."
