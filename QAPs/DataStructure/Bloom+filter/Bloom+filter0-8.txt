What are the best applications of Bloom filters?
Bloom Filters can be used for many things. At Insieve we use them to 1. Keep track of the pages that a given user has visited without actually being able to enumerate the links they have visited. This helps us address the privacy concerns that people may have about having our plugin in their system. The bloom filter only enables us to test if a url has been visited but not enumerate the urls they have visited. 2. We use a modified version of bloom-filter to efficiently detect and eliminate the boiler plates that occur in the text that we crawl. We maintain an array of counting-bloom-filters. We keep adding to a given bloom-filter and move on to the next when its capacity is full for given level of error rate .. and when all of them are full we reset the the oldest one bloom-filter and use it to fill in new text-runs. At any stage if the count of a given hash exceeds a preset threshold, it is graduated to a membership bloom-filter used for the boiler-plate query. This gives us a form aging bloom-filter which we can use to detect boiler plates. The fact that this is a aging bloom-filter is important since the other valid text runs need to phased out or it will lead to storing a lot of good-text-runs for no reason.   3. We also use bloom-filters to reduce the number of lookups to the db. So, we only lookup the db when the bloom-filter says true .
