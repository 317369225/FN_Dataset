Why are some people so in love with Bloom filters?The extent to which people are obsessed with it is too high. What's the secret?
Bloom filter indicates if an element is absolutely not contained, or may be contained in a set. This property of never having a false negative  makes the Bloom filters a great candidate for use as a guard condition to  help prevent performing unnecessary and expensive operations. For example : Suppose S is a huge data set of unique promo-codes(String) { x, y, z, ...}. We need to calculate whether 'n' is contained in that set or not .So if we can define our data set based on bloom filter function, we can easily rule out the possibility of existence of n is that set, though probability would be 0.99 and not 100%. Huge data storage and expensive operation on this data set is saved using bloom filter.
