What are some of the practical applications of Bloom filters in the real world? Where could it be considered the only optimal solution over the other available solutions?
One practical application is being able to create a list of things that doesn't take up much memory, with a trade-off being that for a lot of memory savings you might give up some precision (the output of the Bloom filter might say that some things are on the list that are not actually on the list; you would use some other side mechanism to deal with those if you needed to). I don't know that you would be ever be able to say that a Bloom filter approach is the most optimal solution, nor would you really care about whether it was.
