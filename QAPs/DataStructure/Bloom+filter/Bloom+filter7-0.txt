Who is using bloom filters? At what scale? How is it working for them?
Any company using Cassandra, HBase, RocksDB, etc... is using BloomFilters without knowing it. Most of these companies are using it at scale (otherwise, they may be using MySQL). You can use Google to get a list of companies using these NoSQL stores. For example, for a list of companies using Cassandra, refer to Companies Using NoSQL Apache CassandraÂ  | Planet Cassandra. How do BloomFilters fare at scale? Great! In the NoSQL DBs above, Bloom Filters are used to detect the absence of a row key from a file (i.e. SSTable). Bloom Filters are memory-resident. Hence, it is quicker to access a BF in memory than to scan the file for a row by row key. In many cases, the BF access eliminates the need for a file scan, specifically when the row key will not be found in the file!
