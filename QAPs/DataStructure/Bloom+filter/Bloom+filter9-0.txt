Probabilistic Data Structures: What is the difference between MinHash and Bloom filters?Can one extend Bloom filters for similarity search by finding intersection between sets/Jaccard coefficient using Bloom filter fingerprints/signatures, and would it be more or less efficient than computing MinHash signatures? Testing for membership seems to applicable to similarity joins as well.
MinHash is primarily used to quickly and accurately estimate the Jaccard similarity between two things (for example, two documents, two sets...). A Bloom filter is an efficient data structure that allows you to quickly prune out elements that are not part of a set, with the possibility that it may fail to prune all of them out. Both are probabilistic in nature, but the purpose is very different. MinHash is very well known and very often used in information retrieval.
