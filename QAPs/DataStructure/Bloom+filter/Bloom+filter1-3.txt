Why are some people so in love with Bloom filters?The extent to which people are obsessed with it is too high. What's the secret?
I'll add in that: People love stuff that reduces latency and load. People love memcached for the same reason that they love bloom filters -- they effectively reduce the frequency with which you have to do expensive operations, and you can do all sorts of tuning to optimize beyond the initial payoff. There's a richness to the math around bloom filters, it's not just a one-off trick. There are all sorts of variants of count bloom filters, adaptive bloom filters, time-decaying bloom filters, etc.; you can seriously geek-out if you want to, and that has some appeal to a certain kind of person.
