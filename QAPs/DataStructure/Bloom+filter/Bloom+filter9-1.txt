Probabilistic Data Structures: What is the difference between MinHash and Bloom filters?Can one extend Bloom filters for similarity search by finding intersection between sets/Jaccard coefficient using Bloom filter fingerprints/signatures, and would it be more or less efficient than computing MinHash signatures? Testing for membership seems to applicable to similarity joins as well.
Are you looking for something like Feature hashing? (I've used bloom filters and but at the core, I don't think they are built for similarity-based mapping, I use them to find duplicates as described here: What is a practical and memory-efficient algorithm to search through a sequence of millions/billions of (big heterogeneous) objects (too many to be stored in memory at once) and determine definitively whether a duplicate exists in the sequence?
