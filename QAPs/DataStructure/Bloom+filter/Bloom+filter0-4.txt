What are the best applications of Bloom filters?
Any application where a false positive is OK, but a false negative isn't. The most common use for bloom filters is probably testing to see if an element exists on disk before performing any i/o.  You risk sometimes looking for something that's not there, but you'll never skip testing a segment because the bloom filter said it wasn't there and it was.  This should reduce your I/O for lookups dramatically over large data sets. Another nice use is cheap unique counts.  If you need to know the approximate number of unique items you've seen (say, in a stream), you can use a bloom filter to test if you've seen that element before.  If the bloom filter says it's not in the set, you increment the count by one. You'll get false positives (under counting), but it's cheaper than having to keep the entire set in memory.  It's nice to be able to say "we've seen at least this many unique items".
