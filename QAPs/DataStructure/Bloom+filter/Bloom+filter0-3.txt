What are the best applications of Bloom filters?
Transactional Memory (TM) has recently applied Bloom filters to detect memory access conflicts among threads. TM is a developing concurrent programming style which hopes to alleviate the challenges of programming with locks (serialization or deadlock/races).  The programmer's task is to write ("simple") transactional code, and the underlying TM system tracks memory accesses and prevents data races/deadlock. The following is a subset of hardware TM (HTM) and software TM (STM) systems that use Bloom filters to represent a thread's access information: 2006 Bulk (Ceze et al.
