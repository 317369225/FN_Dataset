Where is the Euilerian path finding algorithm applied?I teach algorithms in Yandex School of Data Analysis. One of the topics I'll discuss with my group is DFS (depth first search) applications. One of them is of course finding Eulerian path/cycle. It's always interesting to learn algorithms when you understand where can it be applied. Sadly I don't know any industrial, scientific (or other) application. Can you help me?
One popular method used in DNA sequencing is based on finding Euler tours in something that resembles a de Bruijn graph. (Vertices are short sequences of bases, edges correspond to their overlaps.) A nice basic optimization problem closely related to Euler tours is the Chinese postman problem: what is the shortest tour that visits each edge at least once? The practical applications of this one should be pretty obvious.
