What surprised you the most in your field of study?
Diffie-hellman key exchange!! Put in simple words it is a scheme/algorithm using which two parties communicating over a network can arrive at a common secret key (for encryption further communication) without letting any eavesdropper in the medium find out about it (although the eavesdropper is privy to all the data one party sends another over the network and the parties have not had any prior communication) Wiki explains it with a brilliant diagram (Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange) and I won't be reproducing the explanation here.
