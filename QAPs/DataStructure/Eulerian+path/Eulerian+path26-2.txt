Is literary theory and criticism essentially 'much ado about nothing'?
No Literature, art, and other forms of both 'high' an 'low' culture provide us with an imagination framework which we use to understand the world around us and to understand ourselves.  Critical studies is the examination of this framework. All of us make assumptions and conclusions about the world every day without any direct or even indirect knowledge of these things.  We live in an internal world much vaster than our direct experience.  Media provides this for us, not just the news but movies, books and TV shows tell us what the world is we live in. For example people who have never been to China or known anyone from China don't generally have blank spaces in their minds concerning China like they might concerning Eulerian paths or String Theory.  People have vast amounts of 'beliefs' or even 'knowledge' that only comes from media. In fact it is possible that the Iraq war was made possible because Iraq was always depicted on TV and in the movies as having mass stockpiles of WMD.  The US public's had its imagination colonised by endless media retelling the same story, a story that was taken up by government and turned out to be utterly false and without basis. Literary studies and criticism are essential in trying to understand how these beliefs are structured, how they are created and who may benefit from their creation. But films, books and TV shows go beyond this to even teaching us how to feel, what to desire and judge ourselves and our lives. Literary studies are essential to trying to find how cultural works help us form our own concept of ourselves.  How we use plots from movies, books or folktales to make sense of and structure our own emotions. So this study is essential to fields of history, psychology, anthropology, ethics, political economy, sociology, social theory, Queer studies, ethnic studies, and any other field that takes the human and society as its subject.
