How do I become a successful entrepreneur in a short span of time?
Success = Time x Money The more time and money you give to your idea, the more successful you become. While you work on your startup, invest in other projects as well. The best market to invest in right now is the energy market. Apart from this if you invest sensibly in equity, you can get the "success" you need!
