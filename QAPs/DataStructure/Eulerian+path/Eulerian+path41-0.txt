What predictions does quantum mechanics make that we couldn't verify yet?
It depends very much upon what you mean when you say "quantum mechanics" because there are the mathematical models, there are interpretations and then there is what is inferred by the combination of the previous two things. In essence, the basic mathematical model predicts only what we already know but explaining what it is we see is a whole other path of exploration. Even the "spooky action at a distance" so often referred to is just part of an extension of an interpretation. There is a connection between inference and interpretation and what you are asking is more art than science but we often get that conflated. Let me refer you to a previous Quora answer to Why is Bohmian mechanics not very well promoted that deals with criticizing the most popular interpretation "The Copenhagen interpretation" and refers instead to a much less known and less well developed interpretation that is quickly gaining ground. All of the spooky, magical, mystical seeming effects in QM are based upon the Copenhagen interpretation and it turns out that fluid dynamics offers a fully rational deterministic model to utterly replace the silly woo (Copenhagen) that has snuck into science. Here is an excerpt from a Cambridge researcher's website that puts the new fluid dynamics interpretation in very concise wording: Maxwell's fluid model of magnetism shows that a wavepacket travelling along a phase vortex in an Eulerian fluid obeys Maxwell's equations, is emitted and absorbed discretely, and can have linear or circular polarisation. What's more, the measured correlation between the polarisation of two cogenerated wavepackets is exactly the same as predicted by quantum mechanics, and observed in the Bell tests
