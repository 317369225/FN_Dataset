How can a seasoned software developer get into bioinformatics?For a person with lots of programming experience, and relatively fair (though outdated) biology knowledge, what would be the best way to start?
Definetely, yes. As a bioinformatician, a huge force slowing down bioinformatics advancement and application right now is a poor design of existing packages making code reuse or re-purpousing applications extremely hard. The more seasoned software developers there are in biology, the better it is for the whole community. Depending on your time for finding a job in bioinformatics, you could start by attending a conference with a large bioiformatics component, such as ISMB or one of Cold Spring Harbor conferences and talk to people. Most of attending Principle Investigators would be more then happy to offer you a job. Otherwise you could go through major bioinformatics hubs (UCSB, UCSD, UCSC, JHU, Broad Institute, Rockefeller Center, EBI, EMBL Heidelberg, Max Plank Insitiute, ... ) looking for post-doc/technician positions on topics you would feel interested in.
