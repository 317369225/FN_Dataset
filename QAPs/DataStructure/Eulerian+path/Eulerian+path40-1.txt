What's a complete list of topics/a complete syllabus to fully learn computer programming from scratch?
I'm programming in AutoLISP. Most people find it very complicated. I don't think it is complicated. Before you start programming, you must ask yourself the following four questions: 1. What program do you want? 2. What must the program do? 3. How is the program written? 4. How is the program tested? Explain what program you want? You can add pictures to the explanation. Say what the program must do. What are the steps? What is the user doing? That is programming. Now you must explain how the program is written and what i done by the computer program. Testing. Look. Some users are very stupid. You tell them what they must do and all of a sudden they only speak Russian. Or they don't understand your language. So the program must be fool proof. Was I clear? If not let me know.
