How do I become a successful entrepreneur in a short span of time?
Your question is just BARELY misguided. What you should want to know is "How do I become a successful entrepreneur and cut my learning curve as significantly as possible?" and the simple answer is, you need mentors. The human mind is still the single greatest resource known to man and likely will be for quite a while into the future. What you need to do is identify what kind of mentor you need, and how to find that mentor. Tai Lopez has something he calls your Eulerian Destiny that I think is pretty good for everyone I've ever parrotted it to: 1. What did you grow up around? 2. What did you want to be when you were 10-14? 3. What do strangers give you compliments on? 4. What can you talk about effortlessly with friends on a Saturday night? Answer these questions over and over. Mix and match the answers, one answer from each question. When you've done this enough you should see something that jumps out at you -- a pattern of sorts. Think in terms of an industry. What is your industry? That is where you must find your mentor. You'll need a mentor in investing, raising capital, marketing/advertising, and sales. What you've learned in school may or may not be what you need to use to produce your desired results. Just remember, the only way to shorten your path to success is to be humble in action and to learn everything you can from those that have done it before.
