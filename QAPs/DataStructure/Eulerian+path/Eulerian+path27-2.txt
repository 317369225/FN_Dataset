How can a seasoned software developer get into bioinformatics?For a person with lots of programming experience, and relatively fair (though outdated) biology knowledge, what would be the best way to start?
It depends on your skill set, if you are into data-science and familiar with statistical analysis , writing programs in python, shell, R (w.r.t genomic and proteomic analysis) you can take some courses of NGS data analysis and start working. Even packages are being developed in C/C++ as well. There is also a large part of Bioinformatics which deals with Novel database formations which can be used for Biological knowledge and information sharing. You can also check the below answer in Quora. What is the best path towards a career in computational biology/bioinformatics for a software developer with 2.5 years of experience? I would not always suggest for a PhD as it takes a chunk of years of your life , if you want to be a researcher then going for a PhD is worth or you can also take up a Masters and then pursue. However if you want to directly go into Bioinformatics company from a software industry then you have to be more a Data Scientist so that you can apply for jobs in that position. I hope it serves your query.
