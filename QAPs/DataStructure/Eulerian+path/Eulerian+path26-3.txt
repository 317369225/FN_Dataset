Is literary theory and criticism essentially 'much ado about nothing'?
The whole of literature and its implications in human society are too large to be comprehended by itself, an sich; and as such we need maps which would show us only the essential features of concern, to, for example, a specific issue or a specific exposition; and we can look at the different theories as maps which show to us only the kind of features in literature that we wish to highlight (just as there are maps that show only economic features, geographical features, &c.). Thus, theories are epistemological maps through which we may make sense of this large, multi-faceted thing we call "literature," which do not give us answers per se, but merely show us the path toward them.
