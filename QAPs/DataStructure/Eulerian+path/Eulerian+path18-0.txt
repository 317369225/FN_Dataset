What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
When I was about 18 a schoolteacher pointed out to us that you can treat the differential operator ddx   like a variable. So if you write D=ddx   then you can, for example, interpret (D 2 +1)f(x)  as f ′′ (x)+f(x)  . But then I had the way out idea of not just forming polynomials in D  but also transcendental functions. Eventually I tried exp(D)f(x)  for various functions f  and realised I was getting f(x+1)  . I was completely blown away. You could shift functions by exponentiating a differential operator. I thought that exponentiating such a thing would give complete nonsense but it didn't. Turns out Oliver Heaviside had been making use of this well over a century ago and Boole had documented it even earlier. And I just discovered page 343 of this book from the 18th century: http://books.google.com/books?id... It also turns out that this is important in quantum mechanics and having played with these operators before ever studying QM gave me a head start. I also found countless ways to use this approach to solving many problems in differential equations - many of them not in standard textbooks. So my discovery may have been old, but it was really useful to have discovered it for myself. I recently heard that the teacher who taught us the idea of treating ddx   as a variable was knocked off his bicycle and killed. That makes me sad. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ope... Updated: 17 to 18. I remember now that this was the extra school term we had as preparation for Oxbridge entrance exams.
