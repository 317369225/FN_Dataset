Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
Ever since humans first started talking we've been modelling the world with words like gold, shiny and electron. Part of these models is the use of the word exists which can be loosely thought of as a word that says what is or isn't part of our models. So to me it doesn't make sense to ask if electrons exist, or they're just a model. The moment you're talking about what does or doesn't exist you're modelling the world. The important question isn't whether or not electrons are "just" a model, but whether they are part of a good model.
