What are the must-reads for computer scientists new to the bioinformatics field?
Though not highly technical nor offering a single-minded computer science orientation, Dr. Eric Topol's breakthrough book has a spot-on understanding of how consumer-patient generated data will combine with information technology (especially wireless and mobile applications, which Topol likes to "prescribe"), social media, genomics and other medical advances collectively to deliver a data-driven, information-intensive future for medicine - albeit a very disruptive one, as his title suggests The Creative Destruction of Medicine: How the Digital Revolution Will Create Better Health Care - Kindle edition by Eric Topol.
