What predictions does quantum mechanics make that we couldn't verify yet?
There can be two kinds of predictions- Existence of certain phenomena. (like existence of charge) Property of any phenomena even if it's hypothetical. (Like quantity of charge quantization : e).Quantum mechanical and mathematical calculations lead us to the exact quantity of magnetic monopolar charge that, if ever it exists, has to be in those quanta. However, as far I as I have read Quantum Mechanics, it does not predict/reject the existence of magnetic monopoles. So, the quantization of magnetic charge (predicted by QM) can only be verified once it is discovered (not commented by QM).
