Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
We can say they exist as surely as anything exists, and we can say they most definitely are neither particles nor waves, but entities which sometimes have characteristics of both, or either.
