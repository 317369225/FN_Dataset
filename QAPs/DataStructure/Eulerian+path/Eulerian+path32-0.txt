Bioinformatics: What should I do to become a bioinformatist?
"As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science,statistics, mathematics, and engineering to study and process biological data" -  Wikipedia. As a bioinformatician, you will need to equip yourself with basic knowledge in all these areas. Computer science • Python, C/C++, Perl, R or some other programming language. • Basics of Unix - (sort, cut, grep, awk, sed,..) • Search and sorting algorithms • String manipulation e.g. edit distance, alignment etc. (used in genome alignment) Statistics Hypothesis testing e.g. χ2-test, t-test, Fisher exact test. (Used in association studies) Bayes theorem and Naive Bayes assumption. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation (statistical genetics). Expectation - Maximization algorithm. (used in HMM, GMM) Markov Chain Monte - Carlo methods Machine Learning Linear and Logistic regression (used in GWAS methods) Clustering K-nearest neighbors, Random Forests etc. Mathematics • Linear algebra - Linear equations and matrix factorizations • Graph theory - Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths (used in genome assembly) Genetics Population genetics Molecular biology is also very useful.
