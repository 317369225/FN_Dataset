If I want to start with bioinformatics or computational biology, what topics should I learn? What are the actual challenges in this field?
Bioinformatics and computational biology are methods and tools used to study biology. So the first thing to do is learn biology. Learn basic genetics, genomics, cell biology, evolution and a bit of biochemistry. Once you understand the principles on which life operates, then start getting into the more common computational methods such as the sequence alignment problem, protein folding problems, association mapping, and analyzing next-gen sequencing data. A lot of bioinformatics now a days is analysis of sequencing data to figure out e.g. potential causal mutations in cancer, and problems in computational biology include building the tools needed to generate the sequencing data that is analyzed by the bioinformaticians.
