How do you solve the square puzzle?As you can see, you can draw a line from A to B, also a circle, so many figures like for the rectangle starting from point A in one stroke without cut (lift the pen) or repeat the line twice, well the square with a cross, I challenged everyone to do it but yet failed... I really like to know if it can be solved
Because it's impossible. You're trying to find an Eulerian path (A draw visiting each edge of one graph exactly once). The necessary condition of an Eulerian path is not found : For the existence of Eulerian trails it is necessary that zero or two vertices have an odd degreeYou have four of them. You can found more explanation about Eulerian stuff here Eulerian path And about a related problem here Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg If you can reduce a problem to a graph one, you can use graph theory to solve it. Graph theory is powerfull.
