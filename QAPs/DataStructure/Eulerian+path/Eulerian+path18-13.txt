What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Okay, I don't expect you to believe me.  But I swear I discovered Archimedes principle of volume displacement before learning about it in high school science class.  Oh yeah, it was in a bath tub too.  No I didn't say "Eureka!"
