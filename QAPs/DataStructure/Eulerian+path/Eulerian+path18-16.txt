What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Some mathematical proofs I "discovered":  When I was in first grade, I realized that in multiplying two numbers, if one were even, I could halve it and double the other and get the same result (and repeat as possible), since halving and doubling are easier operations to do in one's head than "actual" multiplying. I realized intellectually the same would be true of multiples of other numbers, but that was harder to do in my head at age 6.   When I was in second grade, I realized that when you start with a*a=a^2, and add one to one factor, and subtract one from the other, the product is one less (a-1)(a+1)=a^2-1.  I soon realized that you could do this with any n difference, and the result is a^2-n^2, although being years away from algebra, I didn't understand why.   I usually worked this the other way around, calculating a*b by squaring their average, and subtracting the square of the difference between one of them and the average.   When I was in third grade, my father was impressed that I figured out that the consecutive squares differed by the consecutive odd numbers (thanks to looking at the square tiles in a locker room).  But try as I might, I couldn't figure out the pattern for consecutive cubes. I also reproduced young Gauss' equation about triangular numbers (although, oddly, I did it as two cases.  When n is even, Tn is (n+1)*(n/2).  When n is odd, Tn is n*(n/2+.5).  Again, no algebra to understand these were in fact the same.    40+ years later, I'm still "discovering" things.  For example, I was thinking on the train one day a few years ago about patterns in "decimals" in bases other than ten, and I realized to my chagrin  that I had basically just rehashed Fermat's Little Theorem.
