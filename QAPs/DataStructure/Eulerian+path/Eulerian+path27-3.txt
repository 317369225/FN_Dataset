How can a seasoned software developer get into bioinformatics?For a person with lots of programming experience, and relatively fair (though outdated) biology knowledge, what would be the best way to start?
You don't really need biology knowledge.  Bioinformatics is largely the application of certain kinds of algorithms to certain kinds of data sets (e.g. DNA sequences).  Bioinformatics data sets are freely available online, and you can look up the relevant algorithms in books and run them on the data (making sure to use whatever language bioinformaticists happen to think is sexy at the time you are doing all this). Of course, you can do all this, but you've still got to convince an employer that you know all this stuff.... Arguably the best way to do it is to break down and spend one year getting a master's degree in bioinformatics.
