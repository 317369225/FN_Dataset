Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
They are the same thing. It is meaningless to talk about 'existence' outside the bounds of a physical model. When we say something 'exists', we necessarily imply that it forms a part of our model that best fits all the observed data. Mere existence is a vacuous statement. It is the observable properties of what exists that is of value to us. Indeed it is true that observation (direct or indirect) is the key component in defining what is said to exist.
