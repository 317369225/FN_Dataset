Bioinformatics: What should I do to become a bioinformatist?
Learning a programming language is definitely worth, if you have a knack for language, as of now the hot cake in the Bioinformatics field is Python, Perl and R. Definitely JAVA,C and C++ need not be ruled out but it depends on the workstation you will be employed and what gold standards practices they have. The most important thing which you need  to have interest in Biology( not necessary you have to good in Biology you will eventually able to connect everything with it) and think everything in terms of 0's and 1's (numerical pattern) and find a pattern that can be associated with it and try to fit statistical feature to it. This will help you in excelling in the field.  Always have the aptitude to learn new things and accept challenge.
