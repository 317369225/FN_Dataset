What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
I don't remember exactly when I did this, but it was in the class where the teacher taught us about perfect squares, and you tend to learn quite fast that 1,4,9,16,25,36 ... were them. Shortly after the class in an hour with some free time, me and my friend were doing 1+3+5+7+9 and discovering that each iteration produced a perfect square, we were pretty excited about it, and thought it was an amazing "coincidence", only to learn 2 years or so later that, 1+3+...2n−1=n 2   it was pretty much a simple relation, and that there are no "coincidences" in mathematics.
