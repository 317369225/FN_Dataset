Where is the Euilerian path finding algorithm applied?I teach algorithms in Yandex School of Data Analysis. One of the topics I'll discuss with my group is DFS (depth first search) applications. One of them is of course finding Eulerian path/cycle. It's always interesting to learn algorithms when you understand where can it be applied. Sadly I don't know any industrial, scientific (or other) application. Can you help me?
In VLSI. Transistors are considered the vertices. Finding an Eulerian path optimizes the design of the chip corresponding to this circuit, by placing the parts of the chip, that represent the inputs of the transistors, in their order in the Eulerian path.
