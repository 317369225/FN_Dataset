How can I find a complete mathematics curriculum for private school if I want to open a math school for school-aged children?
Besides the obvious things needed for exams common in all schools I would suggest you teach them things that are a bit more fun, e.g. Math for seven-year-olds:Â  graph coloring, chromatic numbers, and Eulerian paths and circuits
