What surprised you the most in your field of study?
I am a Computer Science major and there have been moments when I was truly amazed by it. (i) You cannot truly simulate the tossing of a coin on a computer. It is difficult to get a computer to do anything by chance. Here's a link to an organisation that give you truly random numbers based on atmospheric noise Introduction to Randomness and Random Numbers (ii) All my money and information feels safe over the internet just because a simple arithmetic problem takes a really long time to solve on computers. i.e. the cost incurred in solving the problem is way more than the rewards.  RSA problem (iii) Evolution is so deep seated, it applies everywhere. Software, algorithms, competitors in a free market. Evolutionary algorithm (iv) If you can represent yes/no (1/0) using something, you have a computer. Behold! molecular computing RNA nanotechnology for computer design and in vivo computation http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org... (v) Exponential growth is pretty overwhelming. And so you will find very interesting comparisons in computer science texts "The time taken to solve this problem is greater than the age of the universe"  "The number of address won't run out even if we uniquely address every grain of sand on the Earth." (vi) There can be two very similar problems, once of which is solved easily and the other is intractable. eg. Finding a path that traverses every edge of a graph exactly once (eulerian path) is solvable while, finding a path that goes through each node exactly once (hamiltonian path) is intractable Data Structures and Algorithms: Hard Problems
