Bioinformatics: What should I do to become a bioinformatist?
Learn as many of these as you can, at least one in each category: Programming Languages:  C/C++, Python (with numpy, pandas, scipy ...). Optional: R, MATLAB. Math: Basic algorithms, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Probability. Data Analysis: Regression, Machine Learning (Clustering, Classification, Neural Nets, Bayesian methods, Boosting), MCMC methods, Hidden Markov Models. Computing: Parallel computing, optimization, distributed systems, Numerical Methods. Biology (standard): Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry, Bio-phyiscal thermodynamics (or Statistical Mechanics). Biology (theory): Population Genetics, Coalescent Theory, Evolutionary Game Theory, Network Theory. Also try to learn as much as you can about the process from which you receive data. Understanding processes like RT-PCR, Next-generation sequencing methods, single cell transcriptomics, and the like can help you a lot. Read these Journals: Bioinformatics, Genome Research, Nature Biotechnology, Nature Genetics, PLOS Comp Bio, BMC bioinformatics. Updated 6 Oct 2014 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Amin Ghaemi
