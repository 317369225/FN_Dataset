Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
Nothing is real in this world. Everything is what we see or get to know through experimental evidences. Physics is based on experiments. There is no theory in Physics without any experimental evidences. Even Newton's laws have experimental evidences. Electron is just the result of experimental evidences and so are all particles. We just cannot say an electron exists. This is above from reality. Even about atoms, we have no cent percent reality. All properties of particles are based on experimental evidences.
