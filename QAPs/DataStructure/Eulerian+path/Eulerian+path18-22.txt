What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
I "discovered" PCA (Principle Components Analysis) and Binary Decision Diagrams while casually researching Boolean expression minimization.  I didn't make the connection that PCA could be used for continuous domains, and certainly didn't make any connections with eigenvectors, as my approach was more statistical than anything. I also remember discovering the closed form solution for the Fibonacci numbers after noticing their ratio converging, which was pretty exciting.  Finding out that this had already been done was pretty disappointing though. Lastly, Zeno's paradox used to keep me awake for hours as a kid.  Still does sometimes, though knowing space is quantized gives some comfort.
