Is literary theory and criticism essentially 'much ado about nothing'?
Literature is certainly something and, to many people, a very significant something. Literary theory and criticism is simply an effort to better understand that something. So, the value of each depends upon who you ask. A lot of people like literature. A small subset of them also like literary theory and criticism. For me, both are valuable. Both are much ado about something incredibly valuable.
