Where is the Euilerian path finding algorithm applied?I teach algorithms in Yandex School of Data Analysis. One of the topics I'll discuss with my group is DFS (depth first search) applications. One of them is of course finding Eulerian path/cycle. It's always interesting to learn algorithms when you understand where can it be applied. Sadly I don't know any industrial, scientific (or other) application. Can you help me?
