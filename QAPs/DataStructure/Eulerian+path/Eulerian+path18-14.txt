What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
One such incident happened with me very recently, in the previous semester.   I was trying to find out all the prime numbers which can be written as a sum of two cubes (p=x 3 +y 3 )  . I had recently taken the elementary course in Algebraic Number Theory and I was fascinated by its applications in solving Diophantine equations. I split the above equation in Z[ω]  ( ω  is a cuberoot of unity) into three factors and using basic properties of the ring Z[ω]  such as PID, UFD and 3 being the only ramified prime, I came up with a necessary and sufficient condition for such primes:   An odd prime number p=x 3 +y 3   if and only if p=3n(n+1)+1  for some integer n  .   I felt very proud of myself for having established an amazing result using the techniques of recently learned subject. Later I went to my instructor to show the proof only to realize that the problem is just one-line exercise in high school algebra that requires no higher mathematics.
