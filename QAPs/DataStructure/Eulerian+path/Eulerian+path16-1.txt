What are some good resources for learning about computational genomics? Why?This is a follow-up on What are some good papers on high-throughput sequencing?
Some random places: Rosalind [1] is a popular resource for doing bioinformatics problems. The Durbin [2] book is a classic for bioinformatics as well. A couple of OCW courses at MIT are good (though a bit outdated now): Quantitative Genomics [3] George Church's random walk through genomics and society [4] [1]: http://rosalind.info/problems/lo...
