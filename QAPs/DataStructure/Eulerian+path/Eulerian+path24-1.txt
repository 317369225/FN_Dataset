Where can I find topic wise algorithmic problems?I'm a newbie to algorithmic problem solving. What I want is to go through a particular algorithm and solve some good amount of problems related to that algorithm so as to gain a good grip over algorithmic problem solving. Is my procedure correct?
I am surprised no one mentioned this :- The bible - TopCoder Statistics - Problem Archive Yes, what you are thinking of is a good strategy. Just check the url above, put in the category and solve a few questions with varying difficulty. If you are stuck you can look into the editorials for solutions.
