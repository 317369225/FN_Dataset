Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
The simple answer is yes, the phenomena we call electrons exist. An electron, however, is not in itself a discrete object but an event that exists to balance its opposite, the proton, and does so in a specifically defined boundary. This is why it is possible for 'an' electron to appear in one place within its 'cloud' and then in another without apparent travel. It is simply an occurrence that takes place in various, but strictly defined, areas in rapid succession, NOT a single object bouncing from place to place without regard for Newtonian etiquette. It 'appears' to be a discrete object because there is 'always' an instance of this balancing event we call an electron. Unfortunately, our earlier idea of 'planet orbiting sun' model still persists as an almost Jungian archetype from too many high school science textbook imagesÂ  and chalkboard oversimplifications. So yes, the electron event that arises from ..quantum foam(buzzword)? as a necessary balancing act does exist and if it were possible to map each of these events within its 'event cloud' then I am certain it would tell us very specific things about the state and mechanics of the neutron. ~and to Geoffrey Gaines: "...like a set of silhouettes of an object from different directions..." _________this phrase is poetry.
