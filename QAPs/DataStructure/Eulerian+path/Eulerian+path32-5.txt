Bioinformatics: What should I do to become a bioinformatist?
If you have profound knowledge in C,Java or C++ or either basic knowledge of ruby, python or such high level languages you can work really good in bio informatics. You may solve problems onÂ  http://rosalind.info/ You may take up coursera courses https://www.coursera.org/course/... You can contribute to scikit-bio (If you are a python programmer) You can contribute Afra genome project https://github.com/wurmlab/afra I think this must be enough to work for around 5-6 years. Completeing only coursera courses (around 5-6 courses) will take 1 year if you have just begin programming.
