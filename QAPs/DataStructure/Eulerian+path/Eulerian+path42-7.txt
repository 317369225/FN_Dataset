Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
Well you can hit something with electrons, or create some current passing through a copper wire. If there are certain apparent effects of a phenomena, then it must exist. Of course, in the future, we may find something peculiar in high energies, where everything goes crazy and there is no, say, an electron model anymore. This doesn't say electrons weren't real from the beginning, it just says that they were only applicable in certain energy range. Also, from a philosophical point of view, "existing" is a challenging concept. We don't even know if we are just a computer program (South Park/Matrix reference), governed by the laws that are put as various codes into the computer. We just "observe" things. That's all. Obsevation is the key role in determining the fundamental law. We ask questions, then observe. Write down some equations, then again, observe. From this definition, "existing" can be derived from being "observable" in nature. We don't care if we are part of the Matrix. We just want to know what are the fundemantal laws. THAT'S ALL!!
