Is it good to train for the USA Computing Olympiad?I am not going to competite in any competition. Â I am eager to learn data structures, algorithms and related concepts. Is it easy to understand?
The USACO training website, http://train.usaco.org/ is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to become good at designing and implementing algorithms and data structures. It covers nearly a wide variety of standard algorithms: dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, depth-first search and breadth-first search, recursive brute-force search and pruning, shortest path, minimum spanning tree, network flow, Eulerian path, and probably some stuff I've missed. It also has a lot of ad hoc problems that were popular in some of the older IOIs; these require you to be more creative than simply adapting one of the major classes of algorithms. The best part is that everything you need to know about dynamic programming, graph theory, etc. to solve the problems on the website is explained within the website itself. The monthly USACO contests are also fun, and they are offered at three levels: bronze, silver, and gold; you will start out in bronze where the problems are easy and you will probably be able to solve at least one problem, and only move up to silver and then gold once you've mastered your current division. The learning curve extends pretty far out. And by the way, if you can finish the training pages and reach the gold division in the contests, many tech interview questions will seem trivial by comparison.
