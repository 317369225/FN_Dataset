What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Halting problem When I was a kid (in my third grade) I thought it was impossible to calculate how long I should wait for my friend who went to search for the cricket ball ( i.e., maximum time I can wait, what if he returns with the ball after I leave?). Then I applied the same concept for the workers who worked in our farmland , without knowing the efficiency of the workers and the amount of work they have to do It's impossible to calculate the maximum amount of time we have to wait for the completion of work before abandoning it to plough the land. I thought that was not an invention but later I came to know there is something called Halting problem which deals with the same kind of situation in computer programs.
