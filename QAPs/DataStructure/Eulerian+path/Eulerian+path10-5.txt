What surprised you the most in your field of study?
I graduated with a degree in Electronics and Instrumentation. Control System is one of the majors we had. It is fascinating because everybody want to have a control on what is going around us. But there are things which are hard to control like the life itself and things like stock market. Couple of years after graduation, I had an understanding of why certain things can be controlled and certain things can't be. The important revelation which fascinated me is the Chaos theory. In designing control systems, we create a mathematical model of things. Chaos theory says that, even if you have the best model of certain systems, you may not, let alone even to predict the behavior, be able o control. This is because, such systems depends on the initial conditions and are always approximations of real conditions and are highly sensitive to it. This one continuously keeps me engaged ever since, to ask "why?".
