What is the order of reading data structures and algorithms for smooth learning?I started competitive coding 3 months back. I'm able to solve most of the ad-hoc and easy problems on various judges. I need to start learning data structures and algorithms to improve further. I've seen a lot of questions on the required Algorithms and DS to do well, but not the order of reading and mastering them. Thanks!
