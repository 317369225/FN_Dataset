What were the "16 standard algorithms" that Neal Wu's coaches "drilled into his brain" in preparation for the International Olympiad in Informatics?Quotes from http://www.wired.com/magazine/20...
Neal's coach signing in here (I guess this is a bit overdue). That article from Wired, like most popular science articles, have a number of inaccuracies. I agree with the other posts that it's probably referring to that list on the USACO training pages. Looking at that list, some of the topics (dynamic programming, greedy, adhoc) are just as crucial, some of them are grouped into graph theory, while some (complete/heuristic searches) are much less common now. Key topics in recent IOIs, such as tree-like graphs, and data structures, are also missing from the list. I don't think Neal (or any other US contestants) drilled these topics individually. What's more common is to do a contest (hopefully one where things don't go so well) and make adjustments based on it. Neal was among the first US high school contestants to have exposure to the international contest literature (TopCoder/acm.sgu/POI/CEOI/CNOI/CTSC). This led to sharper reactions to most problems, as well as better decision making during contests.
