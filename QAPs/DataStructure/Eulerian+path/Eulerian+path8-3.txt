Are there good websites where you can find short and efficient implementation for algorithms and data structures in C++?We all know how understanding algorithms and data structures in theory is simple, but when it comes to implementing them it might be a little difficult. Is there a place where I can find efficient and short code with built in libraries and short-cuts used for algorithms and DS implementation?
mycodeschool on YouTube is very good for crisp explaination and practical implementation for data structures :)
