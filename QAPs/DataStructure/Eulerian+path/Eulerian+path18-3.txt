What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Last summer, I did a 3-weeks research on a game. I knew the rules, and the proof that the 1st player should always have a winning strategy. I proved 3 different winning strategies for general board sizes and about 70 specific ones using a computer code, which also helped me discover there can be more than one solution. I also proved 2 general examples for losing strategies. After that, I learned the game is named Chomp, and that almost everything I discovered appears on Wikipedia: Chomp
