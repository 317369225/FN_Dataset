What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Fermat Factorization, or The Difference of Squares I recall a time when I was no older than 5 or 6. I found that, essentially, x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1). I was astounded by this result and how it worked so reliably, for even huge numbers, even as large as (gasp) 30! (That's just 30, not 30 factorial) I did not know how to formalize it with algebra, so I found a pretty loose geometric proof of it. In my excitement, I formulated my own method of multiplication based on this property, which I continue to use today. When I took algebra, needless to say, I was disappointed.
