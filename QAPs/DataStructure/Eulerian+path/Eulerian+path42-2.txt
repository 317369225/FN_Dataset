Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
I like these answers, but must add another thought: The concept of the electron is probably closer to the description of physical reality than ever before, but that's not enough to prove existence.  We've learned that cathode rays are made up of the same stuff that creates atomic orbitals, and thus define all chemical reactions. The photoelectric effect was unexpected, spin and the pauli exclusion principal, electron diffraction, the Milikan oil drop and quantized charge, all required us to update and refine our concept of what these little things are (or this stuff is). From these properties it is clear that the electron is not like anything we experience in everyday life.  So it is probably safe to say that the electron is a model, where we've extended what we can visualize as far as possible, and that is not far enough.  We can accurately describe the behavior in many different situations, like a set of silhouettes of an object from different directions. I guess yours is a philosophical question: does the fact that we named the phenomenon allow us to say that they exist, even if only in our minds?  If we learned that electrons really were continuous fields and not numerable discrete objects, or that there was only one electron zipping around in spacetime, would we conclude that they didn't exist as we thought, or would we just update our view and continue to call them electrons?  What qualifies as existence?  Physics doesn't really tackle this sort of question.   Regardless, our understanding of the natural world is richer.
