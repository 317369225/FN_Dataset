Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
It's ok to be confused. "Reality" is confusing when you get down to electrons. Consider the two-slit experiment (electron version). What would you like to call the fact that part of the wavefunction goes through one hole, and the rest through the other? Would you want to say that there exists an electron that goes through one hole? Would you like to say that there exist two electrons that go through two holes? A half of electron that goes through each hole? It is tempting to say, in this case, that "electron" is just a mental construct with which you, somewhat arbitrarily, mark on a graph the point where the wavefunction is concentrated. But remember: if you look at the holes, you will always find exactly one electron in exactly one hole. So in THIS case it is tempting to say that there exists an actual "electron" that passed exactly through one of the holes. So here's a my philosophical idea: the electron exists if you are looking at it and it's just a mental construct marking points on a graph if you are not looking at it. And this is a general answer too, it applies to any other particle that is small enough for you to wonder if it exists or not.
