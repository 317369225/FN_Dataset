What were the "16 standard algorithms" that Neal Wu's coaches "drilled into his brain" in preparation for the International Olympiad in Informatics?Quotes from http://www.wired.com/magazine/20...
From the USACO training pages: Hal Burch conducted an analysis over spring break of 1999 and made an amazing discovery: there are only 16 types of programming contest problems! Furthermore, the top several comprise almost 80% of the problems seen at the IOI. Here they are: Dynamic Programming Greedy Complete Search Flood Fill Shortest Path Recursive Search Techniques Minimum Spanning Tree Knapsack Computational Geometry Network Flow Eulerian Path Two-Dimensional Convex Hull BigNums Heuristic Search Approximate Search Ad Hoc Problems http://ace.delos.com/usacotext2?...
