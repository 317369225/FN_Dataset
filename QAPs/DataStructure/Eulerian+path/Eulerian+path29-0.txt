If I want to start with bioinformatics or computational biology, what topics should I learn? What are the actual challenges in this field?
"As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to study and process biological data" -  Wikipedia. As a bioinformatician, you will need to equip yourself with basic knowledge in all these areas. Computer science • Python, Perl, R or some other scripting language. • Basics of Unix - (sort, cut, grep, awk, sed,..) • Search and sorting algorithms • String manipulation e.g. edit distance, alignment etc. (used in genome alignment) Statistics Hypothesis testing e.g. χ2-test, t-test, Fisher exact test. (Used in association studies) Bayes theorem and Naive Bayes assumption. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation (statistical genetics). Expectation - Maximization algorithm. (used in HMM, GMM) Markov Chain Monte - Carlo methods. Mathematics • Linear algebra - Linear equations and matrix factorizations • Graph theory - Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths (used in genome assembly) Sequencing NGS : Jay Shendure, Hanlee Ji (2008) Next-generation DNA sequencingNature Biotechnology 26, 1135-1145(2008)Three very important steps in computational biology/bioinformatics studies are - Alignment Assembly Variant calling   I wrote about some references on these topics and introductory readings for someone new to bioinformatics in another post - Diving into bioinformatics : Introductory studies for a mathematician/statistician or a computer scientist by Janu Verma on Ripples in Water
