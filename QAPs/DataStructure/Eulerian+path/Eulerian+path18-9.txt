What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Parallax error While I've had a few of these moments, I'll share one particular one because of its eventual outcome ... Growing up, my family used to take regular weekend trips to the countryside. I'd sit in the back seat and fixate my gaze on an object by the roadside, say a haystack. I found it fascinating how the haystack moved really slowly when at a distance, but would move much faster when closer to the car. The week before one of these trips, I learnt introduction to optics in school; I think I was around 12. This time around when I fixated on the haystack and saw it whoosh by, I tried to analyze it in terms of ray optics, and "discovered" parallax error. I was pretty excited to share this with my physics teacher that Monday, and I distinctly remember asking if I could win a Nobel prize for this (youthful naivety ... how I miss you). Fortunately, my teacher was the sweetest person about it. Rather than shatter the glass, she encouraged my curiosity by taking me to the physics lab and showed me some very cool experiments using lenses and mirrors. Best physics lab ever!
