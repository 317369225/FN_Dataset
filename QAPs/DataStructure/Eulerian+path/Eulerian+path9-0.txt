If a pen were able to draw in three dimensions, would there be any notable traceable patterns, e.g. Platonic solids?(Traceable means the ability to be drawn without 'lifting' the pen or going over previously drawn lines)
What you're talking about here are graphs that possess an Eulerian path. This class of graphs is exactly those graphs that have either zero or two vertices of odd degree, the rest being of even degree. (So either all degrees are even, or all degrees except two are even.) It is easy to show that an Eulerian path can be traced starting from one of the vertices of odd degree and ending at the other one. If all vertices have even degree, you can start from whichever vertex you like, and you'll end at the same vertex, thus forming an Eulerian cycle.
