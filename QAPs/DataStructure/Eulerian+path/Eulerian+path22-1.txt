I'm looking for travelling salesman-style problems to solve using a genetic algorithm. What are suggestions for any such problems?Well, I'm not really that fussy. Any problem suitable for solving with a GA will suit me fine.
You can solve Eight queens puzzle using GA. Its a nice start to anyone wants to improve understanding of GA.. :)
