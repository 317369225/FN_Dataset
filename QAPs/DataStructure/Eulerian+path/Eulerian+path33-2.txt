What was your favorite computer science applications class and why?
Objects and design... It was a core class, but looking back it was one of the most important classes I took. We worked in teams and learned how to design software (software architecture), design patterns, scrum, and many other practices commonly found in software development, all while working on a clone of a classic game. I've met lots of smart people who can program well when solving small problems, know specific languages like the back of their hand, and understand certain frameworks really well, but don't seem to be very knowledgeable when it comes to planning projects and staying consistent, which results in very similar projects looking very different, or constant refactoring and spaghetti code. I really think these issues are alleviated when someone takes the time to really think things through before they start typing. And that is something we did lots of in that class (irc, almost half of the assignments required no programming).
