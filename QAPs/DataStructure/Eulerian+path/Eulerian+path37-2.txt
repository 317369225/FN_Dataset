How do I become a successful entrepreneur in a short span of time?
To be successful, you have to make specific things happen, usually bringing enormous value to many people. We Quorans have no idea what you're trying to make happen, so we have no idea what to suggest to make those things happen faster. First, decide who you're going to help and how you're going to help them. Second, think of the parameters of your startup as volume knobs on a radio.  You remember radios, right? :) There is a range of volume settings that's reasonable and useful for your radio.  Too soft and you can't hear it.  Too loud and it hurts your ears and annoys your neighbors. Play a mental game where you adjust the volume knob on the time span for your business. Turn it down to zero (immediate success).  Too soon.  You would have had it already. One second.  Also probably too soon.  You'd have to rush too much. Infinity.  Too long.  You don't want to have to wait forever for your benefits. Imagine turning the time knob up and down.  How does the business feel at various settings? How will your strategies and tactics have to change at different settings? Find the time span setting that feels right to you and maximizes your chances of success. I've found this mental game very useful for facilitating debates at startups. Rather than asking "Should we do X or not?" you could ask "Where is the knob for X set now?  Should we turn it up or down?" Once you get good at that, change the metaphor from turning a single volume knob to turning multiple knobs to create multi-dimensional spaces. Better save that one for another post! Hope this helps, Adam
