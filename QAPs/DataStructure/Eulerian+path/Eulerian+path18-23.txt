What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
When I was in 11th I discovered a small part of Liljevalch’s theorem. It goes like this if a prime p divides 10k - 1 for some k, then p divides 10a + b if and only if p divides a + kb.  And if p divides 10k +  1 for some k, then p divides 10a + b if and only if p divides a - kb. For example, 7 divides 21. So to test if a number is divisible by 7 or not we will just multiply the last digit with 2 and subtract from the rest. For example, 1001. Multiply 1 with 2 and subtract it from 100. 98. To check if 98 is divisible by 7 apply the same thing recursively. Like multiply 8 with 2 and subtract it from 9 to get -7 which is divisible by 7. Since my childhood I always joyed that I could remember many divisibility tests while my friends remembered none. One day in 11th standard an exceedingly genius classmate of mine  told me divisibility test of 7. I was amazed, for it was just so wonderful. And 7 was the only number remaining in my set of 10. That night I gave it some thought and surprisingly I found divisibility test of 17. Replace 2 by 5, and follow the exact same steps as you did in that of 7. Really, that was great. Thought maybe there is some kind of pattern, and there was like for 27 it is 8, for 37 it is 11 and so on. Then I wondered if it's just their for series ending in 7 or other also. For series ending with 3 there is For 3, it is 1, for 13 it is 4, for 23 it is 7 and so on. But in this case you have to add  to the rest. Similarly For 9 it is 1, for 19 it is 2, for 29 it is 3 and so on For 1 it is 0, for 11 it is 1, for 21 it is 2  and so on. In this case subtract as you did in 7 Like this I constructed a huge table for each number and and the multiplying factor. I showed it to my coaching teacher, he too was amazed, and asked if I could generalize it and patent it. But the next night my brother told me about this theorem and all my dream were shattered.
