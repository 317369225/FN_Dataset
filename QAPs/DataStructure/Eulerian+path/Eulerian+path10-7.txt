What surprised you the most in your field of study?
As answered elsewhere, surprises are quite often in Physics. So here are few surprises I have encountered in just 3 years of physics- Photoelectric effect- everyone knows it so no need of explanation. Special Relativity- Even after all the stages from suspicion to devotion i get a 'high' thinking about invariance of c and the pseudo-paradoxes that follow. Quantum Mechanics- Well think about Young's double slit experiment but sending one photon at a time or about the EPR paradox and you will feel it too. Recently i got to know that if you measure number of photons in vacuum it is never zero which i like to say is the proof that ghosts are real :D General Relativity- Apart from the thrill one gets while wrapping his head around the fact that gravity is just a coordinate transformation, the most surprising thing is Einstein' equivalence principle- which has a justification but no derivation and no experimental failure (so surprised by Einstein'sÂ  'heavy' intuition). Black holes- Everything about them is surprising from Swartzchild solution to Hawking radiation, i got so excited after 'watching' observers fall into a BH that i didn't sleep fro 2 days (literally). Gravitons- the photon for gravitational waves. the derivation of its speed being equal to that of photon is just awesome. (see for LISA LIGO on youtube). Multiverse interpretation of Quantum mechanics- As if the visible universe was not big enough there is a theory (it is not just fiction) for infinite universe with different laws of physics than us.There is so much more but as you may have noticed i am not good with words. Sometimes i get surprised just by noticing my luck on choosing Physics :)
