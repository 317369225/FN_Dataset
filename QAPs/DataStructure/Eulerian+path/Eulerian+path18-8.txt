What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Fun question! I made up polar coordinates and Knuth's arrow operators some years before I learned about them, and was amazed to discover that sinx/cosx=tanxÂ  . While doodling, I came across iterated systems (e.g. fractals), which can easily amaze a young mind. Yet, what first came to mind was when I tried to create a new numerical minimization method for functions of several variables, as I didn't like conjugate gradients or non-deterministic methods, for some reason. I started by approximating the function as a parabolic one, and determined the location of the minimum expressed by derivatives of the function. The end result was very elegant, and I was very proud of creating the method, until I realized I had just rediscovered Newton's method. I had of course learned about the method earlier, but probably through a boring derivation forgotten long before this. Be careful not to reinvent the wheel. You might learn something.
