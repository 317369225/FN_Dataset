What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Dilworth's Theorem [1] That the minimum number of upsequences into which a given ordered list of data can be partitioned is equal to the length of the maximum downsequence in that list (of complementary strictness.) (Ditto ... min number of downsequences.... maximum upsequence....) I came up with that one evening in about 1992 one evening while helping a friend answer some questions that had been set by her potential supervisor for a doctorate she was applying to do. The difference between us, and why she's a much better mathematician than me, is that while I could come up with the answer, she could prove it :-) [1] Thanks to Mark Gordon for providing the name, in the comments.
