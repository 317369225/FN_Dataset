Are there good websites where you can find short and efficient implementation for algorithms and data structures in C++?We all know how understanding algorithms and data structures in theory is simple, but when it comes to implementing them it might be a little difficult. Is there a place where I can find efficient and short code with built in libraries and short-cuts used for algorithms and DS implementation?
Here is an excellent resource: Stanford University ACM Team Notebook (2013-14). There you can find implementations of some very basic and some not-so-basic algorithms: combinatorial optimization (matching, flow, cuts), geometry (convex hull, triangulations), graph (Dijkstra, Eulerian path), numerical (FFT, Simplex, solving linear systems) and others (various DP solutions, KMP).There are also some data structures like KD-trees, suffix trees, union-find structure, segment trees etc. Updated 23 Jun â€¢ View Upvotes
