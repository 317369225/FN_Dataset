How can I find a complete mathematics curriculum for private school if I want to open a math school for school-aged children?
You could do a lot worse than simply using Art of Problem Solving's books.  Their Beast Academy materials for grades 2-5 are only half done at this point, but their materials for grades 6-12 are complete and the quality is superb. You could also look at what's in the Common Core Mathematics Standards and build off of that, although that's likely to be boring.  It's the most likely to be an acceptable choice though if you're looking to create a school for ordinary kids, many of whom won't be particularly good at math. Or you could see what Proof School is doing and riff off of that.  They haven't quite started up yet, but if awesome people can create a successful math school for math kids then they're going to be successful.
