When should we use BFS instead of DFS, and vice versa?Can you give some examples?
Others told you where you should use DFS and BFS, I'm going to tell you where you should not: As you know, DFS is a recursive algorithm, you can write it using a stack, but it does not change its recursive nature, so DO NOT USE it on infinitely deep graphs. DFS is not a complete algorithm for infinitely deep graphs (it does not guarantee to reach the goal if there is any). Even if your graph is very deep but you have the prior knowledge that your goal is a shallow one, using DFS is not a very good idea. Also BFS needs to keep all the current nodes in the memory, so DO NOT USE it on the graphs with high branching factor, or your computer will run out of memory very quick. If your facing an infinitely deep graph with a high branching factor, you can use Iterative Deepening algorithm.
