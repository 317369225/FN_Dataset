Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
Obviously, the existence of electrons is just a model to explain how atoms actually are, and presence of electrons outside the nucleus was determined by physical experiments, because, upon experimenting, no trace of negative charge was found in nucleus, hence, it was concluded that electrons exist outside the nucleus. Moreover, the convention of assuming electrons to have negative charge and protons having positive charge is strictly historical in nature, as the best way to state is that protons and electrons have opposite charges. If, from existence, you mean that electrons look like tiny balls as drawn usually in books, its not the case. As a quantum particle, it exhibits dual nature, hence, no one can say what it actually looks like. The uncertainty principle forbids us from doing that. Just like most of the concepts, theories, models of physics, the presence of electron was also formulated mathematically first. Then many models were predicted, eg. the plum pudding model. Then by continuous experimentation, as its already explained in the previous answer, those mathematically formulations and predictions appeared to fall in place practically. hence, there is a "thing" like electron, which when equated with another available particle (proton), balances an equation involving charge. Electrons do exist as its a particle and not a quasiparticle like holes in semiconductors, which is a purely a mathematical concept.
