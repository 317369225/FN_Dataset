Are there good websites where you can find short and efficient implementation for algorithms and data structures in C++?We all know how understanding algorithms and data structures in theory is simple, but when it comes to implementing them it might be a little difficult. Is there a place where I can find efficient and short code with built in libraries and short-cuts used for algorithms and DS implementation?
There is two great resources that I can think of. First, GeeksForGeeks -http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ It's a great resource for almost EVERYTHING code related. Interview programs? They got you covered. Marathon problems? Absolutely. Complicated data structures and algorithms explained? Sure thing! And the best of all, all in C or C++. Other choice is rosetta code.Â  - http://www.rosettacode.com Actually, thus website works as a big "dictionary" of implementations in a bunch of languages. Some codes can get pretty complicated or over-optimized, but it's a valuable source when learning a new language.
