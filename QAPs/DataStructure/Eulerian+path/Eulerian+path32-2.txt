Bioinformatics: What should I do to become a bioinformatist?
While most of the answers here are very valuable and true, but I am going to add another perspective, bioinformatics has expanded to a more advanced computational work than simple algorithms and evolved beyond just statistics/simple machine learning, while still many people view it that way. If you want to become a very strong bioinformatician with unique abilities that is not yet very common, having strong algorithmic background goes a very long way. Many real challenging and open questions in bioinformatics require deep understanding of algorithms and probabilistic analysis beyond common statistical methods. Take a look at the Coursera's popular Bioinformatics Specialization Page on coursera.org. It's a great well rounded free course that works on many aspects of bioinformatics and is instructed by one of the leaders of the field. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that you can approach it from many different angles, but nowadays good bioinformatician have a decent knowledge of both computational and molecular biology components, working on either or both will be very helpful. From programming point of view, scripting languages such as python, perl and R (many people don't consider R scripting language) are very common in bioinformatics and they're a good place to start if you are new to programming. But if you migrated to actually developing Bioinformatics tools that robustness and speed is an important issue then starting C/C++ (and sometimes Java) is very beneficial.
