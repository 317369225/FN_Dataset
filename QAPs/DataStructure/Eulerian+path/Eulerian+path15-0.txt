How do you solve the square puzzle?As you can see, you can draw a line from A to B, also a circle, so many figures like for the rectangle starting from point A in one stroke without cut (lift the pen) or repeat the line twice, well the square with a cross, I challenged everyone to do it but yet failed... I really like to know if it can be solved
The problem cannot be solved. What you are describing is called an Eulerian path. You can work out whether such a path exists by looking at the vertices of your figure, which are the points where more than one line touch, or at the ends of lines. I've highlighted the vertices on your image below: (I'm ignoring the circle for now, because it's more confusing than helpful. If you want me to explain it let me know and I will) For an Eulerian path to exist, either every vertex (singular of vertices) must have an even number of lines coming out of it, or else exactly two vertices must have an odd number of lines. To see why this is the case, notice that, for your path to exist, every time you go into a vertex, you must leave it again. If there are an odd number of paths into the vertex, then eventually you are going to go in, but have no paths left to get out. The reason you can have two odd vertices is because you have to start and stop somewhere. Either you start and stop at the same place - then all vertices must have an even number of paths, or they start and end at different places - then there are exactly two vertices with an odd number of paths. The line in picture has 0 even vertices and 2 odd vertices. This follows the rule, so there is a path. The rectangle has 0 even vertices and 2 odd vertices, so there is a path. The square has 1 even vertex and 4 odd vertices, so there is no path. For an interesting similar problem, and a discussion of how Euler originally worked this out, see the article Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg.
