What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
Strictly speaking , I did not discover any, but i do get close to discover it. 1. when I was in 10th grade, I noticed that [0,1] has a obivious one to one mapping to [0,2] by multiply 2, but the latter has "more element "in the common sense. I deemed it as a mystery featrue about "infinitily many" . if I could think deeper(has more insight view) I may invent some part of "cantor set theory" 2. when I was in my first year in college, I consider the problem "whether exists?"  after some trying, I clearly realized that to solve this problem one must estimate "the speed of using rational number to approximate pi" . Then in my junior year, some one told me  that Mahler 1953's work about "pi is not a Liouville number" solve this problem) Liouville number:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lio.... then one can prove it tends to 1 as expected
