What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
I found (not independently) that the coefficients of binomial expansion could be found using pascal's triangle.            1       1        1 1         2        1 ect. I then sought out a simple way to achieve trinomial expansion. I then developed what I called "Pascal's pyramid" Here's the first few layers:         1 ____________         1 1              1 ____________         1     2      2 1      2     1 ____________            1        3      3     3     6     3 1    3       3      1 The pattern is pretty easy after a while, and you can use it for trinomial expansion. I thought I was pretty big stuff until I did a quick search online and someone talking about Pascal's triangle said you could "simply" use the same methodology to create a pyramid to get the coefficients of trinomial expansion. Yum... humble pie.
