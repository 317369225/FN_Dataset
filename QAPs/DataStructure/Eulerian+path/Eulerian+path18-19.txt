What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
A couple of years ago I learned of the generalization of Collatz Conjecture. It's not very difficult, but it takes that "twist of the mind" to realize what Collatz Conjecture really is. Turns out it's been discovered already of course, and that - sadly - discouraged me somewhat. Wouldn't it be nice if we could all be happy just about discovering? That it has to be a novel discovery says something about us (or me in this instance), doesn't it? Here's how I generalized it. Multiplying by 3 is just putting in another factor in the number. +1 is equal to removing all those factors. Thus we know that 3 is not a factor in the new number. So one operation removes all factors of 3 (and other factors of course). What does the other operator do? It removes all 2-factors. That's the usual interpretation. Let's add that slight twist I mentioned. We're not "only" removing all factors of 2. We're removing all prime factors less than 3. And voila; we can do 5*n + 1 when n has no factors of 2 or 3, and if n does, remove all those factors. Or we can have 7n+1 when n contains no factors of 2, 3 or 5, and so on. Most of the generalized algorithms seem to be cyclic for pretty low inputs, not cycling back to 1 that is. Which is why it's even more strange that the original conjecture seems to be true; why is it so special? The original conjecture has one obvious feature that none other has. The factor you multiply with is bigger than the product of the factors you divide with. 3>2. 5<3*2 though, and so on for all primes greater than 3. Anyway, that's a mystery which doesn't really belong here. I was thrilled to find out about it on my own though!
