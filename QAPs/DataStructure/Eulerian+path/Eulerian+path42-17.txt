Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
Are you "sure", the computer, in your front, "exists"? Are you sure, your hands "exist"? Your legs? Everything you can think of is a model of reality. They are "real" in so far as they are successful in making intelligible connections to your various experiences. Updated 14 Apr 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
