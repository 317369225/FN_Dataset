How do I become a successful entrepreneur in a short span of time?
There are no shortcuts to Success. Success requires hard work and persistence (along with other things like timing, access to capital/talent, etc.).Â  There are many excellent existing answers on this topic on Quora for example - What does it take to be a successful entrepreneur? Startups: How can I start a new business? and many good books, articles about traits of successful entrepreneurs. None of those can give you shortcut with guaranteed success. The road to success is going to be long and sometimes painful, so buckle up and enjoy the journey. Good luck.
