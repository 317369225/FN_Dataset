What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
I was around 14 and was always very quick to give approximate square root of any number. Didn't know how, but I guess the calculation kept running somewhere back in my mind. So after getting very excited about the calculations, one night..I sat down and tried to find out how it works and wrote down square root of first 3000 natural numbers and deducted this : Sq Rt of any number N = a + (N-a^2)/(b^2- a^2) Where a^2 and b^2 are nearest perfect squares lesser and greater than N respectively. and to check it accuracy, I went on and on to 9000 just to find out that the formula works fine with error of +/-0.02; for N > 8. But when I grew up .. BANG !! .. I found out that the work has already been done by the great Sir Issac Newton and much more than that (out of my understanding limits) too. Newton's Method for finding square roots Square Roots by Newton's Method Also understood that it (my work) wasnt a big deal and a simple Linear equation and slope relation.
