What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
As an amateur mathematician I loved doing my own experimentation and discovered many things before being introduced to them in formal education. I've listed the ones I can recall here. My apologies for the lack of formatting, I don't know how to use LaTeX. Euclid's algorithm I discovered this algorithm in high school. I simply remembered wondering if there was an efficient way to calculate greatest common factors, and took a stab at it. I am sad that I did not think to write down exactly how I came to discover the algorithm, but it had something to do with converting fractions to proper form and dropping the integer part. It is likely I discovered it the same way Euclid did in 300BC. A limit to infinity In my freshman year of high school, I tried (unsuccessfully) to calculate the value of pi by solving the ratio of the perimeter of an n-sided polygon by the average distance of the line drawn through the polygon, so that I could substitute infinity for n. Naturally, I got infinity on both the numerator and denominator and did not know where to proceed from there. I later learned that I had touched upon the concept of a limit, even though I did not know how to properly apply it. Augustin-Louis Cauchy formalized the definition of a limit in 1821. The sinusoid nature of complex numbers In my sophomore year of high school, learning about complex numbers for the first time, I found it remarkable that i^0 = 1 i^1 = i i^2 = -1 i^3 = -i because I remembered sines and cosines also alternated signs and axes in such a pattern. I extrapolated from this pattern, using trial and error, and came up with the following formula: i^x = cos(x*pi/2) + isin(x*pi/2) If you recall Euler's formula, e^(x*i) = cos(x) + isin(x). The formula holds if you substitute x*pi/2 for x [e^(x*pi/2*i)] = [cos(x*pi/2) + isin(x*pi/2)] = [i^x] This is the relationship between the formula Euler discovered, and the one I discovered independently. I seem to recall there's a way to convert between the e^ix form and the i^x form, but I was unable to figure that out myself. Leonard Euler published his identity in 1748, and the complex number plane was published by Jean-Robert Argand in 1806. Using differences to Find polynomials that satisfy patterns Do you know those SAT questions that ask you to find a mathematical equation to match a pattern? One may give you a pattern like 5, 6, 9, 14... and you would either have to find the next number (21) or the equation (n^2+5). Well, in my junior year of high school I discovered an algorithm for generating a polynomial equation for ANY pattern of numbers. First: take the differences of the pattern until you get to a point where numbers repeat (sometimes the final row only has 1 number, and that's ok.) 5 6 9 14   1 3 5     2 2 add the summation of the equation for the bottom row and add it to the first number of the next row up. 1+[ sum(2) ] = 1+[ 2n ]    (notice 1+2(0) = 1, 1+2(1) = 3, 1+2(2) = 5) as in the middle row.   then, for each row you want to go further up, take the equation for the current row, substitute n-1 for n, take the summation, and add the first number of the row above it. 5+[ sum(1+2(n-1)) ] = 5+[ sum(1-2n) ] = 5+n-[ 2(n^2+n)/2 ] = n^2+5 This algorithm can find polynomials for n^2 patterns very quickly because the triangle only has 3 rows. Finding polynomials for patterns n^3 or higher takes increasingly longer, and requires knowing the summation formulas, but it can be done.  I eventually learned that Charles Babbage's difference engine and Gabriel Cramer's rule for solving for a matrix could accomplish the same result, even if they did not do it the same way. Babbage proposed his difference engine in 1822, and Cramer published his system of solving linear equations in 1750. Boolean Equations with a max of 3 literals per variable are NP-complete I became extremely interested in NP-complete problems after college, and the Boolean satisfiability problem especially. I spent a lot of time trying to find simplified sub-problems of SAT that were also NP-complete. I've discovered many of them, but this is the only one that I've found in the topic of a research paper. It is quite likely all my other discoveries in this area have also been discovered independently, but I've just been unable to get access to free research papers online to confirm. Additionally, a quick web search has not brought up the paper I speak of so anyone who can find it and attribute the author has my upvote and my respect.
