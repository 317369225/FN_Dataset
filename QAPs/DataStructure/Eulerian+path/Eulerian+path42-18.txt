Philosophy of Science: Do electrons exist or are they just models to explain physical phenomena?I am well aware that there is a lot of evidence in favor of the electron model. But still can we surely say that it exists? I am confused about my notions of reality. Please help. Make your answer general (not just pertaining to electrons).
No scientific theory can be absolutely established.  However the experimental results with electrons are sufficiently good that we have no hesitation in using the theory. A scientific theory can never be proven absolutely true.  It can only be proven false for sure.
