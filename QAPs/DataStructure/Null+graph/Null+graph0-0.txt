What are the most amusing figures or images from academic journals and articles?
Figure 1 from Effect of different types of textiles on sexual activity. Experimental Study [Eur Urol. 1993], a study which involved putting small pants, made from various materials, on rats, to work out how the different materials change their sexual behaviour. I was shown this image during a talk by scicurious.
