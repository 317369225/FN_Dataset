I am a fresher pursuing my B.Tech final year, and I have an interview with Amazon tomorrow in my college. It's my first experience with any interview. What should I do?
you should have mentioned the profile you are targeting. Be sure to be asked about logical problems and algorithms. & be clear with simple concepts [like abstract class and interface as mentioned above]. All the luck mate.
