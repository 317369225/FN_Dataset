How did you secure an internship with Google Mountain View being from India?
I didn't intern at Google MTV, but I know a bit about securing an internship there. Its a fairly standard process (works the same way for Facebook): First upload your resume here: Google Jobs Submission Page. If you're good (a combination of good grades and projects should do), you'll be contacted by a recruiter. She may schedule a non-technical interview first. You'll have to go through at least 2 rounds of technical phone interviews. For these, you should brush up your algorithms and data structures. If your major is Computer Science, revise your Operating Systems and Computer Networks notes. Solve lots of puzzles on TopCoder; the interviewer will definitely ask you to write code. Do well in the 2 interviews to get an offer. Getting a VISA should be a breeze.Good luck!
