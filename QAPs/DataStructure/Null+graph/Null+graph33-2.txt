What was your first ever poem?
Thanks for the A2A.  :)  Thanks a lot, for it helped me realise how far I have come and that I can't really look back now, no matter how many hurdles I face  . This poem was written when I was in class 3. It was a day when I was sitting all bored at home during summer break, having nothing to do. So,  after having enjoyed an awesome piggy back ride with dad,  my eyes fell upon his gleaming new diary he had received from BRPL.  And I just wanted to write something spectacular ..and this is what I used to consider my " masterpiece" back then. "There was a beautiful fairy, About whom I wrote a diary, She was very beautiful,  And very joyful, She was very nice, She came to me twice. Her face was very fair, And her dress was so rare, I wish I  could also be a fairy, And others could write about me a diary! ​ ​
