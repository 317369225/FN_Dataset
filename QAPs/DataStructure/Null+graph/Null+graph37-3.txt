Who is your favorite Fields Medal winner?
Looking at the list of Fields Medalists on Wikipedia, lots of these people are responsible for results I use on a daily basis.  Without mathematicians like Kodaira, Serre, and Grothendieck, my chosen field of study wouldn't even exist.  So I don't see any way I can pick just one.
