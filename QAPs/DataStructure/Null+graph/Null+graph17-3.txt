Does the Cannae Drive disprove the law of conservation of momentum?
You know, if I was king of the world, I would ban anyone with a Journalism degree from writing anything about medicine or science, things they know not of.  They would have a year to find alternate employment, then it would be off with their heads, for anyone still writing pure nonsense.  If you were a captive PR person writing the original news release, they would get a week to change jobs, then it would be up in front of a firing squad. From a scientific or common-sense perspective, there is nothing to this story.   Quantitatively, 88 micro-newtons could be from a breeze, miscalibrations, a grain dislocation in the torsion strip, a heavy truck parked nearby, ionization, temperature gradients, corona, op-amp drift, and probably more reasons we are not cognizant of.  And even if they improved its performance by a factor of 100, it's still far too feeble an effect to actually use to move anything at a walking pace, much less at warp speeds. Form a common-sense perspective, how likely is it that someone would come up with an earth-shaking scientific discovery, run the experiment only once, then not again in the next three years?    There would be riches, women, and a Nobel Prize if they just re-ran it and showed that the results are repeatable and due to the reason they said.  But nothing happened.    What does that suggest?
