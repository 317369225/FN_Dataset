What programming language do people hate the most, and why?
The worst language I ever had to write code in was JOVIAL, which was a variation of Algol. I had an internship at a company that did United States Department of Defense (DoD) work, and was working on some code related to missile systems. The code was written in JOVIAL, which I had never even heard of before. The version they ran on limited variable names to 6 characters, and any characters past a certain column was automatically considered to be comments. So the variables were all unintelligible acronyms that were impossible to understand if you didn't already know how the system worked. Lemme put it this way: a few people on this topic were complaining about ADA. ADA was the language that the company was planning to upgrade to from JOVIAL. But when you have to write code to DoD spec, you're often stuck with dealing with old languages like that. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOVIAL Updated 127w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
