What was your first ever poem?
I was in 9th standard when I wrote my first poem. There was this awesome geography teacher, Mr. Rahman, who explained anything with such great enthusiasm that we enjoyed his lecture and actually paid attention (and not just pretend to) than any other lecture. I remember his words when he was teaching wild life. See, How nice is the wild life! These words gave me a push and then I wrote something like this that I hoped to be my first poem. â€‹ The Text: How nice is the wild life! It looks very beautiful, And interestingly very useful. It maintains the ecological balance, Which can't be seen at a glance. It magnifies the beauty of environment, Which provides us the enjoyment. But it is now disappearing, Because humans are interfering. Pollution is the knife, Which cuts the wild life. So, we must apply our useful sense, To protect and save their existence. So that they could live in this world, To maintain balance and to protect life. How nice is the wild life!!
