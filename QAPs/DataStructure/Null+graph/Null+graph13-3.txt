Which Relational/NoSQL approach is best suited for storing trees, with real-time aggregation from child nodes to parent nodes?
I'm not sure as to level of scale this will go to, but I've used sql trees quite effectively before. I never got to 100K node trees, but I did see this go to the thousand+ nodes quite well. Its easy on the read, but heavy on the creation/updating of nodes into the tree. I picked the technique from Joe Celko's "Sql for Smarties" book.
