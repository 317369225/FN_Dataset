How does Flipkart's interview process compare with that of Amazon's?
I was interviewed with Amazon as well as Flipkart for SDE 1 profile. Amazon interview was not so pleasant for me. After the online coding round, I was invited for onsite interviews. There were around 10-15 people who had their interviews on the same day. And the whole day was spent with 80% of the time being spent just waiting. I was out in the third round which was taken by a SDE 1 who did not seem to be a seasoned interviewer. In one of the my solutions, I made a mistake of not checking for a null pointer. I admitted this mistake but he kept on rejecting my solution saying these kind of mistakes won't be tolerated at Amazon. I found a bit of rudeness in his tone which made me really uncomfortable. Thereafter he just kept on smiling while I was solving for other questions. Overall this was a bad experience. Flipkart also has a similar process to that of Amazon. An online coding round was followed by a machine coding round, an algorithmic round and a hiring manager round (product and design). The interviewers were either SDE 2 or SDE 3s and overall I had a good experience. I found that Flipkart interview questions were a bit tougher and some of them mapped to real world e-commerce problems. Most of the Flipkart interview questions were based on DP and graphs while Amazon interview questions were mostly based on Trees.
