What are textbooks to follow for GATE CSE Preparation?
GATE needs conceptual clarity to crack. But it also needs systematic approach and dedicated preparation. Absolutely agree with Shreyash Srivastava Remember it not the textbook which is going to be game changer it is upon YOU how you understand key concepts and apply it!! Everyday take out 2-3 hours of preparation is good enough to go!! Pick few subjects in your stream. Try to master them.  Core subjects are heavily focused in GATE. Revise if any of important concepts you left out during your engineering. Form a study group discuss with your friends and get into interactive study more. Go through previous year question papers. Learn through experience of those people who have already cracked it ! Follow all the tips. Use online tools like Doubt Point On doubtpoint you can post doubts, ask experts form a study group and so on...Like Quora spend your time on doubtpoint. Hope this helps. All the Best !
