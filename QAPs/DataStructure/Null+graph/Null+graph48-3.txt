What are some Occult or Magick practices that have a rational explanation for why they may be effective?
Apparently lot of occult is about Intent, which makes rational sense. The intent they have for something is really strong inside of them, and they visualize it and project it out into the world. And after that, "what the bleep do we know" movie says quantum mechanics happens. That seems to be a rational explanation. Edit: Inserted later. Apparently scientists presented in what the bleep movie came out later rejecting association with the psychic shown in the movie. However, I do think there is some kind of connection - quantum mechanic connection - for consciousness and physical universe in some sense. So I wouldn't be surprised.
