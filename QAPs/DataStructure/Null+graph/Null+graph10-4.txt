I don't care for Java. If you like Java, why do you like it?
Because Java runs a nice piece of the enterprise world and it earns me a comfortable living.  As in "well into six figures" comfortable.  Marry that with Datapower skills and I'm never going to be unemployed. Java is dominant in the data center running enterprises.  The frameworks and the language's maturity allow it to run on everything, at any price point, with performance levels from hobbyist app or web site all the way up to running finance, insurance or health.  Other solutions coming up might be trendier but Java is approaching 20 years of evolution and improvement.  And is still going strong.  Languages don't achieve staying power like that if they were bad at what they did. Java is best for distributed transactional work, large scale web applications, data handling, network programming and in middleware.  It also runs half of the mobile world in the form of Android.  So it can't be all that bad!
