In the words of Churchill: Many forms of Gov­ern­ment have been tried, and will be tried in this  world of sin and woe. No one pre­tends that democ­racy is per­fect or  all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democ­racy is the worst form of Gov­ern­ment except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.… Java is similar. It is probably the worst language, except for all those other languages that have been tried from time to time....
