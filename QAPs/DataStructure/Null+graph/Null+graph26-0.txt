How can I make a visualization of a startup's refer-a-friend program?
How minimal do you need the coding to be? Here's a quick hack for you: Create a script that loops over every row in the database with a referer id, printing the user id and referer id separated by two hyphens ("SELECT id, referrer_id FROM users WHERE referrer_id IS NOT NULL"). Put this in a text file and add "graph referrers {" to the top and "}" to the bottom. You should have a file that looks like this: graph referrers {   a -- b   b -- c   e -- b   ... etc. } Open this in Graphviz (http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/) and voila, you have a basic network visualization like this: If your file is so large that it crashes Graphviz, or you want to do something a bit prettier, try Gephi (https://gephi.org). It'll open the file you just made and let you create visualisations that look more like this: Here's their step by step tutorial to get you going, it's pretty straightforward http://gephi.org/users/quick-start/
