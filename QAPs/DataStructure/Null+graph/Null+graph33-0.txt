What was your first ever poem?
I had to rummage through some very old newspapers to find what I was looking for. Here is my very first published poem, written when I was in KG-II (That implies I must have been four years old :D ) Text : I have a sweet Mum Her name is Karabi She helps me She loves me She beats me When I am bad But Mum, You are my dearest Mum I wrote my first rhyming poem when I was in Class 2, that must have meant that I was 6 or 7 years old. Text : I have a little brother, His name is Deek. He is very cute, And also very sweet. He is three years old, He is like gold, And he is very bold. When I am free, He plays with me. He does not like milk, But likes to play with ink. An active boy like him, You have never seen. Thanks for asking, Ipshita, this was one funny answer! :D EDIT : Those were the very first ones.
