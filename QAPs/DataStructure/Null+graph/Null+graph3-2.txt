Software Engineering:Â What are good ways to avoid bugs while programming?
Take frequent breaks. A lot of these answers focus on methods for coding better, but you won't be able to use any of them if you can't focus properly. Casinos are amongst the best organizations when it comes to maximizing ROI. Most casinos mandate a "40-20" rule for dealers i.e. for every 40 minutes you work, take 20 minutes off. Even the slightest error by a dealer can derail an entire game and have huge costs. By requiring frequent breaks, dealers reduce stress buildup and are able to have greater focus, thereby minimizing the chance of error. Programming is no different. Even minor errors in code can cause huge problems down the road. By being rested and physically alert, you significantly reduce the odds of this happening.
