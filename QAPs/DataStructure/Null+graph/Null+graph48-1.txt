What are some Occult or Magick practices that have a rational explanation for why they may be effective?
Meditation - technically it doesn't have a rational explanation as to how it works, but it has been empirically proven to be effective. Visualation - for the simple fact that most inventions were thought of before they were actually invented. Tarot/divination - this is more of a stretch than the above, but simply put, someone who doesn't believe that the positions of the stars and planets have control over our daily lives cannot believe in spring, summer, autumn and winter. How far this idea will stretch in terms of planets millions of miles away is of course a big question to us all; I guess here is where faith steps in.
