Climate Change and Global Warming in 2014-15: What do people think about former NASA climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer's assertion that 95% of global warming climate models are exaggerated?
Here is a pretty solid blog post debunking that chart and that claim specifically: Roy Spencer's latest deceit and deception In general, I think what most climate scientists think, which is that his work has consistently been full of errors and misrepresentations.  So much so that he can't get published in any respectable journal and the last time he was published, the publisher subsequently apologized and resigned for publishing an error- and deceit-filled pile of garbage. He has gone so far as to allege conspiracies that span all respected scientific journals on climate and of course reach into the IPCC.  Being wrong about science can feel like a conspiracy.  Everyone somehow agrees to ignore you and all your work.  It's because they know what they're talking about and you do not.
