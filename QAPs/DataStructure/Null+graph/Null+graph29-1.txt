A study wants to examine the relationship between student anxiety for an exam and the number of hours studied. The data is as follows Student Anxiety Scores: 5, 10, 5, 11, 12, 4, 3, 2, 6, 1 Study Hours : 1, 6, 2, 8, 5, 1 ,4, 6, 5, 2Â  Why is a correlation the most appropriate statistic? 2.What is the null and alternate hypothesis? 3.What is the correlation between student anxiety scores and number of study hours?
To answer your questions, 1)Correlation is used to show the relationship between two quantities. Mathematically, the values lies between -1 to 1, 1 being strong positive correlation, -1 being strong negative correlation, and 0 being that the two quantities are not related. This parameter is used because it tells us, within the given sample of data, how one quantity varies with another. That being said, correlation shows how one quantity varies with another and not whether one quantity is caused because of another. In many cases, the cause might be something else completely, or a high correlation coefficient may be just an accident resulting from the given data. This graph has appeared time and again (part of a paper published in New England Journal of Medicine), to show that correlation does NOT imply causation. Or even if it does, it isn't easy always clear how are even why the two are related. (The paper claimed that the two are, in fact, linked.) 2)The null and alternate hypothesis are up to you, you can choose as you wish. There is never a fixed way to choose which is the alternate and which is the null hypothesis. In any case, I would choose null hypothesis to be: There is no correlation, and alternate to be there is a correlation in the 2 sets of data. 3)Correlation can be calculated using its formula. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cor... Correlation comes out to be 0.5653 .
