What are some Occult or Magick practices that have a rational explanation for why they may be effective?
Interestingly enough, Aleister Crowley's A.:.A.:. published a magazine called the Equinox, whose catchphrase was "The method of science - the aim of religion". On a similar note, Chaos Magick has always claimed to be based on rational explanations. For example, they believe that spiritual entities are actually embodiments of Jungian archetypes. In one of Peter J. Carroll's book, he even tried to marry his occult teachings with (kooky) quantum mechanics and even probabilistic calculations. I recall a few hilarious graphs. I think it was in Liber Null, but i could be corrected on that one.
