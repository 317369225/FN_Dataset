Data Structures:Â How could I visualize data structures in c++?
You question is kind of vague, I might be able to help more if you can explain what you want. However, to visualize trees you can use Graphviz application from Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software It supports a DOT language, you can read more about it here. Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software Once you create your tree you can write a small code snippet to convert your tree to DOT format and save it to a file. You just need to write it once and you can use it for all trees. Example: digraph g {	C2 -> B1;	A3 -> C2;	E2 -> F1;	D6 -> A3;	D6 -> E2;	I2 -> H1;	M3 -> L1;	M3 -> N1;	K6 -> I2;	K6 -> M3;	G13 -> D6;	G13 -> K6;	O15 -> G13;	O15 -> P1;} Above code will look like this when opened in Graphviz. A small code snippet to convert tree to dot format. private void printDOT(Node x) throws IOException {		if (x == null) {			return;		}		printDOT(x.left);		printDOT(x.right);		print(x);	}	private void print(Node x) throws IOException {		if (x.left != null) {			writer.write(x.key + "" + x.count + " -> " + x.left.key + ""					+ x.left.count + ";");		}		if (x.right != null) {			writer.write(x.key + "" + x.count + " -> " + x.right.key + ""					+ x.right.count + ";");		}}
