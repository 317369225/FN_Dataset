How can I make a visualization of a startup's refer-a-friend program?
Both Chloe and David's suggestions sound good, but I think a more important first step would be figuring out what questions you're trying to answer. Are you mainly interested in seeing how many customers as a percentage of total customers came through the referral program? Are you interested in knowing how the referral program grows or decreases in effectiveness over time? Do you have other info that would be useful such as dates, demographics, and how the referral was made? (over facebook, email, etc.). Having a better "big-picture" idea of what you're trying to understand will help speed up the process of knowing what type of visualizations you might want to create, and related to this, what type of tools would be best for the job. In terms of a specific visualization package that can connect to SQL databases without requiring coding, I use Tableau a lot at my workplace. You can easily sum up the number of customers who came in via referral vs those who didn't come in via referral by dragging and dropping different fields onto the x and y axis of a bar plot like David shows. The software is pretty pricey but you can do the two week trial if all you need is just some quick plots for now. If you have some basic javascript coding abd sqk skills you can visualize using google chart tools or another viz library like protovis. And of course as a fallback you can run queries in mysql, export the results of those queries, and then plot in excel.
