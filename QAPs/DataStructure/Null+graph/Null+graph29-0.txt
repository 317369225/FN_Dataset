A study wants to examine the relationship between student anxiety for an exam and the number of hours studied. The data is as follows Student Anxiety Scores: 5, 10, 5, 11, 12, 4, 3, 2, 6, 1 Study Hours : 1, 6, 2, 8, 5, 1 ,4, 6, 5, 2  Why is a correlation the most appropriate statistic? 2.What is the null and alternate hypothesis? 3.What is the correlation between student anxiety scores and number of study hours?
You have x and you have y, in this case, Your x as student anxiety scores and y as number of study hours. You're given 10 values for both variables x and y, how do you show that they are related? You use correlation to make sure that they're related, after calculating your correlation.  If you get zero, it means that they are not related. Any values nearer to 1 shows that it has a strong positive correlation (i.e. a positive gradient, exactly one means that its a perfect straight line up plotted in a x and y graph) Any values nearer to -1 shows that it has a strong negative correlation (i.e. a negative gradient, exactly negative one means that its a perfect straight line down plotted in a x and y graph) Using the data given, the correlation for this case would be 0.5653712181, after applying the formula, but do take note that correlation does not imply causation, the correlation between these two variables does not imply that one causes the other, it may just be a coincidence or an accident. The null hypothesis can be anything you want it to be, unless this is a question from an academic exercise which implicitly states that you need to attempt to prove this n hypothesis right or wrong, in which case you have to fulfill the requirement.
