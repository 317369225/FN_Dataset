What is the best way to store mind map data?
Orient Technologies - OrientDB Distributed Graph Database is an open source Graph Database that has interfaces to many programming languages and has an extended SQL syntax on it's console.  The advantage of the graph database over relational is not having to store NULL links for nodes where relationships do not apply also adding new ralationships does not require adding a new column to a table.  If you had enough relationships between objects you could theoretically exceed the maximum number of columns on a relational database and have to split node tables into multiple tables to contain all the links.
