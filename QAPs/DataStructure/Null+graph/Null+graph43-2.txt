Climate Change and Global Warming in 2014-15:Â What do people think about former NASA climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer's assertion that 95% of global warming climate models are exaggerated?
What do you think about the fact that two thousand of the world leading climate scientists agree that climate change is anthropogenic with over 95% certainty? (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Summary for Policymakers, page 17: Page on www.ipcc.ch). They also say: "The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend (very high confidence). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years" (ibid. page 15). What do you think about that?* It really doesn't matter what I think. But I do think that the influence of climate skeptics on public attitudes is extraordinary given the paltry scientific evidence they produce. *i.e. Why did Spencer pick deviations from the 1979-1983 average rather than another time span?
