What should I do in the next 6 months to get into a company like Amazon/Google?
I am a software engineer at Google, and I honestly believe that 6 months is more than sufficient time for anyone, even someone without a CS background to prepare for the Google interview.  Here are a few tips 1)Syllabus : Here is a checklist  of major topics to prepare for a prgramming interview, that I wrote several months ago. Interview study topics can be divided into i) Knowledge based questions ii) Algorithmic and Data Structure based questions iii) Design questions, which can be further divided into Object Oriented Design and System Design.

The former feels like your resume just fell into a blackhole. ii) Connect with as many people as you can on LinkedIn. When recruiters look for candidates, you are likely to show up on the top if you are closer to them. iii)Start by interviewing at companies with a lower bar and work your way up. 4) Miscellaneous interview tips i) In "elite" companies, missing corner cases or writing otherwise choppy code may be costly.  Think and form a concrete idea of your algorithm before you start writing.  After writing your code, test your code for an obvious test case and more importantly corner cases like an array of single element or a string of one character. Are you expected to write perfect code on your first attempt in tech interviews? ii) Don't brain freeze.  Start with a naive solution, and then try to improve your efficiency. Thinking of various data structures & algorithms, or similar questions yo u have solved before may help. (Can I decrease the time complexity if I use an array instead of a linked list? What if I use a hashtable here?) 4) Google and many other sought after companies  have a very high bar. If you donot make it, it does not necessarily mean you aren't good enough. Your target must be improving your coding skills and not just clearing the google interview. 5) Most importantly it is necessary to have a passion for coding. If not, never mind, consider other options than forcing yourself to code just for the google interview. Doing that would at best be lead to pyrrhic victory. To explore your interests, consider spending sometime on CourseEra, Open source projects like   programming games (this is different from developing games/game programming) is a good way to focus on Artificial Intelligence. If you are in the San Francisco Bay Area, don't miss  the Programming Interview Prep Meetup. The group meets every other Friday, and each meeting focuses on a specific topic.  Participants form groups based on their skill level, and solve questions as a group.  By participating in this meetup, you get to solve problems in a group setting (which is more effective and fun than lonely practice), and more importantly learn from other others.
