Climate Change and Global Warming in 2014-15: What do people think about former NASA climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer's assertion that 95% of global warming climate models are exaggerated?
I'm not sure what sort of answer you're looking for, but I'm going to be blunt.  I don't spend much time reading science blogs or newspaper articles about climate science.  If I do come across a reference to something interesting, I find the original scientific article and I read that. So the Spencer article and its cherrypicked data should have absolutely no effect whatever on public policy. Instead, we should convene a massive international and intergovernmental effort to review all the best scientific knowledge on climate change, then come up with a meticulously documented, carefully nuanced set of cautious recommendations for policy makers. Oh wait!  We already did that.  It's called the CA - PCC / IPCC / IPCE / Inter. It's really sad how our culture has lost so much of its trust in expert knowledge. There are good reasons for that -- a lot of awful broken promises by a long list of governments and experts -- but  in the end there is no substitute for deep knowledge.
