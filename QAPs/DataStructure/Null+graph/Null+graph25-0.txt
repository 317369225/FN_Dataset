Is there a way to rank your facebook friends according to the number of friends they have?
There are a number of ways for you to obtain this information.  The method I'll list below assumes that you want to find this information out on a "one-time" basis, as opposed to a further integration with an application.  You can use Facebook's Facebook Query Language (FQL) Reference to easily obtain this information.  Since you want to find the information about your friends there is no concern about permissions or privacy as you are already connected to these people.  Facebook has created a  Facebook Graph API Explorer that will let you run FQL queries and see the results.  Here is the query you can use to get the basic information about your freinds along with their friend count sorted by highest friend count first.  To run this query go to the Explorer page and select the FQL option and paste in the query below.  SELECT uid, username, name, first_name, last_name, friend_count FROM user WHERE uid in (select uid2 from friend where uid1 = me()) ORDER BY friend_count DESC Note that some friend counts may show up as null, this is because they have adjusted their privacy settings to not allow friends to see their total friend counts. If you are looking to integrate this information into an application then I encourage you to read the documentation about Facebook's Graph API and https://developers.facebook.com/...
