What are the most controversial issues in the field of statistics?
Depends on the branch of statistics but ... Is null hypothesis significance testing useful? (see e.g. The Cult of Statistical Significance: How the Standard Error Costs Us Jobs, Justice, and Lives (Economics, Cognition, and Society): Stephen T. Ziliak, Deirdre N. McCloskey: 9780472050079: Amazon.com: Books for the view from one extreme view, that it is useless, indeed, worse than useless; I tend to agree with Z and McC, but perhaps not quite as extreme) Are most published results wrong? (see Why Most Published Research Findings Are False, for a view that they are mostly wrong; I think he is missing some key points, but I haven't written up my views). Bayesian vs. frequentist vs. likelihood views of statistics seem to have calmed down a bit, but they can still raise some controversy (I tend to operate as a frequentist, althoughÂ  I think both the Bayesian and likelihood views have a lot of merit; the latter gets relatively little attention). The proper use of graphics can be controversial if you listen to some statisticians and some data visualization people. E.g. Tufte's views on "chart junk" are not universally agreed (I disagree with them, for one). The role of sponsors in research is controversial; but research that is paid for by a group with an "ax to grind" or a point of view already esatablished tends to grind that ax and support that POV (shocking, I know). You can often get a good argument going if you propose that one statistical package is better than all others. But most people recognize that each has strengths.
