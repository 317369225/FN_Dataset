How can one go about drawing the graph of [math]y = x \sin (\pi x)[/math]?
Ok. Here is your answer.  I have learnt all these tricks by the book Play with Graphs by Amit Agarwal.  Drawing any graph will be easy if you step by step. 1. First you draw a normal sin(x) graph. Like this: 2. Now you have to draw sin(pi*x) . As in any graph when the variable x is multiplied by a constant. The graph shrinks horizontally. This is when 'x' is multiplied. If we divide 'x' by some constant the graph widens horizontally. In case of  variable 'y' , the graph widens on multiplication and shrinks on division vertically. Just the opposite of what happens in x.  Now put: x=0 , sin(pi*x)=0 x=(1/2) , sin(pi/2)= 1 x=1, sin(pi)=0. So you can see here. The graph gets shrinked. Here it is: 3. Now here is the tricky part: x*sin(pi*x). To draw this graph , you need to be very clear with the concepts of limits. When x=0 , x*sin(pi*x)=0 (No problem here) As I told you before that in case of variable 'y',the graph widens and shrinks vertically on multiplication and division respectively.  So  3*sin(pi*x)  graph would be like: Now as 3 was constant. So it was easy to guess the nature of graph. But the given equation is:  x*sin(pi*x) As x-> zero , y -> zero too. x-> infinity , y -> infinity too. This shows that as we increase the value of x , value of y will also increase. As we are multiplying the y only by x. The graph will change only vertically . The horizontal curve structure will remain same.  So as the x varies , the graph will also vary and you can guess the nature of graph by putting some values . Here it is :
