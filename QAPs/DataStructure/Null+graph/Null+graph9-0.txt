Is it true that given any graph with N vertices is a induced subgraph of subset graph(N). How can you prove or disprove it?
No. Here is a counterexample. Consider a graph of 5 vertices which is the union of a triangle {a,b,c} and an edge {d,e}. We will prove that it is impossible to assign subsets of S={1,2,3,4,5} to the vertices of this graph such that two vertices are adjacent in the graph iff the subsets are disjoint. First, note that if an assignment exists, none of the vertices can be assigned to the null set - this would imply that the vertex is adjacent to all other vertices, but no vertex of degree 4 exists in the graph. Now, {a,b,c} is a triangle. If a valid assignment exists, the subsets corresponding to these vertices have to be pairwise disjoint. But the cardinality of S is 5. By pigeonhole principle, there should be at least one vertex on the triangle which is assigned to a subset with one element. Without any loss of generality, let vertex a be assigned the subset {1}. But there is no edge between vertices a-d and a-e. This means that the subsets corresponding to a and d (similarly a and e) should have some common element. Since the subset corresponding to a is {1}, this means that 1 should be an element of the subsets corresponding to both d and e. But this would imply that the subsets for d and e are not disjoint. Hence there can be no edge between d and e, a contradiction.
