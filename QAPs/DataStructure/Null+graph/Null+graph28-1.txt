How can one go about drawing the graph of [math]y = x \sin (\pi x)[/math]?
Thanks for A2A Graph is that thing which solves a lot of maths calculus and algebra problems, one must know how to proceed for making a graph. Well! I do it like: Check all the null points, i.e. where the function goes zero. In this case  x=n  where n belongs to the set of all integers. Then take its first derivative and find its zeroes if possible, or you can see increasing and decreasing of a graph by analyzing the value of derivative at that point. Most of the time we get functions which are the sum of different elementry functions, in those cases I mostly prefer to draw different graphs at the same place so that I can finally add them, and take out as much information as I can, but you can aslo do 1st and 2nd steps in that. But sometimes finding zeroes of that equations is not that easy. like y= e^x +x^2 +sin(x) I these kind of cases you should prefer drawing different graphs at same place. Lot of time you face the graphs as composition of different functions, in those cases, consider f(g(x)), you should make both f(x) and g(x) so that you can think about the domain, range and lot of things by just seeing the two drawn graphs. lot of the times you get weird functions, in those cases you should try different values like, x=n (integers) or x=n(pi)... etc. , these values give some idea about the nature of graph, One more thing, check the end point values and limits at which denominator goes zero, or at the infinity. ​ ​ ​
