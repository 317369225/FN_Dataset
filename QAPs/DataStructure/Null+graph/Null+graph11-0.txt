What are the Jacobian, Hessian, Wronskian, and Laplacian?
Hi, as it says in the comments there are pretty good entries in Wikipedia and in Simple English Wikipedia. Jacobian: Is the generalization of the notion of "derivative" for vector-valued functions (functions that take vector in and give another vector). Hessian: If you take a scalar function of multiple variables (a function that takes a vector in (the multiple variables) and gives a scalar) the "first derivative" is the gradient. The gradient is a vector-valued function, so its Jacobian represents the "second derivative" of the scalar function. This "second derivative" is the Hessian of the scalar function. The Wronskian is a matrix that is built from a set of functions. In each column you put the derivatives of each function up to the order equal to the number of functions in your set. The determinant of that matrix tells you whether your set of functions is linearly independent or not (null determinant). It is used in the solutions of ODEs, for the method of variations of parameters. The Laplacian: For this one we have to be careful. I assume you refer to the differential operator and not to the Laplacian matrix of a graph. The Laplacian is just the divergence (another differential operator) of the gradient of a function. Now, that is just the mathematical definition, depending on the field where the Laplacian appears it may have different interpretations. The one I like is the relation with the mean curvature of a surface (how much bent the surface is). The mean curvature is the divergence of the unit normal of a surface, if the normal is given by the gradient of a function (that means that your surface is a level curve, an equipotential, an isopotential, etc...) then the curvature is proportional to the Laplacian.
