What are some Occult or Magick practices that have a rational explanation for why they may be effective?
An understanding of how 'rational' or possible occult practices are got skewed and screwed by the nature of the Scientific Revolution and by armchair occultists who criticize and theorize without actually doing it. Thinking that you can talk your way through magic is mistake #1. There are countless times across history and the world recorded to greater or lesser degrees where someone could not do something that was considered to have to be possible in the occult world, and times when someone did something they didn't really think they could succeed at. What matters is doing. If it works, that's the bottom line. Whatever you can rationalize is your own wasted thought on the matter. Using magic, I've been able to extend my life beyond severe injury and resulting debilitations that would otherwise have been fatal, gain sudden skills and knowledge that I had no other reference point for, hear the thoughts of my sister from several states away, and more. Is it possible that there's an additional explanation beyond occult practices for this? Sure, I guess. If that's where your head's at, though, that's an impediment and not an improvement. Screw explaining it. Be a pragmatist. If something works for you, then embrace it rather than nitpicking. Maybe it's because I find speculative hypothesizing so boring, maybe it's because I'd rather be reaping results than contemplating how it happens, but I have very little interest in or patience for nitpicking my occult work, and that's served me pretty well to the point that if I never got into this stuff, I would be crippled and brain damaged and best and most likely dead.
