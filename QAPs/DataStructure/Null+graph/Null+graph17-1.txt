Does the Cannae Drive disprove the law of conservation of momentum?
Looking at the link to the abstract, there isn't actually proof this thing works. Both the test drive and the 'null' drive (the one which was designed to not work) produced thrust. This points to a more unexciting result of a systematic error. I suppose another possibility is that they have no idea how this thing works (even the inventor), and that there is some method of propulsion going on even in the 'null' drive. Supposing it does work, without knowledge of what causes its thrust, it would violate the conservation of momentum. However, there are potential solutions to the cause of the thrust, such as what is mentioned in the abstract (interaction with the vacuum). There are some very basic tenets to physics (mainly conservation rules) that if truly violated would cause major disarray in the physics community. These guys are so committed to the conservation of momentum and energy that when given a reaction that seemingly violated it (beta decay), they'd rather theorize that there was an ultra tiny particle that barely reacted to anything in order to solve the violation... and they were right! Read here: Neutrino. In this case, they'd be willing to discard such a design because it would seemingly violate conservation of momentum.
