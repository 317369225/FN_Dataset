I don't care for Java. If you like Java, why do you like it?
The two groups of people I've met who deeply love Java can be best categorized as follows: People who learned Java first and think it's the only way to program properly. People who come from a C or C++ background. People in the second category usually cite Java's garbage collection as a great, great, thing. And they're right - not having to explicitly collect your own garbage gets rid of an absolutely huge number of ways you can blow your program and/or computer to hell. That it looks like C/C++ makes it pretty easy to learn. It also doesn't hurt that the standard library is extensive and that everyone and their mum (or so it seems) has written frameworks and open source tools to do whatever it is you want to do in Java. That said, at this point, I think the Java language is just about the worst part of the Java platform. You want to program in Python but have Java libraries? Go with Jython. Ruby more your style? JRuby. You want a well-supported Lisp dialect? Clojure or Kawa. And Scala's a pretty good choice, too - it's far more compact, among other things. In my experience, the people in the first category will also point to static typing as a great thing. The static typing/dynamic typing argument is really nothing more than a holy war at this point, but hey, some people love it.
