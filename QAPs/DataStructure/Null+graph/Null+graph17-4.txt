Does the Cannae Drive disprove the law of conservation of momentum?
The way this drive is understood makes it sound like you're sitting in a boat pushing on the sail with your hands and that makes the boat move through the water. Now that would break the conservation of momentum law. More likely it's just another anisotropic thermal radiation effect like the Pioneer anomaly, or something similar. Updated 76w ago
