Who is your favorite Fields Medal winner?
Cursory Note before I answer: My former advisor used to joke that the set of "mathematicians" was a set with only one element - Israel Gelfand and with his passing it became a null set. Norbert Wiener in his book Cybernetics noted that perhaps the last Mathematician was Gauss, after that we only have topolgists or geometers etc. Nowadays mathematics is so specialized that even experts in one area may not be in a position to understand the work of some other area. Why do I say this? For the above reason simply, I believe any such question is inherently meaningless. Because it tends to give the appearance that people will pick "their" favourite based on their work. But they will not, because they might not even know the work of people in the list and their picking would be influenced by factors unrelated to the actual contributions (I don't like to say this but Perelman will fall in this category because of his refusing the award) or to something that the answerer actually worked on (which might be a better bias). In either case it is unfair to the others. It's never possible to "rank" people, and this becomes even more meaningless when one progresses into mathematics. The Answer: That said, going by some other answers, I will pick a few (not listed in any particular order). 1. Alexandre Grothendieck: I think he is a candidate for the greatest "theory building" mathematician from the last century. He was the central figure behind Algebraic Geometry and related areas. And if it were not for his contributions many fields of mathematics would not even exist and an entire generation of mathematicians has been influenced by his approach to mathematics. While there are too many contributions to list, one particular one that I am familiar with is the Grothendieck Inquality: Grothendieck inequality Interestingly, although Grothendieck was a dogmatic purist most of his work has found applications in Physics and other areas. In particular Grothendieck's inequality has found applications in Combinatorial Optimization and even machine learning in problems arising out of correlation clustering (and generally matrix factorization see: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.2464v1... for references. The problem of correlation clustering originated in a work by Alex Smola and others). Other than his revolutionary contributions he also is famous for being a recluse. He was a pacifist and withdrew from mathematics and then public life completely and now lives somewhere in the south of France. Some of his writings are perhaps some of the best that I have ever read. If you are interested in his life and work, I would highly recommend Allyn Jackson's two part article on him: As if Summoned from the Void (Allyn Jackson): Part 1: http://www.ams.org/notices/20040... Part 2: http://www.ams.org/notices/20041... 2. Steve Smale Steve Smale is a very unusual mathematician. He started off quite interestingly: did very poorly in graduate school, earning a C average and was almost kicked out before he started working hard and soon enough he astounded the world with a proof of Sphere Eversion. This is known as Smale's Paradox. A charming video of Sphere Eversion i.e. turning a sphere inside out is on youtube   He also proved the Poincaire conjecture for all dimensions greater than or equal to five. This was usually believed to be false by mathematicians and also believed to be much harder. Smale showed otherwise. The actual problem posed by Poincaire was solved by Perelman decades later who won the Fields Medal for his proof. He generalized his result into what is called the h-cobordism theorem. I mentioned that Smale was unusual. This is because he has worked on many other areas that at first blush seem totally unrelated. Some of his work that I am actually familiar with is from Machine Learning. He has been a central figure in the import of Manifold Learning methods for data representation. In many cases it is seen that although data might be high dimensional it actually has a small ambient dimension i.e. it actually resides on a low dimensional manifold and using this can help fight the so called "curse of dimensionality". He proved some important results in this direction. With Filipe Cucker he also published a very influential paper on the mathematical foundations of learning http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~smale/... For people interested in Control. He (again with Cucker) perhaps gave the first mathematical proof (correct me if I am wrong) in self organization: i.e. on Emergence in Flocks https://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/~mehlh... it is noteworthy that many problems in self organization can be reduced to flocking birds. While still in his 80s he is still very active and creative! 3. David Mumford Like Smale, Mumford is another unusual mathematician. He worked on Algebraic Geometry and made many fundamental contributions. But I am in no position to comment on it. I will thus mention work that he has done in other areas. Since the 90s he has been working almost continuously on a formalism in AI called Pattern Theory: Pattern theory (even wrote a book: Pattern Theory: The Stochastic Analysis of Real-World Signals (Applying Mathematics): David Mumford, Agn�s Desolneux: 9781568815794: Amazon.com: Books ). Pattern Theory is a different approach to problems in AI (especially in vision and speech) where the goal is to describe the knowledge of the world as Patterns. It is different from other approaches which work on recognizing patterns. The goal here is to make a grammar of patterns which can help in creating a vocabulary of them and thus recognizing a pattern would amount to composing simpler "alphabets" from this grammar. His work in vision following this line in Vision has been very influential. A preprint for some work on "Image Grammars" is available over here: http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/... 4. W. Timothy Gowers I have had the chance to work on the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma, so I have a little more to say about Gowers work. Tim Gowers won the Fields Medal for work that showed connections between Combinatorics and Analysis. Although this would only be a very rough portrayal a good way of thinking about this is via the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma: The Szemeredi Regularity Lemma roughly states that Every large enough graph can be approximated by random graphs. This is in the sense that every graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of equal parts such that: 1. Most edges run between different parts 2. And that these edges behave as if generated at random. For those who work in Analysis or even signal processing, a first look at the statement of the regularity lemma above reminds one  of the Fourier series.  While this is extremely simplified – It’s not entirely incorrect to say  that it points in part to a deeper relationship between combinatorics  and analysis. His work solidified this connection. He also gave a generalized version of Szemeredi's Theorem which is a very important result with consequences in many areas of mathematics (like Ergodic Theory, Number Theory etc). Endre Szemeredi was given the Abel Prize this year! I must mention another thing that I find very fascinating. In The Szemeredi Regularity Lemma for which I mentioned a very approximate statement above. In the proof one proceeds in the following way:  We  start with an initial partition of the graph (with low potential - a quantity that gives the quality of each partition) and then  iteratively refine the partition in such a way that the potential  increases to a point such that the partition is epsilon regular (a condition to say that the partition is good enough).  However, this leads to a major problem – In refining the partitions iteratively the number of  classes increases exponentially in each iteration. We then end up with a  partition in which the number of classes is a tower function – usually  an astronomical figure. For a long time it was thought that such a  tower function was perhaps not necessary and it was the side effect of Szemeredi's proof. But Gowers actually constructed an example that showed that such a tower was actually necessary. (see here: Geometric And Functional Analysis, Volume 7, Number 2 ). This was an insane example to me - That somebody could actually construct such an example! 5. Terence Tao There is a lot to mention about Terence Tao. But I am sure he would be mentioned in other answers so I will not answer, although I would like to. But a short note: He has worked on the same areas as Gowers above - Infact one of his most well known results (The Green-Tao Theorem) was an extension of Szemeredi's Theorem. He also gave different proofs of the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma (mentioned above) and also its Hypergraph Variants. To people in Machine Learning he is probably best known as the founder of compressed sensing! 6. I must mention Will Thurston, who passed away just recently. I don't know much about his work. But he was very active on MathOverflow and often made very insightful general comments. He wrote an essay that I recommend: On proof and progress in mathematics : http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/940423...
