What programming language do people hate the most, and why?
The ones that no one uses any more: x86 Assembly Language, because the Instruction Set Architecture is just bad. Aren't we happy to have compilers to hide its ugliness from us? Advanced Defense Applications (ADA) COBOL, which was an attempt to make programming more accessible to MBAs. Visual Basic, which was another attempt ... APL (programming language), because it's all Greek. PL/1 Perl (programming language), because it prefers function over form (rather than the inverse; see Form vs. Function), which language purists hate. Updated 126w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
