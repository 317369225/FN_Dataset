What are the most amusing figures or images from academic journals and articles?
This ant species, Cataglyphis fortis, forages on the extremely hot surface of the Sahara. There is so little food available, so its trips can be quite long. The scorching heat -- which often is what offed its next meal -- threatens to kill these ants if they do not return to the underground nest once food is found. Although they forage randomly, once they have found food, they beeline immediately back home by the shortest possible route -- even if they have not traveled by this route at all! The desert terrain has few distinguishing features, and the ants are clearly too short and small to make eye contact with the nest, so how do they know their way? Because the ants moved in small bouts with frequent reorientation to the sun -- and because if you pick an ant up and move it, it will try to return to a "nest" that is as far from the real one as you placed it  -- researchers led by Harald Wolf at the University of Ulm suspected the ant was counting its steps and recording its direction while foraging in order to eventually plot a course for home. To test this, they caught a few foraging ants and performed rapid surgery to change the length of their legs: ...and re-released the ants near food. On their return trip, ants on stilts got the direction correct but dramatically overshot on distance, going right past their nests. Similarly, stumpy ants (missing a leg joint) took the correct number of steps but because of their stature did not travel far enough to reach home. The figure is from this review article. Actually that is not the end of the story, because the ants have a different mechanism for handling vertical distance from home, which if I recall correctly was  tested with an obstacle course of rolling hills...can't find an illustration now, though.
