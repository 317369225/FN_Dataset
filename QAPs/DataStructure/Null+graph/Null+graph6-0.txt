In Excel graphs, is it possible to have fewer markers, like one for every two data points?
This is not a built-in feature in Excel graphs, but there are a couple of ways to hack it. The most straightforward (and manual) approach is to create your graph and selectively right-click on each data point you want to erase and set the 'marker' option to 'none' one data point at a time.  This is pretty inelegant and not so useful for a chart that has many data points, or is frequently updated. A more automated approach is to create a second data series that you can overlay on top of your original data series.  You can plot the first series as a line and the second series as markers with no line.  Then all you need is a formula to null the markers you want to suppress. Suppose your data is located in B1:B20.  The following formula entered in C1 and copied to C1:C20 will create an 'overlay' data series with every other data point set to NA(), which will not plot on your graph: =IF(MOD(COUNT($B$1:B1),2)=1,B1,NA()) You can change the variable '2' in the MOD function to any integer if you want to create a maker for every nth data point.  Even better, make it a reference to a cell containing your preferred 'skip' interval. P.S. - Interestingly, Excel permits this formula to be entered as an array formula, and even as an named range array.  In both case, Excel produces the correct values when referenced in spreadsheet, but it does not seem to produce the correct values as a Graph'ed data series.
