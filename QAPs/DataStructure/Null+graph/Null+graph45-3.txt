What are textbooks to follow for GATE CSE Preparation?
Mathematical Logic, Set Theory & Algebra, Combinatorics Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth H. Rosen Discrete Mathematics by Seymour Lipschutz & Marc Lars Lipson Algorithms: Introduction to Algorithms by Rivest, Cormen, Stein, Leiserson Operating System: "Operating System Principles" by Galvin. Theory of Computation: "Theory of Computation" by Ullman. Computer Networks: "Computer Networking: A top-down approach" by Kurose-Ross "Computer Networks" by Tanenbaum, Computer Organisation: "Computer Organisation" by Carl Hamacher - the syllabus covered in here is more in tune with the prescribed GATE syllabus Computer Organization and Design â€“Patterson Programming and Data Structures: The standard textbooks are good for C Programming while Introductions to Algorithms by Coremen is good for data structures. Database Systems: "Database System Concepts" by Korth Compiler Design: "Principles of Compiler Design" by Aho and Ullman. Digital Logic: "Digital Logic and Design" by Morris Mano. Software Engineering: "Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach" by Pressman. I also prefer Gate books from Nodia publication for best results in Gate exams .
