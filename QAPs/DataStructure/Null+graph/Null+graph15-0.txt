Is the black hole a null point, like absolute zero of energy?
T he inside of a black hole is not a null point - it is a singularity . Basically,it is an infinite mass confined to a point size particle . Putting stuff plainly, it causes the gravitanional field, which even light cannot escape, and hence creates a "black" hole . The Absolute zero concept is totally different - when we take a teperature - volume graph, absolute zero is a point on the temperature axis, ie just a temperature where volume becomes zero. Beyond this temperature, matter cannot exist, as negative volume is not permitted .
