I am a fresher pursuing my B.Tech final year, and I have an interview with Amazon tomorrow in my college. It's my first experience with any interview. What should I do?
I'm assuming that, since you're a CS grad, you're applying for a software engineering role. Check out Cracking the Coding Intervew:Â  http://www.amazon.com/dp/098478280X Other than that: Practice with actual interview questions. CareerCup.com has about 2000 interview questions from Amazon: http://www.careercup.com/page?pi... Practice by actually solving questions yourself. Really, really push yourself - don't just flip to the answers in the book / on the website. Practice white board coding by writing code on paper. Test the code yourself too, by hand. Don't use a compiler to check your code until the code is perfect (and tested).
