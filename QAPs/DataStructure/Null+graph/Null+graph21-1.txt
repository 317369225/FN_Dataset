What should I do in the next 6 months to get into a company like Amazon/Google?
These companies do not test for anything other than your core CS subjects that you studied in college. Learn data structures and algorithms. (have thorough knowledge of space, time complexity and stuff). Learn programming, UNIX,  and fundamentals OO Design. Have rock solid CS fundamentals. Learn basics of Operating Systems, Networking Be absolutely strong in a programming language of your choice (It could be C++,C or Java).  Eg: For Java, you should know collections,classes, interfaces, threading, concurrency , the JVM and related stuff. Learn basics of Probability Theory, Combinatorics, Practice Puzzles in sites like Programming Interview Questions | CareerCup, interviewstreet.com, spoj.pl, topcoder.com Even better, contribute to an open source project In the end, also realize that an interview is a gamble and you might be tested on some of these areas above ( a fairly comprehensive list this! ) or on a completely new area or an open ended problem.  It depends on the interviewer and what favorite problems he has.
