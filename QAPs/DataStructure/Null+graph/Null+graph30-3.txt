What's the average profit margin earned by apparel distributors, brick & mortar retailers, and e-commerce/online retailers?
Great response Matthew, now I'll tackle this in the context of smaller businesses. Distribution in apparel for unbranded (small brands, not multinationals) is virtually unheard of unless something really awful happens and you have to unload stuff in the off-price market. Distribution is more common in commodities (tees, tube socks etc). So, smaller firms don't need to worry about distributors because this isn't how goods are represented and sold. Retail markups are constantly evolving. It used to be strictly keystone (wholesale price X2) but it's moving upwards to 2.10 to 2.5. E-commerce is all over the map. All bets are off with respect to eBay etc, maybe it's good to test the waters but I wouldn't recommend selling there unless again, you have steady supply of well priced commodity goods. If you're asking because you want to know what an ecommerce vendor expects in the way of mark-up... ideally, it is in your best interest that their mark up is the same as brick and mortar. You don't want to sell to someone who can't enforce your price points because they can cannibalize your B&M accounts who then won't buy from you anymore. Ecommerce done well has just as many expenses (fulfillment, photography, PR, free shipping etc) as a B&M store. Lastly, if you're asking because you want to retail your own stuff, you more than anyone has to sell at MSRP, you can't undercut your doors. If you need to sell off something that isn't moving, offer it to your accounts first. If you have no takers on the merchandise then you can discount it.
