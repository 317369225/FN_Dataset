How does this recursive function work?
The goal is to try to find a way to get from 1 to the goal only by adding five or multiplying by 3. The function actually try all possible path until one is succeed or all fails (because they all lead to numbers larger than the goal). When you call findSequence(24) this is the history of calls. 1 -> 6 (+5)    -> 11 (+5)      -> 16 (+5)        -> 21 (+5)          -> 26 //discarded        -> 63 //discarded      -> 48 (*3) //discarded    -> 33 //discarded  -> 3 (*3)   -> 8     -> 13      -> 18        -> 23          -> 28 //discarded        -> 69 //discarded      -> 54 //discarded     -> 24 // goal ! we return the current history: ((1*3) +5) *3 It first try to add 5 until it exceed 24. When this fails, it then replace some +5 by *3 and repeat the process. Try putting on a paper the execution of the program (at least for the first calls), it helps to understand recursion.
