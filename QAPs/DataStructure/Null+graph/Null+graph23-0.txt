How does this recursive function work?
I think the best way to understand this function is to visualize it as a graph: This is a recursive function that generates all permutations of adding +5 or multiplying *3 to the previous number. It stops when we find 24. We start at 1. Then we do a depth first traversal preferring +5 over *3, until we find 24. To see why this is correct, just look at the cases in our recursive function: if we are at our target number, stop and return the history if we are above our target number, stop if we are below our target number, first go down the +5 path. if this returns null, go down the *3 path. This is basically depth first. You can view the Python script I used to generate the graph here findsequence.py. Updated 15w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
