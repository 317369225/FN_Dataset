What are the top 10 math topics I should learn if I'm trying to become a data scientist?
Well, I am not sure there are 10 things. There may be some specific question to ask before answering. There are many kinds of data scientist. For example, if you want to know about data analyst, all you need is to study the statistics. In most cases, the linear regression will be enough. Actually, it is the entry-level job for those who study in statistics major. And daily job is like you have a lot of numbers and use STAT or R try to find the math relationship between them. But  if you want to focus on machine learning, 1. It has something in common with the statistics. 2.Basis knowledge in linear algebra. 3.Basis probability especially Bayes.   It is true that the data scientist does not require that much math knowledge and if you do not care the details of the proof (just like many student did) there are much less to learn.
