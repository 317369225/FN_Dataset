What are the most amusing figures or images from academic journals and articles?
Figure 1 from P. A. Franken, A. E. Hill, C. W. Peters, and G. Weinreich, "Generation of Optical Harmonics," Physical Review Letters, vol. 7, no. 4, pp. 118-119, Aug. 1961, which reported the first experimental observation of second harmonic generation and launched the field of nonlinear optics: See how the arrow doesn't point at anything?Â  That's because the second harmonic signal was erased by the publisher, who thought it was a dust speck. For more detail, see this interview with Peter Franken: http://www.aip.org/history/ohili... (search the page for the term "erased").
