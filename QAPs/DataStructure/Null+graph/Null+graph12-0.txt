What are the top 10 math topics I should learn if I'm trying to become a data scientist?
I went back to study data science and applied analytics at a masters level after 10 years out of university. I was good with numbers but quite rusty so I was fortunate that the course had a solid statistics refresher that helped remind me of some fundamentals before I jumped into the wonderful world of econometrics, optimisation and subsequently machine learning and predictive time series. So this answer are my top 10 foundational topics that I appreciated having refreshers of before embarking on the more advanced data science topics. (I agree with some of the other posters that 10 is a somewhat arbitrary number. But you asked for 10, so here's 10 :) 1. Basic probability Probability of events. Conditional probability. Independence / dependence. Probability trees. Bayes. 2. Probability models Distribution functions - Cumulative Distribution Functions and Probability Distribution Functions. Discrete distributions (Poisson, Binomial, Bernoulli). Variance and Covariance. 3. Calculus Derivatives and integration. Chain rule and product rule. 4. Linear algebra Vectors. Addition, multiplication, and especially dot product. 5. Matrix algebra Addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication. Transpose of a matrix. 6. Central limit theorem Independent and identically distributed assumptions. Which distributions approximate to normal distribution. 7. Linear Regression The simple linear regression model. Assumptions. R-squared. Sum of squared formula. Plotting residuals against fitted values. 8. Multiple regression. Interpretation of coefficients. Interactions between variables. Â  9. Hypothesis testing Null and alternate hypothesis. One tailed. Two tailed. p-values. Significance. 10. Basic graph theory Definitions, directed and undirected graphs. Graph properties.
