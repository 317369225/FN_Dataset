What's the average profit margin earned by apparel distributors, brick & mortar retailers, and e-commerce/online retailers?
Depending on a couple factors gross margins should be about 75% for clothing mfg selling online. Commodity items will be harder to sell at higher margins as there will be price competition. But for branded items sold from the maker, 75% is a realistic target before markdowns. However there are exceptions, items with high mfg cost and lots of competition may have to sacrifice margin to meet the "sweet spot" of market pricing. Alternatively, unique items with no easily identifiable competitive benchmark can be sold at higher margins as long as demand will support sales at a higher price point.
