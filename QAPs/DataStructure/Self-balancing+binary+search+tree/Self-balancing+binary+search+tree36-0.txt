What are the ways to excel in programming, given having only a little knowledge in coding so far?
There are two sides when it comes to learning to program. 1.) Practical 2.) Artistic Almost all the books that deal with C++, Algorithms. etc concentrate on the Artistic side. The Art of Programming is really important. The math behind programs, the theory.etc But a beginner may be interested to learn them but when he begins with them, he realises they are tough and the explanations are not that beginner-friendly. The beginner will soon lose interest. You need to go with the Practical side first. Learn to create websites or mobile apps. While doing these practical projects you will tend to have lot of questions for which you can find solutions online. More projects you do, more better you get. Then one fine day, you will be like "I want to know more". You will find yourself going to the artistic side. You want to know how exactly the "behind the scene" works. There is a huge difference between learning the artistic side without practical experience and with it. Let me give you a path that you may find helpful: 1.) Learn Web Development ( Choose Python ) 2.) Learn Mobile Development ( Choose Windows Phone 8 ) 3.) Create your own python web framework ( You will know what this is when you do step 1 ) 4.) Create your own Javascript library ( Step 1 will teach you what this is ) 5.) Learn to increase the performance of your projects ( You will be entering the artistic side ) 6.) Build a Python interpreter using C# ( You will learn C# in step 2 ) 7.) Read the book "C.O.D.E" by Charles Petzold. 8.) You will know where to go from here once you reach this step. Its not too late.
