What are the ways to excel in programming, given having only a little knowledge in coding so far?
I am in the same situation you are (though i am not doing CSE) .The first thing you should do is stop feeling sorry for yourself. We all make mistakes. Becoming a topnotch coder requires effort. So you'll have to practice a lot since you say don't have experience or knowledge. Now to build fundamentals pick an algorithms book that doesn't bore you. Here are some books which might help : Amazon.com:  Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition (9780262032933): Thomas H.  Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein: Books Algorithms (4th Edition): Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne: 9780321573513: Amazon.com: Books You mention C++ . So pick a good C++ book maybe C++ Primer Plus or Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example as recommended here. Don't copy paste the code. Write the program and understand what it is doing. Sites like codechef, topcoder etc. will look a little hostile to you if you don't have some experience in programming. So it would be good if you try solving problems on these sites when you get a little comfortable with simple programs. Once you feel at ease with simple programs go to codechef and start solving easy problems and then move on to advanced problems. TL;DR : No, it is not too late! Get a good book, read it and write some programs.
