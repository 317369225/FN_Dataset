What are the ways to excel in programming, given having only a little knowledge in coding so far?
Pick a project and start coding. Really, there are only two ways anyone truly learns to code and that is by doing and by imitation.  Once you have picked a project, if you look on the net you will find all sorts of code to imitate to make the various parts of your project. Please note that I am *not* down selling the value of learning the theory.  Thats important too.  It will help you to understand why you should approach the problem in various ways, but in the end coding is like math in that its a set of habits.  You can't learn to do math by just sitting in lecture and neither can you learn to code that way.
