What's the most time and space efficient algorithm to find the repeated phrases in a document?
Part of this depends on your time/space tradeoff and what a "phrase" is. Assuming you have no separator, one way you could go is to fill an array with the words from the document. (You could store the hashes instead for less space, but you're trading that off with a chance of collision.) If you're looking for repeated phrases without the separator, you could look for repeated words by using a dictionary that keys on either the word (or hash of the word) and stores the index of the occurrences of the words in the document. Let's assume that a phrase is three or more words that repeat. Given that a word is at indexes 5, 57, and 192, you can see whether the words at 6, 58, or 193 are the same as one another. If the words at 6 and 193 are the same, check for 7 and 194. You'd obviously have to make a bunch of other decisions, like whether punctuation or capitalization changes a phrase.
