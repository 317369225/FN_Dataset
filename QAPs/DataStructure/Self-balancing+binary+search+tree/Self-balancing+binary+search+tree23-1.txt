What is the difference between a binary tree, a binary search tree, a B tree and a B+ tree?
Binary tree is a generic version of binary search tree and it's not ordered. While constructing, binary tree we follow a rule that every node should have at most two children. Whereas in case of BST, along with at most two children rule, we follow below rules 1) All left descendants should possess smaller values than root value. 2) All right descendants should possess larger values than root value. BST are effective only when we are dealing with data which resides in main memory (RAM). B trees,B+ trees comes handy when we have huge which can't fit in main memory and has to perform disk seek operations. These two self balancing tress will reduces no.of disk seeks.
