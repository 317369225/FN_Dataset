What should I know when searching for a job in the IT industry?
Very common question and important too. As a CS graduate, I guess one must be thorough with the following topics for interview: Data Structures: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queues, Heap, Hash Table, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Self Balancing Binary Tree (AVL, Red Black Tree), B-Tree, Tries/Suffix Tree Algorithms: Sorting (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, External Sorting), Searching (linear and logarithmic time searching), Graph Theory (Adjacency List, Adjacent Matrix, DFS, BFS, Topological Sort), Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer. Adhoc Algorithms: Select Algorithm, Fisher Yates Card Shuffle, Reservoir Sampling and list is endless. Databases: SQL Queries Programming and Design: C,C++, Java, scripting languages (Perl, Python), (OOPS basics, virtual functions, deep and shallow copy, copy constructor, assignment operator, STL, memory management, pointers/reference, interface, abstract classes. Operating Systems: Thread Synchronization (Mutex, Conditional Variables, Semaphores, Deadlocks), Memory Management (Segmentation, Paging, TLB, Caching Mechanisms). (Just go through these topics, this will surely help you out.) Now the list of projects which you can do to build your resume: Mobile banking project source code in java Intranet management system in java source code. Human resource management system project in vb.net E-space project source code in java and project report Distributed management system project source code in java and report Student management system project source code in java and report.Â  (many more projects of such types are there,which will help you to build your resume) I hope this will help you. All the best.
