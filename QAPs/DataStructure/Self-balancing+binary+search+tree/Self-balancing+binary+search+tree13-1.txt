How can I design an efficient data structure that supports findMin, findMax, deleteMin, deleteMax, Insert, and delete?
I agree with the others, a BST of some sort is probably your best solution (especially for inserts). What you're basically after is what's known as a Priority Queue, these tend to be built using either Heaps or other types of BSTs. Though the naive implementation would use a circular array (only time this would be preferred is if you need to optimize all values to fit at once into a CPU cache, though even then it might be possible to implement a BST within an array instead). You might find this of interest: Priority Queues
