If all programmers and developers look things up as they code, why are coding tests often a part of the interview process?
How crucial is it to still know all of the specifics of each and every language to get the job? Not very important. Coding interviews generally focus on solving tricky algorithm problems within time limits, rather than test knowledge of obscure language features (like Java's enum vs C#'s enum, what a Python generator is, etc.). However, it would often be useful to be familiar the standard library of at least one language, usually the one you used at your last job/school. This would simplify many data-structure-oriented coding problems (e.g. C++ <set> is a self-balancing binary search tree). ... Why are coding tests often a part of the interview process? Coding tests verify an applicant's understanding of basic CS concepts, such as sorting, hashing, data-structures, and binary notation. Coding tests are convenient as a single problem can encompass several concepts, as well as test an applicant's ability to communicate complicated details, handle pressure, and general attitude.
