What are examples of the practical use of trees and heaps?
Trees are used for Efficient Searching and Hierarchical Organization Consider, you have a list of names and you want to search whether a given name is present in the list. If the input list is random then you need to traverse the entire list to check whether it is in the list.Whereas when you use a special kind of tree, likeÂ  self-balancing Binary Search Tree(ex.AVL Tree) we can search it in logarithmic time. Let's say that your list contains 1000000 names and let's assume it takes 1 millisecond to check a name, then in the linear approach it would take 1000 seconds to search for a single name. But in a tree this becomes log(1000000)=approximately 0.00015 seconds which makes your facebook search for friends engaging ;) Heaps are used for Prioritizing and Sorting. Consider you are managing the number of goals scored by each player in a tournament. At any time, you may need to know the player with the most number of goals scored. In a brute force approach, you need to traverse through your list to find the player with the maximum number of goals. Clearly this is time-consuming. However, we can use a priority queue using heaps and can keep track of the player with the maximum goal anytime and can produce the result in constant time.
