What is the worse case of binary search tree with duplicates O(n)?
Is worst case of Binary search tree with duplicates O(n)? Yes. The worst case would be if all elements are the same and equal to the umber to search. In that case, you would have to made changes to check if first and last element are the same as required. As all numbers in between will be less than high and more than low, all will be equal. So a modified Binary Search algorithm could have O(1), but not the original one. Assume a BST where you place elements of lesser or equal value to the left of the current node. Does this theoretically reduce the efficiency of the tree to O(n) since you could potentially end up with a single branch in your tree? Does this essentially make the worst case equal to a linear search? Yes it does decrease the efficiency and make it similar to Linear Search in worst case, where you find the greatest or smallest element first. However, in such a case, all elements have to occur in increasing or decreasing order, or in other words, sorted ascending or descending.
