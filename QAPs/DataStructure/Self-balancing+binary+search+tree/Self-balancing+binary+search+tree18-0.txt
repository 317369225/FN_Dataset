If all programmers and developers look things up as they code, why are coding tests often a part of the interview process?
Coding tests cover skills people can't look up, like writing loops that terminate correctly, thinking of and handling edge conditions, thinking concurrently, etc.   Problems with common syntax in a language a candidate claims to have used recently and extensively suggests they lied on their resume or can't remember enough to write software.  Beyond that there's a lot of latitude.
