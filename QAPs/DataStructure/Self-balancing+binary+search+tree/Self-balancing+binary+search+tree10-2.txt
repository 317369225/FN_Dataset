Does a data structure exist which supports logarithmic insertion/removal and constant-time query for the Kth smallest element?
If k is a parameter of the query, then Eric Price's answer says impossible. But if k is fixed, then it is definitely possible. You need a self balancing binary search tree with constant time access to its smallest and largest value (this can be effected by adding a min and max link to the tree root). Construct two such trees. One wil hold the k smallest values, the other will hold all other values. The kth largest element is always the max of the firstÂ  tree. Insert and delete as usual in the appropriate tree, then rebalance by moving the min/max element from one tree to the other as required to maintain the invariant that the first tree is size k.
