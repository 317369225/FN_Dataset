Does a data structure exist which supports logarithmic insertion/removal and constant-time query for the Kth smallest element?
Others have more technical and technically-accurate answers, but it's pretty easy to see that the constant-time query is going to be impossible.Â  Being able to identify an element by its position means searching, and you can't search in constant time. You might argue that you can index your data structure to change the search to a look-up, but then you're trying to maintain a data structure that needs to essentially be sorted, and we already know how much time that takes to update, and it's not logarithmic. The traditional fast index is a hash table, but hash tables can't know anything about relative values.
