What is the best way to self-teach the skills and knowledge gained in a typical computer science degree?
Short answer: Of course you should learn programming - but I assume you will do that anyway since you're interested in computer science. The theoretical stuff that is taught in CS courses is what is typically missing from self taught programmers. Look up the courses being offered at typical CS undergraduate and masters programs in top US universities, and start teaching yourself those. Once you've chosen a topic, finding material on the internet to learn the top should be easy - from MIT open courseware, Stanford courses, Khan Academy, Wikipedia and various websites. Here is a quick list of must must learn topics to get you started: Data Structures and Algorithms Discrete Maths Operating Systems Computer Architecture Networking Programming Languages and Compiler Construction Databases (both: Using databases and building databases) Theory of Computer Science Machine Learning / Data Mining / AI
