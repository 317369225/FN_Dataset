What is the typical implementation of an unordered_map and map in the C++ STL?
Yean, std::map implementation is based on LLRB trees. The tree implementation has the advantage that iteration of the key-value pairs contained in the map is done in key-order. A tree implementation has O(logn) cost for both insertion and retrieval. Deletion also has a logarithmic complexity. std::unordered_map is introduced in C++ 11 with a hash map implementation, as the name implied it loses the property of being ordered. The iteration of the key-value pairs is not in key-order, it has O(n) cost for both insertion and retrieval.
