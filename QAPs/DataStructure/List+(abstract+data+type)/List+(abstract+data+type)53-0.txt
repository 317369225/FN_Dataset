What's the best way to use a Queue in C++ to automatically sort a list of numbers as they are input?
If I understand correctly someone (a teacher ?) asked to create a Queue (abstract data type), and then to use it to implement some "on the fly" sorting algorithm. Really the Queue is a simple FIFO data structure (you add data at one side and remove it from the other side). But the details about the provided input looks like if more specifically what you want is a Priority queue . It's not really a queue any more you'll get the numbers by order of priority and the structure will behave like a queue only for items of same priority. Really I don't understand what you mean by "the best way to use a Queue". What is described it just the behavior of a priority queue. Henceforth you just implement one and it will do that. If you look for an efficient implementation, just go for a Heap (data structure) It's certainly good enough for an educative exercice. But by all means don't use a simple FIFO (a Queue) to implement a Priority Queue.
