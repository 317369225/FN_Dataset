When coding in Python when would I use a list vs using a dictionary? And on top of that what are the benefits of one over an other?
They are very different data structures. Dictionaries are basically hash tables, you use then to store pairs of key->value, having fast access to the value knowing the key. You can think of a dictionary as a list of tuples (key,value) with a fast function that can give you the index of an element given the key Â  Lists are, whell, lists, they offer access by index, which is a lot more limited then a key, you can emulate a list on a dictinary by using 0,1,2... as keys. You use lists when they are sufficient, as dictionaries will require much more space to store and will be less nice to iterate on.
