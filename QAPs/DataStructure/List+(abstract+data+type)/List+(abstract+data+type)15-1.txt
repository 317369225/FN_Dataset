What are the pros and cons of functional programming compared to imperative programming?
Some of the advantages those seems to be real advantages to me.. Functional programming moves more basic programming ideas into the compiler, ideas such as list comprehensions and caching. The biggest benefit of Functional programming is brevity, because code can be more concise. A functional program doesn't create an iterator variable to be the center of a loop, so this and other kinds of overhead are eliminated from your code Using the Functional style allows code to be written that declares its intent clearly, without being mixed up with control flow statements, etc. Ability to allocate lots of relatively small data structures that don't (usually) get mutated.
