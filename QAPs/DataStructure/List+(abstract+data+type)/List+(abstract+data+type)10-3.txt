Who are the 2013 Top Writers?
One thing that's striking to me is how few of these names I recognize (from my feed). There's obviously a ton of content that I'm not even aware of. That's pretty awesome to know.

Does this mean I have to update my 4 year old photo to reflect my more recent folicular challenges? Well, fleece > fleas...
