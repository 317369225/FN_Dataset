What is the application of linked lists in data structures?
Linked lists are the elementary linked data structures which can be used to implement stacks and queues all the time . You use an implicit stack each time when you are programming and are using recursive methods . You also use it for backtracking when you use the more complex data structures like trees . Another data structure which is implemented using linked lists is a queue . Queues are used for job scheduling all the time in our operating system , for example while requesting for a document to be printed , it is added to the print queue of the printing device .
