In C++, How do I sort the string variables stored in an array in a structure (abstract data type)?
Apply the exact same logic as integer sorting. If you have a array of structure objects A Having string str Then use A[i].str to access the member. Then use any one of the sorts, To compare the strings Use strcmp Read more abt strcmp and the values it returns, 0 if both areÂ  equal -1 if 1st is smaller 1 if 1st is larger Now the point is Strcmp not only sorts them according to size but topographically as well So you maintain your dictionary format and your work is done efficienctly.
