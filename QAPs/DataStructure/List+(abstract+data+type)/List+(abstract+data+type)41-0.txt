When coding in Python when would I use a list vs using a dictionary? And on top of that what are the benefits of one over an other?
I'm really not sure in the context of Python, but generically a list is a sequentially ordered and sequentially searched ADT (Abstract Data Type) and a dictionary is a simple hash table, which is mathematically ordered and mathematically searched. The List is a sequential ADT, meaning that the data is added in order of arrival, value, or some other metric. Searching and sorting both involve iterative comparisons. On the other hand, this can be done in such a way to efficiently utilize memory. The Dictionary is a Mathematical ADT, meaning that data is stored and searched for by a mathematical function of the data's value. It takes the same amount of time to search as it does to add data. The concept of sorting is not applicable in something like a Dictionary. However, it generally uses a non-negligible amount of additional memory.
