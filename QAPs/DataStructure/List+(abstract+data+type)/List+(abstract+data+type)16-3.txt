What is Redis?
If you would like to see a 'use case'; Check out my Redis blog article: Connecting Node.js with Redis You will see Redis sets, gets, lrange and others in action (with Node.js). There are links on how to install and configure redis-cli and server. This is code; Its incomplete because the focus is Redis and Node - not how to develop a website with Node. However, It should be moderate to follow and contain enough information for you to see how Redis is consumed by a website as a 'state -machine'. There is a link to the website that is pulling the Redis counts of tweet topics  in realtime.  However, this only runs during the day (PST) as it is a demo-proof of concept site.  Here is a link to a very cool GUI for Redis: Redis GUI management tool for Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu and Debian. With the install, redis-cli, server and gui; You should be able to glean the intuition behind a key-value store and some operational information behind Redis. Have fun :) - Gus
