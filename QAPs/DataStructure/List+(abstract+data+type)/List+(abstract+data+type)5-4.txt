How do I allow the user to define the number of elements in a Python list?
First thing is to understand that you cannot initialize arrays in python the way you do it in C/C++/Java. // array in Cint arr[20];// 20 is the size of array You cannot exactly do the same thing in python, but a few ways around it would be , 1. Ask for number of elements and initialize the array with a certain value. Incase you want to work with arrays Java style, this is your best bet. Initail values by java for an "int" array is 0. Same as here. x=input()arr = [0 for i in range(x)] 2. Ask for the size ,iterate and append. arr=[] # empty listx=input()for i in range(x):    '''     Do Something    '''    arr.append(something) Append adds the "something" inside braces to end of the list Good Luck. Hope this helps :)
