How do I allow the user to define the number of elements in a Python list?
Although I'm not sure that this is what you want but you could use list comprehension to create a list of predefined length: x = [0 for dummy in range(any_number)] This will create a list with of with whose length will be 'any_number'. The list will be of zeroes. You can use any filler value you like. As an example, x = [0 for i in range(5)]   # x = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]y = [True for j in range(3)]   # y = [True, True, True] Remember that 'x' and 'y' are still lists. That is, their length can still change. Hope this helps.
