When coding in Python when would I use a list vs using a dictionary? And on top of that what are the benefits of one over an other?
They are different data structures. Both are dynamic in nature,  grows as required.  List is like an array of sequential values with some order. Eg.  l = [1,2,3,4,5] Its useful for storing and retrieving elements by that order or by the index. Like l[1]=6,  l[3]+1 etc. You can loop through the list by sequence of indices. Dictionary is basically a hash table where its elements are a <key, value> pair. Keys can be an integer,  or string or character. eg.  D ={'a':2 ,'c':5} Its particularly useful to retrieve the values based on their keys,  when there in no particular order in the values. Like D['a'] = 9.  This kind of indexing is not possible in list. Its useful for quick retrieval or checking whether a key exist or not,  or whats is the corresponding value. The same operation in list would involve a linear search of the complete list in worst case thus making list inefficient for this kind of operations.
