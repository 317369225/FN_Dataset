What's the best way to use a Queue in C++ to automatically sort a list of numbers as they are input?
One answer would be using priority_queue from STL, but you don't want it. You have to implement everything then. Bjarne Stroustrup said, "The standard library saves programmers from having to reinvent the wheel". You are basically trying to do what he doesn't suggest. Btw, if you don't know, queue is part of STL. How ironic of you saying "without using any STL". If you want to sort with queue, which will be really inefficient. Because you can't insert in the middle with queue, one way you could do is to have 2 queue and put in the value based on where they belong, imagine it like BST. I wouldn't use queue to sort because as you can see, it's going to be very inefficient. You can think Queue just a linked_list. So you can use list to sort, which you can insert where you want it. And FYI, priority_queue from STL is implemented like a heap or BST. So you can use something like that.
