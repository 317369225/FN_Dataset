What is the use of structure in linked list?
[A2A] Structure in linked list is used to store data of the node as well as the pointer to the next node's address. A linked list is a linear collection of similar data where the next node is reached using the previous node in list. Structure helps to create this abstract data type(ADT) in C as there are no existing data types in C which helps in providing this ADT.
