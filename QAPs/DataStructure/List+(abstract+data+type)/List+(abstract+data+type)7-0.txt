What are some ways or examples of how abstract data types are used in software?
You've given us a clue in the question! A queue is an abstract data type. If you think about adding music to a playlist, you're adding music to the end of a queue. Songs at the front of the queue are played first then removed. Songs at the back of the queue are played last -- First In First Out (FIFO) or First Come, First Served. Think about how you might use the list abstract data type to model a list of songs in an album. Or a tree abstract data type to model a hierarchy of song files on disk, in folders by artist and subfolders by albums. Challenge - think about examples of when you might use a stack -- First In, Last Out.
