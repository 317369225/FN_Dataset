How do you Explain "Abstract Data Types" in layman terms?
With what I understood about ADT I would like to explain it with a scenario in layman terms: You enter a hotel and the waiter comes and asks what would you like to have. You say a cup of coffee. After some minutes, you get what you asked for. You pay for what you had and leave the place. Here, the functions that you did were 1. Entering into the hotel and settling down. 2. Answering to the waiter. 3. Paying for what you had. The data's that you provided were 1. Your presence - visually its a data notifying the waiter to come to you. 2. Your order - a cup of coffee. 3. Your money for what you had. If you were to write this in a class this would comprise of both functions and data that you provided. This would be the ADT. Making a coffee inside the hotel is never exposed to the customer. Likewise, in ADT you just expose what you can offer and not how it is offered. Meanwhile, you also mention what data you need to offer what you can. Hope this helps to understand. Correct me if I'm wrong.
