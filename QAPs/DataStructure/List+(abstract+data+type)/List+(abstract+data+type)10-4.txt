Who are the 2013 Top Writers?
I can't believe it! I was already on a high from finishing final exams, and this was the icing on a cake. Wow! I don't know what to say. It's an honor to be part of such an amazing and talented group of writers. It almost feels surreal, but I think after pinching myself 17 times, I convinced myself that this was happening. Honestly, I don't feel like I deserve it, but I'm really happy that Quora thought I did. I'd like to thank everybody who's upvoted, read, or even criticized my work. Everybody's who's supported or encouraged me. I guess it was all worth it! Thanks again, everybody!
