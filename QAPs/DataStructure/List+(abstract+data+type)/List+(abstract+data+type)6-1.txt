What are the top algorithms and data structures a software developer must know?
Here is a list of common data structures Array data structure and Sparse array Linked list and Doubly linked list Stack (abstract data type) and Queue (abstract data type) and Double-ended queue Binary tree and Treap Red–black tree Heap (data structure) String (computer science) and Trie B tree and B+ tree Graph (abstract data type) Hash table and Associative arrayFor most data structure, You need to learn how to perform Insertion, Deletion, traversal, Union, Search and Resize operations. Note that some data structures have very specific operations. A List of common algorithms Linear search Binary search algorithm and Ternary search Merge algorithm and Merge sort Insertion sort and Timsort Heapsort and Quicksort Selection algorithm Graph traversal (DFS, BFS) Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman–Ford algorithm Topological sorting Disjoint-set data structure (Union Find) and Minimum spanning tree Flow network Algorithms And a lot more, I will keep adding as i remember.
