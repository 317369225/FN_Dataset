How best can you advise someone who wants to get started with data structures in Java?
You don't mention your own knowledge of data structures in general. If you're already familiar, then read the Collections javadocs to see what's available to you out of the box, usually including a good description of implementation and expected performance. If you're new to data structures then look on Cousera, MIT Open Courseware, or for a textbook and try to implement each of the main abstract data types (ADTs) like List (array and linked), Tree, Dictionary (also called a Map or associative array), Set, Queue, Stack. Study why you'd use one particular implementation or another of each ADT, and in what circumstances to use each ADT.
