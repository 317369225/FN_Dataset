Who are the 2013 Top Writers?
I am really happy to have been named a TW for the first time this year...the fleece jacket is truly going to be awesome! I have to put a shout out to Jane Chin (陳盈錦) for being my inspiration for coming to Quora and throwing in my 2 cents. We met on facebook and saw her answers to questions on Quora posted there first. Intrigued, I jumped on and even though it was probably well over a year before I answered my first question, I eventually did. Jane has been an inspiration in so many ways...she speaks her mind, she takes huge risks, she is willing to learn, willing to love, willing to teach, and willing to encourage and promote good questions and answers. So thank you, Jane!  And thank you to Quora for the honor...a very nice Christmas present!
