What kind of programs are best written in Haskell?
Haskell is a general-purpose programming language, but you will certainly see more benefit and enjoyment using it if you are prepared to really take advantage of its strengths. The most well-known of those strengths is a fantastically powerful type system.Â  Some of the kinds of programs that can most obviously take advantage of this include transformations of structured data such as stream processing, DSLs, or compilers for other programming languages. Haskell is also a language often chosen by more formal practitioners for describing many sorts of interesting data structures and mathematical transformations, and so might be the path of least resistance if you wish to implement any of the systems it is used to describe.
