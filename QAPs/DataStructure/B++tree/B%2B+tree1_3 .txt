What are the advantages of B+ Trees over B Trees?What are the advantages over B tree. I know couple of them a) Providing support for range queries in an efficient manner. b) You can iterate over an ordered list of elements. Are there any other advantages when compared to B Tree?Answer 1: Advantages of B+ trees: Because B+ trees don't have data associated with interior nodes, more keys can fit on a page of memory. Therefore, it will require fewer cache misses in order to access data that is on a leaf node. The leaf nodes of B+ trees are linked, so doing a full scan of all objects in a tree requires just one linear pass through all the leaf nodes. A B tree, on the other hand, would require a traversal of every level in the tree. This full-tree traversal will likely involve more cache misses than the linear traversal of B+ leaves. Advantage of B trees: Because B trees contain data with each key, frequently accessed nodes can lie closer to the root, and therefore can be accessed more quickly. Answer 2: B+Trees are much easier and higher performing to do a full scan, as in look at every piece of data that the tree indexes, since the terminal nodes form a linked list. To do a full scan with a B-Tree you need to do a full tree traversal to find all the data. B-Trees on the other hand can be faster when you do a seek (looking for a specific piece of data by key) especially when the tree resides in RAM or other non-block storage. Since you can elevate commonly used nodes in the tree there are less comparisons required to get to the data. Source: B trees, B+ trees difference
