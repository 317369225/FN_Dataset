What are the differences between B+Tree and B-Tree?A B+ tree only stores data in the leaf nodes. With no data in the interior nodes the fan-out can be higher than with a B tree, tree depth shorter, reads from secondary storage lower, cache hit rate on intermediate nodes better, and time to data faster.
