What are the advantages of B+ Trees over B Trees?What are the advantages over B tree. I know couple of them a) Providing support for range queries in an efficient manner. b) You can iterate over an ordered list of elements. Are there any other advantages when compared to B Tree?The B+ tree allows you to more efficiently scan the data in sorted order because all the data is conveniently located in the leaves. The B-tree might have some benefits of its own because the data is closer to the root. But it is unclear to me whether B-trees are ever much better than B+ trees.
