How would you delete 22* from the following B+ tree? Why doesn't deleting by redistribution work?Can you please show the tree step-by step?To quote Tony Li, "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help with your homework." Deletion by redistribution does not work because it would violate the rule for a B+ tree of order 5 that it must have at least 2 entries per leaf block. This minimum requirement is figured as the order divided by 2, rounded down. The 27*/29* sibling of the 22*/24* block is only half full, so shifting the 27* to the left block with the remaining 24* would leave 29* alone, violating the requirement for 2 in the leaf. Now visually you can easily spot several ways to resolve this since the final leaf has plenty of members. You could make 24*/27* -> 29*/33*/34* -> 38*/39*, for example -- two elements, then three, then two. Or you could do it three, two, two; two, two, three is also possible while keeping the same block structure. There are, of course, even more ways to arrange the data that all fit within the constraints. One goal of the deletion algorithm, however, is to do the minimum amount of work necessary to bring the tree back to legitimate state, and the "right" way to do that here will depend on which algorithm your professor is attempting to teach you. One common method is simply to merge the siblings and then delete the key separating them from the index block, so 24*/27*/29* -> 33*/34*/38*/39*, with an index block parent of 30 ... oops, that's one element too few for the constraints of this order 5 tree. Therefore the merge propagates and that index block merges with its sibling, and their parent is brought down into the newly merged index block. The result is a two level tree, with the root block being 5/13/17/30, and its first three pointers to the first unchanged three leaf blocks in the initial illustration. The pointer for the 17/30 span goes to the merged 24*/27*/29* block and the rightmost root pointer goes to the unchanged 33*/34*/38*/39* leaf.
