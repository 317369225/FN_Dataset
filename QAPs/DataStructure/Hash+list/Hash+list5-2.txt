Redis vs Memcached: which one should I use for a web-based application?I'm starting on a project and I'm considering choosing between Redis and Memchached for caching purposes, and I wasn't sure which one would be better. I have a feeling that Memchached is faster than Redis (not entirely sure), but Redis allows me to run code against it in Python as opposed to C++. Does Memchached also have this feature? If not, then is there any reason why I should one over the other?
Use Redis. If you want a highly scalable data store which could be shared by mutiple applications (or even servers), redis is what you should use. If you aren't ok with your cache warming up with every restart, redis is what you should use. If you want to delete or expire items of your choice from your cache, redis is what you should use. If you want to query for a particular type of an object, redis is what you should use. And you'll need all the above things, so use Redis. I have used both memcached and redis and I can assure you Redis is fantastic and far more stable. Antirez and team have done a phenomenal job at it. Yes, memcached offers you robust clustering, but then again you might as well use Varnish with Redis. On Redis, Memcached, Speed, Benchmarks and The Toilet - from Antirez himself.
