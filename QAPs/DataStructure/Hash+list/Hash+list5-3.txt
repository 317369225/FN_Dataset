Redis vs Memcached: which one should I use for a web-based application?I'm starting on a project and I'm considering choosing between Redis and Memchached for caching purposes, and I wasn't sure which one would be better. I have a feeling that Memchached is faster than Redis (not entirely sure), but Redis allows me to run code against it in Python as opposed to C++. Does Memchached also have this feature? If not, then is there any reason why I should one over the other?
The mainstay of the argument for memcached is its built in use case for transient, expiring data and its fault-tolerant clustering by default.  It's a "cache" by nature - you shouldn't intend on querying it or analyzing the data within, merely utilizing it to obivate extra persistency layer calls. If your use demands anything that even remotely resembles a query or a data processing task, I would recommend Redis over it.  There are a lot of great NoSQL solutions depending on your needs, but Redis is lightning fast on reads, especially if your data set fits in memory.
