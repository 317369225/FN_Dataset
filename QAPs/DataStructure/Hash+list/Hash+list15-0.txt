How exactly were LinkedIn's password hashes compromised?See this article: http://translate.google.com/tran... I'm looking for how the hackers had access to LinkedIn's password hash data. That must mean some kind of data breach. How did that happen in the first place? What other data was compromised?
How the data was exfiltrated from LinkedIn servers is still a mystery, but as Ars Technica [1] describes, someone in possession of a large batch of password hashes posted them to a 'password recovery' website forum to get help cracking the encryption. UPDATE 25 June, 2012: A class action lawsuit has been filed against LinkedIn relating to this hack. The suit relies on the lack of salting as evidence that LinkedIn was negligent.  A news piece by Venture Beat [10], includes a scan of the entire initial filing document. The suit also mentions the possibility that SQL injection was the attack vector. The good news is that the suit may reveal more facts about the hack through the legal process of discovery. (6 Jan 2013: The original suit was merged with several similar suits in late August 2012. You can follow the major court filings in this case on Justia [12]). UPDATE 16 June 2012: Australian news outlet CRN has gotten a few people involved in the password cracking effort to talk [9]. Users from the Inside Pro forum (where the hashes were originally posted) are claiming the hack occurred in the January to March 2012 timeframe based on known old passwords. Others are claiming the hack used SQL injection, but these claims are unsubstantiated. Still no word from the actual hackers. The fact that any of the passwords have been cracked can be attributed to shoddy security practices at LinkedIn. PC World  [2] , Information Week [3], and others reported  that the leaked hashes were created with an unsalted SHA-1 algorithm and that LinkedIn, presumably in response to this breach, are only now using a salting technique on their passwords. The need for password salting [4,5] has been known for more than 30 years. Without it, your hash database is vulnerable to rainbow tables, brute force attacks, and dictionaries of common weak passwords. Security researcher Jeremi Gosney and others cracked over 90% of the hashes and have posted a detailed analysis of the results in this June 30 post at the Security Nirvana blog [11]. LinkedIn's first official response [6] to the situation seems to tell us that they are using the leaked hash list itself to figure out which accounts are compromised. This is concerning, since many security researchers have pointed out that the list is missing many of the easiest passwords which indicates that the hackers may have already cracked them and scrubbed them off the list before posting. A more in-depth critique can be found on ZDNet's blog [7]. The last post on LinkedIn's blog regarding the hack [8] states that law enforcement, including the FBI have been brought in on the case. This makes it unlikely that we will learn anything more about the specifics of the hack unless and until there are arrests or some other major breakthrough on the criminal case. The only other hope is that the hackers themselves will post details of their exploits. 1. http://arstechnica.com/security/... 2. http://www.pcworld.com/article/2... 3. http://www.informationweek.com/n... 4. http://stackoverflow.com/questio... 5. https://info.aiaa.org/tac/isg/SO... 6. http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06... 7. http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/li... 8. http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06... 9. http://www.crn.com.au/News/30454... 10. http://venturebeat.com/2012/06/1... 11. http://securitynirvana.blogspot.... 12. http://dockets.justia.com/docket...
