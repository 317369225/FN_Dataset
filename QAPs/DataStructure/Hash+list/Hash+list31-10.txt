Which database should I use for a killer web application: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL?I'm working on killer web application, and I am really interested and worked with MongoDB. Is it a choice to choose MongoDB as a premier database? Or Is it better to use MySQL (with MongoDB/Redis as secondary)?
Originally Answered: Should one use MySQL or MongoDB as the core database when you are trying to build a social network similar to Facebook?Funny you should ask, because there's an important field case that answers your question. The Diaspora social network started out using MongoDB, ran into lots of difficulty, and finally decided to switch to MySQL. Rails consultant Sarah Mei wrote an excellent blog post about the technical problems faced by Diaspora, and why they finally felt they had to use a relational database. Why You Should Never Use MongoDB. Apologies for the spoiler, but here's an important concluding sentence from Ms. Mei's blog: I’ve heard many people talk about dropping MongoDB in to their web application as a replacement for MySQL or PostgreSQL. There are no circumstances under which that is a good idea. Schema flexibility sounds like a great idea, but the only time it’s actually useful is when the structure of your data has no value. If you have an implicit schema — meaning, if there are things you are expecting in that JSON — then MongoDB is the wrong choice.
