Is MongoDB a good replacement for Memcached?
The flat out answer is no.  Memcached is used for something completely different.  The reason you use Memcached is typically to reduce the number of requests to a database.  If you have high traffic volume, memcached will help you take your most common requests and store it in memory for rapid access. Some people have become completely reliant on this somewhat new-wave of in-memory databases (like Redis, Voldemort, memcached, etc) as their primary database and all new writes to the memory are simultaneously written to a on-disk database (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc) as an archive/backup.  (this would be the far end of the spectrum) However you choose to structure your data model, MongoDB should not be seen as a replacement to Memcached and vice versa.
