What uses are there for Skip Lists?I've recently been trying to choose a data structure to implement an internal dictionary/index for a project I'm working on. I've read all about Skip lists, Hashtable implementations etc. and can't figure out where a Skip List would be a good choice. Seeing as you can easily use Hashtables at an efficiency of O(1), why use Skip Lists, who'se best performance is O(logN)?
