What are good ways to store data in ram with any programming language? I want to use ram as a cache
Whenever you are running a program it is running in its Virtual address. For the 32 bit system, the address space will be 4 GB. So, it is the responsibility of the operating system to manage the limited physical memory you have, amongst several processes running on your system. So, whenever new program has to be run or additional memory is required for the current process then Least Recently Used memory space is swapped into the disk and free memory space is created. However, if you want to lock your memory, you are telling the OS not to touch it whatever may be the reason. Though it is strongly advised not to use, in linux you have several mlock() APIs which you can see it here lock/unlock memory. These APIs can be used to lock your memory. By doing this you will be preventing OS to swap that portion of the memory. This memory you can use as your cache.
