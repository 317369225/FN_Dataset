What is the simplest language with which to learn algorithms and data structures?
At university (York UK) the algorithms and data structures module was taught using Ada, but they have since changed to Java. A strictly typed language like Ada helps when studying algorithms and data structures because it helps avoid silly bugs and debugging when it goes wrong, but I also agree with Lief in that the syntax for Python closely resembles pseudo code and practically it is quicker for prototyping small programs.
