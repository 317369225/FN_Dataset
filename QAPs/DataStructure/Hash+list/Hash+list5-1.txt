Redis vs Memcached: which one should I use for a web-based application?I'm starting on a project and I'm considering choosing between Redis and Memchached for caching purposes, and I wasn't sure which one would be better. I have a feeling that Memchached is faster than Redis (not entirely sure), but Redis allows me to run code against it in Python as opposed to C++. Does Memchached also have this feature? If not, then is there any reason why I should one over the other?
Redis offers a lot more then just cache. You can even use it as a datastore because it can persist data to disk. Redis has many builtin operations which you would otherwise have to develop at your own. One major advantage while caching is that keys can be simple strings, or more complex types (hashes, lists, sets etc). It also allows LRU eviction of items. Pub/Sub: You can keep track of subscribers and what information they are interested in. You can use SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, and PUBLISH. Queues: You can use normal queue data structure, Redis has blocking queuecommands as well. Real time analysis of events(stats, anti spam etc) - Using Redis primitives it's really simple to implement a real-time tracking filtering system or a spam filtering system. Order by user votes and time: Leaderboard type functionality(Quora/Reddit/Digg), where the score is changes over time. Transactional support: Provides transactional support. See Transactions - Redis.
