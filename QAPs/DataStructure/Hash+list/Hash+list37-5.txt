How can I become a good programmer at online judges?I am currently working in Indian IT industry.I have always wanted to work for a product company.I have a good command on C programming and a hint of JAVA. I wanted to get started with competitive programming in order to prepare for interviews of these companies. What should be the right path of preparation? Also do I need to learn C++ or JAVA or should I continue programming in C?
Your real aim is to prepare for an interview of a good company so it requires: 1. Good Knowledge of Data Structres like Linked lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash List etc. 2. Algorithms related to these data structures. (You should be able to apply these to any real world problems when asked at interview) 3. CS concepts like Big O time, Memory, etc. 4. They may ask you questions related to your past experience or the position that you are applying. To become good at anything you have to practice. Participating in online contests is a great way of learning Data structures and algorithms and developing logic, so start practising, starting with the easy problems. As you already know C you can start learning C++, as you should know atleast one Object Oriented language. So start practising problems in C++ as writing programs in a language is the best way to master it. That is as much for the first part. But only being good at online contests will not get you a job,(Kostadis Roussos' answer to Careers in Computer Programming: For a software engineer who doesn't find competitive programming interesting but would like to join one of the big tech companies (for example Google, Facebook or Microsoft) what options do I have? Is it still possible to land a job at one of those companies?) as you need to have clear CS concepts, so I would suggest you to start with online contests and also devote some time to brushing up on your CS concepts from college.
