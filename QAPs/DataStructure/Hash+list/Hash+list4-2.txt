Which is the best method or algorithm to compare two large lists of email addresses in a short time?
I would go with the hashing (no need for the lists to have the same size). I would hash all the email addresses in list A. Then for each address in list B, if it's hash is already present in the hash list obtained from the first list, I would output that email address. I am not a MAP-REDUCE expert but I guess you could obtain the hash list from list A using a map-reduce approach. Then you could distribute this hash list to all the nodes along with some part of list B, and compare hashed addresses from list B and output them if a match is found.
