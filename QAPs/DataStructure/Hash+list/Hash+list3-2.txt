What is the difference between Hash map, Hash tree and Hash table?Can you explain how their construction differ from each other with an example.
HashTable and HashMap are used interchangeably(synonyms of each other) .  For more clarity just refer  Hash table vs Hash list vs Hash tree? and How are Hash Trees useful? Hope it helps.
