Starting from a top level directory, how would you find files having the same content?
I have written a Java program which can find duplicate files from given list of directories. I will give you an overview of it. Recursively traverse through the directory. 1.) If it is a file, calculate hash (MD5) and add to a hash table and add the path. (key is MD5 hash, value is list holding the path of the files) 2.) Else check again. Print all the lists from the hash table. Delete unnecessary files if necessary! Pseudocode for the function: void duplicateFinder(File file){ .       .       if (file is a directory){ .           fileList = getFiles(); .           for (iterate over fileList) .                 duplicateFinder(nextFile); .       } .       else{ //Create a new list if it is not there. Removed to enhance the code clarity. .           hash = hash(file); .           list = get(hash); .           list.add(file.path); .           put(hash, list); .       } }           Warning: Don't mess with system files! Note: I'll post a github link to my code. It has some bugs. Also it is a single threaded application. Planning to add a thread pool. Do feel free to point out any errors or a better way to do it. And sorry for a bad pseudocode!
