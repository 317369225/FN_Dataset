How exactly were LinkedIn's password hashes compromised?See this article: http://translate.google.com/tran... I'm looking for how the hackers had access to LinkedIn's password hash data. That must mean some kind of data breach. How did that happen in the first place? What other data was compromised?
To illustrate the vulnerability of using unsalted hashes (let's ignore the flaws of SHA-1 for the moment), I matched the leak against the top 10,000 most common passwords on the internet and found that 93% of the eligible common passwords were revealed in the LinkedIn leak: http://www.johnvey.com/blog/2012... While there is a lot of snark on the internet about "at least one person knows what my LinkedIn login is now", the reality is that the real hacker has both email addresses and their corresponding passwords. Since a significant number of people use the same credentials in many places, the threat is that now other more sensitive sites can be accessed, thus leading to real theft.
