What is a good hash function to use given the following constraint: you have a list (of potentially hundreds of thousands of words), and, given a word, you have to find all other words that are an anagram of the given word?
Sort the word ignoring the case. This would make all anagrams have the same key. Use any polynomial hash function :) This might help too: https://sunilsavanur.wordpress.c...
