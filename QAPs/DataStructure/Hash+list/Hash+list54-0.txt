Which Stanford CS courses best prepare an undergraduate student for software engineering internship interviews at top companies such Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?I'm going into my sophomore year as a CS major
CS161 is your best bet for learning the algorithm heavy questions asked by the big companies that can really separate you from the average candidate. CS242 dives a fair bit into high level design decisions and trade-offs between Java and C++ and gives you a sense of Javascript scoping and how it came to be. Equally interesting and practical as it is useful for interviews. CS107, surprisingly enough, may be the best course to stay fresh with the common 'Write strstr in C' or '_____ and ____ this tree / linked-list / hash table' whiteboard coding questions. Honorable mentions to CS124 for giving a breadth-first coverage of naive bayes, crawling, regexes, and other interesting introductions to information retrieval, and also CS140 for drilling the core concepts of computer systems into your blood, because it's always nice to be able to have some reasonable answer to the question "What is virtual memory?" Also, if you've never used a database before, CS145 is a pretty foundational course, as storing data lies at the heart of every tech business these days. Editorial: Doing what you like in CS / software and proving you're passionate about it is probably the best way to make yourself look good to hot companies and also enjoy yourself at the same time. Don't try to prepare yourself for software engineering interviews, try to prepare yourself for software engineering.
