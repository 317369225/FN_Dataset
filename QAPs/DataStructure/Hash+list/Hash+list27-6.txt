Is MongoDB a good replacement for Memcached?
MongoDB can certainly be a replacement for Memcached but is it a "good replacement"? No. The pros and cons have all be listed in this thread but the main thing to bear in mind is that Memcached's stored data is not persistent and that's the way it should be - it's purely for caching so it's no big deal if you lose the data. Think of it as a bucket. It will store as much as it can handle but once it's full it will overflow to make room for more data. Usually first come, first out or if you allocate a TTL it will expire after x seconds automagically. If for whatever reason you need your DB or HTTP requests to be stored permanently then use MongoDB but you'd be killing a fly with a nuclear warhead.
