How does one verify data being transferred over a connection using hashes?
You can compute a hash over the entire file and over each chunk to determine either the correct transfer of each file or each chunk or both. I think the part you are missing is that each chunk can be sent with its own hash. That is usually how hash or error detection functions are used. So you don't need to send a hash from the master controller. Each peer transferring a chunk sends the hash for that chunk. If you want to verify the entire file when complete, then embed a hash for the entire file in the first or last chunk, in addition to that chunk's hash. List of hash functions
