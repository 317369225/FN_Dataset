How can I become a good programmer at online judges?I am currently working in Indian IT industry.I have always wanted to work for a product company.I have a good command on C programming and a hint of JAVA. I wanted to get started with competitive programming in order to prepare for interviews of these companies. What should be the right path of preparation? Also do I need to learn C++ or JAVA or should I continue programming in C?
Start solving problems on various sites like Codechef, SPOJ, Codeforces, Topcoder, Timus and USACO. Also learn about new algorithms and data structures but that should be on the fly, as and when you require a new algorithm or can't seem to come up with a solution for a problem. Start coding in C++ and learn the standard template library. You don't need to particularly learn Java. As you said you already know C, therefore, C++ is the right language to learn and get used to. Java is useful in competitve programming for some of its features like Hashmap or BigInteger or geometry library. The first however can be managed in C++11 using unordered_map. Try to get a hang of Java so that you can use BigInteger in questions. It proves to be very useful in questions involving large numbers. Or you can get acquainted with Python for that. All in all just get started with easy level questions on the online judges mentioned above and work your way out to the difficult problems. All the best!
