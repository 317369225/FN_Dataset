What are some good ways to use GeeksforGeeks i.e. what order one should follow while solving problems at GFG if he has only 2 months left?There are many topics like Algo,DS,Interview corner,C,C++,Java,Array,Bit magic,C/C++,Linked list,MCQ,Misc,Output,String,Tree,Graph.How should one start with this website.
Which company are you interviewing for in 2 months? Go to the interview section in GFG for that company and look at the questions asked(or you can see this in career cup). Based on that, plan your order. Spend more time on a topic which is asked more frequently by that company. I presume that you have basic knowledge in all the topics you have mentioned. If not, please do that first.
