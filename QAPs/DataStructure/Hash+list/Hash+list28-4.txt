How much does a web developer have to know about data structures and algorithms?
For frontend programming basic DS and algorithms would be enough like hashes, lists, trees, sorting would be more than sufficient. You won't be doing anything yourself mostly you would be using built-in language features and libraries. However understanding the fundamentals will make you a better decision maker while coding. For backend programming there is no limit. Depending upon how popular a website is complexity of the problems increases and all kind of advanted DSes and algorithms are used to scale the services. In some cases new DSes and algorithms are invented.
