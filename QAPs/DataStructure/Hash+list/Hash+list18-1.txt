Will Memcached be replaced by Redis in the near future?I see the latest stable version of Memcached was released on September 3, 2012. Memcached is awesome, but Redis is getting more features and more stable over time. What is the future of Memcached, will Redis takes Memcached's use cases?
I may be missing something but from everything I experienced you want to use Memcache for any volatile piece of STRING that you need to be delivered really fast. You will want to use Redis if you want to retain that information in storage. Get memcached, add support for more data types (hashes, lists, sets, etc), persistent storage, and a handful of cool features and you get Redis. Of course, those features don't come for free, so Redis will be slower than Memcached (although it is really fast). I think one weak point for Redis is clustering for really large datasets (dozens of gigabytes up). Memcache should be along side your web request-response cycle to make it return really fast snippets of HTML, and Redis should be on the back-end to avoid slower transaction-heavy and critical mission databases such as Postgres or even MongoDB.
