Is MongoDB a good replacement for Memcached?
Definetely a big YES. It's not only as good, it's much better. First - not storage limit. Memcache can use only the amount of ram you allocated to it while with Mongo it will use as much RAM as it can but in case it's not enough it will write to disk. So basically it keeps stuff in RAM if possible, otherwise uses disk. Second - you can use nested array or tags per cache entry - not possible with Memcache but possible with Mongo. Important thing is that those tags can be indexed. For example - put all cache entries that have to do with XML feed and group them with a tags [feed, xml] Then you can easily find all cache entries tagged xml or tagged feed or tagged both xml and feed. This is useful when you want to remove all entries that belong to certain group or multiple groups or "any group" And one more thing - memcache has a limit of 1 (or 2) Megabytes per entry, while MongoDB has 4MB per document (even 8MB in the very latest release), so you can store larger objects in cache.
