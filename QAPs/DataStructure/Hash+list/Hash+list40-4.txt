Why aren't skip lists used more often instead of balanced trees?"Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that seem likely to supplant balanced trees as the implementation method of choice for many applications. Skip list algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced trees and are simpler, faster and use less space."  (William Pugh, quoted on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski...)
It's probably mostly because they're less known, with fewer available libraries. People may also be slightly afraid of randomized algorithms in some contexts. There are at least some claims that skip lists can be better than trees for certain things. Some skip list implementations appear to perform very well under concurrency. This Stack Overflow answer has some interesting information about this: Skip List vs. Binary Tree. I have not fully evaluated all the information in the thread, but my initial impression is that, while skip lists may outperform some types of balanced trees under heavy concurrent modifications, it is mostly trees whose balancing algorithms are based on tree rotations that have concurrency problems. Trees that split and merge nodes, like B trees or B+ trees, should be a lot better than rotation-based trees in this regard. Updated 14 May 2014 • View Upvotes
