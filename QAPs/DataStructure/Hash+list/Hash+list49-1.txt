How can we create MySQL shards?
You ultimately do it with policy managed by your applications.  You can have MySQL shards at the schema/database level, the instance level, and the machine level - and we have all three - but this requires your apps to manage them correctly. One helpful piece of the shard world is to have a master lookup table that says that "foo is on db X on host instance Y".  The master lookup table itself should be on a well-known db instance that all your apps can get at.  (Ideally, it's also read on app startup and cached so it doesn't become a bottleneck, which it will be if it's accessed on every operation.) The best MySQL shard key is something that isn't often spanned, so you can minimize cross-shard operations.  Since we have a smallish (hundreds) of fairly large customers, the customer ID is a good shard key for us. If you want to do hash-style sharding of the NoSQL variety, this is harder to do as you'll want to avoid cross-instance joins in the vast majority of situations.
