What should I study for Google, Microsoft, Directi, Flipkart, and Amazon interviews a year from now?Right now i am working in a Service based company in india as SQL developer. I did my Engg from a third tier college. I have mediocre programming skills and I can spend 3-4 hours on weekdays and mostly 8-9 hours on weekends studying.
My friend suggested this e-book for me. Although i didnt have enough time to prepare for the interview I found this helpful. This book explains in-detail about Flipkart interview process. Its a compendium of sample interview questions, sample resumes of those who eventually got shortlisted by Flipkart. Hope this e-book helps you!! Interview Guide - Flipkart [E-Book]
