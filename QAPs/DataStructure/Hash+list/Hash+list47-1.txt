What is the simplest language with which to learn algorithms and data structures?
C may not be the simplest language to learn (because of the challenges of pointers and manual memory management), but I cannot stress how rewarding I have found using it to learn data structures. The language forces you to work with the very barebones of your machine. In C, you are responsible for effectively stitching together data structures from raw bytes of memory. If you are not careful, you could cause serious errors (so have a good debugging tool/environment handy). I think programming in C makes you appreciate your code far more. In the end, you develop a very thorough understanding of the data structures that you built, since there is pretty much no hand holding. It may not be easy, but it sure is effective. As Einstein said: "Any fool can know. The point is to understand."
