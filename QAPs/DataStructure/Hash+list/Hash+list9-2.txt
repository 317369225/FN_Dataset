What are good ways to store data in ram with any programming language? I want to use ram as a cache
By default data or even objects are stored in memory before usage. But because the memory is volatile, only data or objects which are needed immediately are stored in the memory. And the operating system manages your memory usage making sure some programs or apps don't overuse the memory....however, I don't think there's need to worry about this as most of what you will be needing will be stored in the memory for usage.... You can implement pointers in C++ which allows you direct access to memory locations...but even Other languages that basically use variables and references are implicitly pointing you to memory locations... but its not implemented like C++....
