What is a good hash function to use given the following constraint: you have a list (of potentially hundreds of thousands of words), and, given a word, you have to find all other words that are an anagram of the given word?
If you're just looking to have words that are anagrams of each other hash to the same value, a simple trick would be to normalize the words before hashing. For example, you could reorder all the letters in alphabetical order and hash that with a normal hash function. I'm sure you could take this idea and expand it out to a full solution. You could make the prime multiplication approach work by taking the value modulo the number of buckets you have.
