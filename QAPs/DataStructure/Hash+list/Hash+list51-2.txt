What are the best resources to prepare myself for Amazon Interview?I have got the call for Amazon Interview and I have 4-5 weeks to prepare.
Best resource is your computer science basics. Believe me, its nothing other than that... But I want to share my experience with Amazon process, exactly one year ago I got Amazon's offer, So I want to share my personal experience - "This answer is based on my personal experience. I work for Amazon and I do take interviews. Here is some of the things you should keep in mind while preparing for interviews or appearing for it (specially Amazon/Microsoft/Google I don't know about Flipkart) - 1. Stick to your basics of CS fundamentals 2. Focus on algorithms and data structures. And here also don't leave basics. There is no limit of questions but if your concept of basic data structures like trees, hash, link list, array etc are clear than you can solve any question. 3. Prepare from Programming Interview Questions | CareerCupandGeeksforGeeks - A computer science portal for geeks to take hints of questions and its patterns. 4. Don't mug up the answers otherwise you will fall if there is a small tweak in the question. 5. Don't run behind languages, interviews are not language specific but you should be good in at least one programming language. 7. Also focus on your personal attitude like - you should be a good team player, be clear and firm what you speak, have faith on your self, listen carefully, ask doubts if any and be polite. 6. Stay calm, focused and don't panic in the interview. Just chill a day before interview."
