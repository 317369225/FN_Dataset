What should I study for Google, Microsoft, Directi, Flipkart, and Amazon interviews a year from now?Right now i am working in a Service based company in india as SQL developer. I did my Engg from a third tier college. I have mediocre programming skills and I can spend 3-4 hours on weekdays and mostly 8-9 hours on weekends studying.
