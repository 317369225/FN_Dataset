What is the simplest language with which to learn algorithms and data structures?
I use Python for everything in real life, but I'm glad that I was taught data structures using C.  My data structures teacher made us implement all of the core data structures (hash table, linked list, binary search tree) for ourselves in C using structures and pointers.  I can't imagine understanding them nearly as well using a language like Python or Java where you're handed ready-made implementations to start with. For algorithms, yeah, Python is great.  But you should really implement all the fundamental data structures yourself, the way God intended for you to.
