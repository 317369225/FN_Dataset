Is MongoDB a good replacement for Memcached?
It's depends on task. TTL in memcached is not a feature, because you can not be sure, that after the selected period your data will be removed. So, it is just a low-limitation. If you will compare memcached and mongodb - you will find, that memcached is better. But if you need to have not only cache, or a big number concurrent connections - you need to think about sharding/clusterisation, moving some logic into the storage and so on. For one last highload project I prefered to use Redis. As for me - Redis is much more better then mongoDB (if you need a good and stable key-value storage with a good atomic featrures and internal working with some data structures, like hashes,lists, queues).
