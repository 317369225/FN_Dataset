What data structures should I know to become a great programmer?
I'm going to take a contrarian approach and tell you none of the data structures mentioned will help you be a great programmer. They are simply tools to be used. Knowing about them certainly comes in handy and can help you decide which is appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve at any particular moment but great programmers are people that solve problems regardless of the tools available to them. So I would learn about them, yes, but focus on exercising your critical thinking and problem solving skills. They will take you farther than knowledge of data structure will.
