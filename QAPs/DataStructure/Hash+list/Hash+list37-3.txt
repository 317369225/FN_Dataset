How can I become a good programmer at online judges?I am currently working in Indian IT industry.I have always wanted to work for a product company.I have a good command on C programming and a hint of JAVA. I wanted to get started with competitive programming in order to prepare for interviews of these companies. What should be the right path of preparation? Also do I need to learn C++ or JAVA or should I continue programming in C?
There are always two ways to become good at something, of which first is, becoming really good by practicing, and the other is by cheating. Emphasizing on first one, You should try until you get the green light. Its not important to solve the every question. But to be good, you should try and try the one in which you are getting TLE("Time Limit Exceeded"). Because that question can make you learn many new aspects of looking towards a problem. To solve any problem, you can search the algorithm/code if you don't get the question after reading few times, but I would strongly recommend you not to copy that code, just build it on your own. You should improve your algorithm knowledge by solving problems category wise. E.g. you can solve first some of the problems related to DP, then you can go for Graph algorithms, Tree based algorithm, etc. and this list goes on. For codes, you can search in GIT(Build software better, together). You will get many codes on that. You can also refer some blogs that explain the better approach for many problems. In programming competitions, main emphasis is on mathematics. You can practice that on Project Euler. You can refer some books/courses available online. How can I master in language C when i have got just 1 month in my hands and i know C at basic levels? Shreyans Doshi's answer to What are the best websites a programmer should visit?
