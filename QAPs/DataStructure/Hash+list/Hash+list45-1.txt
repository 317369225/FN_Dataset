What do you think of Why LinkedList became a famous data structure even though it is used very less in the programming world?We use Array /ArrayList , Hash Maps, Trees much more than LinkedList in normal day to day programming to solve real world problems. But Why LinkedList became a famous data structures in college courses and Job interviews?
"Used very less in the programming world", are you sure? ;) But either yes or not, LinkedList as a concept approach is a very versatile one compared to anothers, yet map easily with any relational or object database afaik. e.g., to make simple conditional question answer subsequent question thread: - "flag playing" (using traceable id to track answers and subsequent question) using hash map - easy traceable but very big tree (not necessary binary tree) - afaik, also "flag playing" (or may be it is me who need much to learn) - 2 simple linked list. ;)
