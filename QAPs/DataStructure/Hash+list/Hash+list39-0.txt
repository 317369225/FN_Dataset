What is the fastest way to remove duplicates from a list in Python?Both for cases where maintaining order matters and doesn't matter.
If order does not matter this will do what you want and should be optimally fast since all the work occurs in C: list(set(list_to_dedup)) Otherwise to preserve order: result = [] seen = set() for i in list_to_dedup: if i not in seen: result.append(i) seen.add(i) Alternatively, you could use the OrderedDict class found in Python 3.1: http://docs.python.org/dev/libra...
