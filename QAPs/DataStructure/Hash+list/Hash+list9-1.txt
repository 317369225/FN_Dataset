What are good ways to store data in ram with any programming language? I want to use ram as a cache
If you need an out of the box solution for this, you should definitely look into http://redis.io/ Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings,hashes, lists, setsand sorted sets. It has a very simple API and can be practically use with any language by using the custom libraries specific to tht platform.
