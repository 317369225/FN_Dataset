As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
PageRank and spectral graph algorithms (e.g. min cuts) are a great topic, though I'm not sure they're in your scope. Please don't remove Linear Programming; even though it might be out of place it's excellently written.
