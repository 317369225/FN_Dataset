Is MongoDB a good replacement for Memcached?
As per the other answers, the general answer is "no". If you've out-grown memcache (which isn't surprising, considering it was originally written in a weekend), there are quite a few elastically scalable, typically highly available, and generally high performance options for distributed caching, such as Oracle Coherence (one that I personally know well, since I worked for the company that created it), VMware's Gemfire, SoftwareAG's ehCache, etc. Some are open source, some commercial. All generally make memcache look like a toy. What memcache does have that is incredibly valuable is a fairly complete set of client drivers, which isn't surprising considering how simple it is (since it's completely client-driven, and doesn't have anything resembling clustering functionality). What you'll find is that many other distributed caching products support using these drivers to ease adoption, or at least expose RESTful interfaces so that any language can plug in easily. I still have a hard time believing that anyone uses memcache, but I suppose most people don't know any better.
