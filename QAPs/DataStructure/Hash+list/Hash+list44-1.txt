What should I study for Google, Microsoft, Directi, Flipkart, and Amazon interviews a year from now?Right now i am working in a Service based company in india as SQL developer. I did my Engg from a third tier college. I have mediocre programming skills and I can spend 3-4 hours on weekdays and mostly 8-9 hours on weekends studying.
1. Work on your basics. Revise Data Structures and Algorithms thoroughly. 2. As Arnab pointed out, checkout problems at GeeksforGeeks - A computer science portal for geeks . Try and code problems on paper first and then run it using a compiler. Most companies would ask you to follow this pattern. CareerCup is another good resource. 3. Read Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, not just for problems but for some really awesome interview tips. 4. Maintain a GitHub profile with your projects and open source contributions. This is really helpful as interviewers are able to judge you on what you have already done as a developer, apart from interview questions. 5. Compete in online problem solving competitions such as TopCoder, Codechef, Codeforces etc. 6. Prepare well on what you have been working on as there will be lot of questions from it.
