I found some topics missing in the book CLRS by Thomas Cormen, like cuckoo hashing, then from cuts and flows like the minimum cost problem, weighted matching, Hall's theorem and then something like skip lists. Wouldn't it be better if these topics were added to the book?
Sure, as long as we also included an algorithm to avoid the hernia you'd get from lifting the book. If we were to include all the topics that have been suggested to this point: We would not be able to finish updating the book by the time I die. But if I live long enough that we can finish updating the book, it would have to be several large volumes.I did ask for suggestions of what to add to our next edition (As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?), but notice that I specifically requested that "if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove."
