How can I become a good programmer at online judges?I am currently working in Indian IT industry.I have always wanted to work for a product company.I have a good command on C programming and a hint of JAVA. I wanted to get started with competitive programming in order to prepare for interviews of these companies. What should be the right path of preparation? Also do I need to learn C++ or JAVA or should I continue programming in C?
I believe that there is not shortcut to become expert in programming. Following points may be helpful Reading some good books like Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS, Algorithm Design Manual by Skena. Follow TopCodes [Algorithm Tutorials] tutorials.
