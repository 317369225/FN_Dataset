Redis vs Memcached: which one should I use for a web-based application?I'm starting on a project and I'm considering choosing between Redis and Memchached for caching purposes, and I wasn't sure which one would be better. I have a feeling that Memchached is faster than Redis (not entirely sure), but Redis allows me to run code against it in Python as opposed to C++. Does Memchached also have this feature? If not, then is there any reason why I should one over the other?
Redis is much more than a cache supporting all sorts of nifty data structures (lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, pub/sub messaging, etc) whereas memcached is a simple key-value store.Â  Both are accessible from pretty much any programming language you'd chose. I'd choose Redis -- even if you're not planning on using it for more than a key/value store initially, having it in your stack when you want to use one of the more advanced features is a very good option.
