What is the simplest language with which to learn algorithms and data structures?
C. Considering that most operating systems trace their roots to C, it is a good language to learn data structures and algorithms. It is a low level language with few basic constructs to master and the language itself doesn't come in the way of learning algorithms or data structures.
