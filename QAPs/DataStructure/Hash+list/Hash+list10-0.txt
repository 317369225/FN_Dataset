Did Twitter migrate from Memcached to Redis for its timeline storage? Why?
Yes, because deep structural awareness in the storage layer (ziplists vs. blobs) allowed for more flexible feature development. Everything else is effectively the same. I believe the move is complete although I don't work there anymore.
