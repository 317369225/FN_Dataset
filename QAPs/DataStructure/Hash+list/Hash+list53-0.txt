What uses are there for Skip Lists?I've recently been trying to choose a data structure to implement an internal dictionary/index for a project I'm working on. I've read all about Skip lists, Hashtable implementations etc. and can't figure out where a Skip List would be a good choice. Seeing as you can easily use Hashtables at an efficiency of O(1), why use Skip Lists, who'se best performance is O(logN)?
Skiplists are ordered like binary search trees and hence are much more similiar to BSTs than to hash tables.  You'd prefer skiplists over hash tables for the same reason that you'd prefer BSTs over hash tables. Skip lists will let you traverse a collection in order, quickly find minimum/maximum elements, they can find the next item in after a given element in order quickly, etc.  A better question might be "why should I use skip lists over binary search trees?"
