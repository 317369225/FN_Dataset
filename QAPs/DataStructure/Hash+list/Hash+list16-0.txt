What is a "good" hash function to store a list of "k" words (and later to check if given word is present in the original list or not)?Assuming that I have a list of "k" words e.g. {cat, dog, then, hen, end, ...} and I want to store their hash so that later I should be able to check if given string <xyz> is already present in the list or not. What hash function would be useful in this case? Also, in general, how to go for selecting a "good" hash function?
Well that's the thing for hash functions. There isn't a perfect hash function. However for strings you could do something like this int s = 0; for( int i = 0 ; i < strlen(str) ; i++ ) {     s=s*31+s[i]; } The main idea behind a hash is to create a function that would create a unique value for every string, which is extremely hard as you might already know
