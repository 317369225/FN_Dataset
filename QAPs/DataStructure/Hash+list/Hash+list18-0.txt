Will Memcached be replaced by Redis in the near future?I see the latest stable version of Memcached was released on September 3, 2012. Memcached is awesome, but Redis is getting more features and more stable over time. What is the future of Memcached, will Redis takes Memcached's use cases?
I have been witnessing sustained demand for the simplicity of memcached combined with dynamic scalability and high availability, which is one of the reasons that we added support for the memcache protocol to Oracle Coherence, letting companies drop in Coherence as a replacement for memcached, and picking up a ton of valuable capabilities (including automatic HA and dynamic scaling) in the process.
