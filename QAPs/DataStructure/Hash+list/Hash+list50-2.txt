Originally Answered: How do you implement hashtags?We can use a hash table with chaining implementation. We can store all hash tags as keys and the links corresponding to it as chains (linked list). To insert a link in an hash tag we can insert in the front of the linked list(which is recent). To query for a hash tag we can do it in O(1) and can retrieve the related links as required. Another idea: for measuring popularity maintain both hash table and linked list (hash for fast searching and linked list for popularity) instead of maintain only in hash table you can use linked list of linked lists. idea : the popularity of hash tag can increase by 1 in computer science term at a time (although it can increase by 1000s in 1 sec). so as a link gets added to an hash tag we can move it up the linked list if its upper one is of less popularity. so the linked list of hash tags will be sorted every time. hence we can query popular hash tags and links related to hash tags in optimal possible time.
