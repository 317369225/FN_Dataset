Why doesn't C also provide default implementations for linked lists, trees, hash tables, sorting, etc. like Java does?
Lists, trees, hash tables, sorting. Those are all simple constructs. Both in their data structure and in their implementation. The unquestionable "standard operations" on a linked list can be implemented in less than a page of code. Here, for example: src/sys/sys/queue.h - annotate - 1.68 In less than 850 raw lines [the first 100 of which are commentary] the complete implementations of: singly-linked lists lists simple queues tail queues circular queuesSo in some 750 SLOC, nicely whitespaced, you've got five different data structures to play with. Complete with debugging aids, even!
