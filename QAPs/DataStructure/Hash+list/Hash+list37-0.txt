How can I become a good programmer at online judges?I am currently working in Indian IT industry.I have always wanted to work for a product company.I have a good command on C programming and a hint of JAVA. I wanted to get started with competitive programming in order to prepare for interviews of these companies. What should be the right path of preparation? Also do I need to learn C++ or JAVA or should I continue programming in C?
Step 1 is reading Quora topic on competitive programming. This question has already been asked a hundred times and answered a thousand times, and I'm a strong believer in using existing answers before asking for new identical ones. This habit will also help you in industry work, unlike some of competitive habits :-)
