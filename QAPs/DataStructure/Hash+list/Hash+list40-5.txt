Why aren't skip lists used more often instead of balanced trees?"Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that seem likely to supplant balanced trees as the implementation method of choice for many applications. Skip list algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced trees and are simpler, faster and use less space."Â  (William Pugh, quoted on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski...)
I personally think it is simply a matter of novelty. Balanced trees have been around since the dawn ages of computing, which means guys like me had at least a quick mention of something like an AVL tree back in the punchcard days. Skip lists are pretty recent, and probably didn't start getting any real attention until perhaps 15 years ago. And while they are arguably more efficient than balanced trees, they aren't that much more efficient - they have the same asymptotic behavior. Check back in 20 years and you might see a change.
