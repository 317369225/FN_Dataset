What is the most difficult question you ever faced in C programming language?
Though not tough question but some C questions need hands on before we answer them properly. 1) Bit width field Union/Structures and Endianess Impact , Structure Padding, structure offset, containerof macro 2) 2D-3D array dynamic allocation, 3) "volatile" keyword and its usages 4) macro expansion, typedef 5) Callbacks(Function  Pointers) Implementations. 6) C Function Calling Convention 7) Inline assembly (Very rarely asked) 8) OS Specific C Questions Like System Calls, C Program and Cache Memory, Interrupt Handling, Process 9) Data Structure too but Data Structure is  not only confined to  C. BST, Hashing, List(Singly and Doubly). 10) Bit-wise operator and Its impact (underlying architecture based)
