Is it a breach of the Apple developers agreement to give an ad-network a list of MDF hashed UDIDs?that installed my app in a set time period; to help track installs where I wasn't integrated with their API/SDK.
Not a breach of Apple Developers agreement as utilizing UDID's is open for all developers. A hashed list wouldn't manipulate privacy, information, or data that would cause alert to Apple App reviewers. Especially as an owner of an application, you are able to share and utilize UDID information to help optimize your product. But with UDID's being deprecated on iOS5, there will only be a short amount of time where you can utilize this method as a means of tracking.
