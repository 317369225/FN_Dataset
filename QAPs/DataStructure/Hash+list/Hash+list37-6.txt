How can I become a good programmer at online judges?I am currently working in Indian IT industry.I have always wanted to work for a product company.I have a good command on C programming and a hint of JAVA. I wanted to get started with competitive programming in order to prepare for interviews of these companies. What should be the right path of preparation? Also do I need to learn C++ or JAVA or should I continue programming in C?
C Would be enough, catch any of the product in Open-Source that will maintain the instincts in C-Programming. Also search for Linux Kernel Programming, that also would be good go for starting up.
