Is MongoDB a good replacement for Memcached?
No. Storage systems are generally not good drop-in replacements for distributed caches. Properly tuned, with all data in memory, a storage system may be just a little slower than memcached, but the real question is, what happens when data exceeds memory? In this case the cache discards unused items, retaining constant performance; the storage system gets slower and slower, which is exactly the wrong behavior for something whose sole purpose is to increase performance. Basically disk performance is highly non-linear as a function of data, and you don't want that kind of complexity unless you absolutely must have it. The second issue is the consistency between the two systems. Caches have a great way of restoring consistency in a pinch: restart the cache servers. There is one exception to this, which is when your primary storage is really fucked performance-wise, so that if your cache is ever empty you can't survive. In this case, it is possible that a persistent cache is worth the trouble. A better solution might be to consider fixing your primary storage system, though.
