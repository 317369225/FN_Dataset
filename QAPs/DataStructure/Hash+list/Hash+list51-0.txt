What are the best resources to prepare myself for Amazon Interview?I have got the call for Amazon Interview and I have 4-5 weeks to prepare.
What position is your interview for. SDE 1, internship? Well either way the process is very similar. You will get betweens 1-3 calls in which each will have between 1-2 programming and math questions. Usually people ask the same questions to both SDE 1 and internship candidates, but they change how specific they want the answers.Â  The way that I prepared for my interviews is by reading most of Programming Interviews Exposed. This helps get all the data structures down, and also talk a lot about what they are looking for with interviews. You have to be ready to tell about a project that you have worked on. I think what's important here is that you can remember how you worked on a team, that it was challenging, and that hopefully you worked on it outside of school. You really want your project to show who you are as a programmer and what drives you. Every Amazon interview I have had asked me this question. Now something huge is can you code without the used a an IDE and remember all of the functions related to a specific data structure. Can you remember all of the language defaults, if you are using c you better use snake case, and if you are using java use camelCase. This doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but since someone will be reading your code it better be pretty, this is a easy way to achieve this. Work in the lanauge you are most conforterable in, but if possible use java, c++, or ruby. This is becasue most of Amazon uses these three languages and it's always positive to use the language that they use. Hope this helps, good luck.
