Which database should I use for a killer web application: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL?I'm working on killer web application, and I am really interested and worked with MongoDB. Is it a choice to choose MongoDB as a premier database? Or Is it better to use MySQL (with MongoDB/Redis as secondary)?
Originally Answered: Does it make sense to use MongoDB instead of MySQL as the main database for a website?These are some of the questions you should be asking yourself when making this decision: 1) Will it be more convenient to store your data in a traditional RDMBS format, or in MongoDB's more flexible document store formet? 2) Do you care about strict isolation of database transactions? 3) How big is your data going to get?  If the answer is "very large" could MongoDB's easy support for replication/sharding be helpful to you? 4) What language/framework are you developing your application in?  Does it have good support for MongoDB (almost everything should have good support for MySQL) 5) Are you going to want to do joins at the datastore level (or have the datastore enforce foreign key constraints)?  MongoDB doesn't support this (because joins are generally a bad idea anyways if you have large scaling needs) 6) What is your level of risk tolerance?  You are more likely to run into bugs or other unexpected problems with MongoDB as it is much much newer (that being said, the 10gen team is awesome at fixing things fast when people run into problems)
