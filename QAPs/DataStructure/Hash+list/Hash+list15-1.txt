How exactly were LinkedIn's password hashes compromised?See this article: http://translate.google.com/tran... I'm looking for how the hackers had access to LinkedIn's password hash data. That must mean some kind of data breach. How did that happen in the first place? What other data was compromised?
Originally Answered: How did Linkedin passwords get leaked?As per this Wired article[1], they were allegedly stolen by a hacker who hacked into the system and then leaked them online for help from others to crack it. LinkedIn is investigating claims by a Russian hacker that he broke into  the company’s network and stole nearly 4.5 million password hashes for  user accounts, according to a Twitter message the company sent out on  Wednesday.
