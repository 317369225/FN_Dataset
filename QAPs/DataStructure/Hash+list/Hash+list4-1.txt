Which is the best method or algorithm to compare two large lists of email addresses in a short time?
Are the two lists equal ? If so, then use the counter method (hash the email addresses) O(n) Else, use the sorting method (as in sort it and compare) O(nlogn) The above methods work well in python You could also go about the naive way of comparing each email address O(n^2) Personally, hashing and counter/sorting is the way to go. Also, if you want to go about with the naive approach, then take a look at Bloom Filters. If you have a large number of null intersections, the Bloom filter can help you eliminate those quickly. You'll still have to resort to one of the other algorithms mentioned here to compute the actual intersection. Hope this helps :)
