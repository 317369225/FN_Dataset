How can I become a good programmer at online judges?I am currently working in Indian IT industry.I have always wanted to work for a product company.I have a good command on C programming and a hint of JAVA. I wanted to get started with competitive programming in order to prepare for interviews of these companies. What should be the right path of preparation? Also do I need to learn C++ or JAVA or should I continue programming in C?
Hi Varun, C programming is the basic logic building programming language. As you have mentioned that you have good command over C programming then i don't think so that you will find any difficulty to learn C++ or JAVA. But points to remember while learning JAVA, that JAVA is purely Object oriented language whereas C is proceduralÂ  language. So accordingly you have to command object oriented programming concepts. This is about what you have asked in the end of your question. And for your interview preparation I would suggest HackerRank Stack Overflow. There are many places like both but i found HackerRank & Stack Overflow helpful to get prepare for interview by asking or providing different type of programming concepts. Thank You!!
