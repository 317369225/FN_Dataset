What are some good ways to use GeeksforGeeks i.e. what order one should follow while solving problems at GFG if he has only 2 months left?There are many topics like Algo,DS,Interview corner,C,C++,Java,Array,Bit magic,C/C++,Linked list,MCQ,Misc,Output,String,Tree,Graph.How should one start with this website.
For a guy which has just started reading vociferously about programming and paradigms, basically a starter, geeks provide me a number of ways to learn about the different questions and given enough time I ponder at the origin of these questions and the probable time when someone unfortunate guy might had to solve it for the very first time. I pick up a question , catregorize it and then spend time on that category and then come back to solve it
