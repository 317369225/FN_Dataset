Is there a complete list of everything a C programmer would need to know, like arrays, threading theory, pointers, etc.?
No one should know everything. You just have to know what you need in your work. If someday something happened and you need something you don't know, go and search the web and find out about it. What you ask means people go and memorize the whole dictionaries to learn english. NO they don't. They first learn hello, how are you, what's your name & etc. Then people go find out about what they need to use in causal day life like taking a cab, order in restaurants, ask for direction & etc. Not everyone need to know name of all tropical fruits or name of flowers that only grow on certain areas.There are many english words that native american don't know. But they keep learning when they need to use them. Don't fill your mind with these pointless questions, because there are lots of things in C or any other languages or frameworks. Because it's scary to think about all of them and you may think it's hard to be master in it. So you won't start learning at all. Just try to do simple stuff, then harder ones. Once you wanted to do something you don't know how to do it. Search it or ask a question in Stack Overflow. I find it annoying when people asking about which books to buy to learn a language and they want to read it from the first page. It's not the right way. As i said, it's like opening a dictionary and read from A to Z to learn english.
