Which Stanford CS courses best prepare an undergraduate student for software engineering internship interviews at top companies such Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?I'm going into my sophomore year as a CS major
I started listing various 1xx courses, but the list grew too big too quickly, so upon further reflection I will limit it to 3 courses that I think will give you the best generalist skill set at your stage (I'm assuming you're done with CS106/107/108): CS161 (gotta know your algorithms) CS140 (group project + a hard systems course) CS147 (product and design are more important than ever)
