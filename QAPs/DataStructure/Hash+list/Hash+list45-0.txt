What do you think of Why LinkedList became a famous data structure even though it is used very less in the programming world?We use Array /ArrayList , Hash Maps, Trees much more than LinkedList in normal day to day programming to solve real world problems. But Why LinkedList became a famous data structures in college courses and Job interviews?
In order to create and use other complex data structures you need to know how to make & use a link list. They either have linked lists embedded in them some where (array lists, skip list, hash maps) or they are improvisation over linked lists like trees. The idea is to learn about pointer operations and dynamic data storage. Its like you don't often use a single straight line in a drawing but you need to learn how to make it as the drawing is composed of straight lines(& curves). Updated 9 Oct 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
