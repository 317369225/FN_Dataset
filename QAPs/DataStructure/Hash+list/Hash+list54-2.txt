Which Stanford CS courses best prepare an undergraduate student for software engineering internship interviews at top companies such Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?I'm going into my sophomore year as a CS major
I'd also like to put a plug in for CS108: Object-Oriented Systems Design. In this class you learn advanced industry-level Java, source control using Subversion, and software engineering concepts. The final group project - where you build a quiz-sharing social networking website - was my first experience in writing code with a group of peers. It's because of what I learned in CS 108 that I got an internship at Yahoo for the summer.
