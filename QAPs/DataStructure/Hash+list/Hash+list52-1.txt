I have always loved using GeeksforGeeks just because of the fact that for each problem all kinds of solutions are present. They basically show you how to approach a problem and how you would optimize moving forward. It is the exact same approach any interviewer would expect from you. As to how you can use it, take a question try it yourself first. You would find some solutions to it and start comparing those with the solutions there. Even while comparing do not directly look at the code. Look at the approach and try to code that yourself. This would help mainly cause some ways shown there in the code are also optimized. About the topics, I would say try everything. You are not going to lose anything learning new so you need not bother too much about which category to go about. If you are looking for interviews in the last minute just try out strings, arrays, hashing, linked list and such standard questions. Another way would be go to career cup look at the questions and you would find answers to a lot of them in GeeksforGeeks.
