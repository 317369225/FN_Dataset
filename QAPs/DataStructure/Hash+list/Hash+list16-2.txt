What is a "good" hash function to store a list of "k" words (and later to check if given word is present in the original list or not)?Assuming that I have a list of "k" words e.g. {cat, dog, then, hen, end, ...} and I want to store their hash so that later I should be able to check if given string <xyz> is already present in the list or not. What hash function would be useful in this case? Also, in general, how to go for selecting a "good" hash function?
