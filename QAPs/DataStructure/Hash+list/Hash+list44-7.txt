What should I study for Google, Microsoft, Directi, Flipkart, and Amazon interviews a year from now?Right now i am working in a Service based company in india as SQL developer. I did my Engg from a third tier college. I have mediocre programming skills and I can spend 3-4 hours on weekdays and mostly 8-9 hours on weekends studying.

Apart from the study materials mentioned in the rest of the answers, check out: Geeks@i-pupil They have amazing in-depth videos. Particularly useful if you want to prepare quickly.
