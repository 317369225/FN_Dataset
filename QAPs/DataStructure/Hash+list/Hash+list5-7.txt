Redis vs Memcached: which one should I use for a web-based application?I'm starting on a project and I'm considering choosing between Redis and Memchached for caching purposes, and I wasn't sure which one would be better. I have a feeling that Memchached is faster than Redis (not entirely sure), but Redis allows me to run code against it in Python as opposed to C++. Does Memchached also have this feature? If not, then is there any reason why I should one over the other?
