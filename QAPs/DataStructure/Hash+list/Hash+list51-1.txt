What are the best resources to prepare myself for Amazon Interview?I have got the call for Amazon Interview and I have 4-5 weeks to prepare.
My interview with Amazon was for the internship but here they are: GeeksforGeeks - A computer science portal for geeks This is a site where you can find many algorithms with explanations and code. Also there is the interview section that you can look into; it has Amazon interview experience too! Crack the Coding Interview This is a pretty useful book in terms of organizing your cs knowledge in an interview-oriented way. It also helps to develop problem solving skills that you want to apply to the interview. Textbooks I used my textbooks and notes for the algorithm and data structure courses I took. Those deserve a review since the fundamentals are really important. Resume I recommend having a deep understanding on some of the projects you have done, especially the one you listed (in detail) on your resume. Don't just think, say it aloud (I probably stole this idea from the book and the discussions I had with my friends, but you got the idea :) A lot of people are used to thinking silently. At least that's the case with me for the most of the time. But in the interview it is important that you talk to your interviewer as you think. Take a look at the big picture and propose your first-sight approach. Then try to break down the problem into smaller pieces and bring out the related concepts on top of your head (like the time/space complexity of the data structure, even though the problem might be much more complicated). Don't keep a dead silence just because you are not sure of the final answer. Your interviewer would not know what's in your mind unless you talk. Like I said my interview was for the internship so the full-time ones can have more rounds and more comprehensive questions. Still, I hope this helps and GOOD LUCK! :D
