What should I study for Google, Microsoft, Directi, Flipkart, and Amazon interviews a year from now?Right now i am working in a Service based company in india as SQL developer. I did my Engg from a third tier college. I have mediocre programming skills and I can spend 3-4 hours on weekdays and mostly 8-9 hours on weekends studying.
Easiest 40% of Introduction to Algorithm by Cormen is more than enough. Capability to understand a dynamic problem question and ability to put the algorithm on paper will take you through 20% of the interview, and if you can do that you will also be able to go through the easier 30%. Last 50% is mostly your luck and how presentable you are and in what mood your interviewer is and if you know how to crack interviews.
