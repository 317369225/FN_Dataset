Redis vs Memcached: which one should I use for a web-based application?I'm starting on a project and I'm considering choosing between Redis and Memchached for caching purposes, and I wasn't sure which one would be better. I have a feeling that Memchached is faster than Redis (not entirely sure), but Redis allows me to run code against it in Python as opposed to C++. Does Memchached also have this feature? If not, then is there any reason why I should one over the other?
It depends on your latency/throughput requirements and your use case. Could you please be more specific about these? If you need persistence then Redis is better because memcached does not have it. If you need speed, but don't need server side scripting then Memcached is better. If you need both then try Tarantool.
