How exactly were LinkedIn's password hashes compromised?See this article: http://translate.google.com/tran... I'm looking for how the hackers had access to LinkedIn's password hash data. That must mean some kind of data breach. How did that happen in the first place? What other data was compromised?
Not a lot on the hows, but it can be done in two (not very) different ways. If you can obtain the password hashes of an organization, you go about creating a word list specific to that organization. You scrape language specific dictionaries, lists with names, you scrape their web site, everything written within that org. and then you hybrid dictionary attack the hashes You use rainbow tables. A very large database containing every possible combination or characters is created on beforehand. Every character combination is hashed using the correct algorithm on beforehand. The cracking of the obtained password hashes is then just a matter of looking up the hash in the table. Rainbow tables takes time to create
