What are the different branches of mathematics, and what type of problems are they designed to solve?
Graph theory is an interesting field and was one of the most difficult courses I have ever taken. In the class that I was in, it was very proof heavy and was pretty tough as I learned to prove theorems with induction, directly, contradiction and contraposition. Graph theory is really a branch that is nothing like your conventional math class as you'll find yourself connecting multiple dots together, discovering very interesting relationships. Here is the seven bridges of konigsberg problem that deals with Graph theory. The problem is to find a walk that that crosses each bridge once and once only. Euler proved it to not be possible. Here it is in a graphical sense. Each vertex represents a section of land and the edges represent the bridges to other sections of land. Basically Euler showed that you need to have a return route after you leave a vertex, so that means that there need to be an even number of edges coming out of a vertex if you want to guarantee a return route for each route from a vertex. This isn't the best explanation of the proof, but in general that is what he proved. Graph theory is truly an interesting field that has some really cool applications.
