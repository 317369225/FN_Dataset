How do I study Indian Economy by Ramesh Singh (6th edition) effectively for the Civil Services Examination 2014 (prelims) as I have only 40 days left?
​ Go for Indian Economy by SANJEEV VARMA ... I attended his classes. He was awesome. Unfortunately he's no more  :( Along with that read economic survey and newspapers.
