What are the different branches of mathematics, and what type of problems are they designed to solve?
Well, very shortly: Statistics (Is this really even a branch of math? More like an industry obsession.) Applied Math (Again, is this really math? Just a bunch of differential equations nobody cares about.) Algebraic Topology (Study of shapes.) Set Theory (Study of collections of things. It's a much weirder topic than it sounds, and it has to do with different sizes of infinities.) Logic (Things like: when can you prove something? It's fun, but whacky, and feels like Set Theory) Riemannian, or sometimes Symplectic, Geometry (Study of shapes, where you also measure how close points are, and not just whether different points are close to one another. Sounds confusing? That's probably because you've never read the definition of a topological space!) Combinatorics (The study of counting stuff. It's way more difficult than it sounds, but the caveat is that the theory is not very beautiful, and it's mostly a hodgepodge of tricks) And finally the two most important topics: Number Theory (Study of prime numbers. This subjects is way more amazing than it sounds. It's the origin of "abstract algebra", and some of the most amazing math on the planet.) And... (drum roll) Algebraic Geometry (More or less the theory of everything in math. While it started as just the study of solutions of several polynomial equations in several variables, it became so abstract over time that it encompasses even number theory. The ideas in Algebraic Geometry, and in Number Theory, together are the most advanced, and beautiful, and complicated, theories that humanity has ever come up with. They make Einstein's relativity theory seem quaint and naive. It's a real sight to see...) That's pretty much, in terms of math that's worth pursuing.
