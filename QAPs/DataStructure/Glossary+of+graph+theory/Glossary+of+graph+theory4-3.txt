How reliable is the 100 point scoring system for choosing wine?
The scoring system is only as good as the reviewer, and how well you agree with the styles they like. For example, Robert Parker (who is credited with starting the rating system) likes a certain style of wine. His favorites appear to be "over the top" higher alcohol wines. If you like that style, then you'll like his ratings. But, if you like lighter styles (Pinot Noir for example), then his ratings  probably won't match up with what you expect from a good Pinot Noir. Maybe there is a reason he doesn't rate Burgundy.  Best bet...try many different wines, and determine what you like. If you find a critic that agrees with most of your choices, then stick with that critic's recommendations. I for one, try most anything. Too many good wines are missed because they either were never rated, or rated poorly by some so-called "expert".
