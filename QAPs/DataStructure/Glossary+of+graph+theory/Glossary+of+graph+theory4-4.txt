How reliable is the 100 point scoring system for choosing wine?
The "who is giving" the score is very important. Different reviewers have their own slightly personal scale. That being said, it can be very useful to use a consistant reviewer in making purchasing decisions. If, for example, you are trying at the store to choose which of six 2007 Cote du Rhones to buy at a similar price, and you look them all up on erobertparker.com -- then the relative score is very useful. I have a seasoned palette, and buy and drink hundreds of bottles every year -- but I find my purchasing to be at a higher level when I am score and review conscious. There are exceptions. I use score a lot less when buying Burgundies, because they are so personal. There you have to know the Terroir and the producers. Point/$ ratio can also be useful (again use the same reviewer). As the score/quality of a wine rises, so does the price. If I see a Parker 94 for $29, I'm going to say, "Wow, that's a great deal." Don't take the ratings posted by wine stores at face value. Many retailers switch and swap reviewers, and even years. They may sneak in a good review from a lesser known reviewer in there with some others from WS or WA, or they may post the score/review of a DIFFERENT vintage. Always check. An iPhone, decent signal, and online review accounts help.
