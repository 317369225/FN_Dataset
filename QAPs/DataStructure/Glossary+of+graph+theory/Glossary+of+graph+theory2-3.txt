What are the different branches of mathematics, and what type of problems are they designed to solve?
Graph Theory is interesting because many of the proofs do not necessarily follow traditional strategies but require a bit of creativity. e.g.: For a travelling salesman who must travel different distances between points which are themselves different distances from each other, how can one determine the most efficient route i.e. that route that requires the least total distance travelled, in order to visit each location.  This problem is as yet unsolved except that honeybees seem to have solved it in their quest for flowers.   Combinatorics is the science of counting.  Sounds simple doesn't it?  However this is deceptive. A simple example is a lottery where the grand prize involves correctly selecting seven numbers out of 49, while a prize of 1000 dollars requires selecting only five of the winning numbers.  How many different 1000 dollar winners are there potentially?   Applied Algebra techniques can tell you what the last two digits are of a number x, raised to a power y, all raised to the power of x.  It is also used in cryptography, as is number theory.  Actually, number theorists were perversely proud of the lack of practical application of their discipline until it became useful for creating crypto keys that resisted any brute-force analysis, and as such were insoluble in any time frame smaller than the age of the universe.   Calculus is probably the most important discipline as it is applied to physics, chemistry, and engineering.
