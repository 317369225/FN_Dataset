How do I study Indian Economy by Ramesh Singh (6th edition) effectively for the Civil Services Examination 2014 (prelims) as I have only 40 days left?
You can't finish ramesh singh,better you read indian economy by sanjiv varma,very good book.Â  You can finish in 2days max, it is cost you around 150 INR. Really it is worth and author teaches in vajiram. All the best
