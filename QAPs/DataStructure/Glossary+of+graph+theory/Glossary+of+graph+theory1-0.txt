Do non-CS guys understand the meaning of "graph" in Facebook's Graph Search?
"The graphs (mathematical curves) we used to draw on graph papers in high school" are graphs of functions. A graph in Mathematics is: Informally, a graph is a finite set of dots called vertices (or nodes) connected by links called edges (or arcs). More formally: a simple graph is a (usually finite) set of vertices V and set of unordered pairs of distinct elements of V called edges. The name "Graph Search" refers to the social graph nature of Facebook, which maps the relationships among users. I assume that the average Facebook user would not know of this, although many non-CS guys would. Sources: Graph Theory Glossary Facebook Graph Search
