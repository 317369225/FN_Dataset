What's a complete list of topics/a complete syllabus to fully learn computer programming from scratch?
Howdy! It depends on your background and goals. If it's a career change, you should indeed focus on the fundamentals. Things like data structures and basic algorithms. Udacity is a good place to start, as is Coursera and Edx. If you can, get a job doing Quality Assurance. It can be more routine, mundane work, but it's in software and you can see code up close. Also, always be coding. ALWAYS BE CODING. Computer Science is the theoretical, programming is the handicraft. Like anything that requires a certain excellence, you have to practice constantly.
