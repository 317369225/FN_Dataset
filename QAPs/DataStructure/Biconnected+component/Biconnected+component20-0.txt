What are some basic level questions on disjoint sets?
Thanks for the A2A. The below mentioned links may be useful for you to understand the concepts of disjoint sets. Page on berkeley.edu Disjoint sets data structures and binomial trees? There exists some practical examples of disjoint sets like Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees . The other possible applications of disjoint sets are: Maze generation (using a modified Kruskal's algorithm) Tarjan's off-line least common ancestors algorithm Connected component labeling Online maintenance of biconnected components Validation Hindleyâ€“Milner rules Computing the winner of Havannah board game (see Efficient Playouts for the Havannah Abstract Board Game) Used in construction of contour trees (see Laying the Foundations for an Advanced Visualization System in O'Caml and Multi-Resolution computation and presentation of Contour Trees) Hope it will help you.
