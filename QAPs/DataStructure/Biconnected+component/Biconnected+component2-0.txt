How can we find those points which are forming a cycle in a graph?
A vertex is part of some simple cycle in an undirected graph iff it is part of some biconnected component of size greater than 1. First, some definitions: A biconnected graph is a graph which does not become disconnected on the removal of any vertex. A biconnected component of a graph is a maximal biconnected subgraph. That is, the subgraph should be biconnected and should lose the biconnectedness property if any other subset of vertices is added to it. An articulation point is a vertex in a connected graph, the removal of which disconnects the graph. Consider a vertex which is part of some biconnected component of size >1. The only way that such a component is biconnected is if there are at least two edge disjoint paths from the vertex to every other vertex in the component. This means that the vertex is part of some simple cycle. The converse is easy to see as well. That is, a vertex is part of a cycle iff it is part of some biconnected component with size>1. Now, biconnected components are linked with articulation points. Articulation points of a graph divide the graph into biconnected components. The algorithm (Hopcroft & Tarjan) for detecting articulation points has been described in the wikipedia page. This can be modified to actually output the biconnected components pretty easily. See an implementation here.
