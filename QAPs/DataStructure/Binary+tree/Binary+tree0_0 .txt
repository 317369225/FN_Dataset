Height of binary tree?is there a formula that returns the height of a binary tree given the number of nodes?? Say if I have 16 nodes then the height would be the length of the longest branch. eg: n = 16 then the longest branch has length 4You can find a lower bound for the height. A tree with a height (or depth) of has at most nodes. Thus, if you have nodes, The upper bound is, of course , which is just a linear tree.
