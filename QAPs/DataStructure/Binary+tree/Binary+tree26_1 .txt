What are binary trees and how can I practice implementing them in Python?Definition 1. A binary tree is a solution of the functor equation T=A+TT Definition 2. A binary tree is either a node (container of a value of type A) or a pair of binary trees. Definition 3. A binary tree is a data structure consisting of nodes having values and branches; a node has up to two branches (which are binary trees too), and a value. Regarding the other question, you can always google the answer, and/or find it on stackoverflow (which I recommend).
