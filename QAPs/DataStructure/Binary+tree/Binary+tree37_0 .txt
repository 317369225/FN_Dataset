What would be a simple and easy to use JAVA library to visualize a binary tree?You could either try with something like a graph database like Neo4j which maybe a bit overkill for purely visualizing, but could do the trick. Alternatively you could also use something like D3 which gives you some nice possibilities to make interactive visualizations (D3 Tree example) Alternative you could also try dot/Graphviz especially if your binary tree is fairly simple that will probably be the easiest and quickest way to go (Rafal's Blog - Binary Trees) Good luck :) -David
