What is the use of a threaded binary tree?Thanks for A2A!! Threaded binary tree, as the name depicts have pointers(threads) to other nodes of the tree. Generally, in a tree structure, every node has left and right pointers.(implemented by doubly linked list)The left pointer points to its in-order predecessor and right node points to in-order successor.But the leaf nodes have both their right and null pointers null.Thus there are more zero links then actual links. However, in threaded binary tree, leaf nodes, left and right pointers also points to in-order predecessor and in-order successor respectively. This has following advantages- Reverse traversal is possible because of circular structure Any traversal procedure like in-order requires stack mechanism to move upwards but in threaded binary tree it is not required to maintain any stack , thus traversal is faster. (Binary search instead of linear)Cons- Procedures like deletion,insertion requires extra effort, since we need to maintain threads of each node. Image source-google.com
