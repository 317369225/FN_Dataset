What is a threaded binary tree?It's a binary search tree with but with a small modification: it makes all right child pointers "that would normally be null point to the in-order successor of the node (if it exists), and all left child pointers that would normally be null point to the in-order predecessor of the node". This should make the in-order traversal of this search tree more efficient since it can be generated only by following these links, no explicit or implicit (recursion) stack is needed.
