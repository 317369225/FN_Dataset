What are binary trees and how can I practice implementing them in Python?A binary tree is a data structure that is either empty or is a node with links to left and right binary trees. A simple definition that covers it all. In the above figure, the topmost node is called the root of the binary tree and the left and right links of that node are called its left and right child respectively. These left and right nodes are themselves binary trees with their root as their first element and links to the left and right children. The bottom most nodes are empty trees with no children... Hope it helps.
