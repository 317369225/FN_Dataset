What is a binary tree?A binary tree is a data structure, usually represented by a connected acyclic graph where each node represents a data element and has 0, 1, or 2 child nodes. There is usually some type of ordering imposed on the nodes of the tree to help organize it. Computer science trees are normally drawn with root of the tree at the top and the children underneath their parent. This is the inverse of how true biological trees grow.
