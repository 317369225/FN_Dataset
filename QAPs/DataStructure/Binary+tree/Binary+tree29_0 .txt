Given any two orders from (preorder, inorder, postorder) of a binary tree, is it always possible to reconstruct a unique binary tree? Why? If yes, how?If you have inorder along with pre or post order you can always construct a unique binary tree because the pre/post order information gives you the root of the tree. Once you know the root of the tree you can recursively construct the left and right sub-trees which are binary trees themselves thereby making the final product unique. It isn't possible to construct a binary tree just from pre and post order traversals of a binary tree because only inorder traversals give the position of the sub-tree elements with respect to the root.
