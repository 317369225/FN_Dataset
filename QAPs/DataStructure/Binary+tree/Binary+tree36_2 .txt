How do I implement a BFS and DFS on a binary tree in Java?see tree is also an acyclic graph. so bfs and dfs can be implemented. The code h you written in the question is closest to dfs. you just make the print statement in the end of the method then it is complete dfs. the code will first go to the leftmost leaf node, then it's right sibling, then one step up. in bfs you first traverse all the siblings and then its children. in this you can use a queue and then queue the element and then all its child with recursion on it.
