What are binary trees and how can I practice implementing them in Python?The Gist Binary Trees are a way of organizing data. For data to be useful you should be able to perform actions such as search, update, delete and insert. Sorting the information tends to make our life easier, so we need to be able to store data in a way we can do that e.g preferabley Nodes. Steps to make ur life easier 1. Understand the behaviour of binary trees before you even start coding 2. Read up on Node implementation vs Array implementation 3. Write algorithms on how to acheive insert, delete, search and how to sort 4. Google is your friend 5. Try creating not following recipes first, thats how you learn OOP
