Can a balanced binary tree be a better option than a complete binary tree for storing a set of elements?Using balanced binary tree is a better option. The retrieval will be faster than normal binary tree in worst case. It will not face the problem of skewness. Less memory requirement. The heavy operations are insert , delete and updation of key, as they can trigger modification of tree structure. So the question comes back to you. What are the things with hisgest priority. If the key value is not going to change and there is not much insert and delete operation then you should definitely go for balanced binary tree
