How do I uniformly sample a node from a binary tree?You can easily map a binary tree to a list/an (1-based) array by putting the root at position 1, and placing the child nodes at index n*2 and n*2+1 respectively, where n is the parent node's index. Then you can sample from a flat array. Edit: as Anders Kaseorg pointed out, this only works for a complete binary tree. If there are any holes (missing left or right child), you may hit such a hole in the flat representation of the tree when sampling. This can be overcome by simply trying again when hitting a hole - that will work eventually, but there is no guarantee that it will ever finish in finite time (you may just hit the same hole over and over again). If you need a guarantee, you will need a more complex algorithm.
