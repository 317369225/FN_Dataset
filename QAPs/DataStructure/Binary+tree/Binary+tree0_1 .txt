Height of binary tree?is there a formula that returns the height of a binary tree given the number of nodes?? Say if I have 16 nodes then the height would be the length of the longest branch. eg: n = 16 then the longest branch has length 4You can find the formulas that describe the properties of a binary tree here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin... Note, there is no formula for the length of a non-perfect binary tree since you would need to describe how long each branch is, which forces you to declare the answer you are looking for.
