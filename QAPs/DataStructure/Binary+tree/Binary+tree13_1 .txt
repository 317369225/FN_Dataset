What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree?A binary tree is a tree in which every parent can have atmost 2 child. Any tree which satisfies the condition is a binary tree. A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree. In a binary search tree the value at the right child of the parent is greater than the parent and the value at the left child of the parent is less than the value at the parent.
