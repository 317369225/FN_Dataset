What are advantages of using a d-ary tree instead of a binary tree?D-ary trees can improve the spatial locality of memory accesses. A balanced -ary tree having elements accesses non-contiguous memory locations per insert, remove, or find operation. The drawback of having high is that up to operations are needed in each contiguous memory location, making the total time complexity of an operation under a traditional random-access machine model .
