What is the best method for checking if a binary tree is a binary search tree?Check that it has the binary search tree property. Namely, the left sub-tree must have values <= the value at the root, which in turn must have value <= values of the right sub-tree. A recursive algorithm will do. A different method is to perform an in-order traversal and store the elements in an array. Once done check that the array is sorted. Both algorithms take linear time.
