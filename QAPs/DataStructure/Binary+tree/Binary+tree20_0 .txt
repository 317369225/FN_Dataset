What is the difference between Binary Tree and Linked Lists?You can think of a linked list (singly linked) as a sequence of nodes where every node has at most two pieces of information: 1) the data that it contains 2) the next node that it points to (I'm talking about the simplest case of singly linked list). An example representation would look like: N1 --> N2--> N3-->N4-->Null A Binary Tree is also represented by nodes except each node has at most three pieces of information: 1) the data that it contains 2) a pointer to its "left child" 3) a pointer to its "right child" . Because of this, a binary tree looks quite different from a linked list. Here's an example:  N1  / \  N2 N3  /  N4 Notice however, that a linked list is a special case of a binary tree. If our binary tree was such that each node only contained information about its data and a pointer to 1 child and not 2, it would effectively become a singly linked list.
