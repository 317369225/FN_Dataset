How do I find the smallest number of nodes that must be added to a binary tree to make it height-balanced binary tree?Insertion happens only at leaf node. In a height-balancedÂ  binary tree the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.I guess by "balanced" you mean that for every node, it's left and right children should have the same size. This implies that you should have a full binary tree of some height (i.e. a tree with 2^H-1 nodes for height H). We should pick the smallest possible H, which is the current height of the tree. So the answer is 2^H-1-N, where H is the height of the input tree and N is the number of nodes in the input tree.
