Can we construct a binary tree having just its pre-order and post-order traversals?You can construct a binary tree with just its pre-order and post-order traversals, but the result may not be identical to the original tree. Anything less than a perfect binary tree (i.e. one with all parent nodes having exactly two children) will have at least one parent with a single subtree, and you can't tell whether it descends to the left or right with a pre-/post-traversal combo. (For the general reconstruction algorithm, look here.) For accurate binary tree reconstruction, you need either a pre-/in- or post-/in-order traversal combo, or additional information about the tree construction algorithm. For instance, if you knew that you were dealing with a binary search tree (in which every parent has a left-lesser/right-greater relationship with its subtrees), then only one traversal is needed.
