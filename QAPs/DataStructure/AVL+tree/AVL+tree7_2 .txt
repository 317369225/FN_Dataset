What would be an efficient way to convert an AVL tree to a sorted array?I think you cannot know a-priori the number of nodes in the tree.You need to do it like a Depth-first search, go to the depth of the left subtree until you reach the leaf nodes, then instead of searching you need to put it in an array. Now interesting question is, if you don't know the number of nodes it has, how would you define the size of your array? If you don't have any clue then ArrayList or LinkedList would be better. But if you know the depth size then in my consideration, AVL tree is n=2h-1, you can use ArrayList I guess, because now you have a guess on the capacity.
