How do I split an AVL tree while keeping the resulting trees balanced in logarithmic time?Separate the root node, its left subtree, and its right subtree. The two subtrees are each AVL trees since every node they contain still has the AVL property. We just did this in constant time. As per the 400 year old stage direction, "We begin with a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightening." Oops, I started channeling "Slings and Arrows." Now add the root node to either tree in logarithmic time. No muss, no fuss.
