What is an intuitive explanation of insertion into an AVL tree?Without going in details i would say AVL tree or RB Tree are improvement over BST operations like (Search , Insertion ,Deletion ) e.g. insertion time for BST in worst case is O(n) consider when you have sorted elements in BST so it will completely right skewed and time complexity for all such operations will be O(n), to improve this AVL tree comes in to picture so that we can reduce such operations time to O(logn) by using rotation , which is used to minimise the complexity , for more detail you can refer AVL tree
