Are there any concrete examples where 2-4 trees or Red Black trees turn out to be much better than AVL or general binary search trees in application?I have been learning about 2-4 trees and red black trees but I can't particularly picture when will they turn out to be significantly more useful than the other generic trees.2-4 Trees and Red Black Trees are more loosely balanced than AVL trees, where the height of 1 child is permitted to be a constant fraction of the other. Specifically, in RB Trees, one of the children might be twice as long as another for some sequence of inserts and deletes. With AVL Trees, this difference is at most 1. So, applications where updates are more frequent than searches could benefit from RB Trees v/s AVL Trees. It's just that the constants differ. Asymptotically, they are the same, and I personally prefer AVL Trees because of their simplicity.
