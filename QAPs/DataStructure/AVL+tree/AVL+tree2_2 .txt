What are some real world applications of AVL trees?Trains in a railway system. I am not sure how IRCTC (Or, any other Railway system) implements it, but taking the fact into account that newer trains come up very few every year and the[code] struct train {};[/code] remains constant for a good period of time, an AVL implementation of this would be better than any other tree for searching. AVL trees are beneficial in the cases where you are designing some database where insertions and deletions are not that frequent but you have to frequently look-up for the items present in there.
