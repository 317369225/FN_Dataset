Algorithms to learn after "data structures and algorithms" What are some useful tree algorithms to know after a BST and AVL trees?It mainly depends on the type of application you are going to use it for: For storage and Retrieval : B,B+ and B Epsilon Trees. For caching and getting benefits of Temporal Locality : Splay Trees, Red-Black Trees For String related computations : Tries and Suffix/Prefix Trees For range searches : KD Trees.
