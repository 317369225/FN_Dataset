Is there any list of AVL tree problems similar to the Stanford Binary Tree Problems?Binary TreesThe majority of the Stanford tutorial, e.g. printTree or isBST, is identical for AVL trees, since AVL trees are really just a special case of standard binary search trees. They have no additional information, but are constrained using rotation to the property that height of subtrees cannot differ by more than one. You could add one more problem for AVL trees, which is to check the above property. The code for that would be a simple modification of maxDepth. If you're looking for how to build the tree, you can find pretty good code just by Googling. Here is one example: AvlTree.java. This code is both terse and descriptive. To visualize the step-by-step operations being performed, e.g. rotations, see this very informative applet: Binary Search Trees, which also features several other similar data structures.
