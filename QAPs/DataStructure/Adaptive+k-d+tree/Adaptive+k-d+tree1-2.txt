Uttar Pradesh | state, India Uttar Pradesh is the springhead of the ancient civilization of the Hindus. A substantial portion of the subcontinent’s ancient Vedic literature had its origin in the area’s many hermitages, as did the great Indian epics the http://...Ramayana and the http://...Mahabharata (which includes the Bhagavadgita [Sanskrit: “Song of the Lord”]). Sculptures and architecture of the Buddhist-Hindu period (c. 600 bce to c. 1200 ce) have contributed greatly to the Indian cultural heritage. Since 1947 the emblem of the government of India has been based on the four-lion capital of a pillar (preserved in a museum at Sarnath, near Varanasi) left by the 3rd-century-bce Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Architecture, painting, music, and dance all flourished during the Mughal period (16th–18th centuries). Mughal architecture reached its height under the emperor Shah Jahān, who built the spectacular http://...Taj Mahal at Agra. Paintings of the period were generally portraits or illustrations of religious and historic texts. Much of the musical tradition in Uttar Pradesh also was developed during the period. The type of music performed by Tansen and Baiju Bawra, contemporaries of the Mughal emperor Akbar, is still well known in the state and throughout India. The http://...sitar (a stringed instrument of the lute family) and the http://...tabla (consisting of two small drums)—perhaps the two most popular instruments of Indian music—were developed in the region during this period. The http://...kathak classical dance style, which originated in the 18th century as a devotional dance in the temples of Vrindavan and Mathura, is the most popular form of classical dance in northern India. As the birthplace of Hindi, an official language of the state and the country, Uttar Pradesh is an important centre of Hindi literature. Although various vernacular forms of the language developed over the centuries, literary Hindi (like Urdu) did not take its present form until the 19th century. Bhartendu Harishchandra (1850–85) of Varanasi was one of the first major writers to use this form of Hindi as a literary medium. 29. World's first hand written needle book: Madhushala 30.
