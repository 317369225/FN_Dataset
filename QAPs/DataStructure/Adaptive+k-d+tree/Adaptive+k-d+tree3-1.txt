Do we need dirt in our diets?
Oh my God. This is such a pet topic for me that's not received as much coverage as it deserves. Today we eat far too much ultra clean food. All things we put in our mouths are sterile and totally clean. However, we forget that our body has all the mechanisms and tools needed to handle a certain amount of dirt in the food. Due to lack of dirt, these mechanisms have atrophied in many people, and even a small amount of impurity in food causes them to fall sick or have allergic reactions. So, go ahead, pick up that grape fallen from the plant on the ground, dust it off and eat it without washing it with lots of water. Just make sure it's visibly clean and devoid of obvious contaminants like feces, molds, etc. Disclaimers apply, use your common sense.
