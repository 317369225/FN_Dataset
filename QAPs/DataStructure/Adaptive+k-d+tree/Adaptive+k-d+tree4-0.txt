What is a good introduction on building theories?
I don't know what you mean by "something theorist", but a good introduction to building theories is Introduction to models in the social sciences / Charles A. Lave, James G. March. (Developing a model is often the first step to developing a theory.)  I've tried to find books on this subject for students to read, and there are surprisingly few that address this fundamental activity of scientists.  This book is fairly old, but the principles are still valid and very well explained.  Note that this book deals with social science theory development, not natural science.
