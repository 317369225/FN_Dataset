What is the difference between anthropomorphism and animism?
animism is investing a soul in things.  the definition of animism anthro (man) pomorphism (importing likeness or shape) is seeing human traits in non-humans or treating them as humans. Those who study animal behavior used to be highly cautioned against assuming human-like motivations in animals.  Some level of anthropomorphism is justifiable since we are related and share some traits with some animals.
