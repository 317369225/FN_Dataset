Which are some good books which relaxes your mind and improves your self-esteem?
For self esteem books: “How to Build Self-Esteem and Be Confident: Overcome Fears, Break Habits, Be Successful and Happy” by Maddy Malhotra Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman The Secret— Take it with a major grain of salt. All I know is that when I started employing the whole law of attraction hocus pocus, I saw results again and again. Is it placebo? Fine. I’ll take it. Are people responsible for their own cancer? Nope. That’s looney-pants. The Six Pillars of Self-esteem— Another book I will randomly buy for strangers. I like my self-help books like I like my math: straightforward, logical and broken down into units. I listened to this book after a year of sobriety, and I could feel my backbone strengthening. Use Your Body to Heal Your Mind — This book taught me how to do EMDR on myself and also helped me to understand to stop bartering for love. I’m getting better. That’s all I ask.And for mind-relaxation books: Still the Mind: Simple Breathing Practices for Inner Peace by Bodhipaksa The Fine Arts of Relaxation, Concentration, and Meditation: Ancient Skills for Modern Minds by Joel Levey Minding the Body, Mending the Mind by Joan Borysenko
