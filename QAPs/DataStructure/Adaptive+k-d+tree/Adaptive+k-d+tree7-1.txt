Why is e-commerce such a hot area in venture capital now?
There are several factors contributing to this trend: Under-investment by VCs between 2002-2008:    Most VCs avoided e-commerce because of concerns about the network effects of eBay (which were exaggerated), the concerns around effective marketing (improper accounting for customer acq costs was a major factor in the Internet Bubble) and the capital required for scale in these businesses as well as general trepidation of "low" margin businesses;  Under-investment by entrepreneurs during 2002-2008:  Extremely small teams of "hackers" pursuing lean customer development were poorly suited for these businesses which normally require simultaneous skill at engineering, product, design, marketing, payments, risk management, customer service/support and inventory acquisition (sometimes). Technology:  Broadband penetration allowed the creation of invigorating shopping experiences (as opposed to purely utilitarian sites) for the first time. Lemming effect:  Many, if not most VCs, follow a proven success and re-think their investment hypotheses:  etsy, Gilt Groupe and Groupon, for example, have prodded many VCs to look for comparable businesses.  Entrepreneurs also can demonstrate this behavior, witness the the rush into social gaming in 2007-2008 and the current herd of Groupon of X companies.
