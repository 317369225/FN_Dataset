Is Evolution founded on scientific proof, or is it a godless worldview founded on supposition?
Like any scientific theory, evolution is limited to just being useful for prediction and control of the natural world.  Your brain could be connected to a supercomputer that is feeding you synthesized perceptions--you cannot know otherwise.  Also, the universe could have been created 5 min ago with just the right attributes to make it look as it does now--you cannot know otherwise.  Thus, your decision to rely on any particular scientific model is a value judgment.  "Scientific proof" is an oxymoron. Note, too, that falsifiability is an attribute of an observer with regard to a proposition regarding the natural world, not of a proposition per se.  For example, "The sky looks blue" is a proposition that is not falsifiable to a blind man. Evolution is typically a 'godless' model, only because 'god' operators do not enhance the reliability of predictions made using evolutionary models.  The lack of god operators in evolutionary models has no necessary bearing whatsoever on whether gods actually do participate in evolutionary processes. Also note that evolutionary models are useful outside of biology.  For example, genetic algorithms are widely used to solve optimization problems, without god operators or supposition.
