Which are some good books which relaxes your mind and improves your self-esteem?
Hmmm... There are lot of things to take into consideration before you can zero in to ONE BOOK that relaxes the mind and also Improves your self esteem, like frame of mind - the time you are reading - and your age, of course! But the two books that comes to my mind, which might be able to reduce anxiety and help in improving your thoughts about yourself are: 1. Bhagavad Gita 2. Gitanjali These two books, when read cleanse the interior of our mind and soul, I feel. They have the power to lift you up from sorrow and low self esteem. Give them a try and let me know. I blog at: Thus Spake Tan!
