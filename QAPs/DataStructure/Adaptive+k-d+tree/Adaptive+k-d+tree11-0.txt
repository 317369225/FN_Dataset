Which are some good books which relaxes your mind and improves your self-esteem?
Thanks for A2A. Sorry, but I would like to give separate answer for both type of books. At times, books that relax our mind may not improve our self-esteem and vice versa, and, therefore, it is better to see books with separate genre: Books for Mental Relaxation: Â  Relaxation Techniques: 92 Affirmations That Apply Anxiety Relaxation Techniques For Relaxation And Stress Reduction by Gary Vurnum Still the Mind: Simple Breathing Practices for Inner Peace by Bodhipaksa The Fine Arts of Relaxation, Concentration, and Meditation: Ancient Skills for Modern Minds by Joel Levey Experience Yoga Nidra: Guided deep relaxation by Swami Janakananda Saraswati The yoga way to release tension: Techniques for relaxation and mind control by Rachel E. Carr Instant Calm: Over 100 Easy-to-Use Techniques for Relaxing Mind and Body by Paul Wilson Out of these 6 books, first 4 books are must-read. Books for Self-esteem: You Can Win-Shiv Khera Six Pillars of Self-Esteem- Branden The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari- Robin Sharma Thoughts on Confidence-Swami Vivekananda First two books are must-read. P.S. I am not sure whether or not the last book is available in English, as I have its Hindi version. Hope this will help.
