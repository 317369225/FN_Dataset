What makes The Western Ghats a hotspot of biological diversity?
The Western Ghats form one of the four watersheds of India, feeding the perennial rivers of India. Important rivers include the Godavari, Tungabhadra, Krishna, Thamiraparani and Kaveri. These rivers flow to the east and drain out into the Bay of Bengal. The west flowing rivers, that drain into the Arabian Sea and the Laccadive Sea, are fast-moving, owing to the short distance travelled and steeper gradient. Important rivers include the Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavati, Mandovi and Zuari. Many of these rivers feed the backwaters of Kerala and Maharashtra. Rivers that flow eastwards of the Ghats drain into the Bay of Bengal. These are comparatively slower moving and eventually merge into larger rivers such as the Kaveri and Krishna. These rivers feed the Peninsular India. The Western Ghats are home to thousands of animal species including at least 325 globally threatened species. Many are endemic species, especially in the amphibian, reptilian and fish classes. Thirty two threatened species of mammals live in the Western Ghats. Of the 16 endemic mammals, 13 are threatened.

Now, what's so special about this? Micrixalus is a genus of frogs endemic to the Western Ghats of India! Commonly called Tropical frog, Torrent Frog or Dancing Frog! You read it right! Micrixalus frogs are popularly known as dancing frogs due to their peculiar habit of waving their feet to attract females during the breeding season. See the video here These frogs are found in the vicinity of fast and slow moving perennial streams in the forests of the Western Ghats. Typical habitats include high altitude shola forests, wet evergreen forests, Myristica swamps and secondary forests. Â The Western Ghats is a biodiversity hotspot for amphibians with 75 new amphibian species having been discovered in the last fifteen years alone.

This lizard when perceives a threat, rises to the top of the tree, opens its wings and glides onto another tree! These flying lizards are found in the Western Ghats and associated hill forests of southern India. This snail, Indrella ampulla, is endemic to the Western Ghats of India. Have you seen a squirrel of length ~three feet (Head - tail)? Well, here in India we have Malabar Giant Squirrel (Ratufa indica)!

The frog spends most of the year underground, surfacing only for about two weeks, during the monsoon, for purposes of mating. See video on Weird Purple Frog Seduces Females From Underground Caecilians are a group of limbless, serpentine amphibians. They mostly live hidden in the ground, making them the least familiar order of amphibians. (Mhadei Caecilian, Gegeneophis mhadeiensis, described to science in 2007, Photograph: Nirmal Kulkarni) This specie is found in northern Western Ghats. Caecilians are found in wet, tropical regions of Southeast Asia, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, parts of East and West Africa, the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, Central America, and in northern and eastern South America. The Malabar large-spotted civet (Viverra civettina), also known as the Malabar civet, is a viverrid endemic to the Western Ghats of India. It is listed as Critically Endangered by IUCN as its population size is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no subpopulation greater than 50 individuals. In the 1990s, isolated populations still survived in less disturbed areas of South Malabar but were seriously threatened by habitat destruction and hunting because they lived outside protected areas. The Uropeltidae are a family of primitive burrowing snakes endemic to Western Ghats of southern India and Sri Lanka. The name is derived from the Greek words ura ("tail") and pelte ("shield"), indicating the presence of the large keratinous shield at the tip of the tail. Currently, eight genera are recognized comprising 47 species. These snakes are not venomous. (Mahabaleshwar Shieldtail, Uropeltis macrolepis mahabaleshwarensis, Kaas 2011, Photo: Vishal PD) The estimated tiger population in the Western Ghats of about 534 (500 to 568) tigers is over 31% of the 1,706 (1,520-1,909) tigers in India. It is notable that the largest single metapopulation of tigers in the world is within the South Indian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. So far, I have covered only a handful of fauna that are endemic and there are thousands of other such rare species. I have not mentioned about flora of the region. These organisms are unique in their lifestyle, adapted to a climate that is not found in other parts of the country. This diverse group of flora and fauna makes the Western Ghats a biological hotspot.
