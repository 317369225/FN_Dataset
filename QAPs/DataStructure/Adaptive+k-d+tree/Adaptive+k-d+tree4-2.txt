What is a good introduction on building theories?
First of all, it is essential to get clarity about what is theory . Theory is a set of concepts and relationship between concepts . These theories have assumptions and boundary limitations. Concept have got properties and dimensions   Previously theories were said/Built by  big names like Aristotle and statistically tested by fellow others.   Have a look at " grounded theory for qualitative research" by cathy Page on Urquhart.  It shows how theories could be built which rooted in context rather than testing grand theories.
