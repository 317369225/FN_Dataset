What are 10 or fewer good habits for a 24 year old that can make life better?
[Short answer ahead] I am turning 30 tomorrow! I jotted down the learnings from the last decade of my life and published this book:  http://amzn.to/1LF4mli (available for free for Kindle Unlimited subscribers). It's All In Your 20s is a gift for all the 20-year-olds on my 30th birthday :-) To summarize the chapters from my book (and the lessons from my life): 1) Practice candor; 2) Guard yourself against any insecurities; 3) Seek validation only from yourself; 4) Don't compare yourself with anyone else; 5) Gain financial independence as early as possible; 6) Success comes to those who are patient or who remain impatient FOR LONG. Eitherways, it takes time; 7) Do things the way that very few people would. Do unique; 8) Seek mentors, be grateful to them. If you discover a selfless mentor, be more grateful; 9) Set goals that make you get up from the bed every morning; 10) No pain, no gain. Be ready to give up things, get out of your comfort zone; 11) Anger is good, channelize it. But also figure out what makes you angry- what's the real source? 12) Matters of the heart can affect your head. Not every love is worth chasing. Be careful; 13) Politics is not always bad. Just remember a good politician always fights for a cause larger than him or her; 14) Bravado is great. But remind yourself- the line of difference between bravado and stupidity is thin; 15) Don't forget lessons you learn. Remember, recall, and apply the learnings at the right time.
