India:Â What do people from Uttar Pradesh take pride in?
So, I asked my friend Nikhil Chaudhary to answer this question as he is from Uttar Pradesh. But he declined my request. So I am writing this answer on his behalf. 1. If Uttar Pradesh was a country they would be fifth largest in the world by population. 2. They have given to the World and India, the Lord Rama and Lord Krishna. 3. They are reported to have Nawabi Tehjeeb (Manners like that of Nawabs). 4. They have the world,s ancient cities like Banaras and Allahabad. 5. As he is from Muzzaffarnagar, he is proud that there are almost equal number of Muslims and Hindus in his city who have lived in harmony for so long. 6. There is a great diversity in dialects of Hindi as well as cultural differences between Eastern and Western UP. 7. Khariboli is a language most people of UP are proud of. The modern standard Hindi and Urdu have originated from this language.
