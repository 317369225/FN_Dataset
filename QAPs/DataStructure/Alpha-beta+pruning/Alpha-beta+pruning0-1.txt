What is alpha beta pruning? Frequently asked in
Alpha beta pruning is a technique for speeding up chess programs. The basic idea behind chess programs is you make a big list of every move you could make, then for each item on that list you make a big list of every move the other guy could make, and so on as far as you think you've got time for. Then you look at all the possible positions and estimate how good they are, and assuming each player chooses their own best option you work your way back to the start. Where alpha-beta pruning comes in is sometimes you reach a point where you can say "if the other guy is smart he won't make that move, so I can skip checking what moves I could make after it"
