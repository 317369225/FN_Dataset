What is alpha beta pruning? Frequently asked in
Alpha Beta was used by chess players long before it was formally invented. Let's say you see a move which wins two pawns. You don't just make this move but rather look for better ideas. But then you notice that if you play anything else then your opponent has a way to lose only one pawn. At this point it would be impractical to keep looking for ways for your opponent to do even better (i.e. not to lose any material). You just cut your further calculations and go for two pawn line. The formalization of this idea is alpha beta pruning.
