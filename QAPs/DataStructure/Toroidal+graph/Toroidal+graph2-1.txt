What is twin paradox and how does it works?
According to the Space travel calculator a spaceship accelerating at 1 g for 1000 years Earth time would experience only 13.5 years shipboard time.  Since Earth, in that same interval is experiencing 1 g due to gravity, there is indeed a paradox. The usual resolution of the twins paradox ignores Earth's gravity and explains the apparent asymmetry of the aging of the twins as due to acceleration--the travelling twin moves through a series of reference frames, each slowing the ships clocks relative to the Earth's frame of reference. I understand the special relativity needed to obtain and explain the twins paradox for the travelling twin.  Why the GR equivalence principle does not apply for the homebody twin experiencing 1 g of gravity is beyond my knowledge.
