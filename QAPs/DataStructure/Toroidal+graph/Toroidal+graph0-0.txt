Is there an equivalent to Wagner's Theorem in Graph Theory for whether or not a graph is toroidal?
The general statement that answers this is the heavy artillery for all such properties: the Robertsonâ€“Seymour theorem. As the family of all toroidal graphs is closed under minors, R-S theorem proves that it can be characterized by some finite set of forbidden minors. The R-S theorem does not actually give a construction of such a set of minors, it only proves its existence. As far as I know, we actually don't know an explicit characterization for toroidal graphs yet. (As of roughly ten years ago, it was known that the characterization will contain over 16,000 different minors.)
