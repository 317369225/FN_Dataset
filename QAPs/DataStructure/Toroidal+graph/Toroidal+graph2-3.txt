What is twin paradox and how does it works?
Start with this idea: time passes at the same rate for all people from their own point of view, no matter where they go. The rate of all physical processes we can possibly use to measure time doesn't appear to ever change for clocks that move along with us: clocks just seem to tick at the same rate, no matter where you go or how you move. But the thing is: the amount of time that passes for you, relative to the amount that passes for someone else does depend on the two paths that both of you follow through space and time. If you go deep into a very, very strong gravity field, and your twin doesn't, but simply hovers far away from the object producing the gravity, and then you return to meet your twin, then much less time will have passed for you than for your twin. That is the twin paradox in a nutshell, though it is usually stated in the context of special relativity instead, where it can be shown that the twin who leaves on a long journey, travels very fast, and then returns experiences much less time than the twin who stays put. It seems paradoxical but it isn't: because there is no symmetry between the two twins. They move along different paths. The so-called proper time, the clock time along their two paths, is actually different. Gravity doesn't change this at all, since general relativity contains special relativity as a limit. So if the twin paradox made sense to you in special relativity, then you should still be happy with it when there is gravity! Here on the Earth these effects are tiny - people living at the altitude of Denver, Colorado experience 100 years, while those living at sea level experience 100 years less about two seconds. So it takes atomic clocks to detect the effect, but it has been done.
