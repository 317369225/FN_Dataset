What do the terms "base-2" and "base-10" mean in this context?“The problem is, the syllable “dec” stands for the number 10, so the word “decimal” implies a base-10 representation. Because computers store base-2 (not base-10) representations, the word “decimal” to describe such a number is a misnomer.” Excerpt From: Burd, Barry. “Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies.” John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2012-03-12. iBooks.

The "Technical Stuff" section you are asking about probably exists to satisfy a pedantic editor or technical reviewer who objected to calling a number generated by a computer a "decimal" when it is actually represented internally as a binary structure.  For beginners, this is a non-issue.  However, as you get into performing base-10 math using a base-2 computing device, some strange things may happen. To see problems that might arise in Javascript calculations, read Avoiding Problems with Decimal Math in JavaScript. To delve into the arcana of how designal numbers are represented by computers, you can read IEEE floating point. For beginners, just replace that section with herp derp herp derp.
