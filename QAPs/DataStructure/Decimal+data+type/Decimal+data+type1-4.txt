Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
JavaScript is: good for writing the front end of web applications ok for writing the backend-end/server-side of web applications bad for native applications bad for embedded programming JavaScript is the only (realistic) language to use to write code which runs in a user's browser. JavaScript is therefore very important if you believe web applications to be important. On Android and iOS, which initially only supported web apps - prior to the advert of the App Store; some people believe web apps to be a viable alternative to native applications (see PhoneGap). For desktop applications; the need for native applications is not going to disappear any time soon, but native applications are often not needed. (It's surprising that webmail clients such as Gmail are considered suitable alternatives to there native-counterparts). CoffeeScript and other languages which compile down to JavaScript (e.g. GWT, ClojureScript) may well be worth learning, as well, rather than instead of, JavaScript. JavaScript is considered by some to be the assembly language of the see (Scott Hanselman blogged about this a year ago, and the idea has been suggested before). So, just as the best C programmers will often have some familiarity with assembly, it is appropriate to learn JavaScript as a CoffeeScript developer. This is especially true when the code you will want to step through/debug in the browser is JavaScript. Even if you completely believe in the web applications dominating both the mobile and desktop markets, it's still worth learning another language for the server-side. Node.js (i.e. JavaScript on the server) is of interest, but has disadvantages. A clear one being - you lose access to the vast array of existing libraries targeting other established languages such as PHP/Java/Ruby.
