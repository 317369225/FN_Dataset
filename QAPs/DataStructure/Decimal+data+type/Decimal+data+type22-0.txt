In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?Since pointers only have to store memory locations of other variables then why don't they all have a a single data type?
Because different datatypes have different sizes. Dereferencing a pointer is tantamount to reading a number of bytes from the memory location equal to the size of the data type. e.g  int *p when dereferenced as  *p returns an  int value which is equal to the value of  sizeof(int) bytes from the memory pointed to by  p . You have also have pointers of no size in the form of  void * pointers, which is generally avoided especially in case pointer arithmetic is involved. As far as I know its use in C is similar to templates in C++. See Why is pointer arithmetic with void* considered bad? for more info on that. Updated 25 Oct 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
