What are some technological things that even computer programmers do wrong?I will get things started. Kilobytes (KB), Megabytes (MB), Gigabytes (GB) are used incorrectly. These are human (base-10) numbers, so each represents 1,000. Computers use binary (base-2), so each should represent 1,024. The proper notation is Kibibytes (KiB), Mebibytes (MiB), Gibibytes (GiB). The same applies for bits.
We don't know our equals well. Sometimes we forget the difference between equals (=) and equals (==). In addition, there are different equals in other platforms from eq to === and many other forms. No wonder we are so confused. Updated 29 Oct 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
