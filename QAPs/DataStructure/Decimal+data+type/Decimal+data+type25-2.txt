What do the terms "base-2" and "base-10" mean in this context?“The problem is, the syllable “dec” stands for the number 10, so the word “decimal” implies a base-10 representation. Because computers store base-2 (not base-10) representations, the word “decimal” to describe such a number is a misnomer.” Excerpt From: Burd, Barry. “Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies.” John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2012-03-12. iBooks.

Base-10 is the base we use everyday to count, it's formed by: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9. Since computers work in binary, that is base-2, they only use two values: 0 and 1. In the context of the book, it means that, since computers count in binary (base-2), calling the numbers as decimal is wrong. Hope this helps :) P.D. Please tell me if there is some sort of keyword in Java that is named dec.
