How do I write a C++ program to add 10^30 and 10^30 efficiently?P.S I often face this big integer arithmetic problem during programming contests because of which i am unable to solve simple problems during contests. It would be helpful if you would provide some resources to do this arithmetic. I don't want to use Java BigInteger class and purely use c++.
You've said you can't solve simple problems for big integer arithmetic. So the first thing is, you should learn big integer arithmetic. Here are a few steps from top of my head: 1. Think how a number is represented. If you are given two numbers in string format, can you write a program to compare them? Can you write a program which will send min, max etc between them? 2. If you can solve 1, think how to add two numbers in string representation. Say you are given a function prototype, string sum (string a, string b) { } fill in the body of this function with appropriate code. 3. 2 Done? Now write subtract, multiply etc methods. 4. 3 Done? Now try to use some existing libraries or compile a library with the methods you've already written. Keep them in a handy place on your computer, have a printed copy with you for onsite contests. Please have a copy for contests as long as you're not super good with it. You don't want to waste precious contest time debugging a simple sub routine method. I used to solve problems those require biginteger arithmetics in Java so that I could use math.BigInteger class. But as a programming contestant, you must know how basic arithmetic operations work first (as you'll face some problems which will need these techniques). Then you can move to existing libraries.
