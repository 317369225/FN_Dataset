How can I develop logic for reversing a number?
Easy way break into variables (i am using arrays) and reverse as multiples of 10's powers. N[0]=4 N[1]=5 N[2]=6 digit = 3 New answer = {pow(10,digit-1)×N[2]} +  {pow(10,digit-2)×N[1]} + {pow(10,digit-)×N[0]} Which will be interpreted as New answer = {100×6 + 10×5 +1×4} Or New answer = 654 Learn more about programming at Newbie Programmer http://ramdeoshubham.blogspot.co...
