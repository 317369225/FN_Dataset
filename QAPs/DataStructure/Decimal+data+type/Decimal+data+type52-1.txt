Python 3.4 string_1 = "Camelot" string_2 = "place" print ("Let's not go to %s. 'Tis a silly %s." % (string_1, string_2)) , why is syntax error: invalid syntax?
You are doing something [probably typing - since it is syntax error] wrong. It will work even with the space between print and (. One more word of advice: %[type] (%s for string, %d for decimal integer, %2f for float with two decimal places, etc) is planed to be discontinued in future versions of Python. Python 3 already incorporates replacement for string formatting and I can see you are using Python 3.4. So, I think you should be getting used to using: print ("Let's not go to {}. 'Tis a silly {}.".format(string_1, string_2)) Much more power, much more control, can be used with positional args, with kwargs, you don't have to worry about data types, etc. Mini language on it's own.
