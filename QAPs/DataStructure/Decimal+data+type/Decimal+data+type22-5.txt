In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?Since pointers only have to store memory locations of other variables then why don't they all have a a single data type?
Take simple example: Let address of "a" is '1000' int a; int *p=&a; now "p" will store 1000. Â if you perform p++ "p" will now have 1004 as integer 4 bytes. now if we do: char a; int *p=&a; if you perform p++ "p" will still go to 1004 because it is integer pointer but it should store 1001 as char is 1 byte. Your Condition: All Pointers of same data type. Now how will compiler know that "p++" would do? 1 byte, 4 byte or 8 bytes? So to avoid this ambiguity we have pointers of different data types.
