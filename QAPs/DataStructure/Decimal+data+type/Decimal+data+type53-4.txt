What are some technological things that even computer programmers do wrong?I will get things started. Kilobytes (KB), Megabytes (MB), Gigabytes (GB) are used incorrectly. These are human (base-10) numbers, so each represents 1,000. Computers use binary (base-2), so each should represent 1,024. The proper notation is Kibibytes (KiB), Mebibytes (MiB), Gibibytes (GiB). The same applies for bits.
They force blog readers to navigate posts via monthly hyperlinks.  If I discover a site due to a good post, I'm inclined to want to see what else the author's written.  Don't require me to step month by month through the posts.  Give me the simplest thing that'd work: a complete list of posts. There are still sites that don't have this.  Who's to blame?  Programmers.  It makes no sense.  Maybe originally when blogs were more or less diaries, but not anymore. The monthly hyperlinks are an anti-pattern.  Just gimme a list.
