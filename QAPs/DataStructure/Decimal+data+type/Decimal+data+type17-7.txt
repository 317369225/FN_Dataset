What are the differences between the double and float data types?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a float and a double?In common use, for languages like C, C++, Python and Java a float means a 32 bit approximation of a real number and a double means a 64 bit approximation of a real number. Double is called so because it takes 'double' the amount of memory that a float does. Floats are also called 'single'. The most important difference is that a float has 7 decimal digits of precision called the 'mantissa', while a double has 14, making it much better for doing arithmetic operations on pairs of large numbers with slight differences. This is because more precision in the mantissa helps against what is called 'subtractive cancellation' as well as 'round-off error'. The downside to using double all the time is that it takes more space in memory as well as the 'registers' of the CPU. Since a double occupies more register space, fewer doubles can be processed at once with a 'vector instruction' than can singles aka floats.
