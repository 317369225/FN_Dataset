What do the terms "base-2" and "base-10" mean in this context?“The problem is, the syllable “dec” stands for the number 10, so the word “decimal” implies a base-10 representation. Because computers store base-2 (not base-10) representations, the word “decimal” to describe such a number is a misnomer.” Excerpt From: Burd, Barry. “Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies.” John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2012-03-12. iBooks.

Base 10 (decimal)  and base two (binary) are two different number systems. Computers use binary to compute things (as well as hexadecimal, or base sixteen) and most of the world uses decimal in every days math. Decimal has the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 whilst binary only has 1 and 0.
