What SQL features does Cloudera's Impala not have?
Note however the Impala roadmap (always subject to change): Impala 2.0 (expected first third of 2014) SQL 2003-compliant analytic window functions (aggregation OVER PARTITION) – to provide more advanced SQL analytic capabilities UDTFs (user-defined table functions) – for more advanced user functions and extensibility Intra-node parallelized aggregations and joins – to provide even faster joins and aggregations on on top of the performance gains of Impala Nested data – enables queries on complex nested structures including maps, structs, and arrays Additional data types – including Date and Decimal types ORDER BY without LIMIT clausesBeyond Impala 2.0 Additional analytic SQL functionality – ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SET External joins using disk – enables joins between tables to spill to disk for joins that require join tables larger than the aggregate memory size Subqueries inside WHERE clauses
