Why does PostgreSQL have such a wide numeric data type?
Dave, I do not know the specific reason for PostgreSQL's exact number of digits before and after the decimal point. Consider, however, astronomy, astrophysics and relative masses. Suppose you choose a common unit of 1 Kilogram.   Then the total mass of the Universe or even of one galaxy would make good use of many numbers before the decimal point. At the other end of the scale the mass of a fundamental particle such as a neutrino (let alone quarks and Higgs) would make good use of a lot of digits (especially zeros) after the decimal point. There is much to be said for using one common unit of measure in such an exercise. The number of times guys make mistakes because of units is legion.   As you will know the number of digits in PostgreSQL is user defined on both sides of the decimal point. There are still a lot of spare digits in hand - but who knows what comes next?
