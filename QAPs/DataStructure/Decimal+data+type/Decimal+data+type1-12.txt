Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
As a web developer JavaScript is the only programming language that you absolutely know you are going need to learn. On the server you could be using any of a whole range of languages (including JavaScript) but in the browser JavaScript is always the language you'll be using. Even if you only do server-side programming you should know JavaScript in case you ever have to do some client-side programming.
