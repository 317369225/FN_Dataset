How is an integer value stored in the memory in C?for example for the statments int a=456; signed int a=2357;and how is a float value been stored float a=34.125;
The answer depends on your compiler. In GCC/Visual C/Other 32 bit compilers: 1. Integers will be stored in 4 Bytes with the MSB as sign bit. That gives you a total possible of 2^31 nos. And the MSB as 0 = Positive & 1 = Negative. 2. With signed integer you mean "only positive" number, so there's no need for sign bit, so you can store a total of 2^32 positive numbers. 3. Floating points will acquire 8 Bytes in memory. In Turbo C/Brland C/Other 16 bit compilers: Concept same as above with integers occupying 2 Byte and float occupying 4 Byte. Please consider going through IEEE 754 Float Point Standard. You'll get clear understanding how numbers are stored in memory. Don't worry it's not as scary as it sounds. Just google/wiki it :)
