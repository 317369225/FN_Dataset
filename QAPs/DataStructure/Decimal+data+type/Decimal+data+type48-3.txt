What are the actual differences between %d, %u and %p format specifiers used in C to print the memory address of a variable?
Difference is: %d and %u are incorrect way to print the memory address of a data pointer while %p is correct way. If you use incorrect print specifier in print, the behavior is undefined. Also check this post: Page on stackoverflow.com Quoting from N1570 7.21.6.1 The fprintf function p : The argument shall be a pointer to void. The value of the pointer is converted to a sequence of printing characters, in an implementation-defined manner. int main(void) {      int a = 5;      printf("%p", (void *)&a);      return 0; }
