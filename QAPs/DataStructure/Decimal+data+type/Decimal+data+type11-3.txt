Given is a structure in C++, struct database {int id_number; int age; float salary;}; Use this structure in the main program and store the ID number, age and salary of an employee and print it?Note: You are just required to provide a valid code. No outputs required.
Don't expect people to do your homework and try to do some research on Google first. But to get the basic idea: int main(){ struct database {int id_number; int age; float salary;}; struct database data; data.id_number = 1; data.age = 11; data.salary = 1000; cout<<data.id_number<<data.age<<data.salary; return 0; }
