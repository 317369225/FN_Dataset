What is the logic behind the output of this code?
All the numbers are stored in computer in binary form and what you observed happened because of different precision of float and double. float contains 23 bits of significand, 8 bits of exponent, and 1 sign bit and double contains 52 bits of significand, 11 bits of exponent, and 1 sign bit. So, for a number having non terminating mantissa in binary form, double will store longer mantissa than float, which is 3 places more after decimal point. Now check that the number (1.1)base10 is actually having non terminating mantissa - (1.0001100110011001100110011001100....)base2 and hence float stores 1.00011001 whereas double stores 1.00011001100 i.e different values, and none of which is exactly equal to (1.1)base10. Hence while comparison, when the float value is typecasted to double (i.e. lower data type to higher data type), the values come to be different as the comparison is made between 1.00011001'0'00(float typcasted to double) and 1.00011001'1'00(double). Whereas, (2.5)base10 = (10.1)base2 and hence both double and float store exactly the same value, and hence equality test comes to be true. Updated 13 Apr â€¢ View Upvotes
