Why do computers use base-2 instead of base-10?Decimal computers were once very commonplace, but why aren't they anymore? *Speaking as something with next to no knowledge of computer science.*
Originally Answered: Why is there only stable states (0 &1) in digital world. Why couldn't we define things in more number of states like may be (0 ,1, 2, 3)?In a computer, it is easy to represent information digitally, using either the presence or absence of an electrical potential. Your computer's processor is an enormous array of transistors--literally billions of them--which are basically electronic switches that turn on or off. Your computer's memory stores information using either the presence or absence of an electric charge. It is difficult and cumbersome to represent information using multiple values of electric current (say, 1 volt for a 1, 2 volts for a 2, 3 volts for a 3, and so on). Such analog computers were built, very early in history, but digital computers quickly surpassed them in performance.
