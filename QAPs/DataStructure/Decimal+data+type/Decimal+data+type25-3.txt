What do the terms "base-2" and "base-10" mean in this context?“The problem is, the syllable “dec” stands for the number 10, so the word “decimal” implies a base-10 representation. Because computers store base-2 (not base-10) representations, the word “decimal” to describe such a number is a misnomer.” Excerpt From: Burd, Barry. “Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies.” John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2012-03-12. iBooks.

The author is correctly saying that technically computers don't work in base 10 but rather in base two. However, NO one calculates in base two. Computers are used to perform calculations that people enter - enter in base 10 or decimal. Therefore as a black box computers are correctly called decimal computers. What people are trying to distinguish is the difference between a modern day 'digital' computer with an analog computer. Correctly there are discrete and analog computers. But if you referred to discrete computers, people would really get confused. In truth though we should just drop  the adjective.
