How assignment work in C language?
The assignment statement in C language takes an rvalue( the value which appears on the right hand side of the assignment operator )and assigns it to the lvalue( also called as locator value, which appears on the left hand side of the assignment operator ). int a, b = 5; a = b; /* a is the lvalue and b is the rvalue ( i.e the value present in b)*/ a = b*5; /* here the right side expression is just an rvalue in the sense that, it doesn't have a memory location associated with the expression */ Note : The resulting value of the assignment expression is the value present in the left hand side variable after the assignment is done. The type of the assignment statement however, is the type of the lvalue.
