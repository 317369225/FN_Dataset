What's the hardest bug you've debugged?
One was just fixed recently my cs & it ideas: fork pthread, never occurred in a test environment, and involved pthreads + vfork + pipes + cpp + php, creating a rather puzzling deadlock in which two processes seemed to wait for a message from each other, even though one of them already logged it's own crash, and the other did not report a restart. There were many hypothesis and a few proposed solutions, but none which could be reproduced. The other was with a Script tag content madness and happened only when a user had a particular sequence of characters in a profile information, which caused the JSONed data to contain a sequence which triggered the HTML parser to believe that a part of JS is actually a special kind of comment. In this one, the issue was further hidden by the fact, there are many different JS parsers in the tools you are using during analysis (it seems that F12 developer tools use at least two different ways to highlight js syntax) which introduced a lot of confusion, since the already-bad html was colored in even less helpful way when we tried to analyze the issue.
