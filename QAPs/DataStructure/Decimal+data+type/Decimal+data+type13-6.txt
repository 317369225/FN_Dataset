What are the differences in laymen terms between data structures vs. data types?
All data structures are data types, but not all data types are data structures. Data types can be atomic (indivisible) or a data structure (divisible into atomic data types). An atomic data type may be an integer, with negatives or positives but no fractions. An atomic data type may be a character, which is translated to a character on your screen. Another atomic data type is a floating point number, with stuff after the decimal point. A composite data type may also be a combination of any of these. A data structure is a composite combination of data types, put together as its own data type. A data structure may contain atomic data types, and it may also include composite data types, made up of combinations of other data types, which all eventually resolve to individual indivisible atomic types.
