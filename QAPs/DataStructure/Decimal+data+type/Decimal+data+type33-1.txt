SQL: What is an attribute?
Originally Answered: What is an attribute?MySQL attributes often refer to MySQL data types and restrictions put on them. When you declare a field as a number or character-data type field, different attributes associate with it. These attributes let you specify further restrictions on the number or character that the field can store. UNSIGNED Attribute Type: You can specify the UNSIGNED attribute with the TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT, INTEGER, BIGINT, REAL, DOUBLE, FLOAT, DECIMAL and NUMERIC MySQL data types. When you use the UNSIGNED attribute to declare a data type field, you can't store a negative number in that field. You most commonly use UNSIGNED attributes for fields to prevent users of a database from making entry mistakes. For example, the price field in a database is often UNSIGNED, as a price is usually a positive number. ZEROFILL Attribute Type: You can specify the ZEROFILL attribute with the TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT, INTEGER, BIGINT, REAL, DOUBLE, FLOAT, DECIMAL and NUMERIC MySQL data types. When you use the ZEROFILL attribute in a data-type declaration statement, the data when displayed will have the number zero, 0, inserted to the left of the most significant digit of the number displayed. The number of inserted zeros is equal to the maximum specified length of the data type minus the number of digits that store in the actual number. CHARACTER SET Attribute Type: You can apply the CHARACTER SET attribute to VARCHAR, TEXT, CHAR and ENUM data types. You use it to specify the character set used to store text in the data type field, or column. You can specify different character sets with the CHARACTER SET attribute, including the UTF-9 character set and the Latin-1 character set. MySQL also supports Unicode, West European, Central European, South European, Middle Eastern, Baltic, Cyrillic and Asian character sets. Binary Attribute Type; You can also specify the CHARACTER SET attribute with the binary attribute. When you apply the CHARACTER SET binary attribute to a string data type, this will effectively convert the string data type to another string data type. For example, when you specify binary for a TEXT data type field, the TEXT data type field becomes a BLOB data type field that stores data as binary data, rather than a TEXT field that stores characters as text characters.
