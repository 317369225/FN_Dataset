Why would you append an F to the end of a value of a floating point literal in Java? (e.g. float ratio = 0.2363F;) Isn't that already specified in the data type "float"? What happens if I don't include the f? Does something similar happen in the integer data types?I'm learning java by myself reading some books. Im having some trouble understanding the following statement: "Java assumes that all floating point literals are of type double".
In Java a floating-point literal is of type float if it ends with the letter F or f; otherwise its type is double and it can optionally end with the letter D or d. You can also express the floating point types using E or e (for scientific notation), F or f  (32-bit float literal) and D or d (64-bit double literal; this is the  default and by-convention is omitted). double d1 = 123.4; // same value as d1, but in scientific notation double d2 = 1.234e2; float f1  = 123.4f;
