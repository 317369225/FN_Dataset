What are the most important things to learn this summer in order to get a head start before beginning a computer science concentration (major) next fall?
To be honest, the best thing which helped me was to code and understand the algorithms. So I would suggest to brush up some old algorithms, for that you can read some chapters ofÂ  Introduction to algorithms by Thomas Cormen. Make some dummy projects in whatever language you are comfortable with. For example, you can make your own website and connect it with database. Learn about svn repositories (tortoise, github). And above all, enjoy your life, eat whatever you like, go to gym and learn some new activity before you start with your studies.
