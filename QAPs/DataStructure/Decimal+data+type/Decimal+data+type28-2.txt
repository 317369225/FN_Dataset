How do I print 5.00 in place of 5 in a C++ code?
As Darshan Oswal suggested, You have to change the data type to float and set the precision of the variable. I suggest you to once go through StackOverflow or any other programming related sites before you post this question. Such questions would mostly be solved in these sites. Thanks for the A2A.
