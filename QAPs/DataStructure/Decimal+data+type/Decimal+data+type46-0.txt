How can I develop logic for reversing a number?
To reverse a number of n digits your loop needs to run "n" times. Usually in this case we use a while loop. Let n =435   Now While (n> 0) . This loop will run until n becomes 0 or less. Lets extract the last digit. Int d=n% 10;  Now your d contains 5. To reverse the number, you need to multiply it by 10 so that you can add the next digit into the units place For example, 55 can be represented as 50+5. So eveytime you need to add a new digit , the previous digit should be multiplied by 10. Rev=rev×10+d; Intially rev will be initialized to zero, so that first iteration will have rev =5. But when the second digit is extracted, we need to make it to 50 so that we can add 3 so it becomes 53. Now you must be confused on how to extract the second digit. We know that n% 10 gives the last digit. But to eliminate the last digit we can use  n=n/10; 435/10=43  ( because its int data type so decimal is ignored )  So you repeat the steps again till n <=0. * one in italics are the code.
