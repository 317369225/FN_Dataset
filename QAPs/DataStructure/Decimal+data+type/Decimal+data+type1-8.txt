Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
While I think it is incredibly valuable to learn Javascript, one can take another stance as well. In terms of society, it seems inevitable that a lot (and i mean a lot) of people will learn Javascript. Some better than others. Still, there is a chance that there will be an abundance of Javascript developers. Now, know Javascript does enable you to do a lot of powerful things. However, if your aim is to compete for jobs in the job market, then maybe a niche market might be better, where competition might become lower. For instance, Fortran is still being used by many important systems that are in use today, but few people learn it, and I would guess even less teach it. Same thing goes for Erlang, (although it seems more people teach it). My advice however, is to learn all those languages. They will all teach you different aspects of thinking in programming - and that will transcend programming languages.
