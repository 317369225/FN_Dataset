Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
5 Reasons Why JavaScript is a Big Deal in 2015: Compile-time support: CoffeeScript and TypeScript both allow catching of errors at compile-time, which is useful in a dynamic language like JavaScript. Server-side compatibility: this has been around for awhile but Node.js raises the bar on JavaScript compile time by going straight to machine code via V8, with no bytecode intermediary. “API economy”:  JSON is the convergent RESTful protocol for IPC. Developers can rest easy that their public-facing API will not become deprecated in a sudden surge of XML popularity. Since JavaScript treats JSON as a first-class citizen, integrating with an external JSON API is easiest in a JavaScript framework. Light Frameworks: Express, Meteor, Backbone, Angular, React–these frameworks can be easily mixed because they were designed to be unopinionated. The switching cost between different JavaScript frameworks is lower than moving from Rails to Spring. Schema is unknown: a database schema can change quickly from day to day. NoSQL databases allow more agile evolution of the data model and treat JSON as a first-class citizen.
