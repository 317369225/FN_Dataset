How does a compiler know about data types?
compiler works in following phases: 1 In lexical Analysis, compiler group sequences of raw characters into meaningful tokens. for eg: a=b+c ----------> a(id)  =(assignment operator) b(id) +(arithmetic operator) c(id) 2. Then In Syntax Analysis, the grammar rules are checked. like for integer, rule can be [0-9]+ . similarly rules for float are also defined in compiler. these grammars are checked in this phase and syntax tree is created. if these grammar rules did not match then error is displayed. 3. In Later Phases, type matching , Intermediate code generation , code optimization is done.  Read this book . for later phases if you want to know in detail: Compilers- principles,tools & techniques by Alfred V.
