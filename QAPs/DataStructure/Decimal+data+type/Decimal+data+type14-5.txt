What's the hardest bug you've debugged?
A couple years ago, there was a crash in the Flash Player that was reported to us by both Mozilla and Microsoft. None of us could reproduce the crash, we'd know where the crash was due to a crash log, but it'd make no sense. In fact, there were several crash logs pointing to different lines of code that were due to the same bug (as we later realized). Finally, an awesome Quality Engineer on our team was able to hunt down a machine on which it did crash, and was able to come up with fairly reliable repro steps. It turned out that it only occurred when using slow hard drives. The crash would occur during the Flash Player's destruction sequence (like when you navigate to another web page in some cases), when a video was being deallocated. The video file stream wouldn't clear out in time, and exposed a thread synchronization issue. The thing that made this bug so hard was that it was so hard to find a system to reproduce in-house, and the fact that there was some nasty multithreading going on around where the crash was. I fixed that crash, and it turned out to be quite popular. It probably prevented tens of millions of crashes -- in a time when browsers would crash along with the plugin. We felt like heroes :-) Updated 8 Oct 2014 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Ravi Sethia
