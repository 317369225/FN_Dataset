What do the terms "base-2" and "base-10" mean in this context?“The problem is, the syllable “dec” stands for the number 10, so the word “decimal” implies a base-10 representation. Because computers store base-2 (not base-10) representations, the word “decimal” to describe such a number is a misnomer.” Excerpt From: Burd, Barry. “Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies.” John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2012-03-12. iBooks.
