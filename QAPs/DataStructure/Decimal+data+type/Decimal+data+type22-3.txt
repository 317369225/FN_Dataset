In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?Since pointers only have to store memory locations of other variables then why don't they all have a a single data type?
Pointers can be lvalues (used on the left hand side of an assignment operator), and as such, the compiler must know how to store the value when making the assignment. The type of an lvalue describes this.
