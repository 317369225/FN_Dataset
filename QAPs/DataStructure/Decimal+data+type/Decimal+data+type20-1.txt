Which data type should I use to store a 12 digit integer in C++?
Rule of thumb: you need 3 and a half bits (well, slightly less actually) to store a digit. Henceforth, for 12 digits 32 bits are not enough, but 64 bits are. I would probably use uint64_t from stdint.h, but making it a long long should be enough on most today's compilers.
