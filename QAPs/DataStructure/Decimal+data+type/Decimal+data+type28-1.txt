How do I print 5.00 in place of 5 in a C++ code?
Okay, that's not a big deal just use the benefit of "precision" in OOP-C++. Proceed as following: 1.Change the data type from integer to floating point number ie. int to float. 2.In the main part of the program write the following: { float x = 5, end1;         cout.precision(2);     cout << fixed << x << end1;     getch();     return 0; } You are done.Now compile it enjoy the number in greater precision. (PS:Since you want precision upto 2 digit, therefore float is enough otherwise use double)
