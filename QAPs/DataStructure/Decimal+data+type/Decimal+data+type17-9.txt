What are the differences between the double and float data types?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a float and a double?In C and C++, a float or single-precision float is 32 bits (4 bytes) long and a double or double-precision float is 64 bits (8 bytes) long. In the IEEE specification, 24 of the bits in the single precision are the "mantissa" which gives the actual value while the rest are for the "exponent" which gives the magnitude. The double has 53 bit mantissa. This translates to roughly 7 (2^24=16777216) and 15 (2^53=~9.0072*10^15) digits precision respectively. Using similar arithmetic you can figure out the range for the exponent, keeping in mind that everything is represented in base-2. One thing that I was reminded of recently is that in C and C++ all single precision arithmetic is converted to double precision for calculations. In other words there is no speed advantage to using single-precision. The only reason is to reassure yourself that your algorithms are in fact stable! Sometimes you can fix an unstable or ill-conditioned algorithm by switching to double precision. A good example of this is the formula for standard deviation that doesn't require calculating the mean first ( σ=x 2  ¯ −x ¯  2  − − − − − −  √   ). It doesn't always work though. Updated 31 Aug
