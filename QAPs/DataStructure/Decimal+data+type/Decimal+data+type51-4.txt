How do I write a C++ program to add 10^30 and 10^30 efficiently?P.S I often face this big integer arithmetic problem during programming contests because of which i am unable to solve simple problems during contests. It would be helpful if you would provide some resources to do this arithmetic. I don't want to use Java BigInteger class and purely use c++.
Its very easy.. just use double for handling large numbers. double is of 8 bytes its value range is 2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308   (source : C - Data Types ) i.e it can hold up to 1.7 * (10^308) ... very huge.. right !!! 10^30  <<<  1.7 * (10^308) Though the precision is limited to 15 decimals, it will work for almost all the regular competitive programming problems.. unless otherwise it is a rare problem which is designed to make use of Big integer (Java) and other libraries :) The code goes like this : double a = 1e30 , b = 1e30; double c = a+b; printf("a+b = %lf",c); Updated 5 Apr • View Upvotes
