In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?Since pointers only have to store memory locations of other variables then why don't they all have a a single data type?
Pointers are a primitive form of iterators. All modern systems address data as bytes. Thus incrementing an address value in a pointer will make it point to the next byte -Â  however, typed pointers have the pointed data type size implicitly described in them, thus an int* pointer when incremented with ++ will increment the memory address that it stores not by 1, but by sizeof(int) - thus the pointer now points to the next int in memory. Arithmetic on pointers happens multiplied by the size of the pointed type.
