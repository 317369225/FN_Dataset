What are some mind-blowing facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?
The Case Of The Big Bang Ants We all reminisce and fondly remember the static on analogue televisions while changing channels (some of you might still be receiving an analogue connection...Lucky you!). I called it "ants" back then. These ants, I discovered years later, comprised of interference. And what astonishes me to this day is the fact that 1% of the static is due to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMR), which is the remnant radiation of the Big Bang. This means the radiation is about 13.6 billion years old and originated with the Universe's birth! This ought to be humbling. So, every time you had observed "ants" on your screen, you were actually observing the birth of the Universe. Right there on the sofa, while munching on popcorn. A relic of the birth of the Universe! Isn't this an awe-inspiring, mind-numbing, one hell of a fact?! How this hiss was discovered makes for another interesting tidbit- BONUS- In 1964, Dr. Robert Wilson and Dr. Arno Penzias, while working in a radio observatory, detected weird mysterious noise, or "hiss". They thought this was because of the radio receiver dishes, so they ran out to check 'em out. To their amazement, they found the antenna equipment layered with "pigeon poop". They were annoyed, and immediately arranged for the cleaning. They delightedly went ahead with another round of observation. To their utter dismay and frustration, they found out that the removal of the poop couldn't eliminate the hiss. After much deliberation, they decided the noise was due to some other unknown-at-the-time factor. This then resulted in the CMR theory being posited (not by them), which was then proven years later. Those pigeons sure had a field day troubling these two chaps.
