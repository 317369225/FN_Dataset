What's the hardest bug you've debugged?
The Time Bomb. I was working for a logistics company, where a Regular Order Job runs every morning to create shipping orders for Major customers. It creates bookings based on specific templates. One random day the job stopped working in production. No code drops, no app server config changes, The last updates to data in the tables it was accessing, was done like two months ago. There were no exceptions in the logs, it was just getting hung. Increased the logging levels (or pointed my eclipse code to production data set, dont tell anyone), I identified that it was getting hung while trying to generate a service incident in service desk, because some orders were failing some validations. Identified that there was a bug in that block or the API it was accessing , it was not returning back the call if the incident failed for some reason. Raised it with the relevent team, but still why NOW ? This exception block was never accessed before because of validation rules in place while generating the templates itself. There was no data changes related to those templates. My manager just joked that its like a time bomb, just exploded out of no where. I immediately jumped up with joy saying, "Yeah you know what, you are right". And fixed the problem in next 20 mins. Actually, there was a concept of holiday in those templates, while the system was in pilot and there were no validations in the system, some one messed with one template and created a holiday of 5 years. After 5 years, when the system was live and in business, that holiday period got over for that template and it started generating validation errors, which then lead to access of that service desk block and hung the job. And woah, that was my moment.
