What are the differences between the double and float data types?
A floating point number is an extension of an older format, called fixed-point numbers. A fixed point number would store a fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point (in binary). For example, +1110101.00001000 is an example of a 16-bit fixed point number in 7.8 format (one bit is spent on the sign). A floating point number adds an exponent, something like +1.01101001E0000001. This one would also be 16 bits (the leading 1 is implied). This allows for expressing a much wider range of values, but the precision is variable. It's called a 'floating' point number because you can think of the decimal point as floating around arbitrarily, instead of always being at a fixed position. The term double is short for "double-precision floating point number." It literally means that twice as many bits are used for storing it as the regular floating point number. On a typical modern machine, floats are 32 bits (1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23* for the value), while doubles are 64 bits (1 bit for the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52* bits for the value). *Elsewhere, like Wikipedia, you'll see 24 bits and 53 bits quoted as the size of the mantissa for single and double floating point numbers; this is correct, but the first bit is always 1, and that 1 isn't stored. The numbers I give here are for the amount of required storage; note that they add up to 32 and 64. Updated 16 Aug â€¢ View Upvotes
