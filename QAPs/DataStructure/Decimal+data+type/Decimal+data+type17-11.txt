What are the differences between the double and float data types?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a a single-precision floating point number and a double-precision floating point number?The number of bits used to store the value in computer memory. The resolution between the numbers that can be represented exactly when approaching minimum and maximum bounds. There is a greater subset of all numbers N that can be represented exactly in double precision than in single precision. For numbers past the decimal point, double precision is typically more accurate for a N than single precision. However, this is not guaranteed, due to the resolution between numbers that can be represented exactly. Answered off the top of my head, so you should verify these statements.
