What are the differences in laymen terms between data structures vs. data types?
A data type is a generic label for any unique category of information a computer can store. This can be something simple like a number or letter. It can also something more complicated like a representation of an email. Data structures are a specific kind of data type. They are data types which store many items in ways that allow you to do useful things with that data (like search through it quickly). As a real world example think of a dictionary. The dictionary has two differnt types of data in it words and definitions. The dictionary itself is a data structure which them and lets you find a definition quickly from a word. However, from the perspective of a book shelf dictionaries are also a data type.
