Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
I never thought I'd see the day someone would ask this question. Back in my early days of web development JavaScript was vilified. It was a tool used to validate forms. To annoy users with alert boxes. My, how far we've come. I'm not bold enough to predict it will be one of the top 5 (or even 3) most important languages to know on the web, because 10 years is an eternity. Things move fast. You never know what breakthrough people come up with. I will admit that the renewed interest in the language and the AMAZING things people are doing with it make it your number one or two tool when developing on the client. (Some would argue CSS is just as important, and let's not forget it begins and ends with markup and HTML5 these days too.) The previous points are spot on. You want to develop on the web today? Right now? You're going to have to increase your JavaScript skills. If only to be able to take advantage of the great innovations we are seeing with the most advanced libraries. Think about it, Microsoft of all companies (remember JScript!?) is now adopting it fully for even its desktop development model. Innovation, indeed.
