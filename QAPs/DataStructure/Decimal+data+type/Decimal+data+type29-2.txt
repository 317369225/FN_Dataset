How does a compiler know about data types?
I believe you are not aware of how compilers/interpreters work. I would like you to inform about how compilers work. When you write any program in any compiled language, your program file is known as source file. It passes through compilation, linking and loading phases, before getting executed. Compilation involves :- 1) First phase includes Lexical, syntactical and semantic analysis of source program and after this analysis an intermediate file is generated, which is used as input for second phase. 2) Second phase takes intermediate file as input and generated an output file, which contains machine lanaguage code, which is linked with other libraries, to produce an executable. Now, coming to your question, a compiler knows whether a given number like 2 or 2.0 is int or float during lexical analysis phase, where whose program is broken into individual tokens and each tokens is compared against the grammar of that language, in which you have developed your program(In fact, for your knowledge, every language has grammar associated with it). Thus, the grammar for integer number determination will be a regular expression like [-|+]<digit>+. Hope, it helps you to clear your doubts. For more information, you have to study how compiler converts source program into machine lanaguage program.
