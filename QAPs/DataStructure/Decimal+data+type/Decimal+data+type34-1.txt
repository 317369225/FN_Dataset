How do I find out the factorial of a big number, like 100, in C?It will be more helpful if you kindly discuss the details of the algorithm to be used in this programming?
For smaller numbers you can use this: #include <stdio.h> long factorial(int); int main() { int number; long fact = 1; printf("Enter a number to calculate it's factorial\n"); scanf("%d", &number); printf("%d! = %ld\n", number, factorial(number)); return 0; } long factorial(int n) { int c; long result = 1; for (c = 1; c <= n; c++) result = result * c; return result; } Now the problem basically asks you to calculate the factorial of a number up to 100 or More. The factorial of a number N is 1*2*…*N. This problem would be very simple, had it not been for the maximum value of N. Calculating factorial of 100 is very simple in languages like python or java which have built-in support for big integer types. It proves to be a hassle for people using C / C++ or languages that do not have a built-in biginteger type. Let’s think about how we can store the the result. Now, the maximum number that we can store in an unsigned 32 bit integer is 2 ^ 32 – 1 and in an unsigned 64 bit integer is 2 ^ 64 – 1. Something like 100!(‘!’ is the notation for factorial) has over 150 decimal digits. The data types mentioned earlier can store numbers having at most 9 and 19 decimal digits respectively. So, we need to find a way to store the 150+ digits that we will get as the answer. The simplest data structure that we can use is an integer array of size of about 200 to be on the safe side.. Here is the code which help u to calculate the factorial of a number 100 or more. This Method can can also applied when we want to calculate 2^1000000 or More. In this method we just want to increase the size of array to get the solution. #include<stdio.h> int main() { int n,a[200],index,temp,i; a[0]=1; index=0; printf("Enter the number\n"); scanf("%d",&n); for(;n>=2;n--) { temp=0; for(i=0;i<=index;i++) { temp=(a[i]*n)+temp; a[i]=temp%10; temp=temp/10; } while(temp>0) { a[++index]=temp%10; temp=temp/10; } } for(i=index;i>=0;i--) printf("%d",a[i]); return 0; }
