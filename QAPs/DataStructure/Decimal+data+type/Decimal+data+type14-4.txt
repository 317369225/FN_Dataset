What's the hardest bug you've debugged?
The One That Wasn't There... Mid-80s, I'm working as a consultant for a medical devices company working on a new generation of Positron emission tomography scanners. Hush-hush, race to beat the big guys to market with a new technique for which the paper hasn't even been refereed yet. I'm the real-time UNIX guy, doing an embedded system. I've done this a zillion times before for other types of control systems, this is my third medical device. I think about it, doodle, prototype a little, then in a three day spree sprint code the whole thing. Type "make install" and watch it compile, build, construct a download package, download to the device, and reboot. And it worked. Perfectly. I. Could. Not. Believe. It. You NEVER write code that actually runs the first time, it's just a stub to kick off the debugging. Everyone knows that. So I ripped it apart, stuck in debugging statements, hooked up logic analyzers out the wazoo, and spent literally a month on it. IT HAS TO BE IN THERE SOMEWHERE I knew it, the project manager knew it. We even brought in a colleague to provide a second set of eyes. Nope. After 6 weeks, we declared defeat. Or victory, as you prefer. There was no bug. It really did work, perfectly, from the first time. And no, I've never replicated that since.
