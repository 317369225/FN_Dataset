What's the hardest bug you've debugged?
Ok so I worked for a telco as a broadband specialist to identify and help solve complex problems. I tried to use an open source gene sequencer to help identify hexadecimal code patterns relating to remotely identifying routers which connected to our network (I managed to identify 80% of the chipsets, and hundreds of router specific problems). I realized that there were a lot of problems which specifically related to the customers routers so finding a way to remotely identify the router could mean that we could datamine en-masse (eg if we compare calls to helpdesk,or speed and stability statistics, grouped by router chipset or brand, then we could remotely identify patterns and then try to reproduce them - eg if it looks like a certain router has a certain issue, we could call that customer and get the router in to try to reproduce it, and then work backwards to the root cause etc). So we found that there was a part of the DSL connection sequence which passed the router signature on authentication. There were 5 specific SNMP MIBs[2] which may be useful, so we setup to strip these results out, and capture these out to a text output. This was all either Ascii, Hexadecimal code, or all sorts of other variations (Examples below) [3] The problem is 1) There are 40,000 unique "brands" or versions of ADSL/DSL/VDSL routers which I am aware of by different names. 2) These are manufactured mainly in China by 5 main manufacturers 3) Each router can have as many as 10-40 different software versions (and each update is to fix a known bug) 4) Each time the modem brand wants a cheaper price, or runs out of stock from one manufacturer, they can jump to the opposition who then often remakes the firmware to the brand's specifications (but can change the MIB identifier). So you have 5 companies, each creating slight different permutations to the hardware (but running various firmware over top). 5) Some didn't use the MIBs correctly (I seem to recall one hardware guy must have got lazy as I saw a lot of routers with the identifier as "I am making a router!" or something similar. 6) Some used a serial code identifier (but with a specific pattern eg first 4 characters might indicate the modem maker) How I found them out So I summed up the common ones to get a count of common router IDS. I searched for these common identifiers and found a bunch of chipset names, or chinese manufacture codes, or worked out that it was the start of a mac address etc. I scraped some DSL router sites, and I had spent heaps of nights doing this research so in the end I got a few PA's in India to search and contact all the modem manufacturers that they could (in my own time and at my own cost). I created a script to generate alternate spellings for each router (eg D-Link 502T could also be D[space]Link 502-T, Dlink 502, etc. ad nauseum) Then I ran this against our helpdesk logs (eg if client calls up and any helpdesk agent across any of the data, is diligent and records somewhere in the notes what brand or modem version they have, then we have that tied against the customer's DSL phone line, and could see that against the MIBs - problem was that the customer could change routers, so this was a fuzzy match). I called all the ISPs and got the router they mainly have, so we could get a strong signal of say "probably a Dynalink as this was the free router given away by Orcon" How we used Genetics So then we took all the hex data and converted each modem string into a "protein chromosome", there were only 16 hex codes, so we didnt use the full 22+ possible. Then we tried to get the sequencer loaded, and then have it run over the holidays to help find the fuzzy patterns. Sadly I got a new Sales Manager job, so never got the chance to finish the loading and learning about genetic sequencing. In summary, we identified about 80-90% of modem chipsets (which is massively helpful!), but did not succeed in using the gene tools, though I am sure that this methodology is sound, and it was a hell of a cool problem for me to throw my nights against. I found out later that the top heads up at ALU (I was chatting to one of the experts out from Switzerland), had all been working on this problem but not had much luck, I think they got about 10-20% identified, but not as many of the routers themselves. If anyone works for a telco, and wants to pay me to finish this work off, and you have some DSLAMS for me to play with, I am really keen to finish off that problem! :-) [1] I am not very good at citations and started on the wrong number.
