How can I compute the average of a large array of integers without running into overflow?
If available: Try using BCD (Binary Coded Decimal): 4 bits per digit, value 0-9, in an array of bytes (growing as the number increases), so 2 digits per byte. The Motorola 68000 microprocessor from the 80's (Atari ST, Commodore Amiga) already supported this data type in assembly, and it's a standard variable type in SAP. If you need to implement it yourself, you only need to write an adder and a divider routine for an average calculation. In that case, of course, you could go all the way and define a base-256 integer scheme, giving you much more value for your storage.
