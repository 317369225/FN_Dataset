In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?Since pointers only have to store memory locations of other variables then why don't they all have a a single data type?
If I divide your question in fragments, two things that shine out are : 1) DATA TYPE 2) POINTERS What does data type suggest ? - It says , what type of value is held by the variable and how much byte(memory) it will reserve. - So, declaring a variable say for example,   int a=10; suggests that it will hold an integer value of 2 bytes(16 bit machine). What does a pointer suggest ? -  Pointer is characterized by what type of address it will hold as a value and it always take FIXED bytes in memory - So, declaring a pointer say for example,  int *p= &a; , suggests that it holds a value in the form address of an integer variable, but difference is that the size required by pointer is independent of the type of value it holds. In short ,POINTERS behave just like other data types,with an exception that it holds an address of a variable instead of value. Thus, it is considered as a data type.
