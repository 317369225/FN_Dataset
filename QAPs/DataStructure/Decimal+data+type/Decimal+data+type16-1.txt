How can I make my c language basics strong?
Start coding in Hackerrank, Codeforces, in  any platform If u start it u ll gradually know that u r learning the language(anything  c, c++, java) perfectly..... And u can become a very strong programmer too. The way I told before ll be  difficult to follow first because of the difficulties u r facing while solving the problem..  May be u ll discontinue the process... So be determined and have interest while solving problems.... And learn library functions and inbuilt functions of a language as much as u can...  Thats it...  You r ready to crack any coding round in interviews....  I prefer Hackerrank because of nice user interface  and  challenging problems from Algorithms and Data structures .....  But the world top coder who won Google Coding competition in 2015 is using Codeforces......That ll be more mathematical....
