Python 3.4 string_1 = "Camelot" string_2 = "place" print ("Let's not go to %s. 'Tis a silly %s." % (string_1, string_2)) , why is syntax error: invalid syntax?
I ran this in Python 2.7.6, it's fine. Maybe Python 3 and later will not like the single quotes inside the doubles and will throw a syntax error. A couple of solutions: print ("""Let's not go to %s. 'Tis a silly %s.""" %(string_1, string_2)) This should work fine. """ starts a multi-line string, so anything inside it should be treated as part of the string until the next """ print ('''Let's not go to %s. 'Tis a silly %s.''' %(string_1, string_2)) Same deal. These are three single quotes print ("Let\'s not go to %s. \'Tis a silly %s." %(string_1, string_2)) Using the \ as an escape tells Python it should treat the single quotes as characters, and not string terminators. This also works with double quotes, like this: print (He said: " \"Camelot is a silly place\" ") Edit: It appears I was wrong, and single quotes inside double quotes is fine in later versions of Python as well, which means you probably have aome problem with indentation or whitespaces.
