Why do we need to use a BigInteger class in programming contests when a double data type can hold values almost up to infinity?
double and any other floating-point types represent numbers in the form of sgn(x)*mantissa*B^exp with base B is often 2 (binary), although there are decimal floating-point types available. They cannot store infinite precision and are accurate only to a few most significant digits. For example the 64-bit double precision type can be precise to about 16-17 decimal digits. 32-bit floats have 23 bits of mantissa so it's only precise to 6-7 decimal digits
