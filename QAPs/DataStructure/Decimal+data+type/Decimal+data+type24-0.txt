Which programming languages are useful in finance?
In my company as a commercial bank I'm working for, I mainly use COBOL for the core banking systems running on the big irons - mainframes,Â  and Java for other open environments like Unix, Linux. Basically, we use COBOL because we have no choice if we have to use mainframes; we use Java because it's the industry level mature language and we'd accomplished most of our applications by using Java which in turn meet our needs in scalability and robustness very well. For some communication facilities which exchange information with external companies, such as Central bank, card organisations, payment gateway or telecommunication service providers, we tend to use C to implement my applications for performance and speed. And recent years, we also use some dynamic languages for DevOps, so Python, Ruby are all our weapons. So financial industry is no difference with other IT companies. What we face to choose is too many rather than too few.
