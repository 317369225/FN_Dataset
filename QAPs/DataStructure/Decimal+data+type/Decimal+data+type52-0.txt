I was unable to reproduce your issue. Python 3.4.1 (v3.4.1:c0e311e010fc, May 18 2014, 10:38:22) [MSC v.1600 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information. >>> string_1 = "Camelot" >>> string_2 = "place" >>> print("Let's not go to %s. 'Tis a silly %s." % (string_1, string_2)) Let's not go to Camelot. 'Tis a silly place. Check your indentation and make sure you're not actually putting this program on the same line, line breaks and other whitespace is significant in Python.
