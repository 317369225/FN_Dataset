What do the terms "base-2" and "base-10" mean in this context?“The problem is, the syllable “dec” stands for the number 10, so the word “decimal” implies a base-10 representation. Because computers store base-2 (not base-10) representations, the word “decimal” to describe such a number is a misnomer.” Excerpt From: Burd, Barry. “Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies.” John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2012-03-12. iBooks.

Base-10 systems are formed by numbers 0-9 (decimal system). Base-2 (a.k.a binary) systems are formed by two only digits, 0 and 1 (which are called bits). 8 bits form a byte. Base-2 systems are so called because each numerical place corresponds to an increasing power of 2 (2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, etc.) and not to a unit like in the decimal system. Notice that we count from 0 because that's how computers work. Computers work with binary system and not with decimal numbers but they translate the binary numbers in a form more understandable to us. In fact binary numbers can be converted into text, as each character corresponds to one byte, according to two different encoding schemes: ASCII (American Standard for Communication and Information Interchange)en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII and Unicode - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. For example, the string Quora, according to the ASCII table, corresponds to binary: 01010001 01110101 01101111 01110010 01100001 . When you enter data to the computer, it's converted to binary and, when you process it (e.g. print a Word document), it's converted back to text and numbers but so fast that you don't realize it. To convert a decimal number to binary you have to consider only the ones and where they fall. That's because 1 corresponds to a state when there's an electrical charge, i.e. "on", while 0 corresponds to a state when there's no electrical charge, i.e. "off". For example 3 in binary is: 00000011. Why? There are only two bits on (i.e. two ones): the rightmost, which is 2^0=1 and the one next to it, which is 2^1=2. If we sum both values, we have 2+1=3. I hope now the concept is clearer for you.
