What's the hardest bug you've debugged?
A known glibc bug. When PayPal (product) was internationalizing its code base in early 2003 we had a bug pretty close to the release date that caused certain pages on the site to segfault when displaying non-ASCII text. After a long evening of debugging and valgrind-ing I tracked it down to a known glibc issue (forget what the function was) that was only manifesting itself when LC_LANG was not set. The PayPal codebase was in C++, so we sure as hell had plenty of bugs of our own. The hardest part was realizing that I had to look beyond our code, but the evidence finally persuaded me. I remember feeling like I hit the jackpot when I Googled for glibc bugs out of pure desperation.
