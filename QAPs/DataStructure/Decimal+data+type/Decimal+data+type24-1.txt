Which programming languages are useful in finance?
Just like for most jobs, you need a tool box.  I can't think of a single high level programming language that doesn't support some kind of Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) data type, which tend to be a lot more resistant to rounding error than floats or reals, when doing money calculations. In the mid 80's through the early 90's I worked as a software engineer on a banking software product called ManageMasters.  It was coded in C/C++, but Java would work as well for general data processing.  There are probably some legacy systems in COBOL or FORTRAN still out there. However, If I remember my graduate business courses, finance tends to use a lot of statistical and mathematical model and can require some pretty complex techniques, like predictive analysis etc.  With that in mind I'd suggest adding R or SAS to your toolbox.  I should also point out that using R together with Python is becoming popular for many types of data analysis.
