What are the differences between the double and float data types?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a float and a double?In languages like C and FORTRAN (where a "double" is called "double precision"), a double is typically understood to have twice the number of bits as a float.  This isn't always true, although a double will always have at least as many bits of precision as a float in any sane implementation. On most modern hardware (such as Intel or Sparc), a float is 32 bits and a double is 64 bits.  They typically are implemented using (at least some subset of) IEEE floating point representation. Some programming languages implement a "long double", which can be up to 16 bytes long.  There are also "infinite precision" packages such as the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library.
