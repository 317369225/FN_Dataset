Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
At least in web development circles, it is the lingua franca.  There are many choices for back end languages and frameworks but the PHP and Ruby folks can relate over JavaScript.  I consider knowledge of JS essential because it gives you more options.  Some forms of logic belong in the front end.
