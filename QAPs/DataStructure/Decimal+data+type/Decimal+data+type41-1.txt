How do I multiply two large numbers stored as strings in the C#?
I'm assuming here that the values are too large to store as numbers an hence numerical operations are ou of the question . I don't know how to code any more so the code part you have to figure out for yourself , I can give you is a process that works. The two numbers numstring1[n] , numstring2[n2] An array of strings of length n2 arrastring[n2] And a few temporary integer values inttemp[5] Now Inttemp1=numsteing1(element n) Inttemp2=numstring2(element n2) Inttemp3=inttemp1*inttemp2 arrsteing(element 1)= units place of inttemp3 Busy now will complete later sorry
