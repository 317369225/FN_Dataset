What does strongly typed mean in .net framework?
A strongly-typed programming language is one in which each type of data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth)  is predefined as part of the programming language and all constants or  variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the  data types. Certain operations may be allowable only with certain data  types. The language compiler enforces the data typing and use compliance. An advantage of strong  data typing is that it imposes a rigorous set of rules on a programmer  and thus guarantees a certain consistency of results. A disadvantage is  that it prevents the programmer from inventing a data type not  anticipated by the developers of the programming language and it limits  how "creative" one can be in using a given data type.
