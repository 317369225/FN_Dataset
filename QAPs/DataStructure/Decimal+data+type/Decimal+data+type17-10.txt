What are the differences between the double and float data types?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a a single-precision floating point number and a double-precision floating point number?The difference is the number of bits used to store the number. A float is 4 bytes (32 bits) and a double is 8 bytes (64 bits). If we were looking at integers, a 32 bit number could hold any value between 0 and (2^32)-1 (a little over 4 billion), usually a data type would actually allow for negative numbers and allow -2^31 to (2^31)-1. The number of values you can hold double with each extra bit, so by the time you get to 2^64 (for a 64 bit integer usually referred to as a long) you have a very large number ( 18,446,744,073,709,551,616). When these bits are used for floating point numbers rather than integers the greater number of bits in a double allows for much greater precision and scale.
