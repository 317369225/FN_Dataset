How does a compiler know about data types?
The compiler implementations are specific to every language i.e. a C compiler would be different from a Java compiler. Though there are few generalisations. Let me Explain the process of compilation with respect to a C compiler.You can see a  compiler consisting of two two pieces 1.analysis 2.synthesis Analysis part breaks up the source program  into constituent pieces and imposes grammatical structure on them.It is this part which detects that source program is syntactically ill formed or semantically unsound The synthesis part constructs the desired target program from some intermediate representation of the source program generated from the synthesis part. The synthesis and analysis parts involves various phases as shown:   the lexical analysis part receives the source program and breaks the input stream into tokens. Token is of the form < token-name,attribute-value> for example say the source program contains a statement a=10 then corresponding token would be something like <id,10> meaning a  is an identifier whose value is 10. the next phases involve syntax analyser which generates a syntax tree for the expression with the  node being the token. Semantic analyser performs type checking i.e an operator has matching operands.And also type conversions whenever possible say if I add an integer with a float, then the the integer would get converted to float implicitly by deafult.
