What are the differences between the double and float data types?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a float and a double?In Java, double is a 64-bit precision IEEE 754 floating point, while float is a 32-bitÂ  precision IEEE 754 floating point. If you want to create a float, you should end your number with f (i.e.: 3.6f). In simple words, float is less precise than a double for storing real numbers.
