How is an integer value stored in the memory in C?for example for the statments int a=456; signed int a=2357;and how is a float value been stored float a=34.125;
You asked how is an integer represented in memory? Many diagrams exist on the Web with great explanations. The simplest answer is that an integer is stored as patterns of charged electricity. The problem then is you have to explain that through layers of abstraction that map from physical to logical addressing ending in virtual memory accessed through the code runtime mechanism (usually encoded to C language convention). A more complete explanation exist in the writings of Kip Irvine, Jeff Duntemann, Randall Hyde and Richard Reese. They take their time with the explanation in which you can examine each abstraction in detail. Ultimately, an integer is stored in physical hardware expressed through the migration of energy.
