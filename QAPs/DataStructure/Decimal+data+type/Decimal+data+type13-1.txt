What are the differences in laymen terms between data structures vs. data types?
A data type is a classification that identifies a certain type of value. Integers, boolean (true or false values), characters, and floating point numbers are examples of a data type. Data types determine: the type and range of values that can be stored. the operations that can be performed on the values of a data type. the way the values of the given type are handled and stored in memory. A data structure is an abstraction that organizes data. It typically contains one or more data types grouped together in order to accomplish a structural goal. Let's consider for instance a simple data structure, the array: An array is a collection of values of a certain data type. Every values has a position known as an index. Consider an array that can store 5 integers. It will have indices ranging from 0 to 4. At every index, a value can be stored conforming to the integer data type.
