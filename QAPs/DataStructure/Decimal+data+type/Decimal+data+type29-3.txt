How does a compiler know about data types?
Indeed the compiler found out it is a float , by seeing the decimal point like us. When we have constants , that is the only way , a compiler can know if that is a float or double or not. It maintains a table of all declared variables along with the data types that has been used for declaring them. If the value of the variable does not fall in between the range of the data types mentions , it terms them as error. However if the error can be removed by typecasting , it does implicit casting. If the error cannot be removed , it flags it to us that the wrong use of variable or other kind of error messages.
