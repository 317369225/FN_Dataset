What's the hardest bug you've debugged?
While working at the largest backend telecommunication equipment company in the world, on my checkin, 10 different types of backbone routers stopped communicating to their control servers. That is, on 10 different platforms, there was no way to transfer the new code to the router. (It was actually more than 10 platforms, probably like 25-40, but since I can't remember I put in 10. Yes, 25-40 - all one code base in C ... #IFDEF hell :) ) So the whole company's build failed on my checkin. And I get a "nice" email from the CTO. Of course the bug wasn't in my code.  :) ... What had happened was that on my checkin, the size of the image on all these platforms had become an exact multiple of 1024 bytes. And I discovered that when the size of the image was an exact multiple of 1024 bytes a bug in the FTP code would make the transfer hang, because it would drop the second last packet.  Insidious! If I remember correctly, it was one of those "off by 1" bugs. I still can't believe I found that bug as I had never ventured near that code ever before, and it was a huge code base. After finding the bug I got a congratulatory letter from the CTO and two sleepless nights :). The engineer assigned to fix the bug calls me up and with the magic of xkibitz I coded the fix in his repository which he then checked in and tested. Yes, these were the days of single-threaded embedded systems. Updated 24 Jul • View Upvotes
