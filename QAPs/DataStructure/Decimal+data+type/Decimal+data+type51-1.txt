How do I write a C++ program to add 10^30 and 10^30 efficiently?P.S I often face this big integer arithmetic problem during programming contests because of which i am unable to solve simple problems during contests. It would be helpful if you would provide some resources to do this arithmetic. I don't want to use Java BigInteger class and purely use c++.
Just as a complement, in case your numbers aren't in range of double precision, you can create a dynamically allocated array to store the digits, and then create functions to replicate the expected behavior of basic operations (addition, multiplication, and so on). Example: For addition, you can add digit-by-digit, and perform the carry operations manually.
