What do the terms "base-2" and "base-10" mean in this context?“The problem is, the syllable “dec” stands for the number 10, so the word “decimal” implies a base-10 representation. Because computers store base-2 (not base-10) representations, the word “decimal” to describe such a number is a misnomer.” Excerpt From: Burd, Barry. “Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies.” John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2012-03-12. iBooks.

For whatever reason, this question was in my Quora feed today, though I seem to be a little late to the party. Other answers have touched on the concept, but there may be a little more to say about positional number systems.. In general, a base-n number system will have n available digits per position. While base-1 may be a special case, any n > 1 will tend to have some symbol associated to a value from 0 to (n-1). As mentioned in other answers, base-2 uses 0 to 1 (2-1); base-10 uses 0 to 9 (10-1); base-16 uses 0 to f (16-1), as the digits above 9 tend to be represented by letters of the alphabet. The detail I found missing, though it may be obvious, is that each digit's value is weighted by its position -- typically this is n^position (or n**position or pow(n, position) or whatever syntax you use for exponentiation). So, in base-10, the 'value' of a number like 123 in base-10 is 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0. If 123 is a base-4 number, you'll have 1*4^2 + 2*4^1 + 3*4^0.
