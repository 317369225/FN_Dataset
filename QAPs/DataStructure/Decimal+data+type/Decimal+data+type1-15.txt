Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
Within 30 years, mostly everything will be written in JavaScript or another language that can be compiled like C++. Thus, you should learn it. That is to say, learn only languages that can be compiled and HTML and CSS, which could be and are also maybe compiled depending on which Webkit you're using. So, I'm guessing that you'll be doing fast things with the HAL in the way with JavaScript and that makes it a smart choice. If you understood this, learn JavaScript and C and then modify V8 so it can determine when the program on the page and all of its finite input are such that it can stop scanning for changes to the Hydrogen graph.  This is not the halting problem, so you can solve it.  Ask Knuth for help if you get frozen. Actually, beg him.  Three times.
