What are the actual differences between %d, %u and %p format specifiers used in C to print the memory address of a variable?
Another way to look at it is to think about how it would be implemented. Once processing reaches the print function it has to decide what to do with the value to be printed. The most straightforward way is to use a "switch" statement to branch to different cases based on the format type string. For example the %d case must be able to convert the hex value of the print argument into each of the ASCII character values to print out the value as a series of decimal digits.
