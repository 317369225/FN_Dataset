Why would you append an F to the end of a value of a floating point literal in Java? (e.g. float ratio = 0.2363F;) Isn't that already specified in the data type "float"? What happens if I don't include the f? Does something similar happen in the integer data types?I'm learning java by myself reading some books. Im having some trouble understanding the following statement: "Java assumes that all floating point literals are of type double".
Decimals are by default double type in java. Thats the reason, to have it treat as float, you always suffix with 'f' (case insensitive). fyi, whole numbers are by default int.
