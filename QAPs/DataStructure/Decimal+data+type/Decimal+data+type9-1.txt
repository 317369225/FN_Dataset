What is the difference between float and double in C language? How is it stored in the memory?
The default choice for a floating-point type should be double.  This is also the type that you get with floating-point literals without  a suffix or (in C) standard functions that operate on floating point  numbers (e.g. exp, sin, etc.). float should only be used if you need to operate on a  lot of floating-point numbers (think in the order of thousands or more)  and analysis of the algorithm has shown that the reduced range and  accuracy don't pose a problem. long double can be used if you need more range or accuracy than double, and if it provides this on your target platform. In summary, float and long double should be reserved for use by the specialists, with double for "every-day" use.
