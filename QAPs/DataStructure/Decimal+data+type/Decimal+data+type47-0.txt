How do I print recurring parts of decimal fractions in Java without the loss of precision?
Queries: What do you exactly mean by loss of precision? Are you asking to convert into another data type without compromising precision? Is your data stored in a primitive data type or do you want to go for user defined ones? For type conversion, don't convert as you will loose precision(eg: double -> float, double -> integer, etc). I would suggest to use string comparison for extracting only decimal part(algo follows below). For user defined data type, I would suggest to use string type as it would be easy to extract and check boundary conditions. Algorithmic steps - Use string variable to store the number, find the position of decimal point and print from the next char to the end! Hope it helps! Feel free to comment! Thnx for reading!
