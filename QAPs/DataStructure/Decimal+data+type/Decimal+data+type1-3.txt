Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
2 Reasons: Interaction and API Communication Javascript has become the language for interaction.  That is the nature of the web: interacting with data.  Javascript handles AJAX communication as well as the dynamic events within a website.  Without Javascript, a site would seem very basic and outdated (and therefore burdensome).   Javascript, or more specifically Javascript Object Notation (JSON) has become the standard way for APIs to communicate data to other sites.
