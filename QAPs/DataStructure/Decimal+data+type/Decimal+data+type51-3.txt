How do I write a C++ program to add 10^30 and 10^30 efficiently?P.S I often face this big integer arithmetic problem during programming contests because of which i am unable to solve simple problems during contests. It would be helpful if you would provide some resources to do this arithmetic. I don't want to use Java BigInteger class and purely use c++.
If you are allowed to, use big number libraries But are you sure you really need to use that? There are hundreds of competitive programming problems that at first look like big numbers problems, but are to slow to solve by this route,Â  and have faster algorithms that dont require big numbers to operate. For example, finding how many trailing zeros there are after a big factorial, its a trivial problem with big numbers, but takes to long to solve. But there is a very fast algorithm to do that
