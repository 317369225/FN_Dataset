Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
Web developers face a totally different set of challenges/problems than their counter parts who deal with databases and business logic. Web development has to think problems different altogether as we have to consider the network latency in all our programming and less about computational complexity.  JavaScript is a language that keeps evolving to address the concerns of web development than computational complexity. It doesn't expect you to handle memory management, garbage collection, type casting,  allows you to build loosely coupled frameworks still within the same page. Having said that, being a web developer, learning JavaScript helps you solve a lot of challenges you face in front end development.
