What are some mind-blowing facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?
The fact that we modern humans lived with, fought with and interbred with Neanderthals,generally classified by palaeontologists as a separate species Homo Neanderthalensis, for nearly 5000 years before they went extinct! (More specifically, over a 2,600–5,400 years span at 95.4% probability). Most people have this conception emanating from the popular culture  narrative that 'Neanderthals' were basically us in the primitive Caveman phase of our evolution. But modern research [Ref 1] shows that the modern man, after migrating from Africa roughly 60,000 years ago, 'bumped' into these Neanderthals in the plains of Europe/Eurasia,  competed with them, lived with them and ahem, mated with them over at least 2 millennia! Just imagine that! To put things into perspective, just imagine your neighbor being from another species married to one of your cousins and that cute girl in the Hunting 101 class actually not belonging to your species! Really puts this whole inter-racial non-sense into perspective doesn't it? [Ref1] Page on nature.com
