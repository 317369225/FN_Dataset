Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
Javascript make you a better developer. Period. Nowdays most web developers use Java, .Net, php, python or ruby for server-side development, and the problem with that is, they all are very much alike paradigm wise. Even though most of these languages are multi-paradigm, in the realm of web development OOP is imperative (pun intended). Javascript, however, is very different. Syntax might be similar to Java/C, but the semantics are more like Self and Scheme. Trying to code some non-trivial app with javascript the way you do it in these other languages is a very frustrating activity. On the other hand, when using all the expresiveness provided by the language in the form of high order functions and prototype-based inheritance, the experience can be very positive.
