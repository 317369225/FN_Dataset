Why is learning JavaScript (programming language) important for web developers?As opposed to other languages? What does it do well? What does it not do well?
Simply said, there are three languages that rule the Internet, everything else is exchangeable. Those are HTML, CSS and Javascript (people might argue that the first two are not languages, but that is beyond the point of this discussion). If you want to do remotely anything on the web these days you must know Javascript, there is simply no way around it. In terms of what it does not do well: Variable scoping, a lot of verbosity, obscure this pointer handling, no decimal data type, and no great built in module system (this is more a browser issue imho, but it is being addressed right now). Other than that is actually a great language, and when used through Coffeescript one does away with all the little annoyances. And as a bonus you can create an entire web platform just in Javascript, from accessing the database through the backend to the web and clients through Phone Gap.
