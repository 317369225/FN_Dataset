What's the hardest bug you've debugged?
It's not my hardest bug but it's one of the most fun to tell about. I was working on Midnight Club: Los Angeles for PS3 and 360, past first, second, maybe event third submission (Rockstar had a habit of leaning pretty hard on the console first party QA teams, probably one of the reasons why Microsoft now charges a ton of money for multiple submissions). One particular race our designers are reporting their tires get kicked up a bit too high into the air when they drive over a single curb in a hairpin turn, causing them to go a bit wide and occasionally slam into a building. They can reproduce it 80% of the time, but only by running the first few minutes of the race, and the effect is pretty subtle. They're playing the release build we submitted, so obviously I ask them to try to reproduce it in a debug build where we log the hell out of everything. In fact I owned much of the logging system because we used the system to detect divergences in the deterministic race replay logic and I had been responsible for instant replays. No dice. 20 races later we still haven't seen it happen in a debug build. Maybe we imagined it. Fire up release again, and it's pretty clear the car is handling a bit different over this particular curb. Only one curb. In the entire freaking city of Los Angeles we modeled. Needless to say, when we're past third submission and we have to ship for the holidays or we're all doomed, we don't want to waste any time. I start bisecting possible changes between our release and debug configurations. Eventually we get it down to "logging enabled" = "car drives fine," "logging disabled" = "tires bounce off the curb too much." Well shit. We enabled the logging function calls in release builds but left the functions themselves as empty stubs. Never did figure it out. Game shipped. Onto the next project. I figure it was uninitialized stack variables but we'll never know.
