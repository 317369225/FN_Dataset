What are some mind-blowing facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?
Kris Holm lives and works in Vancouver for an engineering consulting firm as a geoscientist. He lives with his wife and daughter in Vancouver. He comes across as a pretty nice, regular guy... But Kris Holm leads a double life. When he's not at his day job or with his family, he's doing insane things on a unicycle. He has: Ridden along the Great Wall of China (on the wall). Ridden through the Himalayas in the Kingdom of Bhutan. Climbed and descended (on unicycle) Licancabur, a 5950m volcano in Bolivia. Performed similar feats on the summit of the highest mountain in Central America & the summit of the 3rd highest mountain in North America. You can also find videos of him performing insane technical feats on a unicycle, coasting over 50mph, riding along the circular hand rail of a huge bridge, doing jumps and drops on some of the technical mountain biking trails in Whistler. He's still, over the age of forty, one of the most technically gifted unicyclists in the world and he is without a doubt, the sport's all time greatest athlete. Also he is one of the main pioneers of the disciplines of mountain unicycling and trials unicycling, so he kind of invented the sport too. So if you met this guy at a work conference, and someone told you all these facts about him, would you believe it?
