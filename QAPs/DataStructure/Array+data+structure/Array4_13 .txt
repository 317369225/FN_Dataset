Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?The main advantage of STL containers like vector, is that you gain access to a whole host of vetted algorithms that you would otherwise have to jerry-rig with error-prone pointer arithmetic. The main disadvantage of STL containers, prior to C++11, was obligatory copy semantics. Excepting performance-critical code, there really is no reason not to prefer STL containers and algorithms with a modern C++ compiler.
