How do I revert the array bracket syntax " []" to the old "array()" in PHP?I didn't realize that the cpanel uses php 5.3 while brackets are introduced in 5.4 Is there any quick tip/editor since I already code Laravel with brackets? PS: I code with Sublime Text 3This is why it's always worth developing using the same versions as your production server, for all components of the stack. It's going to be tricky to make this edit, because square brackets have meaning in PHP 5.3, as array element notation. I would search for the easy cases first, like a space before square brackets, or square brackets that contain commas. Those are most likely to be PHP 5.4 style array notation. But there are exceptions to every pattern, so you'll have to inspect them one by one anyway. After you think you've edited all the clear cases, install a copy of PHP 5.3 locally and use "php -l myscript.php" to check for syntax errors in each file, until you correct them all.
