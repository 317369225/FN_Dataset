Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?question when you are talking are array are you talking about, MFC CArray, std::array or plain old C arrays.  If you are talk about MFC CArray please stay away from them unless you are working older code, and cannot change to std::vector.  Both of other types arrays can offer better the complier to create memory allocation because you cannot grow of shine the size of you array and do immediate construction of multiple objects. Also, although the vector has the keyword reserve this is not called during costustion of the object.  If you mean plain old C arrays like the following: 1 int foo[10]; The only times I could using this type of array is when you need C compatibility or if I am using a complier that has no support for std::array or even if you need to uses an interface to old code.  std::array can be better that C array in the sense that they also use many ot the algorithm library written in C++ standard.
