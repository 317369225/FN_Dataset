Why do array indices start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?They don't. In a lot of languages, array indices start from 1. In some, such as Pascal, they can index between any pair of numbers you like. Actually it's quite easy to get C to do this. Numerical Recipes has a nice set of subroutines for this. To make C++ index from 1, you might write something like this: 123 float *a; a=new float [10]; a--; Of course, to delete a, you need to set it back to regular, zero-based indexing: 12 a++; delete [] a;
