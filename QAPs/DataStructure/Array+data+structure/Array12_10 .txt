Is array [] and array* one and the same thing while using as parameter inside a swap function? For eg. int swap (int array[]) works same as int swap (int array*).Yes. I do not have much to add to the existing answers, since I don't have much knowledge of C++. But in C, arrays are treated as pointers, and there is no way of determining the size of the array. An alternate method of assigning arrays is using the variable as pointer and then using malloc.
