Given an array of N integers, how can you find M elements to remove so that the array will end up in sorted order?First compute the longest nondecreasing subsequence in N log N time. A really simple algorithm to do this (that only uses arrays and binary search) can be found here: Longest increasing subsequence - Efficient algorithms Let's suppose the longest subsequence has L elements. Then if L < N - M, there isn't any way to solve the problem since there's no subsequence of length N - M that's still sorted. Otherwise, just remove the N - L elements that aren't in the subsequence, and then remove more at random until exactly M total have been removed. In all this is an N log N algorithm.
