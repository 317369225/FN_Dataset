Is array [] and array* one and the same thing while using as parameter inside a swap function? For eg. int swap (int array[]) works same as int swap (int array*).Yes. They're one and the same. Apart from the example that you've provided, issue arises if you just pass a pointer and trying to find the size of the array. With array being passed you can find the size using sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]), which may not be possible with a compliant compiler.
