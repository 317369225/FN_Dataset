How do I revert the array bracket syntax " []" to the old "array()" in PHP?I didn't realize that the cpanel uses php 5.3 while brackets are introduced in 5.4 Is there any quick tip/editor since I already code Laravel with brackets? PS: I code with Sublime Text 3You might actually be able to use a tool called "sgrep" from Facebook - facebook/pfff Basically, what it does is builds an abstract syntax tree of the source files you're searching and then searches for the actual expression you're looking for in that tree. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like sgrep will do the replacements for you though. What you could do is once you have the instances of [] initialization use, use a couple of RegEx patterns to automatically convert them.
