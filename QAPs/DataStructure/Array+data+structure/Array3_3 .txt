What's the difference between multidimensional arrays and simply having arrays of arrays?Arrays of arrays can have lines (or columns depending on how you want to think about them) of different sizes, while a multidimensional array will have them all the same. Another difference is that in the case of arrays of arrays you can swap lines very easily, since it's a matter of swapping pointers.
