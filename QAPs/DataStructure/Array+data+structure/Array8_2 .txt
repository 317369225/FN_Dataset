Is it faster to compare arrays of integers or arrays of characters?I'm searching through an AVL tree and trying to determine whether to index each node with the (string) data it models, or if I should create a numerical representation of the data. There are millions of nodes, so maximum search speed is optimal here.At the hardware level, what matters is the size of an integer v/s a character in terms of words (e.g. 64 bits). If they are of the same size in the language you are using, then the choice shouldn't matter. In Java, an integer uses 32 bits whereas a character uses 16 bits (UTF-16 encoding). An optimized compiler may be able to stuff 2 integers or 4 characters in a word (on 64 bit machines). With that logic, I suspect comparing an array of characters would be twice as fast as an array of integers.
