Is array [] and array* one and the same thing while using as parameter inside a swap function? For eg. int swap (int array[]) works same as int swap (int array*).They are identical. In both cases, the parameter "arr" has type "int *" (pointer to int). According to C11 standard, section 6.7.6.3 paragraph 7: A declaration of a parameter as ‘‘array of type’’ shall be adjusted to ‘‘qualified pointer totype’’, [...]Or C++11 standard, section 8.3.5 paragraph 5: [...] After determining the type of each parameter, any parameter of type “array of T” [...] is adjusted to be “pointer to T” [...] When the compiler sees "int []" as parameter type, it pretends that it is "int *" instead.
