How can I find the center of an array of geocodes?The problem with all three of the methods so far (k-means, mean, and geographic center in ArcGIS) is that all of them are going to choose an area southwest of Chicago. All of these are going to find the latitude and longitude that minimize the squared distance between the predicted value and each observation. Notice how on your chart there are very few points north of Chicago and the ones to the east are closer than the ones to the west. A median would be less biased by the far off points, but still faces the same problem as the mean. You'll need to give some more thought about what your assumption is about the generating process of the points on your chart. If you have that, then it is a relatively simple minimization to find the most likely point to have generated those points (maximum likelihood estimation).
