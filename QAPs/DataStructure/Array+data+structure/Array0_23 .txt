Why do array indices start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?Depends on how high is the language abstraction on the array construction. The base, processor friendly way to address an element of an array is array[element number]=array base address+ element number*element size With that implementation you get the first element starting in zero. A lot of not very high level languages used it (i.e. C) and others, even if of higher abstraction level, did the same for compatibility. Anyway, not all languages do it that way.
