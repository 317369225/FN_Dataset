Why do array indices start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?When you have to think about where in memory each element is stored, indexing from 0 can really help. For example, if you know that your array is stored at memory location "p" and each element takes up 4 bytes of memory space, then you can calculate the memory address of each element as "p+(4*index)". The address of the first element can now be easily calculated as p, the second one is stored at p + 4 and so on.
