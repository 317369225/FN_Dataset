I am somewhat not comfortable with the term array of 'objects'. What we actually create is an array of 'references' which refer to obejcts. The array of references is itself also an object ( Arrays are objects in java) Like Student[] students; // declared a reference to an array (array of 'Student' type references). students= new Student[5]; // created an array to store 5 Student references. The variable 'students' is made to refer to it. Now, the Student references in the array can be made to refer to any Student object (existing/new one). Methods and messages to that object can be sent by using that very refernces Student s=new Student("Tom"); s.setRollNo(1); students[0]=new Student("John"); student [0].setRollNo(2) students[1]=s; .....and so on
