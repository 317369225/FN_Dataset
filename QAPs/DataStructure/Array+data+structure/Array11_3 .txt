What is the best way to store an array of arrays in a MySQL table?The ideal way would be either serialize it or convert it to json for storing. But if the array is serialized for converted to json, it will not be possible to query the table for a particular key/value pair or a key/value pair within another array. So, if querying within the array is important, a 2 dimensional array of the with the first dimension as i and second dimension as j can be stored as <i, j, value> in the table. Similarly, an array with 3 dimensions - i, j and k can be stored as <i, j, k, value>. For a select query, we will have to query all the dimensions for getting the required value. Select value from arrayTable where i=? and j=? and k=?; Now the problem with this structure is that our table is fixed based on the number of dimensions in the array. A 3 dimensional array will typically have 4 columns for storing the array. What happens if we intend to store a 4 or a 5 dimensional array. Either alter the table and add extra columns for defining dimensions taking the maximum number of dimensions that the array would support into consideration. A better solution would be to use a nosql like mongodb where an alter would not be required as columns would be automatically added when needed.
