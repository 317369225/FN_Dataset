People who work for petroleum companies: How do you see your role in global warming?
If you don't like petroleum, get off the grid. Stop using automated transport, and plastics. Make your own food from seeds you have developed,  Gather manure to fertilize your crops. Stop buying clothing from Bangladesh and Nicaragua, Stop flying, get off your cell phone and off the internet. Shut your lights off. Go find wood to cook with, and don't forget to find an ax or machete to split that wood - don't be using no chain saw. Haul some water. Haul a lot of water, because you need water all the time, for every activity. And don't use water from some standpipe - that was pumped with petroleum. Get to the creek or river, or a hand pump.  And don't be drinking water from plastic - that's petroleum. Heat your water on the wood stove. Use an outhouse. Once you get on your homestead, where you are not using the grid, then talk to me about the evils of petroleum. Because your life is so enormously wonderful because of petroleum. All the things you take for granted - they are so much from petroleum.
