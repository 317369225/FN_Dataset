Narcissism: How does someone abused by a narcissist (mother) resolve their anger?
Simply, how does one resolve anger from abuse is the crux and that includes anger towards yourself for "allowing" it to happen.  Narcissists are the icing on the cake.  Forgive yourself, as it is not your fault.  Look beyond their behavior- you are not the only victim, most likely- and realize there is no guilt or perception of wrongdoing on their part because it is a psychological issue.  And "that" is beyond your control. If you were made to feel weak or otherwise "defective" and are now even more so because you are depressed, then abusers have accomplished necessary goal- to be top dog.  I think breaking free is the hardest step because there is so little acceptance by society that a charming person could possibly do the kind of things that you experienced or "fabricated."  And they are so good at manipulation. It is a different mind set.  Have you ever noticed how narcissists tend to gravitate towards each other socially?  It is often in the privacy of their own homes or work place that they are abusive.  Resolving anger is a major hurdle and the best advice I could give (which I am actively trying for myself) is to be proud of yourself for the strength to break away and recognize the signs for future pitfalls and know that letting go of the anger will ultimately make you healthier and stronger and give you the karmic advantage.  Peace.
