Is there a Desiderata for the Digital Age called DIGIRATA?
Desiderata 2000 Matt Wuerker's Editorial Cartoons Go placidly amid the spam and .coms, and remember what peace there may be in crashed hard drives. Speak your truth in HTML; and listen to others, even those without so much as an ISP; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive websites, they are vexations to the spirit. Exercise caution in your browsing; for the internet is full of cookies and viruses. Be your e-self. You are a child of cyberspace, no less than the portals and search-engines; you have a right to be here. Be careful. Strive to be happy. Always backup your files. ___________________ Below are two works based on Max Ehrman's fine work: Desiderata. Read the inspirational orginal poem at this website along with other related historical information. ___________________ The works below are a contrasting pair — one environmental and one not — which serve to illustrate the differences in our perception of global problems. ECO-DISIDERATA by Ed Glaze III edglaze3@gmail.com Go angrily amid the pollution and waste — taking a long-term environmental view, surrendering the things of materialism, as necessary. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with the environment. Live your life quietly and cleanly; and listen to Nature, even the plants and animals, for they too have their story. Avoid lazy and wasteful persons, they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with Nature, you should become plain and humble; for always there will be greater wonders than humans. Enjoy your planting as well as your harvesting. Exercise caution in your population growth; for the world has limited resources. Never be careless about growth; for in spite of all economies of scale it is as dangerous as the bomb. Keep interested in your own community, however small; for it can change and become a threat to the environment over time. But let this not blind you to what freedoms there are; all responsible persons must strive for ecological living, and remember what savings there are in recycling. Obtain knowledge of survival to aid you in ecological living; and do not distress yourself with reminiscing; the world must change due to our pollution and overpopulation. Beyond a wholesome discipline, always be gentle with Nature. Humans are only animals, especially with no natural right of superiority. We are but one species among many, no more than the trees and the animals — they have an equal right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, there is no doubt that humans have not been living as they should. Therefore be at peace with Nature, whatever you conceive it to be; and whatever your labors and aspirations in our threatened environment keep waste to a minimum, since everywhere life is under threat. Without all our wars, pollution and overpopulation it could again be a beautiful world. Be ecological. Sacrifice for the future. ______________________________________ ANTI-DESIDERATA by Ed Glaze III edglaze3@gmail.com Go blindly amid the noise and waste, and ponder what rewards await you in the future. As far as possible seek no undue notice from any persons. Speak approved truths loudly and opinions vaguely. Don’t listen to others, especially the questioning and nonconforming — they will always cause trouble. Be a loud and aggressive and force your views on the meek. Compare yourself with others, so you know where you stand; always there will be those greater few to which you must yield and the many lesser persons to dominate. Exaggerate your achievements, as well as your plans. Keep interested only in your own career — always seek promotion — your career is your best possession in the changing fortunes of business and politics. Exercise caution in your social affairs, for the world is full of backstabbers. But let this not blind you to what opportunities there are; many trusting persons are there to be taken and everywhere life is full of corruption — get your share. Be not yourself. Especially feign affection. Always be cynical about love, for in the face of all self-interest and rewards it is as deadly as poison. Resist strongly the counsel of the years, never surrendering the irresponsibility of youth. Nurture alliances of convenience to provide scapegoats in case of sudden misfortune. But do not satisfy yourself with imaginings — many careers are made by timely threats and betrayals. Maintain a self-centered discipline, be ruthless with others. Yours is a face outside the crowd, so much more than the blue-collared and unemployed. You must fight to reach and remain on top. And whether or not it is clear to anyone else, you’ve no doubt that the best must earn their rewards. Therefore, dutifully mouth the current part line, whatever you conceive it to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, always cover your butt as you work behind the scenes. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is a fearful and viscous world out there. Be careful. Strive to survive.
