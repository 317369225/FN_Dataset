Are vampires real? If not, where and how did the idea of vampires originate?
Vampires, as in undead, immortal, supernatural creatures who can drain all the blood in your body in one gulp? No. Vampires, as in living people who need life energy and/or blood to enjoy quality of life? Yes. Wikipedia (the online encyclopedia any idiot can edit) notwithstanding, we are out there.  Medical science has yet to acknowledge whatever condition we have, and doctors write us off as delusional.  We don't fly, we can't instantly hypnotize you, and sunlight does not kill us (although a stake to the heart will).  Most of us love garlic, to be honest.  And we can kill, just the same as any human can kill.  But we don't need to. And nobody can drink that much blood.
