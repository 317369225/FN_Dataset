Why doesn't God kill Satan?
If you believe the core of the Bible to be true there can be only one answer: Satan is not a person, but the personification of evildoing which comes from free will. Philosophically speaking it would thus be impossible for God to 'kill' Satan without removing free will because good and evil can only be understood in this context. There may be room for a more complex understanding of Satan. That he is both. A person and a personification. This is sort of religious quantum mechanics as some people of faith would probably like to call it just to sound smart :) But it has some philosophical merit to it I think. Of course, the real answer lies, as always, in physics and not religion. Are we living in a deterministic universe or is there room for free will? We don't really know. Cheers.
