Why do some people feel terrible about Jews?
Antisemitism is NOT new; it is a War between Light and Darkness.  Hitler and his Nazis Party believed humans could be divided into different races/colours because there is always a struggle going on between different races. Nazis decided they were a superior  light ‘Aryan race’  - an archaic Indo-European Race from around  India-Iran-Mongolia. Jews, a 'dark' race were to Germans  an inferior race,  not considered to be ‘humans’ by the Nazis.  Hitler and his Nazis said the Jews were responsible for dismal historical events taking place at the time, like losing World War One and the economic crisis. This was totally untrue. In the context of India, Aryan Migration into the Indian subcontinent was about a highly developed civilization into ancient India. According to this account, India was invaded and conquered by nomadic light-skinned Indo-European tribes from Central Asia around 1500-100 BC, who overthrew an earlier and more advanced dark-skinned Dravidian civilization from which they took most of what later became Hindu culture.  The war between the powers of light and darkness, a prevalent idea in ancient Aryan Vedic scriptures, was thus interpreted to refer to this war between light and dark skinned peoples and assumed as 'truth' by the Germans to this day.
