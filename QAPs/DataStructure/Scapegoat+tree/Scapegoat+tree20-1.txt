In what ways has Christianity influenced Jewish theology?
The most powerful impact that Christianity had on Judaism came through its forcing us to understand our own theology better. You have to realize that theology is not actually discussed in the Torah. This was one of the reasons that many opposed Maimonides' statement of 13 Principles of Faith, which apparently was influenced to some degree by Christian and Muslim theologians who tried to state the dogmas of their "religions" in point by point manner. Still, Maimonides went ahead with his theological canonization, as it were. It's a delicate topic, but I think that if Christians had not forced our greatest sages (like Nachmanides) over the years to debate them on theological topics, we would be lacking some very important treatises on our faith.
