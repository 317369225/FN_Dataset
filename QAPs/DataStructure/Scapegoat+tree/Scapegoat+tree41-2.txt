Is it fair to compare the "May 4 Massacre" (Kent State shooting) in 1970 to "Tiananmen Massacre" in China?
Kent State was one squad of one platoon of one company of poorly trained National Guard panicking and opening fire for a few minutes. Tiananmen Square was ordered from the top, and involved days of planned violence and hundreds of deaths, at least.   Another key difference is that Chinese students fought back. (This is certainly not to defend the Chinese military, since most demonstrators killed were peaceful, and throwing a rock at a tank should not be a death sentence.) Many Kent State students were walking to class, and some were killed or wounded by stray bullets. Others were protesters who were shot in the back while fleeing.   Contrary to another post, no one was convicted for the Kent State shootings. All charges were dismissed. There were finally some payments in a civil suit.   There was some testimony from guardsmen that they heard shots from the demonstrators. An armed undercover FBI agent was among them, and that suggests he may have been the one firing the shots, and thus has responsibility for the shootings. Updated 62w ago • View Upvotes
