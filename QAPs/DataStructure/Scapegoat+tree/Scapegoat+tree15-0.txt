Why is our media so screwed up?
In short I would answer because the country's governmental system. I don't know what you mean by 'screwed up' and am not sure what 'our' is, but I will assume you're American because well, that media system is 'screwed up.' This is because media is in cahoots with big enterprises that want to use them as mouthpieces. As in communist states like China, where media is controlled by the state, capitalist states also have censored media, but it is controlled by large corporations. Who would you rather have control your media? A. The state which has an inherent compelling interest in the health and welfare of it's people. Or B. Corporations that have interests, probably more in your pocket than the state does. Now this is not to say that the state is fully benevolent and not corrupt, but from an idealistic point of view, these are the two options between communist and capitalist states.
