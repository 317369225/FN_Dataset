Why do some people feel terrible about Jews?
A2A Some people are unsecure. They need to define themselves by their relation to something outsiode themselves. Hate is easiest, so "I am special, because I hate X" is met among this kind of people more often that "I am special, because I admire X". Jews and Roma are different, so they are the perfect nexuses for this hate.
