What is feminism according to Hinduism?
The river Sindhu is one of the five rivers that flows through greater Punjab bordering the Indian subcontinent. This was called Indus by the Arabs and hence this land was know as India and the faiths practiced here came to be Hinduism. Unlike Abrahamic religions, it has no one set of rules for anything and thrives in the chaos of multiple parallel ideas and cultures. Hence it will be impossible to provide a single set of rules and expectations for women in this system. Like the rest of the world women here too were expected to be docile, produce healthy kids, take care of the house, etc. Based on their class they may have had specific rights eg. queens and princesses may have a say in public policy, etc.
