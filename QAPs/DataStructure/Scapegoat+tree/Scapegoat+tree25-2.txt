What is the conclusion of feminism?
The conclusion of Feminism - per its definition as result or outcome - has been nothing short of a fiasco.  The conclusion of Feminism - per its definition as the end of pleading - is long overdue, largely because of how far Feminism has divorced itself from reality.  Betty Friedan would turn in her grave if she saw what Feminism has become.  Friedan outright stated that women would be betraying their own identities if they attempted to establish 50/50 parity with men - the complete opposite of the notion most modern Feminists ascribe to. Friedan outright stated that women should celebrate the fact that their liberation was wrought by their fathers and brothers - modern Feminists vilify 'the Patriarchy' and use it as a blanket scapegoat. Friedan outright stated that men should be viewed as partners and fellow victims of how women denigrate themselves - Feminists strive even harder to denigrate women and blame men for it. Friedan outright stated that women should maintain the sovereignty of their homes, not compete with men for domestic duties, not compete with other women for empty status, and not so cripple their children with ideology so as to render them unable to compete whatsoever - all of which is very much the battle cry of modern Feminism. Feminism has been so divorced from reality for so long that anything relating to the ideology is laughable - being unable to see the forest for the trees, the only ones who seem incapable of comprehending this simple fact are Feminists themselves.  What does it say for Feminism when legitimate gender equality activists are forced to explicitly state "I am not a Feminist" in order to be taken seriously?
