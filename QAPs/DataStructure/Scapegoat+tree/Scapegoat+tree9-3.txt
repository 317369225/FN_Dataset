Is it justifiable to blame Kejriwal for the death of the farmer in the Delhi rally today?
Thus far, responsibility can be attributed to: Event Organizer - AAP Emergency responders - police, fire brigade, event staff Jurisdictional authority - Delhi GovernmentThe criminal investigation may uncover other actors (e.g. if there was any abetment, inducement etc.) Since AK is not just the Chief Minister but also AAP convenor, the buck stops at his doorstep across all 3 above. Similarly the Chiefs of Delhi Police and Fire Response teams also have to explain the incapability of their respective organizations to respond to the emergency and help prevent this tragedy.
