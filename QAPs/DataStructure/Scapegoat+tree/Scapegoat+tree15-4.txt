Why is our media so screwed up?
The reason behind our screwed up media is the same as, it was for our screwed up Govt. the so called experienced personnel just don't wanna give it up. I am from a media college and I have seen my really talented friends struggling to get in the media industry to do the real job with not only talent but a proper education and background regarding the same so, I guess the experienced should take a step back and let the talented and educated take the wheel. And also I would appreciate if you understand one fact here, the screwed up news which we listen everyday is not only the result of bad media but also its the people "The Aam-Janta".
