Narcissism: How does someone abused by a narcissist (mother) resolve their anger?
Learn all you can about the disorder. There is an abundance of information on narcissism on the internet that will be an incredible eye opener for you. I couldn't  stop reading, and seriously cried for hours while reading about narcissists and their victims.  I was in shock, it was as if what I was reading was my story. I cried for the little girl that grew up thinking that there was something wrong with her, that she didn't deserve love and attention. "Gas Lighting" . . .  that shook me to my core. I finally understood after sooo many years that it was really all my mothers issues. I grieved for quite some time. I joined chat rooms for victims, and listened to pod casts everyday about narcissistic personality disorder. I learned that I need to have limited contact with her. Next I learned  how to have conversations with her. I attempt to keep topics extremely limited; the weather, a foreign movie, etc. but nothing personal. I know now that I can not put myself on a platter for her anymore. I still grieve, the memories and emotions are enormous. And sometimes when I'm alone,  I let myself have pity parties. But then I take a deep breath and get on with life, she does not have those abilities anymore!
