Did God make Adam & Eve dumb?
Since the narrative says God made Adam and Eve in His own image, they had to have creative, rational thinking minds.  It's obvious they weren't dumb because He gave Adam the task of naming all the living creatures, no small feat for one intelligent person!  Genesis 2:19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. Adam would have run out of names or duplicated them very fast if he hadn't observed their differing characteristics, habitat, physiology and so on.  In fact they were both given the task of exploring and observing their environment and then taking care of it.  So  you might  say their first occupation in the garden was scientific discovery.
