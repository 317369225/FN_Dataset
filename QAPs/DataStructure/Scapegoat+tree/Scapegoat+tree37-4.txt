What are all the contradictions in the Bible about Jesus Christ?
There are none. God's word is perfect. Read and study the Bible for yourself and don't take anyone else's word for it. Whether you believe it or not doesn't matter. Judgment day will come for ALL of us as sinners. We've all got to be ready, and "doing good" without accepting Jesus as our Lord Savior for our sins is not going to be enough. Don't be fooled by what the world says, offers, or tempts you with. You are greatly mistaken if you think this life and this world can make you happy. The answer to the meaning of life is not in this world. Lay up all your treasures in heaven. The only path to truth, justice, righteousness, joy, and salvation, is through Christ. God has put eternity in all our hearts. Don't deny what is good, what is right, what is pure, and what is holy.
