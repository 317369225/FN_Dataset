How do Romney supporters explain/rationalize Romney's lack of detail on how he'll do much of anything?
Elections and especially American presidential elections are about the overall congruence of the candidate with the voter(s) preconceived ideas and values as wells a general sense of the competency of a candidate compared to another candidate. Therefore, what voters want to know is the general, not specific, position of a candidate. Voters realize that the details of policies will change in response to the social, economic and international environments, so voters are not too concerned about the specifics of the policies. But, voters want to know what the direction of the policies are and whether the candidate will attempt to maintain the compass direction while adjusting for changed circumstances. Is there congruence with my values and steadfastness in purpose (not to be confused with doctrinaire obstructionism)? On that basis, Romney has shown the direction of his compass and his ability to adjust somewhat while being steadfast to his compass. This is what voters want to know and need to know. This I offer without commenting on whether or not that compass direction is appropriate for the American people. Finally, I am a Canadian management consultant who has observed at a cross-border distance American politics for about 45 years, so my comments are offered with some humility.
