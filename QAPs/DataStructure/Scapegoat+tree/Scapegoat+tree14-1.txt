Did God make Adam & Eve dumb?
There was no first man and first woman; that's not how evolution works. That said, God (assuming an all knowing God) would know exactly what Adam and Eve would do in the future. God knew that Adam would eat the apple. Saying that they had free will doesn't make sense, because God demanded that they have it. So God made them exactly as smart (or not) for his plan. The whole story is ridiculous and non-nonsensical.
