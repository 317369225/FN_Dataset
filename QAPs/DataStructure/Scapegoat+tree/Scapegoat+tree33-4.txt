What was the reaction of your parents when you told them that you are a gay/lesbian?
My mother: with kindness, a long hug, a "I sort of suspected as much", a slight concern that it took me so fucking long to tell them and finally a feeling of relief that at last, I might be settling into adulthood. Followed by another hug. My father: a fairly non-committal look and a "that's okay".
