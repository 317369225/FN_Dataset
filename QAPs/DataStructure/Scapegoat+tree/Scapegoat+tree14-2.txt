Did God make Adam & Eve dumb?
Certainly not. He might have made them a little too big for their britches, which they really didn't have yet. He made them capable and free--free to make their own decisions and learn from their own mistakes.Â  He made them good, and he made them beautiful, and he put them in a beautiful place. They had to think fast on their feet after the fall, and as we are all still here, I say they made some pretty good decisions.
