Is it justifiable to blame Kejriwal for the death of the farmer in the Delhi rally today?
It's an unfortunate event. It is sad that farmers are committing suicide across the nation. My sincere appeal to all the states and central government is Please take some action. Please mobilise your best of the resources. The situation is worsening with every passing day. The news of farmers suicide is coming from across the nation. I don't think AK should be blamed for this (it's stupid to blame him for this). AAP organized a protest rally against the Land Acquisition Bill. I am sure no politician would want that to happen in his rally.
