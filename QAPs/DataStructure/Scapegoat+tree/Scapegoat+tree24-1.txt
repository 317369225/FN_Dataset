Why doesn't God kill Satan?
Continuity requires conflict. Keep in mind that I'm not writing this answer as a theist or an athiest but as someone who wants to analyze the need for Satan and his existence. Religion, in so far as I have observed it, is obsessed with moral dichotomy. If it is in fact fiction, this dichotomy is what fuels and runs it in many ways. To believe that there is evil to be fended off is it to believe that an insturment or mechanism is needed for this fending off to be achived. Enter religion. If God does exist then I'm not entirely sure why he would keep Satan around. The version of events that usually lead up to one of God's angels turning into Satan invloves a fall from grace when the angel refuses to acknowledge the superiority of man or quite simply rebels in some manner. Perhaps God wants to prove a point and allows Satan to poison men banking on the fact that the majority of his creations will end their lives morally upright in spite of Satan's intervention. That puzzles me though. God shouldn't have to bank or prove. His judgement should be accepted without question by the angels so why does Satan doubt him in the first place and why does God engage in this wager? Perhaps for continuity. Heaven has to be populated and this continuing battle between good and evil allows for a metric that will be used to choose heaven's denizens. Why does God need a metric though? Is the introduction of free will a factor that reduces God's omniscience? That would make sense but even thinking that something could imapct the perfection of God is usually considered blasphemous so I don't know what to do with my conjectures. Either God and his existence is a divine contradiction or more simply he doesn't exist. At least not in the manner that most religions describe him anyway.
