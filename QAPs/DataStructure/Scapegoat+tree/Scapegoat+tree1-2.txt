What are some easy to implement and powerful data structures?
There are quite a few different types of trees that are easy to implement and serve different purposes. Here's a few: Interval tree are trees that hold intervals and let you efficient query for intervals that contain that element. You can create an interval tree from any BBST. A similar data structure to the interval tree is the segment tree and the range tree. There are subtle differences between the three which you can read about here. A trie is also known as a prefix tree and it stores all the prefixes of a set of words. It can be used for fast lookup (regular binary tree gives [math]O(\log{n})[/math] lookup time whereas tries can lookup elements in [math]O(m)[/math] where [math]m[/math] is the length of the search string), autocompletion, and approximating words (such as spell-checking). Merkle trees allow large data structures to be verified quickly and securely. BitTorrent uses Merkle trees to verify large torrent files during download. A simple implementation of a Merkle tree can be found here.
