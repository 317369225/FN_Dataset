Why do some people feel terrible about Jews?
Thanks for the A2A. Anyone hoping to exploit a population's ignorance may see Jewish people as 'competition': it's one of the only religions (well, it's more a 'culture' nowadays) in the world that does not condemn critical thought, and in today's (and the past's) religion-and-dictate dominated world ('don't think, obey' regimes that frown on (or worse) critical thought), that means that someone thinking critically would have an advantage. The 'fault' for that is with a ignorance-exploiting and thought-squashing leadership (that is passing their hate to their (unquestioning, ignorant) followers), not with the Jewish people. I wish the rest of humanity would rise to the 'education first' example (and, slowly but surely, some parts of the world are. Where is the hate for Jewish people in northern European countries, recently deemed the 'happiest' and least-religious countries in the world...?Â  Go figure ; ).
