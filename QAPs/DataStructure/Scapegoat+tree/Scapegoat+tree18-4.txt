If Adam and Eve didn't know right from wrong then how did they know it was wrong to eat off the tree when God told them not to eat it because it was wrong?
I wonder how people write volumes of what Adam and eve felt or thought when they lived generations before us. They... unlike usÂ  they had a clean unbiased mind with no inherited behaviour. I wonder how they perceived the world. According to the bible they lived by their conscious choices and were not judged by any law. I do not know if they knew what was right and wrong. But they sure did know what was instructed to them and that they were breaking a rule instructed by their creator.
