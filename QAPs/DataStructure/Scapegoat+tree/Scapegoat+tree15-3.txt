Why is our media so screwed up?
Well, among many other reasons, it's because - the more outrageous the story = the more viewers/readers = the more money - it's all about perspective --> a person on one side of the street might see a completely different scene from what another person sees from a different place, with a different mindset, and different memories. - lying can gain favor in the eyes of politicians and other supporters. It's a loop: politicians feeds (altered/false) stories to media ---> media broadcasts stories ---> politicians favor (donate towards) media ---> media is willing to broadcast politicians' stories ---> politicians feed stories to media Quite the vicious cycle, eh?
