Is it fair to compare the "May 4 Massacre" (Kent State shooting) in 1970 to "Tiananmen Massacre" in China?
Well, let's see if I can express myself clearly on this. The Tiananmen Massacre was carried out by regular Army units of about 30 divisions.  Kent State was perpetrated by one company of the state militia. Tiananmen was carried out over three days.  The Kent State shootings lasted less than five minutes (most accounts say less than one minute). 67 rounds of ammunition were fired at Kent State.  The amount fired at Tiananmen are not known. Killed 4 vs 218 (official Government figures) or possibly many more. Aftermath - Kent State: The first nation wide student strike in US history Wall-to-wall media coverage A demonstration by 100,000 people in Washington DC five days later A widely aired popular song called "Four Dead in Ohio" A finding by the commission appointed by President Nixon that the shootings were unjustified Three persons at the demonstration convicted of crimes Aftermath - Tiananmen: Mass arrests Suppression of any further demonstrations Firings and arrests of reporters or anchors who expressed sympathy or sadness Rescinding of liberalization policies enacted prior All mention of the massacre was forbidden;  newspapers and periodicals were shut down and copies seized Government statement:  "the timely and decisive measures taken by the Chinese Government at the time were necessary and correct."
