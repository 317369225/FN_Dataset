Why doesn't God kill Satan?
I dont believe in that stuff but from reading the bible, it appears that satan is the good guy that punishes bad people for bad things. God seems to be the bad guy that manipulates and kills with impunity, anyone that doesnt do exactly as he thinks they should, even though he granted free will. Therefore, if these beings existed, im surprised god hasnt killed the good guy yet again. But my answer is the same reason the cop doesnt get the bad guy in the movies. The writers and players of the show need the story to continue and removing one of the main characters will prematurely end the show and subsequently the profits that religion rakes in.
