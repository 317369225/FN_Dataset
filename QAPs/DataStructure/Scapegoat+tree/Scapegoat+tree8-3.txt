Narcissism: How does someone abused by a narcissist (mother) resolve their anger?
We are born with a need to belong. When we don't have that from our earliest days we grow up feeling out of place at best and unlovable at worst. Acknowledge your feelings are valid and realize that your needs are too. Seek places to belong. People with like minded experiences  are a great place to start. You will meet people who will GET IT, and you will feel heard. Perhaps even in this thread.  Recognize that not everyone has the capacity you do - i.e. to feel. Be grateful you can and practice feeling compassion for yourself. It all starts there.  At least it did for me.
