What are the most beautiful lyrics you have ever heard?
Bear with me here - this is going to seem weird. One of my favorite lyrics comes from the comedy duo Flight of the Conchords in their song Jenny. Take a few minutes to watch the video if you don't want this answer to spoil the comedic timing! The lyric I love starts conveniently at 4:30. "We just looked out, 'cross the city from our little spot on the hilltop It was so pretty from way up there We talked about how the lights from the buildings and cars Seemed like reflections of the stars That shone out so pretty and bright That night" A couple of things make these lines particularly powerful for me. The symmetry he points out is really simple and, as a person who has looked down on a lot of cities from planes, really easy to relate to. This section also has a really full guitar pattern running underneath it that fades away, leaving a well-delivered vocal run. The entire section contrasts really well with the rest of the song, which is mainly a stilted back-and-forth between the two characters. I guess I took the long way around to saying that I feel like there's beauty in the simplicity here.
