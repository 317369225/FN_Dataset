What was the reaction of your parents when you told them that you are a gay/lesbian?
I was somewhat lame and told my parents in a letter (I was living a few hundred miles away, so popping round to tell them wasn't an easy option). My sister already knew and was primed to offer them support if needed. I recall that morning vividly â€“ I was on the train to work when my phone buzzed with a text message: "Got your letter. You're still our son and we love you." That was, without a doubt, the best message I could have received. My parents are staunch Catholics, so it was far from easy for them. We had tearful phone conversations many times over the next few days but I think they were shocked more than anything. I went home and visited them. They came and visited me and met my boyfriend. Now, we're all just part of one big happy family. Telling my parents was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, but they made it much easier for me.
