Does destiny exist?
All my life, I believed I was destined for greatness. I was born into one of affluent family in the country.  I was destined to be the change. One day I realize, being the change is different for different people. I am the person who can define the meaning for myself.  In my case, it is spreading knowledge. This quote sums it up nicely. "Dear Dad, my whole life, I've been told I was destined for greatness based solely on the virtue of my name. I was taught sacrifice was for the foolish. Survival was all that mattered. But now I find myself at a crossroads, and I must decide what I believe to be true. There is no such thing as destiny. Legacies must be earned by the choices we make. I now know that we write our own endings, and we can either choose to hide as villains or live as heroes." Daniel Grayson ( Revenge)
