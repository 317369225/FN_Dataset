Do most atheists believe that Jesus existed?
They should.  There is plenty of corroborating evidence from Roman and Jewish sources to confirm some of the basic events of the Gospels.  Pontius Pilate was the 5th procurator of Judea and the Roman historian Tacitus confirmed that later problems in Judea were directly related to the execution of a man named "Christus" during Pilate's administration.
