Why do some people feel terrible about Jews?
I can't answer for other people. I don't feel terrible about Jews. (I presume this question to mean, 'Why do some people dislike Jewish people?') I don't dislike Jewish people. (I am capable of disliking some – but I'm capable of disliking people of any or no religion.) I'm an atheist. I'd like to see people realise the falsehood of religious belief – whatever their belief. So, I'm anti-Judaism. And anti-Christianity. And anti-Islam. Etc. Like Alan Sloan, I dislike the form of Zionism that is persecuting Palestinians. I dislike the persecution of any people – or any person. But Zionism and Judaism are two separate things. For this reason, I am anti-[some] Zionist political and military behaviours – but not antisemitic.
