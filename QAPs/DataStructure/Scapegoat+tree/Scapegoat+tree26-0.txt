What are the most beautiful lyrics you have ever heard?
From a programmer's perspective, it is "Hey Jude" by The Beatles. [EDIT]: I have no idea how I omitted this, but the following line, in my opinion, is the best ever written. "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"- Eagles, Hotel California The line signifies both optimism and despair. On one hand, it tells us that we(humans) have infinite potential and we are only bounded by the limitations we impose on ourselves. On the other, it also exposes the sad reality that we are still prisoners. Most of the people live, believing that they are simply "not good enough". It is just like the prison scene in "The Dark Knight Rises" (although the symbolism there was different) where the prisoners have the way to escape, to freedom in front of them but they believe that they cannot make it. So they just rot there, bounded by the shackles they impose on themselves, not daring to stretch themselves to the full possible extent, to the point (and this is where the symbolism from the movie kicks in) where the mere hope of escape in front of them drives them mad.
