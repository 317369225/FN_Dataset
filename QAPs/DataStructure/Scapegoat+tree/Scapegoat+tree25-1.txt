What is the conclusion of feminism?
The end of gender as a characteristic that is used to declare an entire class of humans as less than; the end of sexism. As other answers note, this isn't utopian, and it may not have a defined conclusion. We still haven't achieved, say, the "end" of the civil rights movement of the 1960's. We're still dealing with racism. (We've been dealing with it far longer than that one historical period; this is just a way to think about a problem that is ongoing.) We haven't reached the "end" of racism. We may not - at least while I'm alive to see it. But if we did, the "end of racism" would be the end of the use of (presumed) race as a characteristic that is used to declare an entire class of humans as less than. The conclusion of feminism (if there ever is one) will occur when sexism is no longer justified by anyone - it is simply rejected.
