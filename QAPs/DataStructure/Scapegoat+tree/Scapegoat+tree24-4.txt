Why doesn't God kill Satan?
The answer to the question is what the other answerers have failed to do: answer the question. It goes back to the events that took place in the Garden of Eden. Satan didn't say to Eve to eat the fruit just for kicks, he said that "you will be like gods, knowing good and bad.‚Äù (Gen 3:5 Byington). So it was a matter of who had the right to determine what is right or wrong. If God simply destroyed Satan then and there it would have left the question," Would humans be better off ruling themselves? ", unanswered. By allowing for a period of time humankind to rule itself, it proves conclusively that mankinds rule is insufficient. Just because he has the power to do it, might doesn't make right. It was never a matter of who was more powerful, it was a matter of who's way of ruling is better.
