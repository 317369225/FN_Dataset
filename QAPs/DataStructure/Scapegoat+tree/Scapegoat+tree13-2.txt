Does destiny exist?
Destiny is merely a myth, designed to bring meaning, purpose, and acceptance to people's lives. It gives a level of comfort to people who need answers to questions about their choices; questions which are usually impossible to answer. Destiny is most often associated with love. It elevates a person's choices in love to an origin of a higher and irresistible power. This removes anxiety, questions, and doubts about their choices. Its easy to be comfortable with your choices if you believe you never had the power to make them in the first place. Destiny is a myth. Free will is a reality.
