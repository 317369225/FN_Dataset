How do employment agencies put Overseas Filipino Workers in debt?
The problem is that many Filipinos who want to become Overseas Filipino Workers don't have any money for the air ticket, medical examinations, and documentary requirements - on top of the employment agency's charges. These agencies thus see an opportunity to advance these fees but with exorbitant interest. Hence the worker becomes sunk in debt for months or even years. Worse, in places like Singapore, the agency passes or sells this this debt to the worker's employer, so if the worker absconds and runs to the Philippine embassy, the employer (who may not be all that well-off themselves) is now out of pocket for the worker's expenses and with nothing to show for it. Sadly there's really no work-around: in order to get to the country of destination (and get the proper permits to work there) requires money. Ideally, if the Filipino worker had that money up front, then they would not be in debt. But in many cases they don't have that money. So..
