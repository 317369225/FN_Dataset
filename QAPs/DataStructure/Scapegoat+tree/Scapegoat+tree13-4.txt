Does destiny exist?
For my own convenience, I believe that all abstract concepts were developed by humans, for their convenience. The fatalistic schools of thought came up with this one: destiny. Science would obviously dismiss it as being unscientific. But imagine a situation in our historic past when the king would behead anyone who brought bad news. In that situation, DESTINY could very well have proved to be a very useful concept. I also believe, on a much more serious note, that every abstract concept - whether it was posited by Einstein or was simply one of our superstitions - has a very definite point of origin. It is therefore there only because there are people who have believed in it, even found it 'useful' So, instead of merely dismissing such concepts as being true or untrue, I prefer to view them from the perspective of a social psychologist who is empathetic toward all creations of the human mind. Finally, I also believe in giving every thing the importance that is due. No more, no less. If for one person in the world there's such a thing as destiny, others have no business dismissing it - even if it is un- or non-scientific.
