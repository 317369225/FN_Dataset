What are the advantages and disadvantages of being too nice to people?
This quote was the first thing that came to my mind after reading your question. Being "too nice" to people carries a strong sense of allowing them an undue high importance in your life - their pleasures, demands, requests - above and beyond your own. Emphasis on 'too'. I also think that you've got to have a strong streak of idealism to be "too nice" to people. Now, since your priorities are screwed up, the biggest disadvantage of being "too nice" to others would be that you cannot be equally nice to your own self. Unless you are a Buddhist monk, with an infinite capacity of compassion, you'll run out of niceties soon enough. Nobody remains "too nice" for too long. Life has its ways of teaching us lessons in moderation.
