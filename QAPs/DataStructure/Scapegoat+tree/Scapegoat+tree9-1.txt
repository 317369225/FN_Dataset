Is it justifiable to blame Kejriwal for the death of the farmer in the Delhi rally today?
Put yourself to the situation and tell us what would you have done? Saving him was the work of Police. Kumar Vishawas was repeatedly asking the police to save him since they were the ones having leaders and could have clear the crowd too. There was some temporary teachers who were protesting in the rally. They also encourage Gajendra Singh to continue. Kumar Vishwas also asked him to come down and meet the CM on the stage so that he can hear his problem. This is to mention that the tree was too far from the stage and can not be seen from stage at all. So nobody on stage knew what was going on, someone was supplying updates. For the proof watch the video here - किसान की खुदकुशी के वक्त क्या हो रहा था 'आप' के मंच पर AAP is just a scapegoat here. The farmer was there because of the policies of Central Government, not because of Dehli Government. I am not sure, but as far as I have heard he was protesting against the land acquisition bill which is BJP's move. Farmers are killing themselves all over the country. I read about it in the news mostly on 4th or 5th page. But did anyone blaming the Government for not doing enough there? Farmer Suicide has been the problem in Congress Government too and this Government is yet to do anything for farmers. Land Acquisition Bill, decreasing the support prices, too much rains and not able to pay loan was among some of the causes for the problems farmers are facing. I do not understand what's wrong and right in the bill, but I am sure that AAP can not be blamed for the event, except continuing the rally.
