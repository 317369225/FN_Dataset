I've been out of work for 8 months. Are there new and creative ways of finding office work?
Try to use your personal network, i.e., friends, relatives.  You need to do the work to figure out the network, e.g., Tell your buddy, Sundar, '..I saw you are friends with Bill who manages a large team...can you introduce me to him...'. Don't ask, '...are any of your friends recruiting...' Look for small companies Look for local companies Make sure you have a good script Dont' spend all your time searching online.  This gives the illusion that you are busy and doing something.  Try to use World's Largest Professional Network Look for jobs which may not be glamorous, e.g., non-profit, even if it is a filler Here is a link on a job search for non-conventional candidates: The One-Week Job Search PS: Easy for me to write this answer.  I would have probably asked the same question.
