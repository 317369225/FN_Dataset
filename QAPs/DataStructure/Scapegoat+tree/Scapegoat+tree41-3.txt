Is it fair to compare the "May 4 Massacre" (Kent State shooting) in 1970 to "Tiananmen Massacre" in China?
Compare? Sure.  I can compare a stone to a hand grenade.  That's a comparison, right.  You throw them both, right? Someone gets hurt, right? Are they equal? No. China's crack down was meant to kill an idea and to murder the people promoting the idea. It was an idea that the people with power were not bad, just that it had become time for them to loosen control. Those leaders chose intentional murder, and for survivors, imprisonment, torture, and enforced poverty on their families. The population was told "forget, or else." Most did. In the US, a couple of guardsmen, amateur soldiers, with no orders feared for their lives and opened fire killing four students. It was a tragic mistake and everyone admitted it. No intent to murder, suppress, or terrorize the population.  No evil, just stupid. This is not about moral high ground.The brutal crackdown on pro democracy activists violated the human rights of THOUSANDS and continues unchecked to this day. The US is not in the same league. Nice try.
