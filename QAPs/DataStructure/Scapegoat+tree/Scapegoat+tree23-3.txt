Did Jesus die for our sins?
I like your question because you are honestly trying to find the truth.  I will preface my response with the fact I am a liberal Catholic and other Christians and Catholics may disagree with me. I believe the Christ died to forgive the sins of the time.  The biggest sin being the Scribes--or religious lawmakers--persecution of those who did not follow the law to a, "T," or were different.  Christ forgives them by showing that death is not something to fear.  He died, was buried and returned to show that death is defeated.  To support my thesis, the Gospels speak extensively of the Christs persecution by religious leaders of the time--the Scribes.  So, when the Christ says, "the way is narrow," he means at the time the way was narrow because few could follow the tedious laws of Leviticus and many were excluded. So, did Christ die for our sins?  Only sort of.  He died and returned to show death was nothing to fear.  Fear is the root of violence and fear of death leads to an erratic life.  So, at the time many were in fear of the religious leaders.  This fear lead to sin.  By Christ dying and returning he showed the way is broad and not narrow.  He did not follow the Scribe's laws and he showed how they really did not matter.  So, he died for the sins of the time and to change the course of religion.  Now, is Christ the literal son of God?  No, he is the son of Joseph and Mary.  The Gospels support this.  We are not related to God but we are all his children.  The Christ and the apostles were conveying the relationship with God was not one of Fear and Trembling but rather a paternalistic one. Well, I hope this helps.
