Race Relations:Â How can I show solidarity with the Mexican immigrants living in my city (Oklahoma City)?
Hi, amigo (a)! It feels so good to read this kind of questions, being a mexican myself, specially since you feel the need to unite your local comunity, which include of course my paisanos , the Mexicans. I think your sticker is a good idea, because it is an easy way to demostrate, with one word, that you support a certain idea and I think some of my fellow countrymen will appreciate it. Katherine gave a very detailed answer and very good ideas, specially the first part of "change always starts within" Also, it is important to make sure these workers are indeed, mexican. As Katherine already stated, it is possible that you have other latinos from other places such as Guatemala, El Salvador or Colombia. Teach others what you have learn and spread the love! I think that the key is just to make them feel welcome, but in a very low key kind of way, I don't think that they want too much attention, they just want to blend and make as less noise as they can, treat them with respect, help them when you can (or when they ask) and just treat them as with any other citizens.
