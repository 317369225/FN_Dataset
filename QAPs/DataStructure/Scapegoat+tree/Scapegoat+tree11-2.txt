People who work for petroleum companies: How do you see your role in global warming?
We make the world go round. If we want to move towards a renewable and pollution-free world, you'd think a prosperous society would be better equipped for that than a poor one. A poor society do not prioritize the environment. People who have fallen into poverty direct their anger at "others", it recruit to extremist groups, it undermines the state that could have had the authority to protect the environment. You wouldn't want to live in a world without oil. Â  So what do we do about global warming then? I have no moral qualms getting paid by the oil industry and also supporting renewables. IPhones and IPads drove down demand for Macs, but nobody sees a paradox in Apple competing against itself. It's the same thing with the oil industry. Renewables isn't a competitor, it's another opportunity for finding energy for our customers. So far the big oil companies are only testing the water, but already rebranding themselves as "energy companies". There'll come a day, maybe when the oil is harder to get than the wave power, when the best geothermal wells rival oil wells or when people really demand renewables. That day, these companies or something not unlike them, move into renewables with a momentum that make todays wind farms seem like garage startups. If you're trying to make that day come sooner rather than later, I'm rooting for you
