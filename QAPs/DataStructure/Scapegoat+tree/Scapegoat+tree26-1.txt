What are the most beautiful lyrics you have ever heard?
1.Elliot Smith-Waltz #2 Elliot smith describes the devastating family dynamics with this haunting song.This heartbreaking song illuminates the unbridgeable distance him and his mother.Damn! the lyrics pack an emotional punch . "First the mic, then a half cigarette Singing Kathy's clown That's the man she's married to now That's the girl that he takes around town She appears composed So she is, I suppose Who can really tell? She shows no emotion at all Stares into space like a dead china doll I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow" Elliott Smith - Waltz #2 (XO) 2.Keaton Henson-Small Hands Small Hands was released in 2010 on Henson’s album “Dear….” The song soliloquies his feelings and regrets after a break up. He reflects on all the small things he remembers and misses about his ex-lover. "Miss you terribly already Miss the space between your eyelids, Where I'd stare through awkward sentences And void through awkward silence Miss your teeth when they chatter, When we smoked out in my garden When we couldn't sleep for all the heat, Soft talk began to harden Miss your small hands in the palm of mine, The fact they're good at making Miss you sitting up incessantly, And the fact you're always waking in the night" -Keaton Henson - Small Hands 3.Elliott Smith-King's Crossing Another Elliott Smith song.The lyrics in this song are sometimes borderline scary. "I can't prepare for death any more Than I already have All you can do now is watch the shells The game looks easy that's why it sells" Smith masterfully portrays his own alienation in this song "It's Christmas time and the needles on the tree A skinny Santa is bringing something to me His voice is overwhelming but his speech is slurred And I only understand every other word" King's Crossing-Elliott Smith (with lyrics) 4.The Shins-New Slang
