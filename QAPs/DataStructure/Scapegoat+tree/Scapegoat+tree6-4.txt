How do you think the concept of God came into existence?
I think it was inevitable.  When we are infants, what is our experience of the world?  Mostly white noise (all our neurons are connected).  From this chaos emerges a parent who is there to provide you comfort, to reward you for good behavior and to punish you for bad behavior.  This is foundational.  Your early world had a god, who fed you and cared for you. Now, fast forward to adulthood.  You've learned that your parents are fallible and imperfect.  What's left is an emotional and cognitive gap.  A hole in the very fabric of the way you view your world.  It seems to me almost inevitable that many people will have a craving to fill this, and God (in whatever form) will do the trick. I recognize that God has always been a handy way to explain the complexity and mystery of nature with a relatively simple concept.  But while that has a tremendous appeal as an explanation for the existence of God in our culture, for me, that didn't explain how it could persist as the mysteries of nature have been revealed through science.  The formulation above seems important in answering that question.
