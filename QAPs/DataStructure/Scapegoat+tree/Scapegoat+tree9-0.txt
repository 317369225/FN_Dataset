Is it justifiable to blame Kejriwal for the death of the farmer in the Delhi rally today?
Blaming AK or AAP for the suicide is really sad. I mean, sure they were the organizers of the event and they should be held responsible for whatever happened, but to a certain extent. The security and peace-keeping of the event is the duty of Delhi police (Otherwise why were the cops & constables there?). If the police does not do its job and keeps smiling, like attempting suicide is normal, they are the ones who have failed their job. किसान की खुदकुशी के वक्त क्या हो रहा था 'आप' के मंच पर The AAP leaders were not informed of the event in real-time. Kumar Vishwas was repeatedly requesting the police officers/constables present at the crime scene to intervene and stop any unfortunate events. He also requested Gajendra to come down from tree and talk to the party leaders if he wants to. The police has not even registered a case of "Negligence in duty" on the cops/constables present at the crime scene! What does one expect from them any more? Stop the rally? Stopping the rally would not benefit anybody. Rest of the farmers who came from all corners of the country to protest against the Land Acquisition bill would have been left empty-handed as probably their last source of hope would have died. And Gajendra's death would have been in vain just like 5 other farmers who chose death the same day! Other parties might want to blame it all on AAP & AK, but it won't change the fact that this bill is the cause of more than just 1 suicide all over the country.
