Narcissism: How does someone abused by a narcissist (mother) resolve their anger?
Interesting....I was in that same boat about 10 years ago and to be honest, I don't think I've fully "recovered."...Time definitely healed my anger, but now there are a lot of unanswered questions that I need to come to terms with...I guess my short answer, for me personally, is that time "healed" my hatred toward the man who abused me...Now I just have to figure out how to accept the unknown... If you're angry about it and it happened, say, 6 months to a year ago, you're still justified in your anger...But know that holding on to that anger will just keep you miserable and you would essentially let him/her "win" if you don't find peace...with yourself for choosing to stay with him/her even in his/her violent fits and with him/her for being a sub-par human being.  The best "revenge" is to rise up and become the person that you held back when you were with him/her.  I know how my ex abuser is these days...and honestly, I hope he got help because he now has a family...but I also know that he had several arrests and some very unpopular press (in his state) for a while after he and I split...Karma really does exist.
