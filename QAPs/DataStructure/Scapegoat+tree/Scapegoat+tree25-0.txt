What is the conclusion of feminism?
The conclusion of feminism is when women are valued for themselves as men are. When women can walk down a street without being harassed, when their interview for jobs are considered with the exact same criteria as men interviewing are. It's when good husbands and fathers are the norm, couples split up housework fairly and stay at home dads have the same support stay at home moms do. Its when transmen and transwomen get the healthcare they need that is appropriate for their bodies, and what it says on their drivers license isn't considered relevant. The conclusion of feminism is when girl children are not sold into marriage or any children into the sex trade. Ever. The conclusion of feminism is not world peace or love and harmony, but the removal of the systemic, universal devaluing of women and women's work by society. That will mean more competition, but also much more sharing and cooperation. It's a different dynamic, and one I look forward to experiencing.
