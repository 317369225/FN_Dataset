What are the advantages and disadvantages of being too nice to people?
I don't think you can ever be too nice to people but sometimes, you have to consider the type of people you're being nice to. About 1% of the population will stab you in the back the first chance they get. They might even screw you over royally without a hint of remorse. In some ways, it's remarkable to observe a person like this—especially when they're a relative. Even sadder, about 1 out of 500 people will actually attack you either verbally or physically without provocation and they'll enjoy the heck out of it. And then they'll criticize you for being impaired and enervated from their assault on you. Perhaps they were severely hurt at some point in the past and they're projecting their pain onto others. Or worse... Be nice to the people who deserve it and will appreciate you. You can be nice to the others but it's wiser to just avoid them if possible. Updated 7w ago • View Upvotes
