Islam:Â What is Jannat?
Jannat or Jannah, in proper Arabic, is the Islamic conception of paradise or heaven. The Arabic word Jannah is a shortened version meaning simply "Garden". Call it the equivalent of 'Swarg' in Hinduism. Whatever you came to know about eligibility criteria of Jannah is completely wrong, and so is the understanding and expectation of those Muslims who wage wars and resort to violence for any purpose.
