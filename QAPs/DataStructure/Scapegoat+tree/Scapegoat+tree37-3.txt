What are all the contradictions in the Bible about Jesus Christ?
None. If you think you find contradictions, it just means insight is not there. See, it's necessary to know the Holy Spirit, Who gives insight and instruction for us to understand the Bible. It's like a writing that is so special, that only those in the "club" can understand it. That club being truely born again in Jesus Christ, and filled with the Holy Spirit. The good news is all are welcome! You just have to enter the Door, and that Dooris Kesus Christ.
