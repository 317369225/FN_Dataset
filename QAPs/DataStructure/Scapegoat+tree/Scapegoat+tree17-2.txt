English (language): What are some interesting English idioms and their meanings?
Pardon my French. What a classy way to politely cuss in public and apologize in an even classier way. So, the phrase seems to have originated back in the 19th century when Englishmen used bits and pieces of French in between conversations. There was a considerable chance that the listener may not be well versed with the language, and hence if one uses a bit of swear words or profanity in French and later covers it up by saying "Pardon my French", the other party wouldn't even be aware of the fact that he was cussed at. Moreover, French is such a beautiful language, and as Merovingian says in The Matrix Reloaded, I have sampled every language, French is my favorite. Fantastic language. Especially to curse with. Nom de dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connard d'enculer ta mère. It's like wiping your arse with silk. I love it. If you'll please pardon his French. Greek to me. So, the origin of this one can be attributed to the fact that Greek is quite a difficult language to understand. Remarkably, I was first acquainted with this phrase in Julius Caesar, where it was actually used for the first time. When Cassius enquires Casca about the events that transpired at Caesar's coronation ceremony, he informs Cassius that he couldn't make out most of what was spoken at the festival. He uses this expression to convey the phenomena. CASSIUS: Did Cicero say anything? CASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek. CASSIUS: To what effect? CASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, it was Greek to me.
