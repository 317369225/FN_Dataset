I've been out of work for 8 months. Are there new and creative ways of finding office work?
Public libraries, universities, hospitals, assisted-living facilities, nursing homes, village/township offices, churches, grocery stores, and schools need office workers. Have you contacted any of them? Is your resume in good shape?
