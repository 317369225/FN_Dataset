Why does Israel have a negative image across the Middle East?
I believe that the hundreds of years of distrust (and ulitmately anger and resentment) traces back to the belief in birth right. Both sides (from their religious perspective) believe and teach that they are their god's chosen people. That belief has become ingrained in the very culture, and re-inforced through action over the centuries.   Obviously, under that context, there wouln't appear to be a simple fix that could alter this core belief. True friendship is hard to achieve when both parties independently believe that they are "chosen". Any perceived slight or disrespect brings back these very powerful feelings of distrust or even resentment of the other group that is believed to be inferior.   In the end, it seems that generations of distrust can only be overcome through generations of actions to build trust. Hard, slow work.
