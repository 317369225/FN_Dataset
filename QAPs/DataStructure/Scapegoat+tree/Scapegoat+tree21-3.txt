How do employment agencies put Overseas Filipino Workers in debt?
You are barking at the wrong tree. Employment agencies are just bottom feeders. The main cause of OFW debt is the nationalist/protectionist policy in the constitution which keeps good paying jobs out. These policies protect the lousy cheapo Filipino firms like Globe, Smart, SM, PLDT - all of em. They are bloodsucking parasites protected by the Philippine government from foreign competition. Thus all Filipino workers (not just OFWs) are driven to debt. How exactly? 1 - The prices of goods are very high (internet, phone, electricity) - this reduces your income. You have less disposable income 2 - Then the Philippine government taxes you some more - in order to pay for the "poor and disadvantaged" - which happens to be you. So, forcibly taking your money away, in order to help you, helps you? WTF! So now you have less income. 3. Then you apply for a job overseas - you are taxed some more. You have lesser and less income. 4. The employment agency who went through the trouble of finding you a job - is also taxed. The employment agencies make a convenient scapegoat for your getting into debt, after government and its cronies have stripped you dry. By then, you are deep in debt, your family is broken, you are in the mercy of coyotes Protectionism in the Philippines: OFWs and Broken Homes. #wakeup
