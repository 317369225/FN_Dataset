What is the conclusion of feminism?
Assume you have cancer in two places in your body, one at top and other bottom, both important, one set of doctors are attacking the one at top and the other at the bottom. Similarly there is a cancer in society called gender discrimination, it happens to both men and women. Feminists are trying to tackle it from the women's angle and men's right activists are tackling it from the male perspective. Note that feminists need not be against only men, in some societies, even women contribute to women discrimination. In Indian society, this can be mother-in-laws or older women, sometimes women of the same age who involve in slut shaming. Similarly men's rights activists need not be against only women, men generally set stereotypes that they have to go out and earn and cannot be stay at home dads. The ultimate aim of both is gender equality, the focus areas however are different. Feminism aims in helping women who have been put down or discriminated against, men's right movement does the same for men. Both movements are very important.
