Why does Israel have a negative image across the Middle East?
The answer seems too uncomplicated and simple: The Middle East is basically Muslim and Muslims don't like Jews. I don't think I'm best placed to speak for the man on the Arab street.  I don't think I'm best qualified to analyse Muslim theology towards Jews.  I obviously don't speak for every, or indeed any, Muslim or Arab. But I see what I see, I read what I read and I draw my own conclusions. Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank and (nominally) Gaza part of the problem?  Yes it is.  But only in as much as Israel exists in the first place. I would really really like the Israel/PA negotiations taking place right now to succeed (a two state solution + fairness to both sides).  But even if it does, I am under no illusion that almost all of the Middle East will still despise Israel. Ironically, it seems most of the Middle East despises Palestinians too.  Why else has their population swelled to 5 million in Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian refugee camps without their being offered citizenship in these countries?  Why else have the promised Arab dollars not flowed into the West Bank? Before anybody feels compelled to 'comment' that until Israel was re-established in 1948 the Jews were treated well in Muslim/Arab countries, could I just say 'rubbish'.  Jews were merely tolerated at best and subject to the same spasms of religious zealotry and persecution as in Christian Europe. A quick read of 'In Ishmael's House' by Martin Gilbert should set your mind at rest concerning that worn out myth. Updated 123w ago • View Upvotes
