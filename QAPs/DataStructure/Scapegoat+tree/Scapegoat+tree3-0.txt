Does the rate of application of water to California Central Valley almond groves result in a lower flavor product?
I can not give you a definitive answer, but my inclination is to say "no". If the trees do not get enough water, not only will yield drop, but the nuts will be small, inceasing the ratio of brown husk to meat. This probably degrades the flavor somewhat because of the tannins in the brown outer layer. Wine grapes and some fruits are a different matter altogether, as deficit irrigation often produces a more concentrated flavor.
