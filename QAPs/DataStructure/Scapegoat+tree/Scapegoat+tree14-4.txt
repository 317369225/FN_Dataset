Did God make Adam & Eve dumb?
God did make them dumb. They inherited it from him. After god screwed up he decided to blame humans. What better scapegoats than us tiny human beings, stuck in a garden with a bunch of trees, one of which we're told not to eat from. Why put the f'ing tree there to begin with? The story is a human creation. Thanks to science we know that we didn't come from Adam and Eve.
