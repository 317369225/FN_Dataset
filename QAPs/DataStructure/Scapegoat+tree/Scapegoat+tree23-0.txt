Did Jesus die for our sins?
I'll take a swing at it too. Small background: I'm a 'liberal' lutheran, and both my parents are theologists. I've been surrounded by liberal-minded christians my whole life. The following is how I understand it. God created man. God loves man. God is the only perfect 'being' in the world. Sin is what separates man from being with God. God gave man free will, and as man is not perfect, free will leads man to sin. Before Jesus, going to heaven was impossible as only the free-of-sin could go to Heaven, and all people would sin. Jesus (God) lived a perfect life and sacrificed himself to bridge the gap which sin created between man and God. Because of Jesus's (God's) sacrifice, man is able to join God, in spite of mans flaws. I think I'm explaining it like it was explained to me.
