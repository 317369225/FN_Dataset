How do employment agencies put Overseas Filipino Workers in debt?
A2A If you go through an agency you will surely be in debt if you cannot pay for funds upfront. This is the same with any job, be it a domestic worker, engineer, or an occupational therapist. The best way for skilled workers is to be hired directly by your overseas employer/company, cutting the middleman. But this is all relative. An occupational therapist cousin of mine, for example, got her plane tickets, a car, and initial rent for a flat from her agency. This allowed her to settle in her new job. In exchange, she had to pay it off in two years (within her contract period). It is basically a hedge on her earning capacity. After the two years, she got hired directly by a new firm and broke amicably with the agency. NBA players also have agents who takes care not only the player's contracts, but also makes sure that the player is housed, has a car, and has money to get around. That is not free, of course, as the player will pay that back through his contracts. If the player is projected to be a superstar, banks will give them a line of credit, no questions asked. For domestic workers, we are up against the law of supply and demand. There are more people who needs jobs, and the cost of labor goes down up to a point. Then you compound the fact that hopeful hires have no money to bring themselves to HK, so they have to take out a loan, and the agency is all the more happy to lend it (with interest). To be fair (and since economics is neutral), the agency takes as much risk in lending someone 30,000 HKD, just as much as the domestic worker taking that much of a loan. That is how all loans work. The riskier the loan, the higher the cost.
