English (language):Â What are some interesting English idioms and their meanings?
Peeping Tom..... Yeah we all probably know what it means, but for those who haven't heard of it, It refers to people who secretly watch other people undressing/involving in sexual activities. The origin of the word is attributed to the instance of Lady Godiva who, in order to persuade her husband to reduce taxes on the poor, agreed to ride nude through the streets of their town. Yeah husbands had strange whims even back then, and wives were obstinate enough to carry out such absurdities as well. Anyway Lady Godiva had commanded everyone to stay inside and not watch as she carried out her dare. One guy however didn't want to miss this opportunity. After all, how often do you get to see a noble lady riding naked on a horse through your street? Unfortunately for the poor chap, he was blinded as a result of his indiscretion, but nevertheless immortalized through this phrase. That's how the story goes though not necessarily true. Here's the source, where you can read more about it. http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanin...
