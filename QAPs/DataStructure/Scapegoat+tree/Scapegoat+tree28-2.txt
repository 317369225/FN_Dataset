Do most atheists believe that Jesus existed?
This question discussed it in terms of historians and did a very good job giving solid research and inquiry. As far as a pole from the general atheist community, I have never seen anything like that. The most outspoken ones on most forums don't seem to though. Do credible historians agree that the man named Jesus, who the Christian Bible speaks of, walked the earth and was put to death on a cross by Pilate, Roman governor of Judea?
