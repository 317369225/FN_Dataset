Is it fair to compare the "May 4 Massacre" (Kent State shooting) in 1970 to "Tiananmen Massacre" in China?
While the reactions may be similar, there are key differences. The first that comes to mind would be the amount of force brought relative to the demonstration (America didn't have tanks rolling through campus) and the second would be how the event was handled. The freedom of the press allowed the information regarding Kent state to flow freely and people were free to form opinions about what was right and what was wrong (a national poll right after the event found most Americans blamed the students). This freedom allowed changes to be made both by schools and the military/police. I am not a Chinese national, so I can only speak to what I've heard about how the events were handled there. I've heard that most Chinese don't know it ever happened or assume it is a lie spread by the west and I've heard that all information regarding the incident is tightly controlled and censored out of web searches. This is not conducive to national debate and prevents any meaningful changes from occurring that could avert this tragedy from happening again as well as holding governments accountable.
