What is a bipartite graph?
The descriptions above outline the properties, but not the utility or reason you should care. What is it? I think of it as a search criteria over graph data, where I am looking for a very useful special case. I am looking for a data structure called an Adjacency Matrix, aka: a 2-mode matrix.Â  A two mode matrix maps together instances of entities of two types. That means for example your row headers are schools, and your column headers are students. In databases these are resolver tables that enable many-to-many relations. Prathyush Kashyap's answer illustrates this nicely.
