What is a bipartite graph?
As there are few explanations in here before I write... I just will go with a simple answer.. Bipartite Graphs are those which have two sets of vertices which are mutually disjoint . The Relation or edges in these graphs exists only between two vertices which are not from the same set of vertices. Famous example : Assigning n jobs to m persons can be modelled usingÂ  a Bipartite Graph.. The edge exists if a job i can be allotted to a person p. Obviously this requires a Bipartite model of graph, Since an edge here can not exist between a job to another job or a person to another person.
