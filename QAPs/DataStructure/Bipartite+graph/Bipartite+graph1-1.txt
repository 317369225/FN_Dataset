What are the best resources on practical applications of Bipartite Graphs?Papers, Books, Blogs - anything that covers practical real world examples.
Bipartite graphs are used extensively in online space, specifically in search advertising and e-commerce for similarity ranking. Just search for bipartite graph along with clustering or recommendations or collaborative filtering and you will find large number of papers on these. (they are the best resources) For instance, in advertising - a click graph is a bipartite graph with ads as one partition, queries as the other partition and the edges(between partitions) can represent clicks.  We could now use this graph, to find similar advertisers and related queries(like clustering).  Here are some papers which is in-use in production systems right now. Simank - is one of the most famous paper which uses weighted bipartite graph of queries and ads for query rewriting => http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/... Generating recommendations using Collaborative filtering on bipartite graphs => http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj20... (yelp food recommendation system) Anamoly detection => http://www.sigkdd.org/sites/defa... Query clustering using click graph(again) => http://www2009.eprints.org/108/1... I love the endless possibilities of applications you get, when you do random walks on Bipartite graphs => http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/~qmei2... While searching this, I came across this book which talks about various algorithms on bipartite graphs => Cambridge University Press Updated 3 May 2014 • View Upvotes
