What are the best resources on practical applications of Bipartite Graphs?Papers, Books, Blogs - anything that covers practical real world examples.
Outside of modelling problems as matchings in a bipartite graph which is very common, I would say the best known everyday use of bipartite graphs is the stable marriage problem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sta...). Think of two groups - guys and girls where each guy has an ordered list of all girls and vice versa. The Gale-Shapely algorithm always outputs a stable matching - one in which there never exist two couples such that they would be happier if they swapped partners. I think its really well described in the following slides: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu... But for a more standard reference, the Wikipedia page is here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem
