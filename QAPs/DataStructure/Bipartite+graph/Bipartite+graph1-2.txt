What are the best resources on practical applications of Bipartite Graphs?Papers, Books, Blogs - anything that covers practical real world examples.
If you look at algorithms for computing deadlock in computer systems, the representation of the system is sometimes (maybe usually) maintained as a bipartite graph.  That is to say, a system is a bipartite graph, S=<V,E>  , where the set of vertices, V  , is the disjoint union of resources and processes: V=R∪P  , and each edge in the set of edges, E  , leads either from  a process to a resource, or from a resource to a processe.  In the first case, the process owns the resource.  In the second case the process is waiting for the resource. I haven't looked at deadlock algorithms in years, so I don't know if this is used anymore.  You should look at operating systems books, though.
