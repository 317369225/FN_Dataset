What are some known algorithms for finding a perfect match in a bipartite graph?Check if the both the disjoint node sets are of equal size. Reduce it to a max flow problem as mentioned here [1].  If the flow value is equal to the left edge set you have a perfect matching. To find the matching, just output the edges with a positive flow on them.
