What is a bipartite graph?
A graph (V,E) Whereas the vertices(V) can be split into two sets V1 and V2 s.t. every edge e is a pair {v1,v2} s.t v1 belong to V1 and v2 belong to V2; And V1,V2 are disjoint sets Pay attention that such a graph does not contain odd length cycles. Moreover a graph without odd length cycles is bipartite E.g.Â  tree is always bipartite (it doesn't contain cycles and esp' not odd length cycles), In order to split some tree's vertices into two sets you can run the BFS algorithm and mark all the vertices that you found on any odd step as V1 and all the other vertices as V2
