Is Bitcoin arbitrage a feasible trading strategy?
In theory, yes. The lack of a central exchange and the distributed nature of the bitcoin system would lead to arbitrage opportunities, most likely fairly large ones. However, you would likely face a few issues if you actually tried to implement this system: Difficulty Generating Sufficient Leverage - Many currency arbitrage strategies are only see meaningful profits when substantial leverage is applied. Given the relatively small size of the Bitcoin market, trying to buy your way in en masse could decrease liquidity your exchange of choice and increase the price at which you are making your purchase. Furthermore, trying to mine sufficient Bitcoin to begin your strategy would require a nontrivial processing investment (GPU's, etc.) and a fair amount of time Security Issues - Given that your strategy will likely involve significant capital deployment at any given time, you should be wary of the possibility of another security leak (Bitcoin bubble burst? Currency suffers dramatic correction) occurring while you are unable to take your money off the table. Speed of Execution - The time to clear a Bitcoin transaction is highly variable, and it is not uncommon for trades to take in excess of 10min to clear (Bitcoin Stats). This delay in capital redeployment would likely decrease the practical profitability of your strategy However, with a little technical savvy, you could likely pull it off. Would be a pretty interesting problem at the very least
