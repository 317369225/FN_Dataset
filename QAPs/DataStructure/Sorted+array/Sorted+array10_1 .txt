Given a partially sorted array, what would be the optimized algorithm to find the index and generate the sorted sub array?Eg. Consider [5,2,9,4,7,8,0] The output must print [4,7,8], [7,8]If you can define the set size, use bubble sort and break at set size. Better if you use recursion. I hope order of the sorting is not an issue. If order is an issue, tweak the quick sort and add the set size as param to the recursive branch.
