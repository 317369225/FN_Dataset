Why is processing a sorted array faster than an unsorted array?The same reason why a mother tells her son to clean and arrange the study table neatly. So that you can retrieve your books and files easily :) The same logic applies here also. For faster retrieval of data. Once you have an idea of about how the data is arranged in an array, you can retrieve it easily without having to search for it But it does not make ALL kinds of processing faster. For example, if you have an untidy desk and you want to put your book on the desk, you just toss the book on top of the pile (Insertion of data takes less time) But the next time you want to search for it, it'll take a lot of time (especially if there are LOTS of books) So similarly, insertion in an unsorted array is faster but retrieval is slower
