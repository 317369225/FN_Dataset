Given a sorted array, output all triplets <a,b,c> such that a-b = c. Expected time is O(n^2) notÂ  O(n^2 logn)?You can even solve this question if the array is not sorted by first creating a hash table of the array now as pointed by in the answer above that problem can be reduced to a+b=c so you just have to make two loops 1234567 for(i;i<n;++i){ for(j;j<n;++j){  sum = arr[i] + arr[j];  if(check_hash_table(sum))  print arr[i],arr[j],sum } }
