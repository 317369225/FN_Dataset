How can I find common elements in 3 sorted arrays?
Here is a generalized solutionÂ  for finding common elements from n sorted arrays: Find common elements in 'n' sorted arrays The algorithm is as following - We are given 'n' sorted arrays, say array-1, array-2 to array-n. To find out common elements in these arrays, we pick each element starting from element at index 0 from array-1 and check if that element is present in all remaining arrays. To check if an element from array-0(elementArray0) is present in array-'i'(1 <= i <= n), we start looking at the elements in array-'i' starting from 'last checked index' until we find an element which is...
