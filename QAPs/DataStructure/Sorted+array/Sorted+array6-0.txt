How can I find the median of two sorted arrays?
This is a timeless classic among interview questions. Your interpretation in the question details is correct: the task is to find the element that would be in the middle of the array obtained by merging the two given arrays into one sorted array containing all their elements. Of course, the intended solution is to find that element in sublinear time. (Good solutions use some modified version of binary search.) Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.
