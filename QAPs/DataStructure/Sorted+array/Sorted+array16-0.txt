What is sorted array, and how do you use it?
I don't know of sorted arrays, since arrays are accessed randomly by index, so it's kinda pointless. I've heard of sorted list. When you add the first element, it is placed in the first position. When a second element is added, it is either inserted at the begining or appended at the end, depending on whether it is greater than the first. Subsequent elements are inserted in the corresponding position. Whenever you traverse the list, it will be sorted. Sorted lists may have a linked list, an array or binary tree as undelying structure. 193 Views Â· 1 Upvote
