How do you search for a number in a sorted array if a) you know the size of the array, and b) you don't know the size?Binary search in the first case. For the second case, assuming that the array can be arbitrarily long, I'd first find the reference index by starting from the first place, then doubling the index until I find an index of a first element that is equal or bigger that the number you are looking for. I'd then binary search inside that last segment to find the location of the target element.
