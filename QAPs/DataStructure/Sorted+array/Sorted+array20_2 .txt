How can I fix my program about finding the k-th smallest element in the union of two sorted arrays, for time O(k)?该网页不存在附加信息...I think it's simpler to have one loop, stop when you reach the condition (a+b==k) or (a+b+1==k if k starts at 1), and then return the lowest element between A[a] and B[b] (or one element if you've reached the end of one array. Before comparing the elements, check if any indices are outside of their array, and avoid the comparison by simply increasing the other index. Otherwise, do the same as you are doing, increasing the smaller index. I ran this idea manually and it worked for your example on 3).
