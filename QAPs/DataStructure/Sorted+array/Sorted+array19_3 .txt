How would you square each element in a sorted array of ascending integers while still maintaining the order?Given n is any element in the sorted array: 32_BIT_INT_MIN <= n <= n + 1 <= 32_BIT_INT_MAX Additionally, what is the fastest possible time complexity of this algorithm and how could that be implemented?Maintaining the order is not a problem since if a>b then sqr(a)>sqr(b). You can do it in O(n) time complexity and loop over each numer and square it. And another way would be looping half the way through the array and finding the square of two numbers in the code inside of the array instead of one.
