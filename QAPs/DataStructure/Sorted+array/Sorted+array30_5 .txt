How do I sort array of pair<int, int> in C++ according to the first and the second element?For example if I have: (10,10),(10,20)(10,10) to get (10,10),(10,10),(10,20).There can be many ways to approach. One I am writing which will be useful when range of numbers is not too big.: let us say 01) convert all pairs to a single number as follows: a=(x*max)+y; 2)perform any sorting method on these numbers P.s : there are many solutions. Choose wisely :)
