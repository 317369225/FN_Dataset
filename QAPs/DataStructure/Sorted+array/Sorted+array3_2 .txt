Given a sorted array and a number and element K, find Ks nearest elements to the number in the sorted array?Here are the steps steps of the Algorithm you could follow: A[] -> Array of numbers. n -> Given number. k -> the number of nearest elements to be found. iterate through the array A[i]=abs(A[i]-n) (abs-> absolute value) Sort the modified array pick the first k elements. The over all time complexity of the mentioned Algorithm is of O(nlogn) (due to the sorting algo). PS: Please comment if you need more clarification.
