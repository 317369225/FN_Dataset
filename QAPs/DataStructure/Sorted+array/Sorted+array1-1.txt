What is the best sorting algorithm for approximately sorted arrays?
Thanks for the A2A. For nearly sorted arrays, the best is probably good old Bubble or Insertion. Here is a comparison of the various sorting algorithms and their efficacy on different types of data: Sorting Algorithm Animations Bubble is the easiest to implement, but Insertion is a better all-rounder. And if you are a working on a simulation where the array needs to be mostly correct and always updated, I suggest a single pass of Bubble, perhaps toggling directions every frame. You cannot get much faster than that: Dale Thomas' answer to How efficient is bubble sort? 1.3k Views · 13 Upvotes · Answer requested by Netal Jubalín
