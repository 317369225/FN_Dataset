How do you search for a number in a sorted array if a) you know the size of the array, and b) you don't know the size?a) If you know the size of the array and that the array is sorted then, go for binary search. (Refer to the link if you don't know binary search- C programming Interview questions and answers) b)If you don't know the size of the array, then use the 'sizeof' operator to find the size of the whole array (It would return the number of bytes occupied by that array). You can divide that with the size of each element in the array. For example, If the array contains integers, then divide the value obtained from the sizeof operator by the size of an integer. int a[17]; int n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int); Hope this helps :)
