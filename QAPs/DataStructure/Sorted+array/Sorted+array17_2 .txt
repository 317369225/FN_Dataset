Given a sorted array, what are some good ways to find all its subsets whose sum is equal to a given value k in O(n)?Bit mask technique won't work.The Subset sum problem asks: "given a set (or multiset) of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero?". Now it has been proved that this is an NP complete problem and the only solutions for this problem are exponential. Now if a O(N) solution existed for your question, then we could sort any array and reduce the Subset Sum problem to your problem.This would make Subset Sum problem solvable in O(N logN) time which would imply that the NP complete Subset Sum problem is solvable in polynomial time( P=NP !!) which is very very very unlikely. Hence your question cannot have a O(N) solution, infact it cannot even have a polynomial solution.Only exponential solution is possible.
