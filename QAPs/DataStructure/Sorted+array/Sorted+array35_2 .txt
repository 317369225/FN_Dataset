How do I write a program that, given two sorted arrays of N int values, prints all elements that appear in both arrays, in sorted order?The running time of your program should be proportional to N in the worst case?If you don't mind indented psuedocode: a=b=0 while a<N && b<N  if A[a]==B[b]  print A[a++]  b++ // (optional)  while a<N && A[a]==A[a-1] {a++} // (optional) makes the output a set  else  while A[a]<B[b]  a++  while B[b]<A[a]  b++ hmm, just rereading Kevin's answer and the question turns out to be ambiguous. This shows how to find the intersection, i.e. each item that appears in both arrays EDIT if you dislike typing: intersection of sets: a=b=0 if N  do  if A[a]==B[b]  print A[a++]  while (A[a]<B[b]?++a:++b)<N union of sets: a=b=0 while a<N && b<N  print min(A[a],B[b])  a+=(A[a]<=B[b])  b+=(B[b]<=A[a]) while a<N  print A[a++] while b<N  print B[b++]
