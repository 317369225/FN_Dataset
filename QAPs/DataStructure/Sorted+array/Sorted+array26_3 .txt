Given an array of positive integers, how can we convert it into a sorted array with minimum cost using the decrement and deletion operations (Decrement operator cost = 1, Deletion operator cost = value of the element)?For example: Consider the array 4,3,5,6 . We can sort it by decrementing 4 and thus sorted array will be 3, 3, 5, 6. Minimum cost is 1 for sorting in this case. Consider the array 10,3,11,12. We can sort it by deleting 3 and thus sorted array will be 10, 11, 12. Minimum cost is 3 for this case.DP. Step through the array keeping track of your position and the max element to your left. Try all possible decrements and delete. This is O(n W^2) where W is the max element in the array.
