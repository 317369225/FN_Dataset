How do I write a program that, given two sorted arrays of N int values, prints all elements that appear in both arrays, in sorted order?The running time of your program should be proportional to N in the worst case?Step 1: Sort both lists Step 2: If next element in A is less than next element in B, move to next item in A and jump to step 5 Step 3: If next element in B is less than next element in A, move to next item in B and jump to step 5 Step 4: They must be equal, so print the current element in list A and move to next item in both A and B Step 5: If at end of A or B, end program Step 6: Go to step 2.
