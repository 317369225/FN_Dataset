Given a sorted array, what are some good ways to find all its subsets whose sum is equal to a given value k in O(n)?Bit mask technique won't work.It is something like this : If we have to find subsets of 2,then subtract k/2 from each element. Now we r finding 2 elements such tht a[i] a[i+1] equals to zero. Given they are arranged in non increasing absolute order of elements. Example: if array is sorted as 2 5 -5 7 10, then to find subsets of 2, subtract each element 1. 1 4 - 6 6. Find two numbers such that equal to zero. 4 and - 6. Also, it's not just I and i+1, it can be i+2 also. ;) For subsets of 3,subtract k/3. . . . This series is called something I forgot.I don't remember ... But this is one way.
