What is the best sorting algorithm for approximately sorted arrays?
Here, the correct answer depends on many things. One of them: what do you mean by “approximately sorted”? There are many different measures of sortedness, and for almost each and every one of them you can find an algorithm that is good if that particular measure tells you that the input is almost sorted. The other thing: are you after theoretical or practical results? In practice, in most cases the answer is the generic O(nlogn)  O(nlog⁡n) one — the one that’s available in your standard library. The “extra” logn  log⁡n factor does rarely matters. When you have the guarantee that each element is at most k  k steps away from it... (more)
