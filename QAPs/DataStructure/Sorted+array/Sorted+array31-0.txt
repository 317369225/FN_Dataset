Which is better for binary search, sorted array or linked list?
Binary search is an algorithm for the search-problem, and can be utilized in many different settings, including certain kinds of decision procedures for optimization problems. Binary search requires that the input data maintains a partial ordering (in simple terms, it is sorted in non-decreasing order). The benefit we want out of the algorithm is to access each value at the middle position in constant time. In a linked list, getting the middle position can take O(n)  O(n) time. So the time complexity would go from O(logn)  O(log⁡n) to O(nlogn)  O(nlog⁡n) . A data structure such as an array is far more suitable as you can access any member... (more)
