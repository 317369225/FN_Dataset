How can I merge three sorted arrays into a single sorted array efficiently?
Ideal Merge. Here’s a link to a description: ideal merge Note that this description suggests using either a linear search or heap structure (which is similar to Arun’s algorithm) to maintain the order of the input arrays. Since that was published I have settled on using a binary search which, like the heap method, is O(MlogN) where M is the total number of elements in all input arrays and N is the number of input arrays. Of course with N=3 a linear search will perform just as well as a binary search and is simpler to code. 69 Views
