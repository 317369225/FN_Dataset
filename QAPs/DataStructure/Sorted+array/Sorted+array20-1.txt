Given a sorted array of numbers. Construct a balanced binary tree with the numbers in the Array as keys?
This question was recently asked to me in D.E. Shaw interview. I recently read solution for this while going through this link: Create a balanced Binary Search Tree from a sorted array Credits: IDeserve The problem can be solved in linear time complexity by applying binary search on the sorted array. We find the mid of the array and make it the root. Then we create left and right sub trees of the balanced binary tree using left and right sub-arrays recursively.Â  Algorithm for creating a balanced binary search tree from a sorted array:... (more)
