How do you merge N sorted arrays?The priority queue method is probably the simplest to implement quickly, however, for the sake of variety, here is another solution with equal run time. Lemma1: Merging two arrays is straightforward and can be done in linear time with respect to the number of elements in both arrays. The proof is left as an exercise to the reader. Using Lemma1, you can pair up the arrays and merge each pair. Then you take the resulting arrays and apply the same process again. You continue until you have one array left and voila! Note that each merge phase cost operations, being the total number of elements across all the arrays, and is independent of the number of arrays/pairs. This leads to the following recurrence equation: , which means that .
