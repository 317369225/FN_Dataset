Given a sorted array, what are some good ways to find all its subsets whose sum is equal to a given value k in O(n)?Bit mask technique won't work.Aditya Kadam has already explained nicely that already a simpler version of your problem is known to be hard to solve. However, for your problem (to actually find all such subsets) there is also a much simpler argument why it cannot be done in O(n): there's waaay too many of them. There are different subsets of with the same sum of 217. In general, if your array is , there are distinct subsets but only distinct sums possible, so the most frequent sum has to correspond to different subsets.
