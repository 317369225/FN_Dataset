Why is my code running in an infinite loop for the problem of finding an element in a rotated sorted array?该网页不存在附加信息...Your code runs in O(n)? Aren't you getting a stack overflow or something? Using your example I seem to get stuck in an infinite recursion. [code] else if(array[mid] > key){ // 4 > 1 //2 > 1  System.out.println(low + " " + high + " " + mid + "mid > key");  if(!rotatedBinSearch(low, mid-1, key)){...} ...} [/code]
