What is the efficient way to find the median of the 2 sorted array of same or different size?I like Rajkiran Rajkumar's answer, but the post that he shared from GeeksforGeeks assumes that both arrays are of equal size. Here Median of two sorted arrays of different sizes - GeeksforGeeks is the solution for the case when the arrays are of different size (still it is modification of the second method of the previous post). Here Page on alfaisal.edu I found a sollution that sounds more intuitive (at least for me). In short: If we have two arrays A[1...n] and B[1...m] and if element A[i] is the median, then it must be the case that A[i] > A[i-1], ..., A[0] (since A is sorted) and it means that A[i] is smaller or equal to element B[j+1], where j := (m+n)/2 - (i-1). And we do a binary search to find element A[i] with these properties.
