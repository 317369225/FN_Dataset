What are good ways to sort array elements stored in shared memory?How can I sort elements stored in shared memory?Well, the straightforward way would be to get the mutex for the array, use your favorite sorting algorithm, and release the mutex. I suspect that your real question is more complicated tho, and unfortunately, the situation varies a lot depending on the precise architecture that you're working in. Say more please.
