What are permutations in a k-sorted array?该网页不存在附加信息...In fact you don't really need a constructive proof using a decision tree model like original proof for pure random permutations, especially if this is just an assignment of a course. Simply reduce to our existing result: pure random permutations have lower bound n log n: Suppose we have a better solution for k-sorted array, formally speaking, time complexity T(k) = o(n log k), then by choosing a special case k = n, our algo has time complexity T(n) = o(n log n), however this is the case of pure random permutation, therefore a contradiction. (Note the little-o notation performs a "strictly less" concept of complexity)
