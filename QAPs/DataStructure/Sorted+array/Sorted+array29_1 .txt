How can i find the position of first ’1′ in a sorted array that contains only 0-s and 1-s?Pls suggest an efficient algorithmWhat's wrong with binary search? Nice O(log N) algo... Just run binary search for "1" that has "0" before it. Also remember to check if the special case where array has all "0"s and all "1"s. This should do it:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213 //check the trivial case of all 0s and all 1s then do binary search low = 0 high = N - 1 while (low <= high) {  mid = (low + high) / 2  if (A[mid] == 1 && A[mid-1] == 1)  high = mid - 1  else if (A[mid] == 0)  low = mid + 1  else  return mid } mid is the required index of first 1 in the array.
