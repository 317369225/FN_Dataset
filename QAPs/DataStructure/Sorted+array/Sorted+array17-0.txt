What's the best way to delete duplicates from a sorted array in O(logN)  O(log⁡N) time and O(1)  O(1) space?
It's impossible, if you make the assumptions that you are sorting integers and they are stored in a linear array.  This is a good time to start asking questions about the type and distribution of the data points, and about the nature of the structures that index them.  A very important part of an interview is demonstrating that you can communicate effectively in order to understand a problem. For instance, you can delete duplicates from a sorted array of booleans values in O(log N) time.  Just do a binary search to find where the array switches from False to True. 3.4k Views · 11 Upvotes
