How do I write a program that, given two sorted arrays of N int values, prints all elements that appear in both arrays, in sorted order?The running time of your program should be proportional to N in the worst case?Do something like the merge step of merge sort, except that instead of adding to the numbers to a third array, you simply keep going until you find a pair. Oh, and the other difference is that you'd probably need to ignore duplicates. If any of the arrays runs out, you stop.
