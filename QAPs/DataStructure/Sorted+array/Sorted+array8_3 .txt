How do I find the minimal range that contains a number from each sorted array?该网页不存在附加信息...The most straightforward approach would seem to be to mark a number line (essentially a Counting Sort) with the row numbers where the values can be found, then sweep the line for the minimum range, probably by watching the last index we've seen each of the rows represented. For your data, in other words, you create something like this: 1 - 1 20 - 2 55 - 3 1000 - 1 1001 - 2 1002 - 3 2000 - 1 5000 - 2 222222 - 3 Iterating through this list, we basically replace indices and check the range. 1: / 20: / 55: 55 - 1 = 54 1000: 1000 - 20 = 980 1001: 1001 - 55 = 946 1002: 1002 - 1000 = 2 2000: 2000 - 1001 = 999 5000: 5000 - 1002 - 3998 222222: 222222 - 2000 = 220222 This doesn't depend on any kind of ordering, though, so there might be a cleverer way to accomplish the goal. But as long as you don't include every possible number, rather than just the numbers you have, it's linear time (two passes through the data set). Anything more efficient is going to need to know there's data to skip. I suppose, if you know that each row is sorted, you can skip the initial index table and try to walk through each row simultaneously, but that sounds error-prone for an arbitrary number of rows.
