How do you merge N sorted arrays?What you can do is use a priority queue. From each array, insert the minimum element and also store the array that the given element came from. While the priority queue is not empty, poll the queue for the smallest unprocessed element, append it to the end of the sorted array, and then add the next element from the array (if it exists), also storing the source array. This will run in time, if there are a total of elements over all the sorted arrays.
