What's the best way to delete duplicates from a sorted array in time and space?It can be proven that it's impossible in . It's impossible because in you won't even see all the elements (as Sai mentioned). In a sorted array, you need to traverse the entire array linearly and for each element, compare it with the previous one to see if it should be removed. This takes time and space. Optionally you can "defragment" the array as well, which is doable in linear time as you're de-duping.
