Given m individually sorted arrays each of length n, return three largest elements?n and m could be millions or billions . I mean Billion array and each containing billion elements (all array are sorted). efficient algorithm ?Maintain 3 variables that store the 3 largest numbers you have seen so far. Loop through each sorted array and look at the 3 largest numbers in the array. This can be done in O(1) time since the array is sorted. Then, update your 3 variables. This can be done in O(1) time as well since you only have 3 variables to consider. The total running time is O(m). This is also optimal because without additional information, you must look at each array at least once.
