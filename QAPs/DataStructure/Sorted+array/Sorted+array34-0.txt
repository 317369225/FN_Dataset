Given an array of positive integers, how can we convert it into a sorted array with minimum cost using the decrement and deletion operations (Decrement operator cost = 1, Deletion operator cost = value of the element)?
I strongly suspect that this problem can be solve in O(N) or O(N log N), however I haven't worked out all of the details.  However, I will detail a simple O(N^2) solution that I think can be made faster with a few transformations. Consider the smallest element in the array.  We will never decrement anything below that so the only decision we need to make with it is whether we delete it or not.  If we delete the smallest element we recurse on the one-smaller array.  If we choose not to delete the element then we will decrement everything prior to it to match its value.  There is no reason t...
