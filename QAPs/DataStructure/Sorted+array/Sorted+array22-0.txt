Why should one ever use a heap instead of a sorted array?
OK, let’s clarify a few things, first. Appending to an ArrayList (or std::vector in C++) takes amortized constant time. Inserting into a random location in the list takes linear time, because portion of the underlying array needs to be shifted. Yes, building a heap takes linear time and inserts/deletes take O(lg n). While peeking the heap, which means finding the min/max stored element is, of course, O(1), popping the head is O(lg n). So, to answer the main question - why use a heap compared to a sorted array? The answer is simple. In some use cases, you don’t care about sorting all of your d... (more)
