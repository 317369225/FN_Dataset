Given a partially sorted array 'A' of 'n' elements, there are at most O(sqrt(n)) elements in 'A' whose removal would result in a perfectly sorted array and none of these O(sqrt(n)) elements are adjacent to each other. How can we sort 'A' in O(n)?Start from the first index of A and move until you find an element which is smaller in value than its previous element store its index and move its next element to its position. Now start from that index+1 position and repeat the procedure in the similar to step 1.This way you will be able to remove all the odd elements and this process will atmost take O(n^2) but the number of elements are O(sqrt(n)) so the whole process will be in O(n).
