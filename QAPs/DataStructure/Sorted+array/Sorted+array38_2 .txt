How do I find out whether there exists two elements in a sorted array whose sum is equal to some predefined number?The most optimized solution is required.One could be to: take up every element starting from the first and using a binary search to find an element that could be summed with it. Search from only elements after the chosen element. continue the chosen element crosses half of the required sum. Also check if largest number in the array is greater than half of the sum and the smallest number of the array is less than half of the required sum. Comment for anymore clarifications.
