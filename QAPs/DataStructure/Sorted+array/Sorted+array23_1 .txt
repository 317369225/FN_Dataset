How do you search for a number in a sorted array if a) you know the size of the array, and b) you don't know the size?If you know the size of the array, just use Binary search algorithm. It'll get you an answer in O(log n). If you don't know the size of your array, you should just figure that out. In almost any language there's a constant time function to determine the size of an array, and then you just do binary search as before. If you're not working with an array at all, but instead something like a linked list, then you're screwed. Unfortunately your only option there is to just linearly traverse the list until you either find the desired element, or realize you've gone too far. It'll run in O(n) time.
