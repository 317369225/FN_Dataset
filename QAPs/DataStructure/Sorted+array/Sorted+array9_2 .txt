How does one find the median of m sorted arrays?There are two variation of this question. 1. Each array has same size. 2. Each array has different size.The median of a sorted array is simply A[ mid ] that is the middle element of the array. Here, mid=(left+right)/2 Using the normal formula to find a median in sorted data. Create a new array with medians of the m arrays. Use quickselect() to find the median. It's average case performance takes linear time. Refer: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicks... quickselect() is a modified version of the partition sub routine of the quick sort algorithm. Another way is recursively using a median of median subroutine.
