What's the best way to delete duplicates from a sorted array in time and space?It's impossible, if you make the assumptions that you are sorting integers and they are stored in a linear array. This is a good time to start asking questions about the type and distribution of the data points, and about the nature of the structures that index them. A very important part of an interview is demonstrating that you can communicate effectively in order to understand a problem. For instance, you can delete duplicates from a sorted array of booleans values in O(log N) time. Just do a binary search to find where the array switches from False to True.
