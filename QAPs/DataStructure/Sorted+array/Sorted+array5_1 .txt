What would be an efficient way to convert an AVL tree to a sorted array?I think you cannot know a-priori the number of nodes in the tree.We have to look at each element in the AVL tree to move it into a sorted array, so our algorithm will be at least O(n). An AVL tree is a type of binary search tree. As such, we can perform an in-order traversal in O(n). This matches our lower bound, so we're golden. You can either dump everything into a dynamically sized structure, like an array list, and read into an array. You could do two tree traversals, one to count the number of nodes, one to perform the work of the algorithm (but knowing insertion cell might be tricky), or you can use a linked list and then read from that into an array.
