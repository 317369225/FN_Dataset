What will be the complexity of quick sort if we insert an element at some random position in a sorted array and then ask it to sort again using quick sort?For example an array like this: 2, 4, 6, 55, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22Quadratic for a sorted (almost sorted) array. Even with Randomised selection of pivot, the worst case complexity would be O(n*n)
