How can I fix my program about finding the k-th smallest element in the union of two sorted arrays, for time O(k)?该网页不存在附加信息...I guess the following idea will work!! use 2 variables: 1. To count the number of comparisons (You can track till this variable reaches k) 2. Minimum element in each pass in the while loop So roughly, your code can be modified as below, int counter = 0; int minimumValue = Math.min(A[0], B[0]); // And then, edit your while loop to something like while(...) {  if(A[a] < B[b]) {  minimumValue = A[a];  a++;  counter++;  } else {  minimumValue = B[b];  b++;  counter++;  }  // Check if counter reached k  if(counter == k)  return minimumValue; } Something of this sort. You may want to add more boundary checks in your code!!
