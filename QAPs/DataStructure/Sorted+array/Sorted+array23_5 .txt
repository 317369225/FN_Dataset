How do you search for a number in a sorted array if a) you know the size of the array, and b) you don't know the size?Array With size: Binary search algorithm is the best thing to implement as the time complexity is much better. You can use brute force algorithm too where you can just iterate through each element and find the element you are searching for. worst case time complexity will be the size of the array. Array without size: I think the only way of doing it is to iterate through each element. You cant employ binary search algorithm as you need to know the size of an array to do it. In this case, you really have no idea what the size of an array is. So the time complexity will be O(n).
