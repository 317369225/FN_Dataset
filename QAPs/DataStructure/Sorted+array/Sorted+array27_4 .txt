What will be the complexity of quick sort if we insert an element at some random position in a sorted array and then ask it to sort again using quick sort?For example an array like this: 2, 4, 6, 55, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22Commercial sort functions are not limited to a single algorithm. They make one full or partial pass to determine which algorithm to use. When asked to sort the example array, they will choose insertion sort, which will run in O(n).
