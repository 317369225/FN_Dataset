How do I implement the problem of "finding the kth smallest element in the union of two sorted arrays" in Java? What is the O(log k) solution?该网页不存在附加信息...First of all, you are asking the wrong question. I see questions like this one all the time. "How do I implement problem XYZ in language ABC?" The answer to all such questions should always be exactly the same: 1. Understand the algorithm you are trying to implement. 2. Learn the language well enough so that you can translate the algorithm into code. Do not use algorithm problems like this one to learn the language. If you do not know the language well enough yet, you are not ready to solve this problem. And memorizing the code, hoping to write it from memory if you get asked this question at an interview, is exactly the way how you should not do it. When discussing the algorithm, pay attention to details. You are not doing that now. The description you posted in the question details contains, among others, the following three things: Given [are] two sorted arrays with m and n elements, respectively. Compare the middle elements of both arrays. Let's say that A[k/2] < B[k/2].Do you see any discrepancy here? You certainly should. If the lengths are m and n, why are you comparing elements at index k/2 instead? Binary search is notorious for being hard to implement if you don't pay attention to details. This task is way harder, with more details that you have to keep in mind. You will not solve it correctly if you just try to wing it. You need to approach it with the right mindset: Details matter. Every +1 is important. Ideally, try to learn to think in invariants. (Have you ever correctly implemented a plain binary search from scratch? Can you do some of its minor variations, e.g. "count how many occurrences of x are in this sorted array"? If no, start there.) That being said, here are some hints to help you fix the solution you posted: What can you do in the beginning if some of the two arrays are long? (I.e., either m>k, or n>k, or both.) What can you do in some iteration if one of the arrays is very short (e.g., A[k/2] does not exist)? What can you deduce about element sizes when you find out that A[k/2] < B[k/2]?
