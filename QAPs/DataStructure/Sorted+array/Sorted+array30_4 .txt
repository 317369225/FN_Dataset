How do I sort array of pair<int, int> in C++ according to the first and the second element?For example if I have: (10,10),(10,20)(10,10) to get (10,10),(10,10),(10,20).This might be a question of design. If you know this array will be sorted at some time as an integral part of the operation, it may be short-sighted to start with such an array. Why not use an appropriate container to begin with that supports the ordering you want whilst its elements are added e.g. multimap<int, int>?
