Given two sorted arrays of equal length, how do you find a pair of numbers, one from each array, such that the absolute difference between the two numbers is minimum?You can do a merge like in mergesort. With each comparison you can compare the difference with the previously stored min difference. When you reach the end of either array, you're done. UPDATE: Python snippet for the above: [Python] min_pair - Pastebin.com
