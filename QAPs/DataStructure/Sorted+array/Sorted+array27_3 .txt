What will be the complexity of quick sort if we insert an element at some random position in a sorted array and then ask it to sort again using quick sort?For example an array like this: 2, 4, 6, 55, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22In general complexity of Quick sort in worst case is O(n*n) unless smart pivot selection is done, for example median of medians method Median of medians it will guarantee O(n*log(n)). Answering your question if you stick with Quick sort than sorting already sorted and nearly sorted will have the same complexity. For nearly sorted array insertion sort will work perfectly O(n), Insertion sort
