Given two sorted arrays in ascending order, with the same length N, what is the Kth min a [i] +b [j]. time complexity O(N)?该网页不存在附加信息...without reading the paper .. 1. start with both i=j=0. 1st min = a[i] + b[j] 2. if a[i+1] < b[j+1]  a[i+1] + b[j] becomes 2nd min, i++  else  a[i] + b[j+1] becomes 2nd min, j++ Repeat step 2 K times and you should get Kth min in Linear time. Hope this helps !
