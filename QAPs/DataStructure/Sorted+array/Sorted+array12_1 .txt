What is the efficient way to find the median of the 2 sorted array of same or different size?Median of two sorted arrays - GeeksforGeeks - very clear explanation here along with code. Basically the point is to compare the median of the existing search space using Binary search and updating the search space based on that. For example, if you have 2 arrays. {1,2,3,4,5} and {6,7,8,9,10} median of first will be 3 and median of second will be 8. Since 3 is smaller than 8, we can safely exclude the region below 3 and later than 8. Like that. And, yeah size doesn't matter in this situation. If you are looking for a more trivial and slower solution, you can always modify the merge part of the merge sort and keep adding elements in the sorted order until you end up with (n+m)/2 elements, where n and m are the sizes of the 2 arrays. However, this solution is slower taking O(n) time whereas the previous one is O(lg n). Just mentioned this because it is easier to understand.
