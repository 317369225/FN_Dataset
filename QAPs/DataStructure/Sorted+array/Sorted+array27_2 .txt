What will be the complexity of quick sort if we insert an element at some random position in a sorted array and then ask it to sort again using quick sort?For example an array like this: 2, 4, 6, 55, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22Quick sort depends on accurately being able to guess the median of a number of values. If the median is guessed well, it is O(n log n). In the worst case, if guessed poorly, it is O(n^2). Some methods of guessing the median work especially poorly with partially sorted arrays. A good method is to take the mean of the first, last, and middle value. Given that, the odd number out is unlikely to make this worse, and so you'll probably see O(n log n). Note of course that there are better algorithms for partially ordered data. An intelligently implemented bubble/ripple or insertion sort will take O(n).
