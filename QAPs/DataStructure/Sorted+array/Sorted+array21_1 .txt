Given a sorted array of numbers. Construct a balanced binary tree with the numbers in the Array as keys?If you are given a sorted array of data how do build a balanced BST. Making middle element as root and making middle element of first part as root of left subtree and making middle element of second part as root of right subtree and recursively continuing this will allow us to build a balanced BST.
