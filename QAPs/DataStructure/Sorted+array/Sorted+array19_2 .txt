How would you square each element in a sorted array of ascending integers while still maintaining the order?Given n is any element in the sorted array: 32_BIT_INT_MIN <= n <= n + 1 <= 32_BIT_INT_MAX Additionally, what is the fastest possible time complexity of this algorithm and how could that be implemented?Iterate in descending order. EDIT: That's not even necessary... just iterate in whichever order, but prevent resorting until after you're finished.
