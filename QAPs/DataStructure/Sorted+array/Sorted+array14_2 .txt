What does it mean to find the median of two sorted arrays?Can you give me some examples? Is the median, the element in the middle(if we combine these two sorted arrays into one sorted)?I will lay out the general idea of the solution: 1. Let's assume that median of the first array is larger than the median of the second array, and both arrays are of same size N (if either of these assumptions does not hold it is easy to make it do, think how). 2. Now you know that the real median can NOT appear in A1[N/2+1...N] as at least N values are smaller than any of the numbers in this subarray (think why this holds). A symmetric argument applies for A2[1..N/2]. 3. So you are left with a search space of size N, in subarrays A1[1..N/2] and A2[N/2+1...N]. It holds that the median these arrays concatenated is the median of A1+A2 (think why). 4. You guess right, recursion of steps 1-3. 5. Once you are left with two single-element arrays, the result depends on the definition of the median you use: it either is the smaller element, or their average. Running time is O(lgN) with O(1) extra space needed (if implemented effectively).
