Given a sorted array and a number and element K, find Ks nearest elements to the number in the sorted array?Find the index of the closest number in the array to given number using binary search. Keep two pointers, one to the left of the element and one to right. Calculate the difference with given element and select the one with minimum value and advance the pointer from which you selected element. (advance direction: left for left pointer and right for right element) Repeat until you get K-1 elements. First step gives you one element. There would be some edge cases you have to take care of. Time Complexity: O(logn) + O(K)
