Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
Shafi Goldwasser Shafi Goldwasser is perhaps best known as the co-inventor of Zero-knowledge proofs.  The basic idea is that one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true without disclosing any other knowledge.  An example is if Alice knows about a Hamiltonian path in a large graph G, and wants to prove to Bob that G contains a Hamiltonian path without disclosing what the Hamiltonian path is. (more details) Zero-knowledge proofs have implications about how one might design protocols that conserve privacy as much as possible.  Indeed, much of Shafi Goldwasser's best known work are in the theoretical foundations underpinning cryptography and cryptographic protocols.   For her contributions, she was awarded a 2012 ACM Turing Award, which is the highest award in Computer Science.
