How does one become good at problem solving?
I think a big part of it is being able to break a problem down but also developing a habit of seeing something as a collection of parts (and relationships between those parts) rather than just as a whole.  It takes a bit of practice but can be developed. Playing simple games can help develop the habits.  Take a look at the games listed here:  Problem Solving Skills  The game Set is good for seeing patterns and the game Mastermind is good for developing deduction.
