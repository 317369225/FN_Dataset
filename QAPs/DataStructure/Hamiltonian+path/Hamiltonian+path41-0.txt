How does one become good at problem solving?
Many people believe in things such as "brain training" to become a better problem solver. They often make extensive use of little mind games such as sudoku, crosswords, riddle and escape games and chess challenges that they believe will make them smarter. That is not true. Working at those small problems will definitely make you "smarter" and more able to solve more of such problems, and even harder ones. But the NYT Crosswords won't help you solve that tough integral you saw. We usually see smart people solve puzzles for fun, and tend to believe that they are smart because they are so fond of such games, when the truth is the exact opposite: they like it 'cause they're smart. Research (http://www.iapsych.com/articles/..., http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inte..., http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICISE....) has shown that fluid intelligence, the one that helps you deal with completely new problems and situations, can be increased with dual N-back training (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua...). Brain Workshop is one of the many free softwares that provide such training. Dual N-back is the only training I know to be supported by scientific research, rather than "hmm, this looks tough, it's got to make you smarter somehow". Updated 23 Nov 2012 â€¢ View Upvotes
