How many arrangements of the numbers 1 through 16 are possible on a 4x4 grid such that a snake pattern can take you from the number 1 to the number 16?A "snake" pattern means you can go in any direction, including diagonally, not visiting previously visited squares.  Ignore symmetry -- solutions that can be obtained by symmetry from other solutions are distinct.  I'd love to find a combinatorial solution if possible, but brute force is okay.
You’re looking for the number of Hamiltonian paths on the 4×4 king graph, which is 343184 (see OEIS A158651). This is computed by brute force, more or less; I don’t believe a combinatorial solution is known. Updated 1 Aug 2013 • View Upvotes
