What is the meaning of this sentence?Prove that G has a Hamiltonian Path only if for every S(subset of  V ), the number of components of G − S is at most |S| + 1
"Prove that every graph that contains a Hamiltonian path has this property: the deletion of any vertices from the graph results in a graph that has at most X+1 connected components, where X is the number of vertices deleted." or Prove that H(G)⟹∀S⊆V(G),γ(G∖S)=∣S∣+1  where H(G)  returns true iff the graph G  contains a Hamiltonian path. γ(G)  returns the number of connected components in the graph G  . The proof is fairly simple. Assume a Hamiltonian path exists, and use induction over the size of S  to prove the property holds.
