What are P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard?
Originally Answered: Explain in simple terms, what does it mean that a problem is P or NP?Many people have already clarified the difference in other related questions. But, in case those haven't helped you, here's an explanation in laymen terms: A problem is said to be in class P if there is a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem. Additionally, you can also verify* a solution in polynomial-time for all problems in class P. A problem is said to be in class NP if you can verify* a solution in polynomial-time but you don't know yet if you can solve it with a polynomial time algorithm. *By verify I mean - if an Oracle presents a solution to a problem, you can verify if the solution is correct or not in polynomial-time.
