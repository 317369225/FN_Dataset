I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
First and foremost You started at the short end of the chain. You learn basic algorithms before you learn programming. See, programming is just writing in a language, you need the thought first. That's where algorithm comes in. Now, on to your question It's impossible Mainly because, what do you mean you want to learn algorithms. There are countably infinite algorithms in the world. I have been studying algorithms for 8 years and I have to think every time I come across a new problem about it's algorithm. What do you want to learn and how much do you already know. Do you know basic sorting in O(n log(n)) time Do you know iteration and recursion Do you know Dynamic Programming Do you know Scheduling If you don't I recommend reading Donald Knuth (all volumes). But that takes way more time than you have. Another option, possible quicker Start reading geeksforgeeks, which can cover all your basic algorithms. The algorithm descriptions are neat and well put, but they do not show the intuition behind the algorithm, which I think is a big letdown for learning algorithms. All in all, depends on what subset of algorithms you want to learn. Nonetheless, start learning, 10 days of learning will be better than none.
