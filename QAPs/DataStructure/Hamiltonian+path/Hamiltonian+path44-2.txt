An MD at a top-tier investment bank where I work told me to read about something (doesn't have to be finance-related but has to be something he doesn't already know), learn it, and teach it to him in my remaining 6 weeks. What should I learn?
I speak as an ex-banker who reads a lot of non-fiction. I would go with Nassim Taleb's 'Anti-Fragile'. Taleb, you may know, popularised the term 'Black Swan' (extreme event).Â  It's a good book and recently enough published. Taleb is a little pompous but brilliant and articulate nevertheless. If you want, get the audiobook version, which you can listen to when you work-out or whenever. Of course, a big factor is whether the book interests you enough. The more it does the easier the task.
