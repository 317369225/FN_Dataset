I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
Coursera.com There's a bunch of classes on algorithms from Princeton, Stanford, etc.Â  If you spend all your time watching and understanding the lectures you can probably get through one (or 2) in 10 days. That won't get you the same level of knowledge as you'll get from doing all the assignments, programing, having experience,etc. But if you have some experience in programming, I think 10 days of intense study can be enough to begin to apply your knowledge of algorithms to everyday programming (despite what some others have suggested).
