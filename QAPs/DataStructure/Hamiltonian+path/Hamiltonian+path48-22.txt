I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
Contrary, to what other people say, I believe it is possible to learn algorithms in some sense of this word in 10 days. You could for example pick 10 most popular algorithms memorize their implementation and maybe sort of understand what general problem are they solving. The thing is that it is not very useful. There two things knowledge of algorithms and algorithmic thinking. The former is yet another piece of knowledge. The latter is something that will make you a great computer scientist, allow you to get a great job or maybe even come up with your own algorithm which other people will try to memorize in ten days ( :-) ). I also firmly believe, that algorithmic thinking scales well beyond compiter science. I for example use it very much in everyday life for small things (automating boring daily routine) and some things a little bigger (planning what to do in next year in order to achieve eve happiness in some sense). Now algorithmic thinking is something that I started to have initial grasp on after 3 years of doing almost exclusively that in my Polish highschool, going to computer science camps participating in many competitions and listening to more experienced people. Summing up, understand what you can achieve in 10 days, but also think a bit whether you are trying to achieve the right thing in the first place.
