An MD at a top-tier investment bank where I work told me to read about something (doesn't have to be finance-related but has to be something he doesn't already know), learn it, and teach it to him in my remaining 6 weeks. What should I learn?
I think the main reason he ask you is because he wishes to minimize the risk of wasting time. If you think about it, there are countless of books and people with limited time tend to feel wary before deciding to read a particular book. The fact is we can rarely know if a book is really interesting or helpful for us until we read a major part of it, despite the reviews or summary. And the risk of wasting time is very high, especially if the time of your MD can be converted to dollar value.   So I suggest why don’t you give him a list of books with summary (good ones by all means, or you'll be torturing yourself), and ask him which one he thinks has potential to be interesting. He should be able to point out a few, and you can proceed to read and brief him after 6 weeks.
