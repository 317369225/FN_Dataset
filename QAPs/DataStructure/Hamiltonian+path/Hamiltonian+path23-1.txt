How can I solve this using dynamic programming?Let's say you have a connected graph, and you start at node 1.   The task is to find a walk ( so you can use edges or vertices more than once if you want to) that visits every node at least once.   The only solution I think of is having a bitmask in the DP state but this would go up to 2^N, does there exists a better way?
EDIT: refer to Bohdan's answer. The op hasn't defined whether he's talking about directed or undirected graphs, but in any case there seems not to exist a polynomial algorithm to find the smallest walk. Updated 23 Aug • View Upvotes
