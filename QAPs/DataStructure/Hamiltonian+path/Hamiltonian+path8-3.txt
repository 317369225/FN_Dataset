Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
My vote goes to Mildred Dresselhaus, a physicist at MIT who worked on graphene, other low-dimensional forms of carbon, and graphite-intercalated compounds 50 years before the field took off in the early 2000s, hence her moniker "queen of carbon science".  She is a recipient of many of the top prizes in physics and science including the von Hippel award, the Kavli prize, the Enrico Fermi award, the Buckley Prize, the Oersted Medal, the National Medal of Science, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  On top of that, she is a mother of 4. Now in her 80s, Professor Dresselhaus is still extremely active in research.  She continues to run a research group, write papers, and travel to give talks.
