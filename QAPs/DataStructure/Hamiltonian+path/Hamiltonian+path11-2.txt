How many arrangements of the numbers 1 through 16 are possible on a 4x4 grid such that a snake pattern can take you from the number 1 to the number 16?A "snake" pattern means you can go in any direction, including diagonally, not visiting previously visited squares.  Ignore symmetry -- solutions that can be obtained by symmetry from other solutions are distinct.  I'd love to find a combinatorial solution if possible, but brute force is okay.
