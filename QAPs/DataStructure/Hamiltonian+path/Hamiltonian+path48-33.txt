I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
The maximum time you could be productive in a day is 10 hours. Considering this, you effective have 100 hours (not 240) to practice algorithms. Now, since you used the word practice, I'm assuming that you already have a basic know-how about algorithms. And the 10 day time line, I am assuming is for a test or an interview. Now, for what algorithms to practice, here is a list of the popular ones: Amit Rai's answer to What are the algorithms required to solve all problems (using C++) in any competitive coding contest? The list has around 150 algorithms listed. Select 100 from them. Spend exactly 1 hour on each algorithm. That way, you will have atleast some know-how about 100 algorithms by the end of 100 hours. Now, if you can stretch for 2 hrs each day, you will complete the 100 hours on the 9th day. Which will give you around 20 hours to revise or study further. Good luck and let us know how it goes.
