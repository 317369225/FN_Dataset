I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
You shouldn't. Firstly, I'd argue that not having a basic understanding of algorithms means you don't actually have basic knowledge of programming. Secondly, it's a vast field, and the only thing I'd see as being more helpful than googling for the algorithms you need on a case-by-case basis is understanding how algorithms are designed, I.e. the mathematics behind it all. Which I'm hard pressesd to think actually possible in ten months, much less days. I'm neither a mathematician nor much of a programmer, myself - I did dabble in formal CS education for a few semesters, though, so I'm not completely fantasising,  here...
