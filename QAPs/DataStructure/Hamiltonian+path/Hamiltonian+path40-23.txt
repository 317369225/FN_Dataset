What are P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard?
Let me put this in simpler way with little details: NP: This is a class of problems for which you can verify a solution in polynomial time but you don't know if you can solve it in PTime. P: This is a class of problems which you can verify in PTime and also solve in PTime. :) Now you can think why all P problems are in NP. NP Hard: These are the problems which can neither be verified let alone solving them in PTime. :( NP Complete: These are the combination of NP and NP Hard problems which means that they can be verified in PTime (NP)Â  and they can be solved but not in PTime (NP Hard ). Thus all problems in this type are inter convertible and if you can solve any one problem in PTime you can solve all of them in PTime. Please correct me if you think I am wrong.
