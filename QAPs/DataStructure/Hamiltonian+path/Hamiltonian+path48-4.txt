I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
I can imagine how going through algorithm books can be boring. I can share what I did to tackle this situation. I should warn you though, I'm no expert, but this is what keeps me going. Find some friends who share similar interests. Make it a group activity. It's more fun that way. You learn a lot from friends. Start participating in programming contests. This will become a driving force for you to learn more. Some of the websites which conducts these contests are TopCoder, Codeforces, Codechef. And personally, I believe implementing algorithms gives us a better understanding of how it works. Don't ever get scared of the competition. Believe in yourself and keep learning. Each of these websites have a great programming community. They are very helpful. You can post doubts and help others too. For some tutorial you can visit following sites : Page on udacity.com Learn Algorithms Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 For queries : Stack Overflow Page on quora.com Hope this helps!
