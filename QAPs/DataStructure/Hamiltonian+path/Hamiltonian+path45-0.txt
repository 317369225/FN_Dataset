Does biological computing have potential?http://www.extremetech.com/extre...
Yes both in monitoring and control of biological systems, such as disease diagnostic, drug screening, experimental models, conditional transgene, inducible expression vector, environmental monitoring, control of cell differentiation and reprogramming, tissue engineering, metabolic engineering, control of the immune system and cancer diagnostic and treatment. Moreover, there are also reports for a potential to solve certain computer science problems (eg Hamiltonian path problem) Have a look to this great review: Biomolecular computing systems: principles, progress and potential by Yaakov Benenson http://www.nature.com/nrg/journa...
