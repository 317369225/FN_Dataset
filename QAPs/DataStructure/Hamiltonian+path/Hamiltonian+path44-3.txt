An MD at a top-tier investment bank where I work told me to read about something (doesn't have to be finance-related but has to be something he doesn't already know), learn it, and teach it to him in my remaining 6 weeks. What should I learn?
He's looking for a demonstration of your aptitude and motivation to learn.  I've read a few times that you really know something if you can teach it to someone else.  He probably read the same thing and is using it to evaluate you. He's looking for the capacity for deep knowledge, expertise, mastery in one topic and the ability to communicate it with confidence and authority; which is necessary to climbing the banking ladder.  Teach him something you can actually master and contain so you can limit the scope of the teaching session - like how to whistle loudly with fingers in the mouth or how to Bittorrent.
