I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
Take your time, if you box yourself in a time-frame, you are going to be frustrated. If you are rushing to beat say an algo interview, etc - it might be good to be honest and tell them you are not the right person now but if they gave you a little more time, you will be ready.
