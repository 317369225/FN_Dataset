I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
I recentry faced the same question. As a mathematician who was about to do algorithm heavy technical interviews - I needed to cram / refresh myself quickly. I found that Sedgewick's Algorithms in C is of manageable size (10 days is doable at a quick pace) and covers the fundamentals (sorting, graph, hash tables, etc). Also... its in C and who doesn't love C? If you wanted there is a version in Java too... From there you can specialize to whatever corner of the theory of algorithms interests you.
