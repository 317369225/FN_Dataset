Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
It's not clear whether the question refers to living scientists or scientists in history? It is always hard to identify who are the 'best' in science. For living scientists, suggest looking at memberships of national academies of science (e.g. Royal Society in the UK, National Academy of Sciences in the US etc), and winners of the L'Oreal-UNESCO awards to women scientists. In the UK, the UKRC centre for women in science also has some lists of current notable women scientists.
