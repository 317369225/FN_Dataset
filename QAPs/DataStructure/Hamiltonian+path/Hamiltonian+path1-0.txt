What is a Hamiltonian path or trail?
In graph theory, a Hamiltonian trail aka Hamiltonian path, is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits every vertex exactly once. Dirac's theorem provides a sufficient (not necessary) condition to check if a simple graph is Hamiltonian. If in a simple graph with n≥3  vertices, every vertex has a degree greater than n/2  , then the graph has a Hamiltonian path. It should be noted that the converse isn't true. A more stronger theorem says that a graph is Hamiltonian if and only if its closure is Hamiltonian. A closure of a graph is obtained by repeatedly connecting non-adjacent vertices by an edge if sum of their degrees is greater than or equal to the number of vertices.
