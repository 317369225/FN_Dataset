I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
Start by understanding this is like wanting to learn "English" or "science" or "cars."  If you know what parts are important to you and what you're planning to do with that new knowledge, you can start to build a plan.  Without it, though, you're not going to get very far.
