How does one become good at problem solving?
I have been trying to become a better problem solver myself, so I cannot claim to be on the other side of the river, but what seems to be of invaluable help is practice. A solution to any complicated puzzle has small components that you can use as independent tools at other places. So, the more you have wet your feet, the more hold you can exercise on further problems. I think a majority of the work should be done after you have successfully solved a problem to think through individual pieces that you put together to reach to the answer. It is of deeper value than it first sounds to be. While working through a problem, the mind develops connections between separately laid foundations on the fly, which need to be broken down later to understand singularly useful tools that you just created. I guess it is hard to cite out specific example without working together on the same problems, but I will try. If you want to search for all Hamiltonian paths in a graph, you are probably going to be solving connectivity of subgraphs along the way. So, you just solved a smaller problem, which you can add in your toolbox.
