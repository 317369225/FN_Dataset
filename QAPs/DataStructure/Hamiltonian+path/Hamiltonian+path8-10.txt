Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
I would also add Maria Goeppert-Mayer to this list (not least because she served on the faculty here at UCSD and the Physics department building is named after her). She received the Nobel Prize in Physics as one of the pioneers of the Nuclear shell model, used to calculate the energy levels in nuclei. And she did much of this work whilst still struggling to get faculty positions at Universities due to strict rules against nepotism (her husband was the famous chemist Joseph Edward Mayer, who discovered the Mayer expansion in statistical field theory). Also, she wrote her doctoral thesis on two-photon absorption by atoms way back in 1931, and it took until the 1960s for this to be verified experimentally.
