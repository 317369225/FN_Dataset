I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
A lot of people say it can't be done.  Conceptually, at least, a lot of algorithms can be explained in just a few sentences.  Not only that, but a competent programmer can implement them in as little as half-an-hour.  I would suggest learning the basic concepts of the most popular and important algorithms.  I'm assuming you are already good at one or more programming languages.  Now in the language of your choice, implement them.  Here's one for starters:  tree-sort. A binary tree is a data structure consisting of a set of nodes in a tree-like structure.  Each node has two children (we'll call them left and right) which themselves are nodes as well as a data element which can be ordered.  The data element in the left child is always less than that of the parent, while the data element in the right child is greater. To use the tree for sorting, build a tree transferring the data elements in the list to the tree.  Now pull them off the tree to form a sorted list.  My description of the tree should give you enough information about how to do these two operations (hint: the second operation is recursive.) Class dismissed!
