Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
Today's XKCD deals with women in science: [alt text: "Although not permanently."] Marie Curie, of course, is famous for her theory of radioactivity (a term she coined). She received two Nobel prizes, in chemistry and physics. This made her the first woman to receive a Nobel prize, the only woman to receive two, and the only person in history to receive a prize in different fields. She also discovered radium and polonium. Lise Meitner was part of the team that discovered nuclear fission. She was the first woman permitted to study under Max Planck, and soon after became his assistant. Einstein praised her as the 'German Marie Curie', which was less ironic back then than now, after the release of this comic strip. Being Jewish, it was only by virtue of her Austrian citizenship that enabled her to keep her job when Hitler rose to power. Later she fled Germany to Sweden after the Nazis annexed and occupied Austria, where she struck up a working relationship with Neils Bohr. Her work with fission, and her recognition of the potential for a chain reaction to release an enormous explosion, inspired Einstein to send his famous letter of caution to Roosevelt, which led to the creation of the Manhattan Project. When offered a job on the project, Meitner refused, unwilling to have anything to do with a bomb. Emmy Noether contributed greatly to the field of mathematics, but since I don't understand most of the higher maths I won't accidentally diminish her achievements by bastardizing Wikipedia. Go read it yourselves! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emm... Many, many more women are recognized here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wom... although a common tragedy of them all is that they were often not recognized until after their death.
