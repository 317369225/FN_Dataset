How does one become good at problem solving?
Problem solving is something we continuously have to deal with our whole lives. One of the best ways to really become good at problem solving is to really think about the problem at hand. Think about all of the assumptions you have of how something should be solved and set them aside. Map out your problem either on a piece of paper using sketches or even use props around you. Once you think of a solution that may work, follow through and repeat if you fail. Try again until you've exhausted your limits. Once you google and find the answer, examine your failures and fallacies in thought. You will struggle, but it's the struggle that makes us better thinkers.
