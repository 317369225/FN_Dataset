How does one become good at problem solving?
If you are struggling with problem solving can you pinpoint at what point in the process you begin to fail? Are you interpreting the question properly, reading it properly, is your challenge in organizing your information, presenting it, is your problem with concentration, followthrough? If you can pinpoint where you are struggling you may be able to develop strategies.Â  We all have different strengths that apply differently to different situations. I have worked with many students with learning differences who very very bright but had trouble processing certain pieces of information. Once these were pinpointed strategies could be developed. Different personality types approach problems differently, different types of learners approach problems differently, different types of intelligences approach problems differently. Try to determine where you are getting stuck and then look for ways to develop different strategies.
