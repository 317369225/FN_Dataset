I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
As others have said, 10 days is of course not enough. However, you can still do a decent job in 10 days: - Start with Cracking the Coding Interview. It has brief descriptions and problems on various data structures and basic algorithms. Study them, solve the problems and implement some of them. Given the time, you can't study it extensively but you can still go over most of it fairly quickly. I would say this can be done in 4 days. (Did this myself!) - Get Algorithm Design. The authors have divided most important algorithms concepts into 6 units - graph theory, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, network flows and computational complexity. Spending one day on each chapter, including skimming through the ideas and practicing a fair number of problems should be doable. And you're all set... You can obviously do much better if you had more time, but in 10 days, this is a quite good coverage of a topic as vast as algorithms.
