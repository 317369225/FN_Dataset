For a directed graph, what is the upper bound on the number of simple paths that include all vertices?Given N vertices and M edges, where N << M. I am thinking it is O((MN−1))  , but I am not entirely sure. The paths should include all vertices in the graph. It does not have to be a tight upper bound. Thanks!
First, a simple path that includes all vertices is called a Hamiltonian path. Determining an exact upper bound is probably going to be impossible without iterating over the graph and counting each Hamiltonian path. A loose upper bound would be the maximum number of Hamiltonian paths possible in a graph.  If you have N  vertices, then you can think of each possible Hamiltonian path as a permutation of N  vertices, so the upper bound would be O(N!)  . I'm sure there is probably a tighter bound, though.
