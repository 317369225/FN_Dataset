What will be the 'big application' for DNA nanotechnology?DNA nanotechnology has been around for some time now and has achieved a lot - origami, autonomous motors etc - but has had little impact on real world technology. Where will its 'big application' be?
All of those little gimmicks are all steps that allow engineers to create self-assembling molecular computers. As you can solve simpler puzzles like the Hamiltonian path problem or if then statements, then you can you can eventually design systems that can answer bigger puzzles. If you can solve bigger puzzles, than you can make these little computers build nanostructures for biomaterials or for making better electronics. In summary DNA nanotechnology is one strategy that allows for molecular computing enabling us to control devices at the nanoscale.
