How does one become good at problem solving?
Problem solving means analyzing the problem and breaking it into sub-problems, solving them individually and combine them. How to search a needle on the floor with tiles? A naive approach is to look in a random order. A better approach is to check tile by tile. Initially all tiles are unmarked. for each unmarked tile on floor         look for needle in tile A         if needle is found                Done (or continue to search for more needles)         mark tile A Mark a searched tile so that same tile is not looked up again. The second approach is what a problem solver should think, a well planned approach to perform a task. Problem solving is all about practice. Try to extend the solution of an existing problem to solve a new problem.
