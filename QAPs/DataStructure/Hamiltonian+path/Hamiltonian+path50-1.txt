What are some interesting results in graph theory?
Let G(V,E)  be a graph representing friendships. V  is the set of people and E  is the set of edges which represents friendships. So, the tuple (u,v)  belongs to E  iff u  and v  are friends. Please note that friendships are undirected. Now, the interesting fact is, for any person A  having at least two friends, there will be at least two friends B,C  both of whom have the SAME NUMBER OF MUTUAL FRIENDS with A. i.e. there exists friends B,C  of A  such that if A  and B  have k  mutual friends then A  and C  also have k  mutual friends. The proof is very interesting. Let A  have n  friends. Then, the number of mutual friends between A  and friend F  is from the set 0,1,....,n−1  . However, an interesting observation is that if any friend has n−1  mutual friends, then no friend can have 0  mutual friends with A  and vice-versa. So, number of mutual friends can actually be from the set 1,2,...,n−1  or 0,1,2,...,n−2  . But since we have n  friends, and the number of possible distinct values of mutual friends is n−1  , by pigeonhole principal, at least two friends of A  will have to have the same number mutual friends with A  .
