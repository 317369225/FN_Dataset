How can one determine every possible route which covers all vertices between two given points in an undirected graph?Details can be found at http://www.quora.com/challenges.
This sounds like a problem of enumerating all Hamiltonian paths between two points. I had to do something very similar recently and easiest approach I found was to encode it into SAT and use a SAT solver. Here's an explanation of constraints to use and link to implementation.

To change the problem to "paths", you need to constraint one vertex to be the last vertex, and remove the "must have outgoing edge" constraint for the last vertex
