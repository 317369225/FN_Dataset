An MD at a top-tier investment bank where I work told me to read about something (doesn't have to be finance-related but has to be something he doesn't already know), learn it, and teach it to him in my remaining 6 weeks. What should I learn?
Topics you should not pick: As it is required that you teach him something he doesn't already know, you should find out what he already knows first. Find out what he majored in and where else he's worked and if possible what his hobbies are, and don't pick topics related to those areas. Corollary: don't pick a financial topic. Pick a topic you're already very interested in, ideally one of your hobbies. Don't try to become interested in something brand new for the sake of this project - your lack of familiarity and passion will show. Don't make a presentation that consists of stuff that can be blandly looked up on Wikipedia. Here are some examples that also have potential to show off some quantitative flair (which is the kind of thing that finance likes): Do you like music or play an instrument? Do a presentation on it - say, the history of the guitar, how it works, how an electric guitar and an amplifier work, how the guitar has been used by different genres of music over time. Do you like a certain sport (ideally a niche sport to avoid familiarity)? Do a report on the latest trends, tactics, and statistical analyses being done in that sport, both by competitors and by businesses (for example it would be cool not only to learn about tennis players, but about the business of running tournaments, stores, etc.) Do you like engineering? Explain how a calculator works, with maybe a few advanced functions like sines or logarithms. How does such a little device "know" what a sine is anyway? Do you like movies? Explain how the moviemaking process at Pixar works. Hey, maybe even try emailing or messaging (via Twitter or even Quora!) some people there. For the quantitative side you can learn a bit about OpenSubdiv and explain that.
