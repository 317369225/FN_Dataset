What surprised you the most in your field of study?
I took up Computer Science as my major after school, and have been quite amazed by it in the past 3.5 years. Here are a few things I found surprising: 1) All the things that a computer can do, from simple arithmetic calculations to satellite controlling, everything can be modelled as a Turing Machine, which is as simple as a record player with instructions like "if current symbol under the head is symbol S1, then overwrite it with S2 and move left/right on the tape" 2) How things that seem easy on small sized data can be very difficult on large scale. Imagine packing for holidays with a fix capacity bag and a lot of things to take. What do you do when you can't fit everything in? Keep only the most useful stuff. This problem is like the classic Knapsack problem, if you can attach a measure of usefulness to the objects. The problem is NP-hard, which means that as the number of items to pack increase linearly, the optimal solution increase exponentially.
