What is the name of the following problem: given a graph, find a path between 2 nodes that pass through each node once and only once?This is a variant of the Hamilton graph problem, but where you do not have to return to the original node.  What is this problem called?
It's the "Hamiltonian path" problem. A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex of a graph exactly once; a Hamiltonian cycle returns to the starting vertex.  Both problems are NP-complete.  I don't know about the problem if the start and ending vertices are given, but I imagine (not being a graph-theorist) that it's a special case of the path problem.
