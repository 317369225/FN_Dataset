What are P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard?
In Simple Words... P Class--- It is a set of decision problems that are solvable in polynomial time... NP-Class--- It is a set of decision problems that are not solvable but are verifiable in polynomial time NP Complete--- It is one of the decision problem that belong to NP Class and all the problems in NP Class can be reduced to this problem.. Implies that if this problem is solvable in polynomial time then all other NP Problems can be solved in Polynomial time.. NP Hard--- NP Hard Contains those problems which may or may not belong to NP-Class but are all reducible to NP Class problem.. It Simply means that there are some problems like set of optimization problem that are harder to solve then NP class.. All those problems which are not decision problems and are not solvable in Polynomial Time Belong the This Set... Implies that if this kind of a problem is solvable in polynomial time then all other NP class problems will be solved in Polynomial Time...
