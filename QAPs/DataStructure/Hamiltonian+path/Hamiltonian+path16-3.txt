What are some examples of problems which are: (1) NP but not NP-Complete; (2) NP-Complete; (3) NP-Hard but not NP-Complete?
To add to the other answers, integer factorization (finding all the prime factors of a number) is an interesting example of a problem that is NP but not known to be NP-complete. It is clearly in NP, since you can check in polynomial time whether a given factorization is correct. It is not known to be in P, since no deterministic-polynomial-time algorithms have been found. (Technically, no such algorithms have been found for the decision version of the problem:Â  given N and M<N, does N have a prime factor < M). Finally, there is some weak evidence that suggests that (if P!=NP) factoring is not as hard as NP-complete problems. See Integer factorization
