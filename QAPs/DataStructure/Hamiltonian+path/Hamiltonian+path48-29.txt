I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
I took an algorithms course at college. It was quite rigorous, and I learned a lot. Two lectures a week. 10 weeks. That is 30 hours. One homework a week. I would spend ~10-15 hours on that. Let us say 12, that is 120 hours. That is only 150 hours, you got 90 hours left over. :) Now, I should say the course involved no programming. It would have taken much longer if it did. Decide whether you want to learn to code algorithms well, or understand the design principles and analyze them well mathematically. Then go to coursera and start doing either https://www.coursera.org/course/... or https://www.coursera.org/course/... I think you can do them in 240 hours. Not in ten days, but 240 hours, sure.
