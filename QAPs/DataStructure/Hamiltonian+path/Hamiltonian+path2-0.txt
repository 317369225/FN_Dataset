How do I find the Hamiltonian path by using the TSP method?(How should I modify the given graph to use exact tsp method to find hamiltonian pathe
A good approach is to look at how you would find a Hamiltonian circuit using TSP methods, and then convert that circuit into a path. Finding a Hamiltonian circuit is similar to solving TSP except that Hamiltonian circuits do not care about edge weight. Thus, if we want to find a Hamiltonian circuit of a graph using a TSP method, we should simply change all edge weights to be the same value. This way our TSP method will see no difference in taking one edge as opposed to taking another, as is the case for Hamiltonian circuits. Once we have found our Hamiltonian circuit, we can remove the edge which completes the cycle back to the start node, leaving us with a Hamiltonian path.
