What is the probability that an n-tournament is strongly connected?Where a tournament is defined as "a directed graph (digraph) obtained by assigning a direction for each edge in an undirected complete graph" (Source: Wikipedia, Tournament (graph theory)) This is equivalent to asking whether an n-tournament contains a Hamilton cycle.
For large n, P(n)≈1−n2 n−2    . The probability tends to one as n is made very large. The number of strongly connected tournament graphs (also called irreducible tournament graphs) on n vertices is given by A054946 - OEIS. For large n, the ratio of this to 2 n(n−1)/2   (the total number of tournament graphs on n vertices) tends to 1. The derivation of the asymptotic probability stated above is given in the paper Almost all tournaments are irreducible.
