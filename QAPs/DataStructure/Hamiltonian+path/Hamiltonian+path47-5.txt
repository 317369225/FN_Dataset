What are some interesting algorithms that have no known implementation to date?
Brodal queue is considered virtually impossible to implement even though until recently, it had the best set of worst case bounds for a heap data structure. Recently strict fibonacci heaps were discoverd, which are semingly implementable and have the same worst case bounds.
