I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
First of all your goal is very broad, and you should be much more specific to be able to measure your progress and know that you accomplished your goal or not. 10 days seems like a short period to learn all major algorithms even if you have a very high capability of memorizing things (very high IQ etc.), and some foundations. I would say it isÂ  impossible for most people, because of the limitations of our brain, and the mechanisms of learning. In addition, based on your time estimation of 240hrs, i see that you are excluding sleep/naps/breaks, which are vital factors for efficient learning, because during sleep we strengthen the neural connections that were built during the day. Without going deeper into neuroscience, just have in mind that learning is a marathon, and not a sprint.
