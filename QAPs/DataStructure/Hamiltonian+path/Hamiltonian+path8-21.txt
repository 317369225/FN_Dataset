Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
I wouldn't presume to judge who are the most accomplished female scientists among quite a few that I've been privileged to run across, and there have been several good answers already.  One person who springs to mind, though, is Jill Banfield, for a particular reason.  Jill Banfield is a professor of Earth & Planetary Science at UC Berkeley, and as far as I know her original field of study up through tenured professorship was all abiotic, i.e., geology, geophysics, geochemistry.   Several years ago she became interested in geomicrobiology, i.e., the study of microbes in the environment, and her work in metagenomics has been groundbreaking, changing our fundamental understanding of how bacterial genomes work, e.g., with the mosaic genome.  Metagenomics itself was in the process of being invented at this time, so her lab had to invent the techniques to produce these results.  She continues to make fundamental advances in understanding the human microbiome, which, of course, is not geological at all.  Meanwhile all along she continues her work in geochemistry (she has a large lab).  Making seminal contributions in work that is a bit of a side interest, and quite different from her original field, at such a point in her career, is really quite extraordinary.
