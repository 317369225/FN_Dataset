Why is the traveling salesman problem NP complete?
You must state which version of TSP you are talking about: the decision problem (to check, whether a given hamiltonian cycle in a given fully connected graph has a total pathlength of k (given) or less) the optimization problem (find the shortest length hamiltonian cycle) The decision problem is NP-complete because you can both have a polynomial time verifier for the solution, as well as the fact that the hamiltonian cycle problem is reducible to TSP_DECIDE in polynomial time. However, the optimization problem is strictly NP-hard, because even though TSP_OPTIMIZE is reducible from the hamiltonian (HAM) cycle problem in polynomial time, you don't have a poly time verifier for a claimed hamiltonian cycle C, whether it is the shortest or not, because you simply have to enumerate all possibilities (which consumes the factorial order space & time). Other answers in this forum have correctly shown the reduction process of TSP (either variant) from HAM.Â  My answer will be completely different as soon as someone successfully proves P=NP or otherwise.
