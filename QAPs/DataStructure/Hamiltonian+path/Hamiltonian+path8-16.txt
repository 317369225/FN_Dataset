Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
Hedy Lamarr, a beautiful actress / inventor who codeveloped frequency hopping for radios as a method of keeping guided munitions on target, since at the time they could be easily jammed and sent off course. Her invention along with George Antheil laid the foundation for bluetooth, wi-fi and cdma technologies, and she was recently inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame. Curiously, regarding frequency hopping, this is still used to this day by militaries who wish to avoid having their communications intercepted, in conjunction with other advanced cryptological methods. So hats off to you Madam Lamarr!
