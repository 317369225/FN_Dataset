Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
There is no field like animal behavior where female scientists have been the primary figures who have completely revolutionized the field, shattered assumptions, and who pretty much did almost all of the truly foundational work. In addition to Jane Goodall (and the other two members of Leakey's 3 Angels - who were Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas [1]), you also have Irene Pepperberg (the scientist who trained Alex the Parrot, and who conclusively proved that parrots have many cognitive capacities previously thought unique only to mammals), and both Lori Marino and Diana Reiss (both who have completely revolutionized our understanding of dolphin cognition). There's also Cynthia Moss, who did the same for elephants. Also, in terms of truly foundational work... Sara Seager has done truly foundational work in exoplanets, and who often made theories well before the theories were confirmed (see http://discovermagazine.com/2008... and http://seagerexoplanets.mit.edu/... for more information). Cynthia Kenyon has done truly foundational work in aging, as has Elizabeth Blackburn. It often seems that newer fields are friendlier to female scientists, as they carry less of the old cultural "baggage" that older more traditional fields contain.
