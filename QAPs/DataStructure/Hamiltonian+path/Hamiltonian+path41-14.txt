How does one become good at problem solving?
Richard Feynman said he became a great problem solver at school when he used to ask people for any riddles or puzzles they knew so they could try them. He got a reputation and people started asking him to solve their homework assignments, including people from the years above him. He used to take a half hour or so to solve the puzzles, but then next time someone asked him the same one he would pretend to figure it out on the spot in a few seconds. :-) Anyway he later became a renowned physicist.
