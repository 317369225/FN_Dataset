How does one become good at problem solving?
Here are nine key steps to improving your problem solving dramatically: 1) Practice (aka building stuff).  Make problem solving an ongoing habit.  (also make questioning an ongoing habit).  Kaizen improvement. 2) Have a nice Set of Problem Solving Tools (it helps to have a checklist, so that you can know if you've applied a given tool or not) 3) Reflective thinking via journaling 4) Define the problem & figure out what the root cause is (thats really two steps) 5) Learn Design Thinking and apply it. 6) Think about the problem from multi-perspectives (ie multiple academic disciplines).  Design thinking is actually another form of perspective taking. 7) Metaphoric/Analogous problem solving is quite helpful.  This was how the mouse was created. 8) Make getting better a real goal for you. 9) Talk to people who solve problems effectively how they do it.
