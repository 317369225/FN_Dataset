What is the probability that an n-tournament is strongly connected?Where a tournament is defined as "a directed graph (digraph) obtained by assigning a direction for each edge in an undirected complete graph" (Source: Wikipedia, Tournament (graph theory)) This is equivalent to asking whether an n-tournament contains a Hamilton cycle.
I arrived at essentially the same result using a different argument, which I find slightly more transparent. Here's a sketch, I'm happy to fill in the details if anyone's interested. - Every tournament contains a Hamiltonian path. This is easily proved by induction. - Given a tournament on 1...n, we can omit each vertex i in turn and build a Hamiltonian path through the other vertices. If we're lucky (probability 1/4), the vertex i has the correct arrows to and from the start and end of this path, and we have a cycle. - The n events I just described are not independent, but they almost are. Each of them depends on the orientation of just two edges, and so each of them depends on at most two others. Thus there's a large subset of independent events, and the likelihood that we fail all of them is small.
