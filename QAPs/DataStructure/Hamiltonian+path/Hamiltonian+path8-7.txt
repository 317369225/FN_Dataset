Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
My vote goes to my personal hero- Patricia Goldman-Rakic who probed the structure and function of the brain’s frontal lobes, once regarded as inaccessible to rigorous scientific analysis. She was the first to discover and describe the circuitry of frontal cortex. Patricia countered the prevailing view in neuroscience that memory was a unitary process, with a single locus in the brain by demonstrating an active memory system in the prefrontal cortex. She went on to describe the mechanism of working memory, also known as the blackboard of the mind. As a teenager, she took on many tasks and responsibilities, playing the piano for a local dance studio in the afternoons and moving on in the evenings to wait on tables at a local seafood restaurant. All this while studying piano, violin, and even mastering calligraphy. No doubt her multidisciplinary approaches led Nobel Prize winner Paul Greengard describe her- 'Pat was as the forefront of biochemical, electrophysiological, pharmacological, anatomical and behavioral techniques to elucidate much of what we know today about memory, behavior and the actions of anti-schizophrenic drugs'. She was a recipient of numerous prestigious awards like Fyssen, Leiber, Karl Lashely, and Alden spencer, member of NAS, AAAS, IMNAS, APS, NARSARD and received couple of honorary degrees. She founded the the reputed journal Cerebral Cortex.   Unfortunately she died at the zenith of her career in a car accident in 2003.
