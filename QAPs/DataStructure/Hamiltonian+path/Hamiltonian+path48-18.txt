I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
Learn about "recursion" for 5 days! Just recursion, nothing else. Go deep within the concept of it, how it works, how your favorite programming language handles recursion and things like that. Spend the remaining days on skimming through various algorithms from your favorite text book, you will find that almost all those algorithms (so called complex ones) are using recursion. PS: To start learning this wonderful concept, just type recursion in Google and notice that Google will recursively try to correct you by displaying "Did you mean: Recursion". Funny isn't it?
