I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
One of the authoritative texts on algorithms is "Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS. Here's an excerpt from one of the authors of the book, Professor Thomas Cormen. Since some pages clearly took less than 14 hours to finish, there are pages that took more than 14 hours! - Thomas Cormen's answer to Why did CLRS decide to coauthor the Introduction to Algorithms? How long did it take from the beginning to the end? Though it is not required for one to completely finish the book from end-to-end, when some work is estimated at 14 hours per page for a book with > 1000 pages, 10 days is too short a time frame.
