How does one become good at problem solving?
Take lots of time to become familiar with the problem. Be sure you understand what is being asked and what elements you have available to find a solution. In some cases this may include knowledge of the way the world works outside the stated problem. Don't even think about getting the right answer, but concentrate on discovering (or developing) a process that will result in an answer to the problem. Once you have that you'll know if your answer is right. Be on the lookout for tricky language in the problem. And remember that negative information can be just as informative as positive information.
