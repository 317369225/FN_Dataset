I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
The first thing you need to do is to remove the timeframe from the question. The timeframe is unnecessary,Â  limiting and provokes aggressive answers. Your question should simply be: "I want to learn how to use algorithms in programming. How should I get started?". You'd be amazed at how helpful, insightful and elaborate responses you'd get. You might actually learn something from the answers. I Instead you choose to box your question in a way that reeks of desperation (why do you only have ten days?), cheapens the subject and the competence of those you ask to answer and gives an impression of arrogance and incincerity. Why would anyone want to waste time answering a question like that?
