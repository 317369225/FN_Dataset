How does one become good at problem solving?
I think the best way of getting good at problem solving is by practicing with new kinds of problems all of the time. On my experience teaching Olympic Maths to children, I have seen how this helps. Solve problems that require different kinds of thinking, and your brain will get used at seeing things on a different light. Try to look for problems that challenge your creativity and make you think in new ways. Olympic maths -even the ones for children- would be a good place to start.
