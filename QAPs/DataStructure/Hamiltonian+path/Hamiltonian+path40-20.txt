What are P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard?
Originally Answered: What is NP, NP-hard and NP complete in layman's terms? P and NP You can check and solve a problem in P in polynomial time. You can check a problem in NP in polynomial time.Assuming P != NP, all problems in P are in NP but not all problems in NP are in P. NP-Hard and NP-Complete A problem that is NP-Hard is at least as hard as any other problem in NP. NP-Hard does not mean that a problem is in NP (a problem that is hard to check and solve). A problem that is NP-Complete is NP-Hard and in NP.Assuming P != NP, not all problems in NP are NP-Hard because P problems are easier than some NP problems so such problems are not at least as hard as any other problem in NP. If P = NP, then all problems in NP are in P which means that problems that can be checked in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. Proving A Problem is NP-CompleteTo show a problem is NP-Complete, you need to show that it is NP-Hard and in NP. To show that a problem is in NP, prove that you can check if a solution to the problem is correct in polynomial time. To show that a problem X is NP-Hard, prove that you can reduce an NP-Hard problem to X in polynomial time. If you had a polynomial time solution for X, then you can reduce the NP-Hard problem to X in polynomial time and then solve X in polynomial time. Thus, you would have a polynomial time algorithm for the NP-Hard problem. Therefore, X is as hard as the NP-Hard problem so it must also be NP-Hard.
