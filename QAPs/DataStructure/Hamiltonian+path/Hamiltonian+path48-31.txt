I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
Go to amazon and buy Introduction to Algorithms and wait ten days for it to arrive. Then take ten months to study it. Algorithms take time, no matter how smart you are. It is an interesting book though. Have fun!
