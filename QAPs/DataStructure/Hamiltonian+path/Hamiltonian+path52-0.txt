What is the best method to connect a network of points, ensuring that all are connected and that each point only has at most 2 connections?
This is a Hamiltonian path. If there are no other constraints, you can do it simply by listing the points and making edges as you list (this seems too easy; did you leave out a constraint?) You didn't say whether it was directed or undirected. If directed, then it seems that you would simply have to close the path (start and end on the same vertex) in order to be able to reach any vertex from any other. (This would only work if "two connections" means one incoming and one outgoing.) I might have missed something obvious though; it's late :)
