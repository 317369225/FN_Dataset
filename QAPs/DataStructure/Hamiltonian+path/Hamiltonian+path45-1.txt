Does biological computing have potential?http://www.extremetech.com/extre...
Well, can molecules travel at the speed of light? How are you going to send data to your grandma in Florida? A canister of DNA sent in the mail will take, on average, 240 thousand times longer to reach her than a simple email. So, no. Biological computers do not have potential because anything they can do, digital computers can do better. If you're thinking that they may have potential because our brains are so smart, then please listen. Computer scientists have not figured out how to make a computer or network structure that is even close to our brains' structures. One day we will, and our creations will surpass their creators. But they won't be biological computers, sorry.
