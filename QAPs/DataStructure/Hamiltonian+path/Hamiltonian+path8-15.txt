Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
Marie Curie's two shared Nobel prizes are hard to beat. Angela Merkle is trained as a nuclear physicist. But I'm not certain how much of an accomplishment running Germany is. Roslyn Franklin who died young is also commonly cited. I had a prof who had Olga Tausky-Todd as his PhD advisor. Leona Wood worked on nuclear devices. Lisa Meitner worked on nuclear processes. Her deepness Sylvia Earle, oceanographer, founder Deep Ocean Engineering with her ex-husband Graham Hawkes, NOAA Chief scientist, Jym-suit diver. Had a bust statue at the Googleplex. Julie Packard, oceanographer, daughter of Dave Packard and founder of the Monterey Bay Aquarium and its Research Institute. Post-facto, Sally Ride was quite informally influential politically in ways not easily comprehended in historic hindsight (she tried to keep a personal live private; I had a couple of private discussions with her). In a similar way, my much closer colleague Kalpana Chawla who is merely a passing foot note to most Americans had and has influence on science in India is ways that Americans can't and mostly won't follow (I worked with her in her stint as a computational fluid dynamicist (CFDer)).
