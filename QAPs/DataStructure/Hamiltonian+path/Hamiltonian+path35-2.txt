What are some easy ways to imagine a 4D hypercube?
A 4d hypercube is a five-dimensional thing: that is, the cube that lives "upstairs" (hyper) from 4D is the 5-cube.  You see, some mathematicians think that a 2d thing is a surface.  For common people, a surface is something that can contain things, like a wall, and in 4d, you really can tie a knot in a 2-fabric.   You can spend a good deal of time with false imagery caused by bad terminology. Really, if you are going to approach higher dimensions properly, you got to get rid of this junky 3d terminology, and really think about what the words mean.  I wrote many interesting things in my Polygloss about visualising things and getting ready for higher dimensions. The easiest approach to four dimensions is to look at pictures of three-dimensions, and also maps.  These are both 2d, but things fall in pictures, but Alaska does not drop into antartica for being mounted on a wall-map.  You can use this sort of imagery to lay out solid space as a hyper-picture, ie a picture of 'upstairs'.  If the thing is a picture, then gravity = gravity, and you are looking at 2d of the 3d of the floor.  If the thing is a map, then there is no gravity, and the 3d room *is* the floor.
