How does one become good at problem solving?
Well, the first and the most difficult step is "to start to think". Once, you have started to think its just a cycle of failures and successes. What I usually do is try to figure out, what actually is creating the problem ? and then try to solve it with resources in hand. Its an iterative approach, and mostly works. There are various approaches which are optimal for a certain kind of problem, but that will take sometime to master and only comes with practice. Also, its very important to keep on solving it till you get the solution, this really helps. You might take long time to solve few problems initially, but eventually it will start coming in smoothly and nicely.
