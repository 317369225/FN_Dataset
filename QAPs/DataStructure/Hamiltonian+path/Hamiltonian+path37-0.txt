What is a good solution to the datacenter cooling problem on the Quora Challenges page?The first challenge here: http://www.quora.com/about/chall... See: What are the effective heuristics that can be applied to #p-complete problems, for finding the number of Hamiltonian paths in rectangular grids?
Hint: It's a Hamiltonian path problem.Â  Excerpt from The Algorithm Design Manual: The problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle or path in a graph is a special case of the traveling salesman problem, one where each pair of vertices with an edge between them has distance 1, while nonedge vertex pairs are separated by distance infinity.
