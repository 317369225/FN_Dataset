Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
I would say Madam Marie Curie is by far most accomplished female scientist or in general scientist ever. There is two main reasons behind this. First one is the obvious but the second one is worth to make her the greatest. 1. The name of Marie Curie is one of the household name in the field of radioactivity. She invented the term "radioactivity" but because the unit of measure  for it is her last name. Curie is still the only person to receive two  Nobel Prizes in different sciences, work that did not come without a  steep price. 2. We see in case of majority of researchers that they are so busy with themselves and their research that they ignored the proper education of their child. Marie Curie one of the few scientists who managed to keep the family as well as science both flowing at a right direction. The Nobel Prize of her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and highly recognised philanthropic work by her younger daughter Ève Denise Curie is the greatest achievement of Marie Curie, even make her legacy beyond the judgement of a Nobel Prize. Because of these two main reasons Madam Marie Curie will always be the most accomplished female scientist ever way beyond the league of others.
