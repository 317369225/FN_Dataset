What surprised you the most in your field of study?
That there is stupid tribal rivalry , for example Oracle is vastly superior to MS SQL despite both having significant market share , both camps are vehemently opposed to each other. Same goes for Java vs .NET , Mac vs PC, Unix vs Windows , could go on for ages. This response was brought to you by a Mac and Oracle devotee who believes Unix is the only viable enterprise OS (OSX is Unix under the hood) , who believes that developing applications in any language other than Java is criminally insane and hates Windows with a passion !
