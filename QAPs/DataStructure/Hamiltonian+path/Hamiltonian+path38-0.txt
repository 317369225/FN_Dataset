Given a graph, how to compute all of the possible topological sort outcomes?
Computing all possible topological sort outcomes can't be done efficiently simply because number of possible outcomes might be huge and outputting them itself will take a lot of time. For example, in a graph on N  vertices with no edges, number of valid topological sort outcomes is N!  . If you're okay with spending so much time, you might as well enumerate all permutations and check each in linear time.
