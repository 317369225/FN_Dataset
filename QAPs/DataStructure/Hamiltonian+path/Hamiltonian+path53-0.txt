Why is the traveling salesman problem NP complete?
The traveling salesman problem is NP-complete because it has 2 properties. First, it is in NP, roughly meaning that there is a polynomial-time algorithm to verify solutions to the problem. Second, for any other problem in NP, we can transform instances of the problem to equivalent instances of traveling salesman in polynomial time. This means that a polynomial-time solution to traveling salesman would imply a polynomial-time solution to every problem in NP, which most people don't believe is likely. For an overview of NP-completeness, see NP-complete.
