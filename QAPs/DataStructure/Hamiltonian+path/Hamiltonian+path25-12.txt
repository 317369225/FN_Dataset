What surprised you the most in your field of study?
How much I would fall in love with it. I started studying Islam and Arabic from a purely pragmatic "I can get a job with the government afterwards" place, but six years in, my studies are the great love of my life. I have found that dedicating myself to my field has changed me, bettered me, and inspired me I ways I could never have imagined when I made the original choice to enter it.
