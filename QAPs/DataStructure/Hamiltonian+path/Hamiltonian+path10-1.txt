How can one order the numbers 1 through 17 so that the sum of any two consecutive numbers are always a square number? Also, how does one prove there is no such ordering for the numbers 1 through 18?
This isn't too difficult, just time consuming.  Pick a number-- say... 14.  And you'll notice that in order to make a perfect square, we can add either 2 (to make 16), 11 (to make 25), or 22 (to make 36).  However, 22's too big.  Hence, we can plot out part of the sequence: ... 2, 14, 11 ... Now, take each end number (let's say 2), and figure out what goes next to it:  either 7 (to make 9), 14 (to make 16), or 23 (to make 25).  Again, 23 is too big, and we've already used 14, so the number next to 2 must be 7: ... 7, 2, 14, 11 ... Now, take 11, and notice that we can add 5 (to make 16), 14 (to make 25), or 25 (to make 36).  25's too big, and we've already used 14, so the other number next to 11 must be 5, making our sequence: ... 7, 2, 14, 11, 5 ... Keep going, and you'll eventually get to the ends, where you can't add anything else.  There are 2 numbers specifically in the sequence which have exactly one number in range that add up to a perfect square, but not two-- hence making them the necessary ends of the sequence. For the numbers up to 18, we can prove that no sequence is possible because there are 3 "end numbers".  That is, there are 3 numbers that only have ONE number that can be added to it to make a perfect square (that are in range, obviously).  As you can't make a single sequence with 3 ends, there cannot be a sequence for the numbers 1-18.
