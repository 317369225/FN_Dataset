What are some examples of problems which are: (1) NP but not NP-Complete; (2) NP-Complete; (3) NP-Hard but not NP-Complete?
To add to the other answers, in particular to question (3), many logical reasoning problems are NP-hard, but not in NP: those problems which are NExpTime-hard or harder. Two rather interesting examples are problems of deciding consistency for ontologies expressed in OWL 1 DL  and OWL 2  DL, which are both part of W3C's standard for Semantic Web. Consistency of ontology in OWL 1 DL is NExpTime-hard, while in OWL 2 DL, it is N2ExpTime-hard which is even harder.
