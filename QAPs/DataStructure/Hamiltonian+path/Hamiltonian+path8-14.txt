Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
Rosalind Franklin "is best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix".  Her "experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953". Sofia Kovalevskaya "was the first major Russian female mathematician, responsible for important original contributions to analysis, differential equations and mechanics, and the first woman appointed to a full professorship in Northern Europe".  I first learned about her when I studied the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem for partial differential equations.
