What are P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard?
The concept has been very well explained by Jessica Su. Adding to her answer, just to help visualize this better: As mentioned, P is a subset of NP, and the intersection of NP and NP-hard is NP-complete. The oval-shaped box would be one if P= NP= NP-complete. If P=NP were proved true, there would be many serious real-world consequences. All known encryption schemes rely on the fact that prime factors of large numbers are something that can be feasibly verified but not calculated. If P=NP, that means there would also be feasible ways to calculate prime factors, and hence de-crypt codes without their private keys. Related to this, quoting MIT Computer Scientist Scott Aaronson: If P=NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in “creative leaps,” no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it’s found. Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss; everyone who could recognize a good investment strategy would be Warren Buffett. It’s possible to put the point in Darwinian terms: if this is the sort of universe we inhabited, why wouldn’t we already have evolved to take advantage of it? Updated 6 Jan 2013 • View Upvotes
