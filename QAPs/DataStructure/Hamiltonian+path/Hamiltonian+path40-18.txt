What are P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard?
Originally Answered: Explain in simple terms, what does it mean that a problem is P or NP?Given any problem, there are two things associated with it : either there's s known solution for it or none has been discovered till date. For the time being consider the problems which have a solution, i.e it can be solved in some way or other(It can have multiple solutions too). We classify these problems into P and NP. P problems : Problems whose solution is generated in polynomial time, and we can verify the solution whether its correct or not in polynomial time .  NP problems : Problems whose solution is generated in polynomial or non-polynomial time, and we can verify the solution whether its correct or not in polynomial time . Example of P problem : Calculating the number of digits in any 'n'-digit +ve integer. Here the time taken to calculate number of digits depend on value of 'n'. So, the time taken can be shown in a function of 'n'.....which in this case will be a linear function.(A linear function is a polynomial with n^1) Example of NP problem : Calculating the number of divisors of a given + ve integer. Here calculating all the divisors is rather tedious but verifying a possible solution is very simple .i.e. just divide with each divisor and check the remainder ,(verification is done in linear time where 'n'  is the number of divisors)
