What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
Jack Dongarra and Francis Sullivan published a list of "The Top Ten Algorithms of the Century."  Their list included:       the Monte Carlo method or Metropolis algorithm, devised by John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, and Nicholas Metropolis;        the simplex method of linear programming, developed by George Dantzig;         the Krylov Subspace Iteration method, developed by Magnus           Hestenes, Eduard Stiefel, and Cornelius Lanczos;         the Householder matrix decomposition, developed by Alston           Householder;        the Fortran compiler, developed by a team lead by John Backus;         the QR algorithm for eigenvalue calculation, developed by J Francis;         the Quicksort algorithm, developed by Anthony Hoare;         the Fast Fourier Transform, developed by James Cooley and           John Tukey;         the Integer Relation Detection Algorithm, developed by Helaman Ferguson and Rodney Forcade; (given N real values  XI, is there a nontrivial set of integer coefficients aIso that sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) AI * XI = 0?         the fast Multipole algorithm, developed by Leslie Greengar and Vladimir Rokhlin; (to calculate gravitational forces in an N-body problem normally requires N^2 calculations.  The   fast multipole method uses order N calculations, by approximating  the effects of groups of distant particles using multipole  expansions)         Source: The Top Ten Algorithms of the Century Updated 20 Jun 2014 • View Upvotes
