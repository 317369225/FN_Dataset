How can Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics be explained in layman terms?
Probably the best explanation in layman's terms comes from Feynman himself and can be found in his book "QED. The strange theory of light and matter". Basically - in order to find the probability that something happens (like a particle going from point A to point B in a given time) you have to consider all possible ways it can happen (all paths the particle can in principle take), calculate for each path so-called quantum-mechanical amplitude, and add all those amplitudes together.
