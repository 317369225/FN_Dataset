Permutations and Combinations: What is the greatest number of moves on a Rubik's Cube that can be made without returning to a previous state or a transformation of one before it must have been solved?If it is possible to cycle through all possible positions on a Rubik’s Cube continuously, then this number is the same as the number of possible positions on a Rubik’s Cube, notwithstanding whichever consistent definition of “all possible positions” is chosen.

If you draw the graph whose vertices are positions of the Rubik’s Cube, and whose edges are single moves, then a sequence of moves that visits every possible position with no repeats—a so-called “Devil’s algorithm”—would be a Hamiltonian path in this graph. Since the operations on the Cube generate a group, this graph is a Cayley graph, so it is vertex-transitive. Therefore the Lovász conjecture, if true, would imply the existence of a Hamiltonian path. (Some versions of the conjecture would imply the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle, which would return the Cube to its initial position after visiting every other position exactly once.) We don’t know whether the Lovász conjecture is true, even when restricted to Cayley graphs. However, it turns out that for the specific case of the Rubik’s Cube graph, a Hamiltonian cycle has been explicitly constructed by computer search. You can download a compressed representation of this cycle that’s about 7 megabytes. So the answer is indeed the number of possible positions of the Cube (112 ⋅12!⋅2 12 ⋅8!⋅3 8 =43252003274489856000  ), minus one.
