What are the best applications of linearity of expectation?
Let G be a directed graph, initially empty, on n nodes. For each node x, we independently choose a node y uniformly at random from the n nodes of the graph. With probability p, we draw a directed edge from node x to y. Then the probability that there is a cycle in G is p. To prove this, we use strong induction on n. We label the nodes 1...n. When n=1, the probability of a cycle is the probability that node 1 has an edge to itself, which is indeed p. For the inductive step, we consider the set S  of nodes who have an edge coming out them. Let G' be the subgraph of G consisting of the nodes in S  and the edges connecting them, and let k=|S|  . Each node in G' has a probability kn   of having an out-edge. If k<n  , by the inductive hypothesis, G' has a cycle with probability kn   . If k=n  , then the probability of a cycle is kn =1  (any graph with n nodes and n edges has a cycle) In any case, the probability of a cycle existing is kn   , which is on average (this is where we apply linearity of expectation) npn =p  .
