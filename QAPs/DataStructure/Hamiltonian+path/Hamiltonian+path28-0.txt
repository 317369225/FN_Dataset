How can Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics be explained in layman terms?
Well, the method of applying the path integral formulation can be explained in simple terms. Let's step back and see why we use it, and how it comes in play. Warning: long post below. Grab a cup of coffee or a banana. The point I want to make is that it's pretty easy to figure out a layman's description for a lot of things in physics, but it won't cover a lot of the finer details. A lot of times, in Physics, we ask ourselves: "what is the probability amplitude that a particle at x i   at some time t i   will be at some position x f   at a later time t f   ?" This is a fundamental question. This means, we would like to know the time evolution operator of that particle for some Hamiltonian system. How that particle moves (evolves) in time. The SystemLet's just take the most basic example, a single particle (proton, electron, something) in a standard potential V(x)  . This Hamiltonian is     H ^ =p ^  2 2m       kinetic +V(x ^ )        potential   The kinetic term is something familiar to us in classical mechanics: 12 mv 2   where the momentum is a conserved (cyclic) quantity p=mx ˙ =mv  . The Time Evolution OperatorNow, to find that probability amplitude, the probability of the particle going from (t i ,x i )→(t f ,x f )  , it turns out we need to compute the following quantity     U(t f ,x f ;t i ,x i )=⟨x f |e −iH ^ (t f −t i ) |x i ⟩  We like to denote U  for time-evolution to remind ourselves that it is unitary, hence why it's U  and not like TE  . But here's where it gets hard. Let's say the total time the particle traveled was T=t f −t i   , as T  gets very large - it is very hard to compute the exponential of an operator multiplied by this total time e H ^ T   . The path integral formulation comes into play here. The Path Integral FormulationIdea: split up the total time T  into N  chunks of time Δt  . In other words, Δt=TN   .. So...     U(t f ,x f ;t i ,x i )=⟨x f |e −iH ^ (t f −t i ) |x i ⟩  Expand this out in N  terms                             =⟨x f |e −iH ^ Δt ⋯e −iH ^ Δt                       N terms |x i ⟩  Insert a 1  everywhere (a=a⋅1  )                             =⟨x f |e −iH ^ Δt ⋅1⋅e −iH ^ Δt ⋯⋅1⋅e −iH ^ Δt |x i ⟩  And then substitute in what is known as the completeness relation to finish up the path integral formulation                             =∫dx 1  ⟨x f |e −iH ^ Δt ⋯|x 1 ⟩⟨x 1 |e −iH ^ Δt |x i ⟩  Note some things:     ∏ N−1 k=1 dx k =dx k−1  dx k−2  ⋯dx 1   And the completeness relation used is     ∫dx k  |x k ⟩⟨x k |=1  which is sort of a closure. You don't have to totally understand this from a Layman's point of view - just know that we have it set equal to unity (1  ). So what are we doing physically? We're splitting up the giant path between two points x f   and x i   into a bunch of little pieces and summing each piece up. And so the probability amplitude is the sum of all the ways from which we can get between our two endpoints. It is almost like we are counting paths and then weighting each path by the Hamiltonian of the system (some paths are more preferable than others, clearly). Approximating the exponentialNow that we have a Hamiltonian multiplied by a small time period Δt  , we can expand and approximate that exponential!     e −iH ^ Δt =e −i(p ^  2 2m +V(x ^ ))Δt                      =e −ip ^  2 2m Δt e −iV(x ^ )Δt (1+O(Δt) 2 )  And dropping the extra terms of higher order in Δt  will mean our expansion is approximate                   ≈e −ip ^  2 2m Δt e −iV(x ^ )Δt   Evaluating a small piece of the pathLet's just consider a single piece from x k−1 →x k   .     ⟨x k |e −iH ^ Δt |x k−1 ⟩≈⟨x k e −ip ^  2 2m Δt e −iV(x ^ )Δt |x k−1 ⟩  Then insert a complete set of states (but for momentum this time!)                      =∫dp k  ⟨x k |p k ⟩⟨p k |e −ip ^  2 2m Δt ⋅e −iV(x ^ )Δt |x k−1 ⟩                      =∫dp k 2π e −iΔt(p 2 k 2m +V(x k−1 )−p k x k −x k−1 Δt )   Substituting it all back in This gives us the Hamiltonian Path Integral or the Phase Space Path Integral. You could also integrate over the momentum states and get the Lagrangian Path Integral: Updated 4 Feb 2014 • View Upvotes
