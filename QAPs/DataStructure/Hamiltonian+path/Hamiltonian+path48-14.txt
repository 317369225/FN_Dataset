I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
Taking your question very literally, "learn algorithms in 10 days" I will assume you mean you would feel successful if you can learn at least two algorithms, you can do that in 10 minutes.  Many people working as programmers have a pretty fuzzy grasp of algorithms nowadays anyway and you'll fit right in. On the other hand, if you mean to develop some sort of professional competence so that your knowledge of algorithms could be useful for work or hobbies, 10 days is just enough to start understanding how deep the subject is.  It's great that you're interested.  I'm pretty serious when I say that many people manage to forget everything they were ever taught about algorithms.  Some of the most common uses of algorithms such as sorting and searching come pre-canned in virtually every high level language. EDIT Forgot to give the advice.  Borrowing a line from Mahan Khalsa, "Start anywhere, go everywhere."  In 10 days you can't do much except dabble so pick whatever looks interesting from books the naming pattern "Introduction to _____ and Algorithms".  Unless you are a really remarkable intelligence, you should follow a established curriculum either by book or by classroom (or virtual classroom).
