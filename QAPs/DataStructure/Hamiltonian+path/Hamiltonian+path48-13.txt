I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
It's impossible. Worth trying though. Since the harder you try, the more you will hate algorithms and programming. Then, you will become a yet another Ruby or Java developer, and contribute to the world's entropy in a manner similar to what most people do. Thus, real software developers and architects, who know what algorithms and software design are about, would gain in value once again. Therefore, by all means, go ahead and try. It honestly doesn't matter where you start. If the goal is to keep trying for 10 days straight, you'll hate it anyway. Just make sure you have enough willpower and stamina to last all these 10 days. Seriously, can you code any TopCoder or CodeForces easy problem in a few minutes in Notepad / GEdit / whatever editor Mac users have by default, and have it compile and pass all the tests from the first attempt? If no, and you are serious, get there first. The rest will follow.
