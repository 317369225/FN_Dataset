Who are the most accomplished female scientists?
I like to add the particle physicist Fabiola Gianotti. Gianotti is currently in charge of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Which is considered the world's biggest scientific experiment.                              (Adapted from her Wikipedia page) Gianotti joined CERN in 1987, working on various experiments including the UA2 experiment and Large Electron–Positron Collider, the precursor to the LHC at CERN. Her thesis was on data analysis for the UA2 experiment. She began working on liquid-argon calorimetry at the LHC in 1990 and continued that work for ATLAS when the collaboration began in 1992. Gianotti also worked on LEP2's supersymmetry search between 1996 and 2000. After 18 years of working with CERN, Gianotti became the ATLAS experiment's spokesperson and coordinator, leading the lab's strategic planning and presenting findings to the international media. Here's her on the cover of TIME magazine as the number five person on the magazine's Person of the Year list in 2012.
