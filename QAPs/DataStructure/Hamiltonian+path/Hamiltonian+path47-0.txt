What are some interesting algorithms that have no known implementation to date?
There's a lovely book about knots [1] in which the unsolved problem is stated: Write a computer program that can tell whether a knot that it is given is the unknot. (This is a difficult problem that requires a complete understanding of Haken's algorithm. But beware: His paper is 130 pages long!)I was quite amazed that there's an algorithm that clearly shows it is possible to solve a given problem but no one implemented it. The algorithm solves the problem of knowing if the given knot is the unknot. Unknot is a knot you get if given a tangled string you manage to untangle it completely (maybe you'll never untangle it but how do you know you can't?). As much as I realized from reading about the algorithm, the problem was (in the 30 years before 2000) that there was something in the algorithm which no one knew how to represent on the computer. Later, in 1999, three men identified the representation and the doors to the implementation were opened.[2] So, at the time and about 30 years after, the algorithm wasn't implemented but today it is.[3] I didn't know that this is the case until recently but this is definitely a nice example of an algorithm not being implemented for about 30 years. There are probably plenty more current examples but I can't think of any currently. I guess plenty of them could be in the areas of mathematics similar to knot theory. There are some inherent difficulties of the problem and are explained in the cited sources.
