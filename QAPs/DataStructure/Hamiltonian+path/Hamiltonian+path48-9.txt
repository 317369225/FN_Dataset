I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
There are 'N' number of algorithms that would take 'N' days to solve and learn each one particularly. This will take O(n^2) time of your life. Well you can look over some of the basic ones : Greedy Algorithms , Searching Algorithms like binary search , Sorting Algorithms like merge sorting , quick sort  etc. To kickstart first learn about space time complexity of algorithms , running time. Then the basic algorithm would be linear search , bubble sort , or may be you should solve some very simple problems like reversing a number , checking a number is prime or not. By doing so you will be able to express algorithms in your choice of language.Always remeber learning algorithms  cannot be done in 10 days .Keep practicing and solve problems using the algorithms you learn along the way. Happy coding.
