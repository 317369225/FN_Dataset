What surprised you the most in your field of study?
The constant battle between using Q  and Z  to note the partition function. How many models of water there are, and consequently, how difficult it is to model water that is consistent with reality. About the number of people who don't have a good definition of hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions. How complicated some potentials between molecules can be, and how it is just handwaved as 'Coulombic', 'Van der Waals' etc...
