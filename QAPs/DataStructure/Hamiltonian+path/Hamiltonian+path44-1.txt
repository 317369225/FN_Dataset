An MD at a top-tier investment bank where I work told me to read about something (doesn't have to be finance-related but has to be something he doesn't already know), learn it, and teach it to him in my remaining 6 weeks. What should I learn?
Depends on what he's like. Here are a couple ideas: 1) Learn how to count cards in blackjack, or basic poker theory. Fairly straightforward to do, fun, shows math skills, and you can go to the casino afterwards 2) Learn something random but funny like juggling, how to do a handstand, etc. It would be pretty cool to see an MD upside down on a wall or throwing things around 3) Learn a sports skill like how to throw a curveball, properly break a pool table, how to finesse a soccer shot, etc. Can set up a game or compete against each other after 4) If he likes to drink, learn how to shotgun/chug a beer, then kick back a few after work Hope this helped
