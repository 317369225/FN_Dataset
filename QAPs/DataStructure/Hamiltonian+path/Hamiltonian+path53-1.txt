Why is the traveling salesman problem NP complete?
Assuming that you're looking for a proof, here's a sketch: Every instance of HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT is reducible to TRAVELING SALESPERSON in polynomial time. (Proof is trivial: consider TRAVELING SALESPERSON on a complete graph, where the edge weights are 1 if an edge is present in the graph for HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT and 2 otherwise.) Every instance of 3SAT is reducible to an instance of HAMILTONIAN PATH or HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT. I won't give the proof here, because it really needs some diagrams, but thr's a reasonable explanation of it at http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~ksmani/... . And 3SAT is one of the NP-complete problems in Karp's original analysis.
