I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
Depends on what you're asking.  If you want to LEARN a lot of existing algorithms - maybe start working through Knuth's "Art of Computer Programming" - front to back.  Then again, after you've got the basics down, I always figure it more like math - when you need a formula, you go to the CRC handbook, when you need an algorithm you go to Knuth and Google. If you want to CREATE algorithms - well, that's more a matter of understanding your subject matter, maybe the math involved, and engineering problem solving (unless your doing analysis, then it's analysis and modeling).  You probably learn that by attacking lots of problems, and maybe reading up on prior work.
