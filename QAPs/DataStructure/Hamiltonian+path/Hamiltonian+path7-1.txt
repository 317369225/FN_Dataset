What is the name of the following problem: given a graph, find a path between 2 nodes that pass through each node once and only once?This is a variant of the Hamilton graph problem, but where you do not have to return to the original node.Â  What is this problem called?
TSP, aka Travelling Salesman Problem, seeks the *shortest* path that goes through every city on his itinerary list only once, where he is usually required to return home, however, even if that requirement is dropped the computational complexity is still NP-complete. I believe the result is due to Richard Karp under the general rubric of directed and undirected "Hamiltonian cycle/path problems."
