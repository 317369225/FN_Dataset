I want to practice algorithms for 10 days (240 hours). Where should I start?I have fair knowledge of Algorithms.
I don't know what it means to "learn algorithms". You can learn some popular algorithms, like for searching and sorting and allocating blocks of memory, or graphic algorithms such as filling polygons and finding inner-outer regions.  Or some of the common and useful tree and hashing algorithms.    And you can learn algorithms in a very general way, the Father Guido Sarducci school of Algorithms, where you learn to not use nested or long drawn-out loops, or nested loops that make the algorithm of a high order, or tricks like cache information so you don't have to re-run slow algorithms, that's the 5-minute university right there.
