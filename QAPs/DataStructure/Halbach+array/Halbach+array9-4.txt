Why are stars so fascinating?
I'm going to give you my view on why stars are fascinating. They're so fascinating because there are billions of trillions of them out there and they can be so different. There are stars that are billions of kilometers in diameter, stars that are extremely magnetic, some with diamonds in their core and stars which weigh about the size of a mountain in one teaspoon. They look beautiful in the sky (especially in the desert) but most of them you see is their light from billions of years ago, long after their death. Because of the several unique characteristics a star can have, I find that very fascinating and we are only finding more. But of course that is just my opinion.
