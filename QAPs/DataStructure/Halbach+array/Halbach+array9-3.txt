Why are stars so fascinating?
Because the stars are us... we are stars. Carl Sagan tells -" Have you ever imagined that the nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood and the carbon in our apple pies were all made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff." We really are made of starstuff. I think that we all are very similar to stars, not only because of the presence of these chemicals but also because we even die like stars. (Only difference is stars die either to form white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes but we die to form a debris of natural molecules!) Continue to observe those shiny points embedded in the heavenly night sky! Wish you luck!
