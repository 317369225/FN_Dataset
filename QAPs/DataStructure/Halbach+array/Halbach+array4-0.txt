What is the strongest magnet in the world?
Last account I had the superconducting magnet at Florida State university was the strongest.  The strongest permanent magnet I have seen is the circular Halbach array of pyramid magnets I had made several years ago that measured 1.65 Tesla in the center.  I have a YouTube video show it.
