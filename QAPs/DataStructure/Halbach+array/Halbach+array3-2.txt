How do I start designing my own electric motor?
There are a number of things you need to know before you start. If you have a reference motor, this knowledge might not be so important. Anyway, you need to know what power you need to develop and what starting torque you need to provide. You need to know the supply voltage as well as the allowable current density in the windings so that the motor will not overheat. You also need to know the maximum allowable magnetic flux density in the steel laminations so that you can size the back iron and the teeth. This information is not enough to get you going but you need this before you can go further. Here are a few other things you need to know. operating speed installation dimensions type: ac, dc, brushed or brushless, PM or wound field or induction cooling means and expected life Some of these items are more important if you need to satisfy a money paying customer. If you are doing this just for fun, then dive in and see what you can come up with.
