Is it possible to create a magnetic field in one direction only?
Magnetic (and all other types of) fields are distorted regions in universal medium. Universal medium, structured by quanta of matter, fills entire space, outside basic 3D matter-particles. Due to latticework-structures of universal medium, distortion in its structure has to be continuous (without breakage to latticework structures). Therefore, all types of fields (except gravitational field) will be continuous and they do not cause breaks in universal medium. Direction of magnetic field is indicated by imaginary lines of force.Â  All lines of force are closed geometrical figures. Hence, it is impossible to create magnetic field in only one direction . see: viXra.org e-Print archive, viXra:1404.0440, Fields
