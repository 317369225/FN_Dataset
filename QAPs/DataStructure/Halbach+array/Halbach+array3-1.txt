How do I start designing my own electric motor?
What immediately came into mind when I read this question is, get a reference motor. That is, if it is within your means to acquire such a motor physically, do it. This will be for small motors of course, acquiring a much bigger one is impractical. The rationale for getting a reference motor is obviously so that you can view how a motor would look like physically and view it in 3D, picture how your own motor in your head would look like and then design accordingly. If however the motor you are designing is a humongous one, you can either Get an already drawn CAD diagram of a similar motor and use it for reference, or Draw by components. Expanding on my 2nd point, create something like a chart to decide which part goes where, on a piece of paper. You can also choose to quickly sketch how each part of your motor would look like on paper, so that you don't have to keep it in your head all the time. Either draw your own part individually, or get them from grabcad.com (I often did the latter during my internship on redesigning the 3D printer). Sorry if I cannot help much as I am not too familiar with motors, but at least this is how I process my thoughts when I start designing something complicated onto 3D drawing software. Hope this helps.
