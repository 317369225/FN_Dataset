How do hover boards work?
Flubber! As far as I know, the sole manufacturers of flubber are the Quantum Vortex Corp. who operate a very secure hi-tech facility in Boganville, South Dakota. They've been delivering for use in cars since at least the early 1960's, but have only overcome difficulties in scaling of the Piolaâ€“Kirchhoff stress tensor that go along with miniaturization to be able to compress enough flubber into a skateboard-sized package while retaining sufficiently sensitive torque manipulation to actually control the 'board in a safe manner. The real question now is whether hoverboards are going to be classed are flying vehicles that require FAA approval, and so can only be used by licensed operators, as seems the current possibility with drones, at least in the US. See Sources: FAA May Require Licenses To Fly Commercial Drones. I have not yet heard of attempts to flubberize drones but I'm sure Amazon and others must be researching the possibilities.
