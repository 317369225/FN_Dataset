How can we amplify magnetic fields?
Look let me tell you, there is a lot of difference between amplification and magnification. In the above question I am considering the magnification of magnetic field (or flux lines) to a point. And not amplification of magnetic fields, a LASER uses a lens to form an image at infinite. And yes, one can concentrate magnetic fields, concentrate here means magnification or bending them. You can use many small permanent steel magnets or coils and arrange them in such a way that they are magnified to a certain limit. One similar case is of theÂ  Halbach array. A Halbach array is a special arrangement of permanent magnets that augments the magnetic field on one side of the array while cancelling the field to near zero on the other side. This is achieved by having a spatially rotating pattern of magnetisation. One more similar example is shown in this video ( ) Here are magnetic fields of few magnets (http://www.coolmagnetman.com/gal...) And I am not sure but I guess pyramid (polyhedron) shaped magnets do concentrate magnetic fields to a better extent. And here in this PDF you might find your answer... And coincidently in this experiment you are concentrating magnetic flux using lasers !!! - http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpowe...
