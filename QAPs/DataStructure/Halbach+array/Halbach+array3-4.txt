How do I start designing my own electric motor?
A motor is an electrical mechanical device that can convert eletrical energy to mechanical motion and mechanical motion to electrical energy. Aspects of the magnetics are just as important of the mechanical design.Â  I'd probably start with the motor requirements (the problem your motor solves that is not solved by other motors) and then design to those requirements (torque, power, etc..). You will need to use both electrical engineering software for modeling and simulation as well as mechanical cad software. If you need help, just let me know. Mike
