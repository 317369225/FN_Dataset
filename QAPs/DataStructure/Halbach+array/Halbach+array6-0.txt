How much power and wire do I need to create a 5-tesla electromagnet?
You could build a 5T permanent magnèt even [at room temperature].  The rated saturation—2T for ·999 iron—only applies to a dipole!  So when you hold two same poles together you get twofold the strength.  (You may need to link the far poles too or stay with pancake magnèts; I'm not sure how opposite circuits work.)  A Halbach array of sideways magnèts only takes advantage of some of the field.  I foretell that the biggest multiplication can be gotten with six poles butted together in a bipýramid, short of 1+1+4[math]\sqrt{2}/2[/math]~4·8 times.  If you butt three 2T poles tilted at 20° to 24° they'll make 5 T. And it'd take almost no power at all if you use almost no wire, widthwise, and almost no wire if you keep the wire cool.  Start with 3 ·00001 A/m and  (·00003L A/m)^2 R W.
