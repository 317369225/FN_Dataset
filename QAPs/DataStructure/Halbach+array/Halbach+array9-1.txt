Why are stars so fascinating?
Personally, I just think astronomy is cool. My parents took me to a star party when I was about 6, and I saw Saturn through a telescope. I was hooked. Other people think music is fascinating, or painting, or literature. I like those too, but astronomy, now that's fascinating.
