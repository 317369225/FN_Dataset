How do hover boards work?
If you can get your hands on a powerful neodymium magnet and a suitable length of copper pipe I recommend trying this experiment: As the magnet falls, it induces electric currents in the copper known as eddy currents. Those currents in turn generate a magnetic field which, by Lenz's law, oppose the change in the magnet's position. It's uncanny to watch. In that experiment the eddy currents don't cause hovering, they just slow down the fall of the magnet. However, if instead of using a permanent magnet you actively drive an electromagnet with an alternating current, the magnetic field will keep changing back and forth. This will also generate eddy currents in the copper that generate an opposing magnetic field. Arrange things correctly and you can get such an electromagnet to hover over a copper plate. Here's an example: (You can use aluminium too.) An important thing to note about this is that if you flip the coil over it makes no difference, you still have much the same AC current flowing in the coil. So it's equally stable whichever way up you have the coil. This is different to what happens if you try to balance a (non-spinning) permanent magnet on top of another. The latter is always doomed to failure because if you can arrange a permanent magnet over another so that it is repelled by the one below, it will tend to flip over and then it will get attracted instead of repelled.
