What kind of programmer will be in shortage in the future?
Same as it is now, I would think, good ones. I don't think languages will matter very much, any experienced developer can move between languages easy enough. I've done maybe 15 years of developing Python, but if my next project was Ruby, D, or JavaScript, it's not going to matter too much. When you learn your first language, it's very difficult, the second is a bit easier, the third is easier still, and when you're on your 5th or 6th, you'll wonder why you ever worried about learning a language. 2.7k Views Â· 18 Upvotes
