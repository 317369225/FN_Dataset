What is the most exciting new research in mathematics? What do mathematicians find exciting nowadays?
In 1987, Sarnak, Lubotzky and Phillips constructed the first Ramanujan graphs by using extraordinarily deep mathematics. But now after the breakthroughs in the last ~2 years by Nikhil Srivastava-Adam Marcus-Daniel Spielman we are may be extremely close to being able to construct these more easily and of infinitely different sizes than those of very restricted kinds in that 1987 work. Its an unicorn of mathematics which suddenly seems to be very tangibly real. And there is a good chance that this is a dramatic new avatar of "random matrix theory" as opposed to the genesis of Ramanujan graph... (more)
