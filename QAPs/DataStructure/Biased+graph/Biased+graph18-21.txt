Why do Trump supporters (81%) feel life is worse for them today than it would have been 50 years ago?
The short answer is that they watch too much Fox News and listen to Rush. I’d love to see data on where these folks get their information. The most conservative parts of the GOP have become addicted to predictions of doom. Unfortunately I think they actually believe it. Another reason is that they tend to live in areas of limited sophistication (with few college graduates) and fewer people who aren’t like them. A lot of political persuasion takes place in barber shops, beauty salons, cafes, and church suppers. It may be the blind leading the blind, but it is what it is. 1.9k Views · 39 Upvotes · Answer requested by Logan Webb
