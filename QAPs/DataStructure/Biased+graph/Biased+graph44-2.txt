What is the best way to explain the bias-variance trade-off in laymanâ€™s terms ?
The best way to explain this might be with simplified graphs e.g. if you Google graph overfitting - Google Search as an image search there are loads of good examples. This may oversimplify things somewhat e.g. examples with just one or two features, but this helps to understand conceptually what it means for a model to have high bias (underfitting) or high variance (overfitting). The concept is much the same just much harder to visualise when there are many features. e.g. (source: 10_Advice_for_applying_machine_learning). It is easy to understand from this that the high variance model ma... (more)
