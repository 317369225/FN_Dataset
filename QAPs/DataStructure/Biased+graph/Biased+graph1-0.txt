What will a semiconductor reverse bias graph look like?
Normal semiconductor or single semiconductor baising either forward or reverse doesn't make any sense as you are just reversing the polarity of applied voltage. I think you you are asking about reverse biased PN junction diode Now here is the answer As you are reverse biasing the junction the width of deplition layer or space charge region will increase resulting in higher resistance to current and a small current will flow in the range of microamperes and that minor current will be due to minority charge carriers Hope this will help you. 95 Views Â· 1 Upvote
