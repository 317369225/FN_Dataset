What are the most harmful special interests in the US?
Industrial Agriculture lobbyists (as detailed by Sasha Katsnelson) Financial Industry lobbyists (Banks, Credit Card companies etc. who misuse and gamble with public money/assets for private profits, and also fleece people with ridiculously high interest rates) Health Care Industry lobbyists (who keep the cost of healthcare so artificially high out of the reach of many) Gun Rights / Arms Industry lobbyists (IMO, there is no f***ing reason anyone should own a gun) 187 Views Â· 1 Upvote
