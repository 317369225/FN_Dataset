Are Marvel fans inflating movie reviews on IMDb? I was going through reviews of recent releases of both DC and Marvel. I saw a trend whereby Marvel movie reviews tend to be extremely positive while DC is on the other side.
And marvel movies have been largely watchable while DC movies have largely been steaming piles of dog shit. How is this confusing or a conspiracy? Bad movies get bad reviews. Good movies get good reviews. It literally cannot be made more simple or obvious. 70 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
