What websites do I need when I'm in high school?
In addition to Easybib.com, I would recommend NoodleTools Express (http://my.noodletools.com/noodle...) for effective MLA and APA citations, which is what I used when I was in high school over ten years ago. Wikipedia is not the most effective website as there can be conflicting information, which professors will state in college. So, I would recommend utilizing the ERIC file on college library websites to obtain excellent resources to do well in high school. 321 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
