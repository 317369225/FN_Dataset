Which cognitive bias do you struggle most with?
Took a lot of thought to finally answer this one. Believing my thoughts. I feel like I’m trapped in an endless cycle like those old Keystone cops routines, or the derivatives of that sort of thing; this carefully constructed mechanism that looks utterly random, terrifying and a total fraud; and yet somehow amazing despite it all. Best example of this I can find is this amazing man, Larry Griswold: Believing my thoughts, I am very much in danger; but trusting myself I pull off this amazing thing that is actually inevitable; all the while appearing like a total ass. 147 Views · 2 Upvotes · Answer requested by Pete Ashly
