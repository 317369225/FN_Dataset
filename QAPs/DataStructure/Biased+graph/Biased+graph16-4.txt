What does your answer Quora pie graph look like?
This is my pie. There are many like it, but this one is mine. As you can see, it's heavily weighted towards computer-related topics, yet fairly balanced otherwise. Hat tip: Mikhail Kotykhov for the A2A, and Mohan S Nayaka for creating the pie chart rendering tool in the first place. (Quora Admins: Hire him! 'Nuff said.) 1.2k Views · 67 Upvotes · Answer requested by Mikhail Kotykhov
