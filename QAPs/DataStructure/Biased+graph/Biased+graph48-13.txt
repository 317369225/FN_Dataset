Will Islam take over India very soon?
No it's not possible toll next three centuries. Even if the Hindu fertility rates continue to decline and Muslim rates remain same (Which is not possible as their fertility rates have declined most in last two decades) it will not be before 2300 that Muslims will be in majority in India. Don't listen at the Muslim leaders who say they will be in majority. If it would have been than Muslim MLAs and MPs would also show an increasing trend. 1.1k Views Â· 5 Upvotes
