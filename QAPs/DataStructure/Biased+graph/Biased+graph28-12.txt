What is an assumption that people often wrongly make?
That they have been perfectly clear, so the onus of understanding is on the listener. I make a good living as a marriage counselor because of this assumption. All kinds of contracts and expectations are constantly being made believing they have been understood as to intent. Very often it isn't and people are surprised. 27.9k Views · 474 Upvotes · Answer requested by Johannus Vogel
