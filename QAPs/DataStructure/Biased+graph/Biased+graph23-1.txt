Why do overfit models have high variance but low bias?
You have misunderstood what “bias” means in statistics. A model can’t be biased toward the training data - that isn’t possible. Bias, in statistics, means that the predictions of the model tend to be wrong in a certain direction. E.g. if you were modeling the weights of adult human males, a biased model would either a) give weights that were usually too high or b) give weights that were usually too low. Overfitting the training data results if fits that are very good (and not biased) on the training data. And no bias is introduced when the model is fit to test data. But the fit won’t be as good. 976 Views · 12 Upvotes · Answer requested by Zachary Thomas
