Which PhD offer should I accept, Computer Science or Operations Research? My research interests are in (combinatorial) optimization, graph algorithms, network flows, and algorithmic game theory (which overlap between both fields).
Just to play devil’s advocate: if you are interested in working on dynamic pricing, yield management, or inventory control systems, operations research PhD’s are incredibly sought after and are frankly harder to find than CS PhDs. That said, both supply and demand is smaller for OR. It’s just a much thinner market. But a top OR grad can make a killing at Uber, Air BnB, major airlines, etc. We’re looking at finding top OR grads at Breather to work on some pretty intense challenges. 884 Views · 5 Upvotes
