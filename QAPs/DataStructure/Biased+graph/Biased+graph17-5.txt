What are the concise meaning and interpretation of bias and variance in machine learning and statistics?
Bias is the difference between the true (or wanted) value and the measured (or actual) value of a statistic or machine's output, when that difference is systematic (i.e. not random) . Variance is the expected difference when  such a  difference is due solely to random processes. 740 Views · 9 Upvotes
