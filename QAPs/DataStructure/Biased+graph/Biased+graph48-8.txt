Will Islam take over India very soon?
After going through all the permutations and combinations. I don't think Islam will take over India. No matter, how badly politicians, preachers and fanatics urge people to increase the number of children per family to overcome other's religion population. This urge is affiliated to dirty politics, although Muslim population is increasing rapidly, it would be a insidious issue for themselves. Poverty, unemployment, decline in literacy, terrorism, vulnerability amongst themselves, can not or should not lead to a population increase exponentially at all. 775 Views Â· 4 Upvotes
