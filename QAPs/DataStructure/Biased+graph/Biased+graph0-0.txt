What is the difference in a forward biased graph and a reverse biased graph?
If we talk about the characterstics of a diode, that is: The main difference between the forward biased & reverse biased graph is the voltage from which the curve changes drastically. In the forward region, its the knee voltage Vd and in the reverse, its the reverse breakdown voltage Vbr. The graph in both the regions might look somewhat similar but the difference is the nature of the characterstics after these voltages. In the forward region after the knee voltage Vd, the current rapidly increases for a small value of voltage thatswhy giving a straight vertical line( this is the required forward voltage value necessary for the diode to work in the forward bias) while in the reverse region, the vertical line indicates that a large amount of current flows through the diode; but this large current flow is due to the breakdown of the diode due to such a large reverse voltage applied to the diode. 416 Views · 3 Upvotes · Answer requested by Rila
