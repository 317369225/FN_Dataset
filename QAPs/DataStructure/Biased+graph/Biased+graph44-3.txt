What is the best way to explain the bias-variance trade-off in layman’s terms ?
Trade-off: a balance achieved between two desirable but incompatible features; a compromise. The bias variance trade-off is one of the most important aspect of error handling in supervised learning. Bias refers to the error due to overly-simplistic assumptions or faulty assumptions in the learning algorithm. Bias results in under-fitting the data. A high bias means our learning algorithm is missing important trends amongst the features. Variance refers to the error due to an overly-complex that tries to fit the training data as closely as possible. In high variance cases the model’s predicted ... (more)
