In which episode of Breaking Bad does Walter White become the bad guy? At what point or points does Walt make the jump from terminally-ill-guy-acting-out-of-necessity to something more sinister?
Walt became the bad guy in season 1, episode 1. Walt poisons those two dealers who caught Jesse selling meth and ask to see their lab. I'd say that was a "bad" moment there. 1.1k Views
