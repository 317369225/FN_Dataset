Aspie Quiz versus Autism Quotient: If you've taken the 150-question Aspie Quiz how do your composite scores compare with the 50-item AQ?
My neurodiverse score was 165/200 My neurotypical score was 51/200. My AQ test score was 42. According to these tests, I am very highly likely to be an Aspie (or ASD as I suppose it is called now). I believe this is correct. I have not yet sought a formal diagnosis of ASD. I do have a diagnosis of ADHD. 862 Views
