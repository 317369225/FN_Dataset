How do I choose the right job?
The right job chooses you. It is like the wand in Harry Potter that chooses its wizard. I am kidding, but there is a grain of truth. You can only evaluate a job by doing it. You can filter most jobs by their portrayals in writing and public image. But you still need to experience jobs. And not only generic name, but the particular company and team. This tests a job in its most important criterion, the people and environment. 85 Views
