How does D-Wave system design their processor core?
I will give the brief overview what they are doing  in Layman's language about the principle it is based on. The answer doesn't include anything related to hardware manufacturing. D-wave quantum computer is based on adiabatic quantum computing. Here is a brief overview of AQC. In adiabatic quantum computation, the quantum computer remains forever in the ground state of quantum system throughout the computation. The method is extensively used in optimization problems(D-wave functionality)  and large number of the computationally hard problems can be formulated as optimization problems.The ... (more)
