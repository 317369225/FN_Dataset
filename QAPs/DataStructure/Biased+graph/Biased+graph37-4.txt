What do people think of the TensorFlow sucks article?
It is the decision to still code in TensorFlow directly which sucks, so I think the author is mistaken. So, one should rather code using TensorFlow as back-end if that’s really what is preferred, and instead directly code mostly with the preferred API, which is Keras. With this you can cover a majority of production and research cases. And in the rare cases you need to do more precise custom work, then you can hook pure TensorFlow code within your Keras programs (or use other back-ends/libraries if necessary). 279 Views · 2 Upvotes
