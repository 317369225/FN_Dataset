What are the concise meaning and interpretation of bias and variance in machine learning and statistics?
Graphical interpretation of Bias - Variance. Let’s understand this image. This is bull’s eye diagram. Assume that center of the target(Red colored) is a model that perfectly predict the correct values. As we move away from the bull’s eye, our prediction goes worse. Imagine we can repeat our entire model building process to get a number of separate hits on the target. Each hit represents an individual realization of our model, given the chance variability in the training data we gather. Sometimes we will get a good distribution of training data so we predict very well and we are close to the ... (more)
