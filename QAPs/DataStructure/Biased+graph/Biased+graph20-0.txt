How does D-Wave system design their processor core?
Good question. There are two parts to this. The first is the actual hardware stuff they use for building qubits, controlling them, controlling and maintaining the entanglement, noise control (thermal and magnetic) and cooling. These are things I don't know much about, but here are some quick references: [1004.1628] Experimental Investigation of an Eight Qubit Unit Cell in a Superconducting Optimization Processor [0907.3757] A scalable control system for a superconducting adiabatic quantum optimization processor [0909.4321] Experimental Demonstration of a Robust and Scalable Flux Qubit ...
