Where does the output characteristic of BJT show the transistor in saturation?
You asked.. "For a given Ib, wouldn't the Ic value just trace the blue line for whatever value of Vce from start zero to Vce max?" the answer is NO. We have to notice that Ic value traces the line only when "Vbe" is maintained such that  EB junction is forward and BC junction is reverse biased(precisely the condition for the active region).  On the other hand if Vbe is such that both EB and BC are forward biased the Ic value for that particular Vce will be greater than corresponding value on the blue line (thus entering into saturation) Bottom line is  whether the BJT is in saturation or n...
