What are some of the best algorithms?
It's not an algorithm in strictest of sense, but I think Artificial neural network deserve a mention. At it's simplest form, it can recognize your handwriting or fly a smarter quad.[1] As you make it deeper, it starts doing much harder things like beating the best contestants in Jeopardy.[2] If someday we end up making a machine smart enough to trigger a technological singularity, some variant of neural network will be at the heart of it. Basically, we're playing God here, and it has the potential to decide humanity's fate. Footnotes [1] The Astounding Athletic Power of Quadcopters | Raffaello D'Andrea | TED Talks [2] ... (more)
