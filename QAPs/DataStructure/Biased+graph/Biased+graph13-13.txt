Are Marvel fans inflating movie reviews on IMDb? I was going through reviews of recent releases of both DC and Marvel. I saw a trend whereby Marvel movie reviews tend to be extremely positive while DC is on the other side.
I donâ€™t think so, it may be that or DC fans not reviewing as much as Marvel. Marvel fans can be more active than DC fans so Marvel Movies can get more reviews. 58 Views
