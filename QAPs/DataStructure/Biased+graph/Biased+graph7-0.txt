Any graphs of survivorship bias-free S&P 500?
Your question makes an assumption that is incorrect.  The S&P 500 does not have survivorship bias, so it is already survivorship bias free.  Yes it drops companies (often the "worst" ones as you put it), but in doing so it retains the performance of those poor companies until the date that it drops them.  Thus the historical returns you see for the S&P 500 from any of the many free sources online, already contain all the performance of the many failed companies that have been included in the index throughout time.  For example, the performance of the S&P 500 in 2008 includes that of Lehman Brothers right up until its bankruptcy in September.  Per this link: S&P 500 to drop Lehman Brothers, add Harris  you can see that Lehman was dropped on Sep 16, 2008, the day after it's bankruptcy, and replaced with Harris. 628 Views · 2 Upvotes
