Considering the massive distance between the Earth and the Sun, how come a slight tilt is enough to change Earth's atmosphere during different seasons?
Imagine a beam of sunlight 1 meter x 1 meter wide coming from the sun. Let’s ignore the axial tilt of the Earth for a moment… At mid-day at the equator. It hits the ground from right overhead - at an angle of 90 degrees…and lights up a 1m x 1m patch of ground. Now imagine that same beam of sunlight hitting the ground somewhere at mid-day in the northern part of the world…say New York (40 degrees latitude). Now it’s not hitting the ground at 90 degrees - but at an angle of about 50 degrees (90 minus 40). As the beam of light hits the ground at a shallower angle, it’s no longer covering a 1m x 1m...
