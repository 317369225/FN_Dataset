How can intelligent people be gullible?
One can be very intelligent and not street smart. And the bad guys use psychology and bank on our greed and desires. For instance, you (the intelligent guy) always admired the Rolex watches. Their average prices range from 10,000 dollars ro 50,000. Now a colleague of yours at the office says he can have them half-price through a friend who works there. What are you, the intelligent man, going to do? Tell the colleague: “no thanks, I have a very elegant Timex for 65 dollars?” Or “thanks the time comes on my phone anyway?” Or ask the guy a question, which is the start of getting conned? 221 Views · 2 Upvotes · Answer requested by Olaoluwapo Williams
