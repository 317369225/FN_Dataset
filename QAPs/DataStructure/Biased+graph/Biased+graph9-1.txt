What are the advantages of using BFS over DFS or using DFS over BFS? What are the applications and downsides of each?
It depends on the problem you want to solve. DFS uses stack data structure to process the nodes while BFS uses Queue data structure. DFS is more memory efficient since it stores number of nodes at max the height of the DFS tree in the stack while BFS stores every adjacent nodes it process in the queue. Both of them has the same time complexity of traversal which is O(|V| + |E|). Applications of DFS: Finding Connected Components of the graph. Linear ordering of the graph using Topological Sorting ( useful in solving dependency problems ). Finding Strongly Connected Components. Solving maze proble... (more)
