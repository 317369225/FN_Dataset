Where can I find examples of a U-Squared distribution?
The bathtub curve which models electronic device failure (like hard drives) is a classic U-shaped distribution, marking the prevalence 0f early life failures and end-of-lifespan failures.  The disk drive industry uses this model heavily. I've never heard of a "U-squared" distribution.  It really makes no sense at all since U is not a variable in this case, but a shape. The only $FOO-squared distributions in common use are Chi-squared and T-squared, and neither bunches at the limits.  Maybe they are trying to coin a new phrase? 1.6k Views · 5 Upvotes
