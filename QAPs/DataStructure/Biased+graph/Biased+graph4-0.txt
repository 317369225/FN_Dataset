Considering the massive distance between the Earth and the Sun, how come a slight tilt is enough to change Earth's atmosphere during different seasons?
Because A: It’s a 23 degree tilt, not a “slight tilt” and because B: that tilt greatly affects the number of hours of daylight received by different latitudes throughout the year, as well as how directly they do so. * P.S. for my Aussie friends, sorry for the north-biased graph. 5.1k Views · 298 Upvotes · Answer requested by Thomas Vetz
