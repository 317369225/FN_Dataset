What is the intuitive explanation of power law distributions?
The "power law" does not refer to a misconception that "whoever has power will rule," but rather it refers to a particular way of characterizing dependency between two quantities. When the number or frequency of an object or event varies as a power of some attribute of that object (e.g., its size), the number or frequency is said to follow a power law. In more general terms, there exists a power law relationship between x and y if y is growing or reducing polynomially when x is growing linearly (y ? xâ€“a). Mathematically speaking, this means that the relationship between y and x is mainly ch... (more)
