What kind of programmer will be in shortage in the future?
I didn't find an answer I liked, so I'm giving a different spin. Given that a) the world's population is increasing faster than ever and b) longevity is also expected to increase. Then it follows that in any industry or topic that you're "passionate" about and addresses or supports those global issues WILL have a large demand. I answer this broadly this because passion and solving a need is determinant... but there are many needs and each of us have their own passion to follow. 2.3k Views Â· 1 Upvote
