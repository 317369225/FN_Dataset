What's the difference between conservatives watching FOX News and liberals watching CBS/NBC/ABC/CNN/MSNBC news? Why are liberal biased stations okay but not conservative ones?
Just look at the question. According to the OP, five different major news outlets, three of which have been around since there were only three channels, are all liberally biased. Now what would Occam’s Razor say? That all of those channels, owned by major corporations, corporations whose management is largely conservative, are liberally biased? Or is it a more simple explanation that the OP, along with the echo chamber (s)he resides in, is conservatively biased, steeped in the lies of Fox News, and couldn’t recognize factual reporting if it bit them on their Drudge Report? 581 Views · 22 Upvotes
