What is an intuitive explanation for bias-variance tradeoff?
Let’s assume we are trying to classify people based on their traits. If we use a very simple model, say blonde hair and blue eyes, then we’ll severely underfit our model and incorrectly predict that several people with these traits match our target due to high bias. On the other hand, if we include too many variables, such as whether they were smiling, then there is a tendency for overfitting the model due to using a highly variable trait (high variance). Ideally, we want to minimize both bias and variance and have our model not favor one over the other. There are ways to test for this, but u... (more)
