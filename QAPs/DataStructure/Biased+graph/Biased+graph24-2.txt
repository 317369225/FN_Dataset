What graph topics should I study in order to be adequately prepared for a Google software engineer interview? Would it be worthwhile to also study algorithms for minimum spanning trees, maximum network flows, bipartite matching, etc.?
You should know breadth-first search and depth-first search. I have never seen anything about Dijkstra's algorithm asked. It'd be a pretty stupid question. First, very few interviewers would know it. It's not like they go home every night and re-read CLRS or whatever their algorithm book is. Second, it'd be way too hard. For candidates who were interviewing with me and finished a difficult question with some time to spare (that is, doing very well), I would ask them how to delete a node from a binary search tree. Only about 20% of candidates remembered this -- and this is of the really ... (more)
