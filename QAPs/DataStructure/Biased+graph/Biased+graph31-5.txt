Is there any reason not to use OrientDB? Is there any reason to opt for MongoDB or Neo4j?
I am in favour of OrientDB, I am building a product based on 3.0 and yes it was like working with bleeding edge technology, we did had bugs but the team at OrientDB is amazing and always resolved issues faster than we reported.

Supports out of the box clustering supports most of the SQL (Neo4J we are forced to use cipher). Embedded mode works the best. Sequences (no support in Neo4J).... (more)
