What websites do I need when I'm in high school?
For Literature, Sparknotes and Shmoop are vital. If you don’t want to read a book you can get most of the details there, and even if you do read it, they definitely give you more clarity. For math, WolframAlpha and Mathway are the best sites for homework help and will give you solved versions of your homework questions. For science and history, CrashCourse has the best videos explaining basically any topic you could be learning about. 213 Views · 2 Upvotes
