How can intelligent people be gullible?
Intelligence does not make you street-wise and to question everything before accepting it. Some intelligent people only really apply their intelligence to their areas of interest and sort of go with the flow in other areas. BTW, did you know that the word "gullible" is not even included in the Oxford Dictionary's pocket version? ;-) 161 Views · 2 Upvotes · Answer requested by Olaoluwapo Williams
