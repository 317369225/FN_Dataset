How does D-Wave system design their processor core?
It's not clear that they're doing ANYTHING. They're kind of in a corporate superposition of states-- they may be honestly trying to make a quantum computer, they may be honestly getting answers, or it could be partial or total self-delusion or fakery. What you need for even a small shot at a quantum computer is to be able to entangle a fair number of quits, say 16 to 32 would be a good start. But D-wave is very sketchy about exactly how many quits they juggle, and how many at ay one time, and how connected they are.   One would think if they WERE able to juggle a reasonable number of the...
