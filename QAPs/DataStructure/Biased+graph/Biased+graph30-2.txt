What are some of the best algorithms?
Reservoir sampling Let's say you have an array of n elements, and you want to pick a random element from the array.  This is easy - choose each element with probability 1/n. But say you receive the elements one at a time, and you don't know how many elements there are going to be.  How would you do it then?  You don't know what n is, so you can't pick each element with probability 1/n.  In theory you could wait for all the elements to come and then do what you did before.  But the stream could be very long, making this infeasible.  We want a solution where you don't store elements and you...
