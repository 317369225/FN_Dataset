Considering the massive distance between the Earth and the Sun, how come a slight tilt is enough to change Earth's atmosphere during different seasons?
It’s not the distance, it’s the angle. Imagine a large object radiating particles toward a patch in the distance which is perpendicular to it. Then imagine tilting that patch 45 degrees. Even without serious math it becomes clear that the number of particles impacting the tilted patch is much smaller because the surface area presented - it would be the size of a perpenicular patch the height of which is that of a side of a right triangle of which the height of the original patch is the hypotenuse - is significantly smaller than that of the patch perpendicular to the radiating object.
