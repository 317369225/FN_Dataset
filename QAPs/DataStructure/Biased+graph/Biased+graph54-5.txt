Which cognitive bias do you struggle most with?
I am still “struggling” with substantiality a bit. You may call it a tendency to “freeze” the fleeting experience and turn it in mind into a fixed entity, solid, relatively unchanging - an object suitable for study and analysis. I am constantly reminded by the experience that substantiality is only an illusion that arises in imagination, but that illusion periodically gets convincing enough to form an emotional attachment to it. 131 Views · 3 Upvotes · Answer requested by Pete Ashly
