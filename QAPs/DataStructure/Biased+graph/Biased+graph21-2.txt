What tools do data scientists use for professional presentations (e.g. diagrams, graphs, flow charts, etc.)?
I'm going to write a Windows version of William Chen's great Mac answer: Presentations: Microsoft PowerPoint Diagrams: Microsoft Visio (I haven't found any Windows diagram software that is as powerful) Graphs: depending on the language I'm working on: MATLAB (since R2014b the default graphs look OK, otherwise need to be beautified), Matplotlib (Python), or ggplot2 (R). For all those software, using the latest versions is better (more features, and sometimes better graphics). 9k Views Â· 40 Upvotes
