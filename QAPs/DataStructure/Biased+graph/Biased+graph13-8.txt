Are Marvel fans inflating movie reviews on IMDb? I was going through reviews of recent releases of both DC and Marvel. I saw a trend whereby Marvel movie reviews tend to be extremely positive while DC is on the other side.
This whole Marvel v DC movie thing is so stupidly childish that I can’t even…I mean, why can’t people enjoy both? Having said that, the latest crop of DC movies have been pretty terrible, while Marvel continues to make good movies. It’s all down to personal preference, but objectively speaking, you’d have to think Marvel is doing a better job right now, inflated reviews or not. 110 Views · 5 Upvotes
