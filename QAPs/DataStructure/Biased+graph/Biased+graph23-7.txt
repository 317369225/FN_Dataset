Why do overfit models have high variance but low bias?
It is all in the definition. Let’s look at it from the view point of statistics(will keep probability out of this) keeping the “linguistics” aside. Lets see a simplified version of a couple of definitions: Population: The entire universe of data. Sample: A subset of population used for experiments Mapping this to Machine Learning, Population: Consider the set of all possible models trained. This set of all models is a result of a set of all possible training data set and a modelling function. There is one to one correspondence between model and data set. Essentially, our population is the set of data sets. ... (more)
