In which episode of Breaking Bad does Walter White become the bad guy? At what point or points does Walt make the jump from terminally-ill-guy-acting-out-of-necessity to something more sinister?
I'm not sure when he makes a moral choice that defines him as 'bad', but its fairly early when he stops being, as stated, the "terminally ill guy acting out of necessity". Season one, episode five. He's offered a full ride, free of strings, from an old friend. He turns him down out of pride. He makes the shift from 'terminally ill guy acting out of necessity' to 'terminally ill guy who has found a purpose and self-esteem in cooking meth'. Everything that happens thereafter is a result of Walt choosing pride, and meth-cooking, over the money from his friend. 4.7k Views Â· 22 Upvotes
