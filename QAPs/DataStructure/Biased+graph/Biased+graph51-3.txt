What is the coolest thing you can do with Mathematica?
Some cool things mathematica can do that I've used: 1. Automatic code generation. Mathematica's symbolic manipulation tools mean that I can write a high-level description of a differential equation system in it, feed my mathematica code to this program, called Kranc: About Kranc, and generate optimized C code that numerically solves the system. I didn't write Kranc, but I use it regularly in my research. 2. Solve for the amplitude of a quantum field in an inflationary spacetime: Yurlungur / QFTToy - Bitbucket. I wrote this bit of code and its a bit rough around the edges. It was for a fin... (more)
