Which cognitive bias do you struggle most with?
The cognitive bias I, and I think most people, struggle with most is here-and-nowism — that is, living in the present moment (and a small subset of it, at that) — ignorant of history and change, distant events, future possibilities, even significant adjacent possibilities in the present time and place. 199 Views · 5 Upvotes · Answer requested by Pete Ashly
