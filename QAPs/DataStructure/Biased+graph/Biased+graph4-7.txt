Considering the massive distance between the Earth and the Sun, how come a slight tilt is enough to change Earth's atmosphere during different seasons?
Because the distance is pretty irrelevant here. Tilt is ratiometric in that it reduces the solar irradiance in proportion to the cosine of the tilt plus latitude, independent of distance to the sun. At noon, the solar irradiance per square mile can be much lower than at the latitude directly facing the sun. At high enough latitude (inside the arctic/antarctic circles), the irradiance can fall to zero. Thatâ€™s the effect on sunlight when exposed. An important secondary effect is that the land receives this sunlight for a shorter percentage of time. Again, within the arctic/antarctic circles, th... (more)
