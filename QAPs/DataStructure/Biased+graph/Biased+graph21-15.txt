What tools do data scientists use for professional presentations (e.g. diagrams, graphs, flow charts, etc.)?

These objects stay 'live' and can be refreshed or filtered even during the presentation - pretty impressive for the audience working on live data (even Big Data) within a presentation...   It requires a LASR In-memory server in the back, though. 1.1k Views · 1 Upvote
