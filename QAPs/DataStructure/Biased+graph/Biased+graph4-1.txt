Considering the massive distance between the Earth and the Sun, how come a slight tilt is enough to change Earth's atmosphere during different seasons?
Considering the massive distance between Earth and Sun, how come the slight tilt is enough to change it's atmosphere during different seasons? The great thing about the massive distance is that we can view the sun’s rays as being parallel. This makes the trigonometry a lot easier. What we basically want to know is how much the sun’s ray is spread out in winter and in summer. If we put up a frame, one meter square, at right angle at the sun at that time, how much ground will be framed by that frame? We want to know the length of the side c in a triangle ABC, where the side a is 1 meter, the an... (more)
