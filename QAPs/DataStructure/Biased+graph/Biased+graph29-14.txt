What are 20 questions to detect fake data scientists? The answers should contain math formulas or a few lines of code, not just vague generalizations.
Someone who fakes it till they make it, and hasn’t quite made it… This is really an ill formed question. The single best computational thinker I know would fail a test if asked to use a few lines of code to express anything but the most simple formulas.
