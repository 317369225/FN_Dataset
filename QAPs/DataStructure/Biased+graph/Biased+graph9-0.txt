What are the advantages of using BFS over DFS or using DFS over BFS? What are the applications and downsides of each?
For their most basic use (i.e., finding the connected components of an undirected graph), depth first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are interchangeable. In some languages, a BFS is a slightly better choice because the most simple implementation of DFS is recursive, which introduces an overhead, and also might cause your code to hit the stack size limit for large graphs. The obvious advantage (and application) of BFS is that in unweighted graphs it can be used to construct a shortest path from u to v. This has numerous applications -- for example, you can compute the smallest... (more)
