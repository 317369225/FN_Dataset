Which PhD offer should I accept, Computer Science or Operations Research? My research interests are in (combinatorial) optimization, graph algorithms, network flows, and algorithmic game theory (which overlap between both fields).
Two options. Choose by faculty/research group instead of ranking. Rankings are useless. It's entirely possible that a top 5 OR group is equivalent to a top 20 CS group in some metric, maybe # of faculty produced or maybe placement rate into top industry positions. I would consider what metric matters the most to you, and compare them that way. From another perspective, I just want to say CS. You would have much more flexibility by going into CS than you would in OR. If you do want to explore new areas, you would have much more flexibility. Finally, given the number of good departments in CS... (more)
