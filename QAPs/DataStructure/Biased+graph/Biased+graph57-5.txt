Where can I find examples of a U-Squared distribution?
A common U-Shaped distribution used by life actuaries is the "curve of deaths" i.e. probability of death as a a function of age. Up until the first half of the 20th century, the highest probability of death occurred during the first few months of life; the second highest probability of death occurred during old age. However in the second half of the 20th century, these have swapped and dying of old age is now more common. Still, the probability of dying at either age 1 month or 70 years old is much larger than the probability of dying at 40 years old. Information Matrix 969 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
