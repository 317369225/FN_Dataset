Why do Trump supporters (81%) feel life is worse for them today than it would have been 50 years ago?
I’m 68 years old. For me personally 50 years ago was pretty darn good. I didn’t have to work. I didn’t have have to pay for food, clothes or housing. School was mostly a social event. I had summers off to dance, play tennis, fish and troll for girls. That’s what I remember. There was plenty of bad going on. Big things like race riots and the cold war (I’m from Oak Ridge, TN) and sorta small things: In 1965, 26 states prohibited birth control for unmarried women. The fact is most people remember the good things and forget the bad. 866 Views · 16 Upvotes
