What tools do data scientists use for professional presentations (e.g. diagrams, graphs, flow charts, etc.)?
I'm not a data scientist, but I do think that Prezi is a really cool presentation platform. It breaks out of the "slide" format and offers you a canvas on which you can arrange your information in whatever way you want. You set anchor points that dictate what order your pieces are shown and it's all available on the cloud - log in to your Prezi account from any computer and present. You can also  share links to your presentations (these are staff picks, not mine): Online Integrated Marketing Strategy Small Business Saturday Prezi Khan Academy: Math Tutoring Made Simple 1.2k Views · 5 Upvotes
