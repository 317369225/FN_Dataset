What are the advantages of using BFS over DFS or using DFS over BFS? What are the applications and downsides of each?
While the decision depends heavily on the use-case, search-space and search target distribution, following two ideas work great as a seed for deciding between the two. 1. If search target distribution is frequent in the search-space, DFS should perform better and vice-versa. 2. If search target is concentrated more near the root and not very deep, BFS should perform better and vice-versa. You could always take a middle ground and choose to go with Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (aka IDDFS), which in some sense, mixes the positive points of both the method (DFS - memory efficient, B...
