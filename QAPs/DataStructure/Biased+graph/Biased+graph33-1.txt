Which PhD offer should I accept, Computer Science or Operations Research? My research interests are in (combinatorial) optimization, graph algorithms, network flows, and algorithmic game theory (which overlap between both fields).
Its quite surprising that I have been asked to answer this, since I am still in the process of getting a PhD. Yet, I will give my opinion based on my observations. It highly depends on how strong you think your research interests are. Most undergraduates change their area of research after entering graduate school. Hence, being in Computer Science department will lead to different opportunities as opposed to being in Operations Research department in case you choose to change your research area. Even within the interests you have mentioned, usually the areas of focus tend to be slightly diff... (more)
