Is there any reason not to use OrientDB? Is there any reason to opt for MongoDB or Neo4j?
Hard to say. It seem more robust and scalable comparing to Mongo and solid graph capability is a nice add-on for some use cases. I would suggest to benchmark it for the specific implementation and see if it is good for the specific use case. Sometimes "Better" does not means good. 11.7k Views · 3 Upvotes · Answer requested by Ben Baert
