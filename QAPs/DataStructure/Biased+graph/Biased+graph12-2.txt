What is an intuitive explanation for bias-variance tradeoff?
In order to understand Bias- Variance trade-off, it is necessary to know the types of error. There are two types of error; Reducible error and Irreducible error. Reducible error comprises of bias error and variance error. If we reduce either bias error or variance error or both, we can reduce the reducible error. The irreducible error is due to inherent variability in the system. It cannot be reduced by any algorithm.
