What is the most exciting new research in mathematics? What do mathematicians find exciting nowadays?
The answer is of course subjective, but depends as well on what we mean here by "Math". Machine learning would not I think normally be referred to as a branch of mathematics, but rather as an applied field, or even a commercial business, that uses statistics, graph theory, and linear algebra for starters. But having said all that I believe an exciting "applied" math field is computational data analysis using topology. The idea here is to take high dimensional data and characterize its topological properties as a means of discovery heretofore hidden relationships. 2.4k Views Â· 6 Upvotes
