What does your answer Quora pie graph look like?
I'd be interested in knowing how it works.  I think there must be a lot of duplication that makes it a bit misleading. For example, I would expect that most of the 8% for ISS also shows up under NASA.  The net result - space stuff is exaggerated and topics like Marvel Comics are artificially shrunken. 6.8k Views · 178 Upvotes · Answer requested by Jon Davis
