Considering the massive distance between the Earth and the Sun, how come a slight tilt is enough to change Earth's atmosphere during different seasons?
Because the tilt exposes more of one hemispshere to the sun than the other. At the equator, where the sun shines all the time, it is always warm. but as you get further away it will cool in the hemisphere that is not exposed to the sun. You get far enough away from the equator and you have ice all the time (Arctic and Antarctic) 52 Views
