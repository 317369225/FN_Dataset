What is the coolest thing you can do with Mathematica?
I'd second Jonah Miller's point about automatic code generation. I inherited some Matlab code that simulated the dynamics of a quadruple pendulum that was to be used as the final stage of the vibration isolation system for Advanced LIGO. Using some Mathematica code I'd already written for a similar project, I created an equivalent model to check the Matlab against. Later I threw together a simple Matlab export package and entirely replaced the innards of the Matlab code with stuff exported from Mathematica. That way I was able to make improvements on the Mathematica side, where it was easie... (more)
