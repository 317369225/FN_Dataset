Are Marvel fans inflating movie reviews on IMDb? I was going through reviews of recent releases of both DC and Marvel. I saw a trend whereby Marvel movie reviews tend to be extremely positive while DC is on the other side.
it’s not inflating. It’s the actually number of fans. And the movies tend to be upbeat, so why not upbeat fans? DC makes downer movies, so downer fans. Or maybe they are just more critical. Superman is an icon of hope. Maybe they should have made a hopeful movie? Batman has been dark since the dark knight and in his case it was a nice change of pace from gay, campy batman. Green Lantern tried to do to many stories in one movie. They jumped from origin story to Paralax. Too much. DC’s Wonder Woman is doing pretty well, but it was kinda upbeat.
