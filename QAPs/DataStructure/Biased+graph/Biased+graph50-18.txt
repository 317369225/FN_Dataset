In which episode of Breaking Bad does Walter White become the bad guy? At what point or points does Walt make the jump from terminally-ill-guy-acting-out-of-necessity to something more sinister?
I think most would agree this occurs in the last episode of Season 4 when Walt risks Brock's life to secure Jessie's loyalty. Brock is probably one of four blameless parties (the other three being Walt Jr., Holly, and Mike's granddaughter), and the only one Walt consideres a mitigating risk. To back this up, Jessie's initial, and correct suspicion creates the first real point of friction between them, notibly changing Walt's strategy for the relationship from a business partnership to a psuedo-"father/son" thing. 1.4k Views Â· 3 Upvotes
