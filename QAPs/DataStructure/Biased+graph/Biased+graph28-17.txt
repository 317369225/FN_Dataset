What is an assumption that people often wrongly make?
Cognitive dissonance   My girlfriend splits up with me. "Ah, good thing I didn't marry her and end up in a divorce."   My wife splits up with me. "Ah, good thing we don't have children yet. Could've been far more stickier."   My wife who I have children with splits up with me. "Ah, good thing I'm not too old to remain single for the rest of my life." 401 Views · 6 Upvotes
