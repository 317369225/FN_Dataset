Why do Trump supporters (81%) feel life is worse for them today than it would have been 50 years ago?
They are either delusional or they are answering a different question. Life was worse for just about everyone - even heterosexual, poorly educated Christian men - 50 years ago. Medicine, technology, entertainment, transportation are all much better and, despite perceptions, crime is lower. Internationally, Mao and Stalin are dead. People are probably answering a different question: How was your life compared to that of other people? 4.8k Views · 134 Upvotes · Answer requested by Logan Webb
