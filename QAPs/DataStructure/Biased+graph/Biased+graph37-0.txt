It’s a framework that is high-level but feels low-level. Ideally, you want both rapid prototyping and fine-grained control. Usually you can have one, but not the other. In TF, you get neither. So you resort to APIs on top of it, like Keras. But if you have to go that route it’s a pretty clear sign that something is not right. The main argument for TF’s static graph computational model is performance, but benchmarks have shown... (more)
