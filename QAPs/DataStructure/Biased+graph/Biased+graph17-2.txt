What are the concise meaning and interpretation of bias and variance in machine learning and statistics?
Michael Hochster gave a good technical answer; more informally: Suppose you have two bathroom scales. Suppose you weigh yourself on a balance scale (gold standard) and find you weigh 80 kg.

Scale 2 is unbiased but has high variance.... (more)
