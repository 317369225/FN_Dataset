Why do overfit models have high variance but low bias?
A simple way to “fix” your understanding would be to say that, “linguistically”, the underfitting models are biased “away” from training data. It might be better, however, to rely on a slightly deeper understanding than plain linguistic intuition here, so bear with me for a couple of paragraphs. The terms “bias” and “variance” do not describe a single trained model. Instead, they are meant to describe the space of possible models among which you will be picking your fit, as well as the method you will use to select this best fit. No matter what space and method you choose, the model that you f... (more)
