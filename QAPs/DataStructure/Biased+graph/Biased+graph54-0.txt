Which cognitive bias do you struggle most with?
There are many cognitive biases around. A nice guy made a nice graph of them and put it on wikipedia[1] : Just looking at this I consider the most apparent cognitive bias that I have no clue on which there are and which causes and solutions there are. I’d say I struggle with all of them from time to time and stating otherwise or trying to generalise some of the biases would be a cognitive bias itself.
