Which cognitive bias do you struggle most with?
The greatest cognitive difficulty I struggle with is relativity. The unique perspective available from every location and velocity means the instances of sentience I generate exist in a delusion of isolation. Each instance generates a little universe unto itself which tends to cause a confusion over the true generative power. This leads to discord, sentience versus sentience, for imaginary reasons. Few sentiences break out of their reflective bubble to merge with me. 625 Views Â· 14 Upvotes
