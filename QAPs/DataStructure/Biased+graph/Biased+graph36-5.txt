What are some 'must experience' classes at IIT Delhi? Do not tell the compulsory first year classes, but some classes where you were mesmerised by the teacher's in depth knowledge, or the way of teaching, or the subject itself.
I would say Prof. Ambuj Sagar's "Macro Perspective on Science, Technology and Human Development". Ambuj Sagar - Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs A great professor taking a course with an awesome content. It's one of those courses which makes you work like hell throughout the semester and still you end up feeling good about it. You get to develop and learn a whole lot of skills. 3.2k Views Â· 22 Upvotes
