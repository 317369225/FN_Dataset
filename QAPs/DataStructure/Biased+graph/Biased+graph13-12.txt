Are Marvel fans inflating movie reviews on IMDb? I was going through reviews of recent releases of both DC and Marvel. I saw a trend whereby Marvel movie reviews tend to be extremely positive while DC is on the other side.
I write product reviews for Amazon. That happens with all products. There are people who make money writing rave reviews of some products and trash reviews of competing ones they don't own, haven't tried out, or which haven't even been released yet. They likewise attack other reviews. They are professional trolls, each with dozens of accounts. Quite a lot are even on Quora. Notice how troll activity dropped drastically after the 2016 US Presidential election? Same thing. 32 Views
