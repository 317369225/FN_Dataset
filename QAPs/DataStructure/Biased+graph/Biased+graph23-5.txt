Why do overfit models have high variance but low bias?
Hi Zachary, An overfit model has a high variance because the model is trying to include not just the real data you should be concerned about but also the random noise that may be included in your data. The low bias is from the same effect, fitting to all the data which means there will be low bias relative to that particular data set. The thing you should be concentrating on, though, is that an overfit model is a BAD thing. It means the overfit model is too complex for your data. Here are some links to read about what overfit is and how to avoid it. Mintab blogs and user manual PDFs are very g... (more)
