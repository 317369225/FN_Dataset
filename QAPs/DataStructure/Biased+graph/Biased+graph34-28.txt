What's the difference between conservatives watching FOX News and liberals watching CBS/NBC/ABC/CNN/MSNBC news? Why are liberal biased stations okay but not conservative ones?
The difference is that fox “news” isn't actually classed as news, it's classed as entertainment. It has no obligation to be to any more factual than the X Files or The Walking Dead. Those other shows you mentioned are all officially registered providers of actual news, and are regulated. 46 Views · 2 Upvotes
