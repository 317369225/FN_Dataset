Why do Trump supporters (81%) feel life is worse for them today than it would have been 50 years ago?
Because when you are part of a privileged group living in an unfair system (50 years ago) and society evolves towards fairness and equal rights (today), you feel as if all you had is being taken away from you. For Trump supporters it is less about the economy and more about fear of social homogenization, what they perceive as the loss of American values and identity (white Christian America) in favor of a multicultural society where we respect our differences and work together to build better society. 131 Views Â· 3 Upvotes
