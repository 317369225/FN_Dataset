In which episode of Breaking Bad does Walter White become the bad guy? At what point or points does Walt make the jump from terminally-ill-guy-acting-out-of-necessity to something more sinister?
Some say that Phoenix (S2:E12) was the turning point, but I disagree. I was under the impression that Walt had a shred of humanity left, that he allowed his emotions to rule him in the spur of the moment. Personally, it was Face Off (S4:E13) that finally convinced me that Walter White had became the bad guy. The poisoning of Brock was nothing less than an utter loss of morality. He was irredeemable after that point, with Season 5 having him spiral out of control. 668 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
