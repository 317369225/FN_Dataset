In which episode of Breaking Bad does Walter White become the bad guy? At what point or points does Walt make the jump from terminally-ill-guy-acting-out-of-necessity to something more sinister?
I think an important aspect of the show is that there is no such thing as a good guy and a bad guy. The world isn't black and white (hence the ironic nature of Walt's surname), there are no "Good people" or "Bad People" there are just people who do things, some of them good and some of them bad and some of them driven by complex motivations that make it impossible to tell the difference. 3.7k Views Â· 46 Upvotes
