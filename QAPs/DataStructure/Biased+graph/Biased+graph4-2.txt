Considering the massive distance between the Earth and the Sun, how come a slight tilt is enough to change Earth's atmosphere during different seasons?
I am guessing the OP means temperature, not atmosphere in this question. Q: Considering the massive distance between Earth and Sun, how come the slight tilt is enough to change it's temperature during different seasons? It is not a slight tilt, it is a 23 degree tilt. Also the seasons are much more pronounced as you travel away from the equator. The latitude and the axial tilt work together to make the angle with respect to the Sun. At the North and South poles the highest the Sun ever gets in the sky is 23 degrees, that is midday on the Summer solstice and for 6 months of the year it is dark (night). 321 Views Â· 17 Upvotes
