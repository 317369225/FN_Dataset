What is an intuitive explanation for bias-variance tradeoff?
The lecture by Prof. Yaser from caltech gives a really intuitive explanation: The left part demonstrates a simple hypothesis set which is illustrated by a smaller circle and thus can be far from the goal f, i.e. it has a large bias. While the right part demonstrates a more complex hypothesis set that is illustrated by a larger circle and thus can be much close or even contains the goal f, but as the circle is large, you may end up anywhere in the circle, i.e. the variance is large.
