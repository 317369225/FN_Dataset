Why do overfit models have high variance but low bias?
What you’re missing is that the technical terms bias and variance are error measures based on average performance across possible training sets. You don’t talk about bias towards a particular data set; bias is the degree to which your prediction is wrong, on average, across all the possible training sets. This is what happens when you try to fit a line to data with underlying curvature. No matter how well you fit the line, your predictions will be off; this is the bias you get with underfitting. On the other hand, if you fit a cubic polynomial to data which is really linear, you won’t get the... (more)
