What are 20 questions to detect fake data scientists? The answers should contain math formulas or a few lines of code, not just vague generalizations.
It's tricky, because fake data science is such a large field. It depends on whether you want a candidate who can do fake machine learning or wish to concentrate more on fake data analysis. In the latter case, you may want different questions depending on whether you care more about analysis of fake data or fake analysis of real data. There are no simple answers. The best general strategy is to tailor your questions to the type of fake data science that most closely applies to what you need done. Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.
