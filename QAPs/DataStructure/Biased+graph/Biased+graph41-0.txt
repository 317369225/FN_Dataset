Where does the output characteristic of BJT show the transistor in saturation?
The saturation region just refers to the transistor being operated in the region denoted by the green patch on the left. In this region, Ic varies with Vce. This is as opposed to the blue active region where Ic stays constant even with varying Vce. So for your example of Vce = 1 V and Ib = 80 uA, Ic is indeed about 45 mA and the transistor running in saturation since this point is in the green region. The DC Load Line (Load line (electronics)) effectively shows the IV curve of a DC supply. Thus, if you were driving the transistor with a DC line, the intersection of the DC Load Line and the...
