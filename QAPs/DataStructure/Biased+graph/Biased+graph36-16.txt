What are some 'must experience' classes at IIT Delhi? Do not tell the compulsory first year classes, but some classes where you were mesmerised by the teacher's in depth knowledge, or the way of teaching, or the subject itself.
Ergonomics by Prof. Dinesh Mohan One of the best classes I have been to at IITD. Most of us who took up this class were final semester (8th) and to my surprise we have almost 80-90% attendance in class without any attendance requirements. This speaks a lot about the course and the teacher. Interesting topics were discussed - everything that I can relate to my life/surroundings. Many misconceptions got cleared like it's not life-saving to drink alcohol at -30 degree C (instead you are increasing your chances of dying)!!! This class was a perfect one to graduate! 1.7k Views Â· 5 Upvotes
