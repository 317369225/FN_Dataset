Will Islam take over India very soon?
No. It won't anytime soon. While, in my opinion, it is something that Muslims wish for, let us be honest that it's not something that is realistic. There are exceptions to everything. India is a beautiful land that lets believe in what they want to and it's because of this beauty why many feel safe here; to follow their religion, whatever it may be. I wish for all of us to live in harmony and not demean each other or call each other names. I'd like for Muslims to stop calling others Kaafirs and similarly others to stop calling Muslims terrorists. Peace and love to you, my dear brothers and sisters. 6.2k Views Â· 94 Upvotes
