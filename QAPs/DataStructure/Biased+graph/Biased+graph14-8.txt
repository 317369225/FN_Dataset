How do I choose the right job?
Originally Answered: How can I choose a job?What do you love to do? What is your passion? That is the primary criteria I use to decide what I want to work at. The more you love something the more you will enjoy doing it, and the more motivated you will be to get better at it. If you don't care about what you are doing, it's just work. If you care, then it's more than a job. It's a vocation, what you ARE. Search your heart. Do what you love. 2.4k Views Â· Answer requested by Michael Zhuang
