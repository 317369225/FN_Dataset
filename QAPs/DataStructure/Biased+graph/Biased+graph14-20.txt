Originally Answered: How should we make the right decisions for our career?Listen to your heart..! What do you really want to do? What you feel is best for you? Dont waste your time on thinking on it so much..! In life some decisions turn out to be right , some wrong! Right decision turns out to be good , you will achieve success! If you fail you learn a BIG lesson and be even more successful! Dont worry about mistakes so much..! As Einstein says " If you never made a mistake.Â  You never tried anything new ".. Love yourself and do what you feel is right! Be your best and leave on God ,the rest! Good luck! 102 Views
