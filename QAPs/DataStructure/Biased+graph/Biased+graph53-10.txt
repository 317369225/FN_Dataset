Aspie Quiz versus Autism Quotient: If you've taken the 150-question Aspie Quiz how do your composite scores compare with the 50-item AQ?
I would not even consider using that bloody test of Erikssons. It is even less psychometrically sound than the MBTI, and that is really badly unsound. The man doesn’t even define what ‘talent’ is. Talent, whatever it is, is definitely a multi-faceted thing with many properties. There’s absolutely nothing sound about that test at all. You’re all wasting your time using the thing. That man is an embarrassment to autistics. Because of the likes of him, the properly qualified autistics cannot get taken seriously. 474 Views · 1 Upvote
