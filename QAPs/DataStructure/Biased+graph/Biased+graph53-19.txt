Aspie Quiz versus Autism Quotient: If you've taken the 150-question Aspie Quiz how do your composite scores compare with the 50-item AQ?
I scored in the Asperger's range on the ASQ test, while this quiz said I had a mix of Aspie and Neurotypical skills.  I don't remember the exact numbers but I did save the chart. This quiz seems to do a better job noticing that my problems more likely stem from Social Anxiety Disorder than from Asperger's. 1.5k Views · 2 Upvotes
