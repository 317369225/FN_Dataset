How do I choose the right job?
Never ever run behind money! Money is an important part our lives and a strong reason for working is to earn, but do not let it be the only driving force for you. Experiment out! Sometimes people do not find the suitable job in a single shot but they keep changing. Do not settle until you found something that you wont mind doing the rest of your life. If you’re struck at a wrong profession find out ways to do something new, something different. Let your interest and passion be the driving force.
