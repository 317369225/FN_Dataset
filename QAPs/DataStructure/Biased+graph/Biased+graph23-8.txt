Why do overfit models have high variance but low bias?
Assume that the appropriate linear model for Y involves 4 explanatory variables X!, X2, X3 and X4. If one of the explanatory variables is omitted and it is correlated with any of the other 3 then the the regression coefficients are biased. (I am assuming that the variables are stochastic. If you include a 5th variable X5 in the OLS estimate the estimated of the residual variance will be reduced. The out of sample estimate of Y will be biased by the inclusion of the effect of the extra variable in the out of sample estimate, Thus over fit variables out of sample have, in a certain sense low v...
