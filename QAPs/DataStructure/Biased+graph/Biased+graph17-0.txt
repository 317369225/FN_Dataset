What are the concise meaning and interpretation of bias and variance in machine learning and statistics?
In supervised machine learning, we train our model on a limited data sample (that is available), but the tricky part is that our aim is not to optimize on this sample but rather to be able to generalize our predictions to the unseen data. This is captured by the generalization error, which is the expected error on all examples including those outside the small training sample. This generalization error is of two kinds - one arising out of bias and the other out of variance. The model that we use for our learning task may be a very simple one that is incapable of modelling the complex relat... (more)
