Are Marvel fans inflating movie reviews on IMDb? I was going through reviews of recent releases of both DC and Marvel. I saw a trend whereby Marvel movie reviews tend to be extremely positive while DC is on the other side.
For sure there is inflation but the DC movies still haven't been too good. When I go to look at upcoming movies on IMDb, the Marvel movies have five star ratings two years in advanced. It's pretty stupid but oh well. 77 Views Â· 3 Upvotes
