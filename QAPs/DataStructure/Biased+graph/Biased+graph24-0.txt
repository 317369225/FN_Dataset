What graph topics should I study in order to be adequately prepared for a Google software engineer interview? Would it be worthwhile to also study algorithms for minimum spanning trees, maximum network flows, bipartite matching, etc.?
As other people mentioned the two popular graph traversals are very important just because they have so many useful applications in real-life work. However, it's not just about knowing the algorithms. For graphs, it's super important to be familiar with the possible representations. Some that come to mind are: 1) A matrix where rows and columns correspond to nodes and in cell (i,j) there is a value representing if there is an edge between nodes i and j, and potentially showing the weight of this edge 2) List of neighbors for each node 3) List of edges in the graph 4) I challenge you to th...
