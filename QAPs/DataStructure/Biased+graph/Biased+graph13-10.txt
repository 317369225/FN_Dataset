Are Marvel fans inflating movie reviews on IMDb? I was going through reviews of recent releases of both DC and Marvel. I saw a trend whereby Marvel movie reviews tend to be extremely positive while DC is on the other side.
No, DCU movies are just that much worse (with apologies to WW, which was great, and Man of Steel, which was not terrible). Seriously, go watch them. They are so bad. 50 Views Â· 6 Upvotes
