What are some 'must experience' classes at IIT Delhi? Do not tell the compulsory first year classes, but some classes where you were mesmerised by the teacher's in depth knowledge, or the way of teaching, or the subject itself.
In addition to the courses already mentioned, I would like to add Numerical and Scientific Computing by Prof. Amit Kumar. It was a great learning experience, one of the courses where I learnt the most. Almost every class taught you something new and you could not afford to divert yourself while he taught, for the fear of missing out on something really exciting. 7.7k Views Â· 22 Upvotes
