What are some 'must experience' classes at IIT Delhi? Do not tell the compulsory first year classes, but some classes where you were mesmerised by the teacher's in depth knowledge, or the way of teaching, or the subject itself.
During my stay from 2000-2004 in Iit Delhi I was really impressed with 1) chemistry (organic) by Nalin Pant.. One of the greatest teacher in my opinion 2) Electromechanics by Sanjay Roy ... I think he left Iit Delhi 3) circuit theory by S C Dutta Roy.. You can see his videos on NPTEL. SEE HIS CIRCUIT THEORY, DSP AND SIGNALS ANS SYSTEMS VIDEOS 4) Communication systems by Surendra Prasad... Even these video lectures are put in NPTEL. 2.1k Views Â· 6 Upvotes
