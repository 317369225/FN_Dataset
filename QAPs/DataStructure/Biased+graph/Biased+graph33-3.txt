Which PhD offer should I accept, Computer Science or Operations Research? My research interests are in (combinatorial) optimization, graph algorithms, network flows, and algorithmic game theory (which overlap between both fields).
It depends on your choice/ interest, subject doesn't matter it may be anything. Phd in any topic matters a lot.Â  Do with dedication and involvement. 77 Views
