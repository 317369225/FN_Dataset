What does your answer Quora pie graph look like?
Predictably, it is heavy on the crust and light on the filling: Politics, IR, USA... Topics subject to considerable editorial slant (at least, when I write about them). The ones that I actually know anything about--healthcare, finance, drugs--are stuck in the 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock range. Oddly enough, "sharting", "fisting" and "the Portuguese snowblower" appear nowhere in this pie chart, notwithstanding Bianca, Ben and Leonard's dogged efforts to drag my sterling reputation into the depths of lechery. BTW: Happy Thanksgiving y'all! I am grateful for Quora and Quorans. 1.3k Views Â· 60 Upvotes
