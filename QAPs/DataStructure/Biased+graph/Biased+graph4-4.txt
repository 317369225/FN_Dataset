Considering the massive distance between the Earth and the Sun, how come a slight tilt is enough to change Earth's atmosphere during different seasons?
It's not a slight tilt really- it's a 47° difference between Summer and Winter Solstices. That's quite a bit. Anything under a 90° overhead sun, the rays are at an oblique angle to earth. The more they hit at an angle, the more surface area the light falls on. That means that the amount of energy in a given amount of sunlight no longer heats a small section of land, but it is spread out over a larger section. That means there is less energy hitting per square *whatever* the more the angle gets. Get a flashlight and go to your kitchen table. Turn the light on and point it straight down. Now l... (more)
