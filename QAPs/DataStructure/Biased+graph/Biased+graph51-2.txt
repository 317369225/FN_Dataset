What is the coolest thing you can do with Mathematica?
From a visual point of view , I think one of the coolest things that can be done with Mathematica pertains to the many ways of visualizing 3D surfaces and curves , and in particular to the representation and visualization of functions of a complex variable in complex analysis . Below is an example of the visualization of the Riemann surface of an algebraic function : The Mathematica code for the image above is : Plot3D[Evaluate[Im[z^(-4) - z^(-1/3) (z)^(1/7) /. z -> x + I y]], {x, -2.5, 2.5}, {y, -2.5, 2.5}, PlotPoints -> 120, Mesh -> False, ColorFunction -> Hue, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1.4}, P...
