If I vertically pull on an object secured on both ends with tensed strings connected to walls, would it remain static or would my pull be an unbalanced force?
I'm assuming you mean something like this: However, this is where a simple understanding of statics is insufficient, and where one must take mechanics into account. Because what's really happening is this: (Pretend it's symmetric.) If the material connecting the object to the walls is very rigid, then maybe the vertical deflection is very very small and I have exaggerated it in the above figure. But in truth all objects are at least somewhat flexible, even a steel I-beam, though you may not see it when you look at a bridge or building. In this case, you have this: Where the upward applied force is counteracted by the downward reaction forces in the strings. Your upward pull is an unbalanced force until the springs deflect enough such that the reaction force (F = kx, where k is the stiffness coefficient and x is the amount of deflection) is equal to the upward force. Therefore the downward force F_down felt in each string is equal to F_down = kx = 1/2*F. That's why a very stiff material like steel will deform only a small amount - because it has a very large stiffness coefficient - whereas a very flexible material like a rubber band will deflect a lot in order to equal the same magnitude of 1/2*F. Hope this helps! Sorry for my not-very-fancy MS Paint figures.
