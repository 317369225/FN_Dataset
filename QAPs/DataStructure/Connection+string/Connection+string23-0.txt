Can an automaton develop a desire to live through this connected-thought logic string?Death. Life. Life is opposite to death. One does not exist without it's opposite. Immortality. The absence of death. If there's no death, then there's no life. If there's no life, then you're not alive. If you're not alive then you can't live. If you can't live, then you die. So why don't I?
Something that has never been alive, is not dead. It is in a state we call "lifeless". Rocks fall in this category, as do robots and automatons. I think artificially intelligent beings might develop a desire to live, or at least a desire to not be destroyed, but this "logic string" as you call it would not have a lot to do with it, sorry.
