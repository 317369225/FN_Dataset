What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory? (in simple words please)One of the persistent problems of Physics (since the early 20th century) has been to incorporate Quantum Mechanics and relativity into the same framework. The attempt probably started with Dirac, who gave the relativistic Dirac equation in Quantum Mechanics (QM) that incorporated Special Relativity. It soon matured into Quantum Electrodynamics and finally to Quantum Field Theory. QFT is a very successful model which accounts for special relativity and quantum effects, but not General Relativity. It is widely applied in various areas of Physics, notably Particle Physics and Condensed Matter Physics. But still it remains that General Relativity (GR) has not been accounted for. In very loose terms, String theory and Loop Gravity are attempts to wed GR and QM. In the words of Prof David Tong of Cambridge: "String theory is an ambitious project. It purports to be an all-encompassing theory of the universe, unifying the forces of nature, including gravity, in a single quantum mechanical framework. The theory involves many elegant mathematical ideas, woven together to form a rich and beautiful tapestry of unprecedented sophistication. It is also quite hard. While string theory is often paraded as the ultimate theory of everything, a less trumpeted facet is the way in which the theory reveals insights and connections between other, seemingly unrelated, aspects of physics. Much of the today's research in string theory is aimed at understanding more down-to-earth physical systems and is often concerned with unraveling the surviving mysteries of quantum field theory."
