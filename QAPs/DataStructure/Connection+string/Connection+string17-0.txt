If I had a taut string connected between me and a branch of a tree in another galaxy, could I pull the branch at the instant I tug the string?Or does this violate the faster than light thing
Yes, it violates the FTL thing. It also violates normal everyday physics. When you pull a string, the other end does not move instantaneously. The impulse moves through the string at the speed of sound. This may be thousands of MPH, but nowhere within sight of the speed of light.
