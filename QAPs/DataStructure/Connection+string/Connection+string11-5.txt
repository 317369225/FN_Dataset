Is it possible that you and I will dream the same dream if we're connected with a string?
My answer to this question is that it doesn't matter if you are connected with a string. Dreams are always connected, with anyone, and everyone. I know it's a pretty scary and interesting theory, but I believe so. Most people forget their dreams, right? after 2 hours or so. Imagine what would happen if everyone could share their world in the waking world. I'm pretty sure it would be pretty frightening. The few times my friends and I DID have the luck to remember, we shared dreams, and found that what we dreamed were pretty similar. And we didn't even get together for about a week! Often times, our brains, and our soul, alters the faces, or tries to at least, to erase the resemblance. But somehow you seem to know that it's them. I'm kinda confusing you I think...Do you understand?
