Can it be safe to connect four identical strings of decorative lights for which packaging states a maximum of three?
I'm presuming these are "pass through" strings where there's a male plug on one end and and a female plug on the other end to allow multiple strings to be connected together. Usually the problem is that the first string must pass the current for all the subsequent strings through its wires. Since they use the cheapest wires they can get away with, the current for three strings will make the voltage at the fourth string too low to operate properly. If that's the case, its not dangerous so much as the added strng and perhaps the ones in front won't work as well as intended - maybe less bright. I'm making an educated guess that it won't be unsafe. I'm not 100% sure this is the case, it depends on the type of strings (LED or incandescent) and how they are wired. Kelly Martin's comment has a really good point and that is the builtin fuse in the male connector may blow when more than three strings are connected. Definitely a possibility. Kudos to you for reading drections.  If you want to be safe, follow the manufacturer's sugestions. If you want to have the product perform as expected, follow the manufacturer's suggestions.
