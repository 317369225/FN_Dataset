If you had a string on Earth connected to Mars and pulled one end, wouldn't that information travel millions of miles a second?
No, the "information speed" would be at most about 186,282 miles per second. What makes you believe that the speed would be "millions of miles a second"? For one thing, your "thought experiment" appears to assume that the "string" is completely rigid, with zero elasticity, but never mind (even if you had access to such exotic material), the "pull" action would not exceed lightspeed (not even close). A thought experiment easier to comprehend would be to make the string of copper (or of a glass fibre) and instead of pulling at it, send an electromagnetic wave along its way in the chosen medium: How fast would the signal propagate? I'll leave that for you to work out!
