What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory in layman's terms?There are plenty of online resources to get into the basics of string theory. But do not forget that it is a theory of frontier physics, which deals with quantum mechanics, relativity, quantum field theory, and in general with all the concepts of modern physics and its inseparable (and unavoidable) mathematics. Perhaps the best place to begin with (after reading this thread on quora) is: http://whystringtheory.com/ Additionally also I'd recommend a very interesting book intended specifically for laymen: The Cosmic Landscape (from Leonard Susskind, one of the pioneers of String Theory itself).
