What is a coder's worst nightmare?
Worst nightmare?  That your code might kill someone. Ford was a customer of my first real-world employer, American Robot Corporation.  I helped them install robotic stations into their factories.  My worst nightmare was an actual nightmare I had from time to time - that a factory worker might accidentally be killed or maimed by one of my robots. Robotic stations - the areas immediately surrounding the robots on production lines, where they work - all have integrated light fences and countless other safety interlocks.  But there's still the potential for human error (mine) causing a human death (some unfortunate dude's).   Ouch.  For some kinds of robotic stations, the risk to people is minimal, but in other cases - for example if the robot is wielding a high-speed, diamond-tipped cutting blade - the risk to human life is quite real.  The stations I was programming for Ford were swinging around cutting tools which could have easily maimed or killed someone.  Today, there are standards and procedures regarding vetting code for these sorts of installations, but decades ago, no standards existed. Unless the robotic station has hardware-level cutoffs (which was prohibitively expensive decades back; not sure if today) there is code somewhere within a controller which if mis-programmed could allow the robot to continue to operate even when a safety override was trying to say "stop!"  ...yup, what a nightmare.
