Do theories with extra dimensions display too much freedom?Like string theory has 11 dimensions and other theories involve extra dimensions and universes. The things i could do if i had an extra dimension. Isn't it a cheap way of just making things easy?
As far as I know, they needed the extra dimensions to make the theory work. It is really up to you as to whether or not you think that was a fair assumption to make.
