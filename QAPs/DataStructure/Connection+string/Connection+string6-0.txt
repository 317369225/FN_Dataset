In a T20 cricket game, there is a moving camera on top of the ground. This camera is placed to get the top view and it keeps moving on the connected strings. I want to know whats the rule when the ball touches the camera or the connected strings?
The ball is dead. But one thing is to be mentioned that in case of the ball is caught, the decision lies completely in the hands of umpires. They can either declare the basman out if they think that the ball was anyways going to be caught or can declare a dead ball if they think that the strings caused sufficient impact to the ball to change its trajectory. However personally I think this is an absurd rule. Either the camera should be removed or the ball should be dead everytime it touches the string.
