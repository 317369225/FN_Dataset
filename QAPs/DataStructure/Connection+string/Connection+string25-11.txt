What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory in layman's terms?String theory is a powerful theory which attempts to solve the "Theory of everything". It originated around  1960 and is currently one of the major topics of research in theoretical physics. String theorists believe that in the most fundamental level of matter there is nothing but vibrating strings. These strings are believed to be one dimensional objects present at the heart of all matter and that their vibration produces different particles. This theory proposes that just like musician can produce numerous tunes from a violin string, different types of elementary particles are produced from different vibrations of the strings and these elementary particles form all the matter in the universe. And as there are infinitely many types of vibrations, there are infinitely many types of particles proposed by the string theory. It also predicts that these strings resonate in a mind boggling 10 dimensions. So, as string theory describes the “Standard Model” (the set of all elementary particles observed) as well as naturally incorporates gravity, it is considered as candidate for a  "Theory of everything" by many physicists and string theorists like Michio Kaku, Stephen Hawking and Edward Witten. According to Hawking in particular, "M-theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe."(M-theory is an extension of string theory that predicts existence of 11 dimensions). hope this helps!
