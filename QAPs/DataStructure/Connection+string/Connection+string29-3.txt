Do theories with extra dimensions display too much freedom?Like string theory has 11 dimensions and other theories involve extra dimensions and universes. The things i could do if i had an extra dimension. Isn't it a cheap way of just making things easy?
Eh, as it stands, you *do* have them, it's just that they're ... invisible is the easiest, fastest word ... If you could *use* the full dimensional space, that would be ... noteworthy, to understate. Of course, while it's understood that extra dimensions is the architecture we're going to use to think about the underlying structure of the universe, exactly how we understand those extra dimensions is hotly debated. There are at least four competing versions of string theory. It took me nine years to get to a woefully incomplete understanding of the mathematics involved, so *easy* ... might not be ... umm ... the word. If it *were* though, that would mean that our current best knowledge is too simple by some cognitive order of magnitude, which would mean that the only way that humans could ever *play* with the multiverse would be to augment their cognition with perhaps a quantum computing network. Easier said than done, but if you can stay alive for a little while longer, perhaps it will eventually be easier done than said. Think of what we're doing now with communication, compared to 150 years ago, as an analog for progress. Dream big. Best wishes.
