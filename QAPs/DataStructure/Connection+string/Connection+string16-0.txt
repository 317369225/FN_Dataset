Why is the tension on a string connected to two different masses the same on the strings of both sides of a frictionless pulley?The string is mass less. ​ Why is tension an indication of weight?
If the string is not mass less then the tension is different at any two points on the string. If the string is mass less consider this, assume the tension was different T1 and T2 as you think then ,  (T 1 −T 2 )×R=Iα  where R is radius of pulley, I    being moment of inertia and α  the angular acceleration. Since we consider α  as 0 as there is no angular acceleration, T1=T2. Because it is the same string on a friction less pulley. Tension is an electromagnetic force.
