My amplifier is producing a slight buzzing sound when i connect it to my guitar. This sound stops when i touch the strings. Whats the problem?It is an ashton amplifier. The sound is more noticeable with distortion on higher volumes. The wires seem to be okay.
When you touch metal on the guitar you're grounding it.  Unless your guitar strings aren't grounded you'll nearly always hear it.  Guitars with painted or anodized tuners seem to do it less.
