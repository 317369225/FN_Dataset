What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory?To understand about string theory, you need to first understand why string theory was proposed. Before the string theory was postulated, there were two theories that tried to define our physical world mathematically, which can help us understand why and how the physical entities like gravity, electro magnetic force etc works. Now, the two theories I.e. Relativity theory and  Quantum theory never achieved a common approach to which both theories individually and combined can explain or these physical quantities. Thus, there was a need for a common UNIFIED THEORY. String theory is not new, physicists proposed it in early 60's, actually there were just 5-6 of them who actually believed in the theory, for it sounded too absurb at that time. For many of us, it is believed that quarks are the smallest unit of our universe, which in fact is not true. What these geniuses found out that by taking the 3 constants of our physical realem gravity, light speed and planks constant , we get a length which is of the order of 10^-13, while quarks are of the order of 10^-9. Thus, the possibility of further subdivision of quarks. String theory  proposes that each and every element present in our universe are made up of closed 2 dimensional strings, which are vibrating in varied frequencies, defering from matter to matter. These frequencies give definite properties to corresponding matter or element. Hope that helped. :)
