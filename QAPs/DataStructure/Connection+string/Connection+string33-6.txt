If you had a string on Earth connected to Mars and pulled one end, wouldn't that information travel millions of miles a second?
No. Even if the string was very stretched out, the information coming through the string is still limited by the speed that the electromagnetic waves produced by the electrons. The photons must go from one atom to another to cause it to relay the pull of the string. So, in a sense, sending a message through a string is the same thing as sending a radio wave since they are limited by the speed that photons can travel. The difference is that one case uses "virtual" photons to relay the message rather than normal ones.
