What are some examples of domain specific languages?Such as CSound for example.
I take a pretty general view of the DSL. I would qualify CSS, HTML, and even your run-of-the-mill libraries which specialize in a particular domain (medical, financial, etc.) I think any toolset is worthy of being called a DSL given: It is designed in such a way that it proposes a restricted view of all possible "design realities". That is, there is a focused, limited view of the "world" that lies beyond it. In order to glob onto some reasonable version of a universally recognized semantic, the writer of the language or library devises a scheme to facilitate the application of its contents in areas which are domain-related. The result is a reasonably-focused, problem-specific mental framework.
