Is it possible that you and I will dream the same dream if we're connected with a string?
Why the string? In that vein, wouldn't a wire be more efficient?Â  How about holding hands? And why the physical link at all? I remember Dr.John C. Lilly did some experiments in the 70's where he had 16 people arranged in a circle with their heads toward the center. He reported every other person had the same dream. When ever people have the same dream, it has always been associated with having a message from God. It is seen as a mystical connection. What is up with that?
