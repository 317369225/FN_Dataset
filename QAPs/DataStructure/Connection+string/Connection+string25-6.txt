What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory in layman's terms?Someone questioned matter. They asked themselves if we breakdown every one of us and everything in this Universe what will we find? What constitutes all matter? - Someone found that to be 'atoms'. Someone else got naughtier and broke atom and found other smaller sub-atomic particles like protons and electrons and said that's what we are made of. It was OK till someone came up with another one called 'quarks' which sub-atomic particles are made of. With every conclusion, came motivation to dig much deeper and see if there's something else that's just one single thing that makes these quarks and thereby sub-atomic particles. Single unified theory to explain everything! But it got deeper and tinier that it could only be validated in the language of mathematics since it eludes all physical observation. This exotic tiniest thing is now a 'string'. The little vibrating energy that seems to vibrates in 11 dimensions creating all kinds of things we are made of and the Universe we interact with. 11 dimensions!? Yes, 11 so far. We have successfully entered into the wierdity! Now, with that comes all kinds of possibilities one of which is multiverse. See, the universe exists on what they call a 'brane' which consists of our 4 dimensional universe and universe that's governed by the remaining dimensions. The brane is not just a single entity. There are many such branes. They say when branes collide, big bang happens. Brane collide and then they move away from each other and then they come back and collide and so on causing big bang, inflation of the universe, deflation and back to singularity again and the cycle continues. And since there are many branes, multiverse is a serious possibility.
