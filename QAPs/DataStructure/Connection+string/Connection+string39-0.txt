Why can't I connect to my local SQL Server database instance?
There are lots of things to check with SQL Server: Is the SQL server instance (Windows service) running? Is the instance name correct (in the connection string)? Are named-pipes enabled and working? Can you reach the SQL instance by either instance name (named-pipes) or localhost IP (127.0.0.1)? Is SQL setup for integrated security or just a SQL server login? Is the connection string using the same type? Is the name/password correct? Can you connect with another tool like SQL Management Studio? (Download the Express version for free and test). Usually the error lies somewhere in these steps. Once you know SQL server is started and running on the server, try connecting using SQL Management Studio to narrow down the connection issues to your application.
