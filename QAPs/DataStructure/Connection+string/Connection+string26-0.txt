The director of the movie has made brilliant movies. Some note worth movies directed by him are Rocket Singh - Salesman of the year Chakde India Ab tak Chappan All three were amazing movies , but this one lacked the promotions normally given to a star packed movies and also the movie didn't have the usual masala item numbers or famous romntic songs. The film featured a very well portrayed story with hillarious comic scenes backed by an amazing performance from Ranbir Kapoor. I just loved this movie!
