Epics and folklore of India: Is there any connection between String Theory and the Sanskrit sound of Hindu origin "Aum"?
Well, it's neither beyond symbol (ॐ), nor beyond syllable (what's that even supposed to mean!), nor beyond sound (it's a sound, so it can't be beyond a sound). Technical terminology exists for a reason. Once you define terms in a consistent and rigorous manner, you can rely on those terms to explain other stuff. The most common mistake spiritual/religious/similar texts/preachers do is to co-opt terminology from one domain and use it their domain to sound pseudo-scientific. I have already answered in detail about OM in Antariksh Bothale's answer to What is 'Om' or 'Aum' and what is its mythological, cultural, scientific, religious and social significance?. I also explained that: There is no phonetic (scientific) basis to the claim that OM (or even AUM) is the sum of all sounds; heck, that probably doesn't even mean anything There is no basis to the claim that OM is the sound of the cosmos, or that of the Big Bang, or the primordial vibration that transcends the universe, or whatever else There is no basis for the claim that OM stimulates the pineal gland any more than what is expected from a vibration in the cranial bones.
