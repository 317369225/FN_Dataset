What are the challenges faced by CS/IT engineers when hired by mass recruiters like TCS, Infosys, Wipro?
None, as far as I know. I am a Chemical Engineer who got hired by Infosys and then Accenture. It does not take a lot of effort for even non-CS/IT engineers to get into these mass hiring companies. For CS/IT people, if you really want to ensure that you get into the company, I think you should just brush up a little on your core CS technical concepts and I think you are good to go. These companies are primarily testing your willingness to join and your communication skills. Once inside the company, there is barely any difference between the CS engineers and the non-CS/IT ones. Everyone is pretty much the same and it all boils down to your work ethic and efforts.
