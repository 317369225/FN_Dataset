Is there any connection between String Theory and the Higgs Boson?
The Higgs was required by the Standard Model, and a certain sort of Higgs might confirm or discredit Supersymetry.  They need a more accurate picture but expect to get it by the end of the year. String Theory tries explaining things at a much deeper level, and should include gravity.  It might also be wrong.  It cannot currently be tested.
