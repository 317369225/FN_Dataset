If you had a string on Earth connected to Mars and pulled one end, wouldn't that information travel millions of miles a second?
No, string is pretty stretchy so the pull is going to travel rather slowly, probably slower than the speed of sound, it depends on the strings weight to compressibility ratio.   It takes 22 minutes for light to get there so for a string it's going to take thousands of times longer.
