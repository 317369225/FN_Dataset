What will happen if I connect Earth and Mars through a string?Hypothetical scenario
Let us assume that there exists a substance which has tremendous tensile strength. When Earth and Mars are connected by a string, the relative radial velocity may not be zero( due to difference in angular position w.r.t. sun). In this case, assuming the string is inelastic, the relative radial velocity suddenly becomes zero. In order to withstand this longitudinal stress, the material should have astronomical tensile strength. Let us restrict the length of string so that the string won't pass through Sun and make it a complicated Three-body problem. Let relative tangential velocity after tying the string = V Affect on Earth-Mars system 1. If V >= Orbital speed of mars around earth, Mars is bound to revolve around earth in circular motion due to string( Even if V > Escape velocity) 2. If 0<V< Orbital speed, mars would revolve around earth in an elliptical orbit. The lesser the V, higher the eccentricity. 3. If V=0, Head-on collision,Â  will be remembered as Doomsday. Now considering this system, lets see how this affects the system's motion around sun. Earth-Mars system would lose a lot of kinetic energy( This would convert into heat/energy stored in the string). Hence, the semi major axis of orbit will decrease => The orbit would become elliptical depending on the value of V(similar behavior will be observed)
