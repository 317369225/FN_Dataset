What am I seeing when I look at an electron microscope photograph?For example in this photograph It's an electron microscope photograph of a piece of Gore-Tex(polytetrafluoroethane).  What are the blobs and connecting strings we can see? What would the size scale be for this type of image?
You are seeing something similar to a regular micro-photograph where the particles impinging on the film  are photons. But in an Electron Microscope Photograph the particles fired at the target are electrons, not photons. Therefore, we can use electrical lensing rather than optical lenses to diffract the reflected beam. This makes a huge difference. A scanning electron microscope actually looks at electrons scattered by a beam of electrons passing through a super thin section of a specimen. Due to the wavelength of light, optical microscopes can only achieve 1000-2000 X magnification. The SEM can magnify up to 500,000 X. It also provides an apparent greater depth of field. But there are inherent disadvantages as well. Which technology is best depends on what you are trying to see. With the edit to the question details, you've added questions about the Gore-Tex. A single water molecule is approximately 0.278 nm in diameter, so the typical opening in the plastic film would be a bit less than 200 nm across.
