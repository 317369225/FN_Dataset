Epics and folklore of India: Is there any connection between String Theory and the Sanskrit sound of Hindu origin "Aum"?
I feel believers and atheists alike can run into trouble by taking this question too literally. Om is a wonderful sound but it is connected only lightly to quantum physics - and Vedic masters probably knew this when they made their comments.  Consider Om as a sound.  Does it have a specific pitch? Does someone with a deep voice somehow make the sound "better" than a high pitched voice? And why isn't the sound Om more powerful when it gets louder?  The vibrations would be stronger, after all.  And if Om is connected to string theory, why doesn't matter pop into existence when a large group of people make the sound? These questions seem silly because the sound itself isn't what is important - the effect on your body is the secret.  Once you recognize that effect, you don't need to make the sound at all (something that ancient masters have also said). Where atheists get sidetracked is trying to debate it's meaning, or lack of meaning. Om is not a thought puzzle. You cannot understand it by thinking about it, only by doing it. No amount of argument will dilute it because we are all human beings, we all have a spinal cord running up our back with a very powerful brain at the top of it.  Once you experience this feeling or process, you will understand why the old masters said what they said. The "point" of Om is to quiet the mind and experience your nervous system, to recognize something beautiful that our bodies do all the time.  The "beauty" of Om is how such a basic action of our mouths is connected, or reflected, so directly to this basic action of our nervous system. To debate Om without experiencing it is like saying you like or dislike food that you have never eaten. Updated 24 Mar 2013 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Alok Moghe
