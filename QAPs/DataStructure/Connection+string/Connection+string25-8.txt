What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory?String theory is the most current theory that tries to 'tie everything together'.  When Albert Einstein proposed that mass was equal to energy, with an expression usually written E is equal to M times ( C squared), he basically said that there was one kind of mass and one kind of energy, and that they were equal.  He wrote a theory of Special Relativity, and one of General Relativity, but they didn't cover everything.  String theory, which has evolved into Superstring theory, or M-theory, attempts to cover the parts 'left out' of general relativity.  Brian Greene explains string theory to us in just 14 words   If you want to get more technical, here's a link.  https://www.learner.org/courses/...
