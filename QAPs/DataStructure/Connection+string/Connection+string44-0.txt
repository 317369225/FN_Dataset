My amplifier is producing a slight buzzing sound when i connect it to my guitar. This sound stops when i touch the strings. Whats the problem?It is an ashton amplifier. The sound is more noticeable with distortion on higher volumes. The wires seem to be okay.
You have a ground loop. See:  Practical Electronics:  Ground Loops and Audio Systems by Jacob VanWagoner on X-Ray Visions I'd have to take a look at your system to see exactly where it is, but I suspect that you have one item plugged into one wall outlet, and another item plugged into another outlet, under the assumption that somehow they have the same ground. If you have two different devices plugged into different outlets, the grounds aren't the same.  They're different.  They're at different voltages.  So feeding the signal from one into the other will add on a nice little hum.  This hum will be susceptible to all sorts of odd things, including how tight the cable is stretched, whether or not anything else is touching it (including fingers on metal strings), and even where a person is standing in the room.  With improper grounds, it's often considered FM (not frequency modulation -- in this case FM means F***ing Magic). There are other things that can produce a 60Hz hum, such as a blown capacitor in the power supply rectifier, but if that were the case then it wouldn't stop when you touched the strings.
