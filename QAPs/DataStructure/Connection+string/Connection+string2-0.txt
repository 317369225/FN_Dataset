In C#, how do you change the connection string in dataset.xsd?
Great question. The connection string is not actually stored within your XSD. If you added the XSD to your project using something like the wizard in Visual Studio, it likely added a connection string to your app.config file within your project. So, with that said, if you want your XSD to point at a different connection string, open it up, and look for the <Connection> XML block. Within there, you'll see an element with an attribute that says 'ConnectionStringObject". You can change this to the name of another connection string in your app.config file. If you just want to modify the existing connection string, you'll need to go find it within your app.config file (look for the connection string with the same name as the value assigned to the "ConnectionStringObject" attribute in your XSD). You can modify it directly within your app.config. Here's a similar answer on stackoverflow: How to change connection string in DataSet.xsd?
