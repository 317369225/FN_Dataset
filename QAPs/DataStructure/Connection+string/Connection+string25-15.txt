What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory?It is a model in which all the forces of the universe and all fundamental particles in it can be represented by the interactions of one-dimensional objects called "superstrings". This bears no relation to any everyday item, so the name is just a convenient label. This string is on a far smaller scale than we at present have any prospect of ever resolving by any present or projected future accelerator, so evidence will tend to be indirect. There are several schools of superstring theory, but the one thing they all have in common is the need to invoke six extra spacetime dimensions. To explain the fact that there is no evidence for these extra dimensions, it is said that they are effectively so "crunched up" that they can't be detected. However, this does offend the (unofficial) Principle of Mediocrity (that our sun, our planet and our galaxy aren't particularly special). The three spacial and one temporal dimension with which we're familiar are not compacted in this way, and this rather does pose the question, "what makes them so special?". One aspect of string theory is supersymmetry (also known as SUSY), the idea that bosons and fermions have "super-partners" in the other group, differing only in spin (bosons have integer spin, and fermions have half-integer spin). This theory seeks to resolve issues with unifying the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces. It was hoped that the Large Hadron Collider would show evidence of SUSY (and thus indirect evidence supporting string theory). However, the first run, which did nail the hitherto elusive Higgs boson, failed to find any evidence for SUSY. This doesn't mean that either string theory or SUSY (which isn't uniquely associated with strong theory, it supports several models) is dead in the water, but it is a bit of a disappointment to string and SUSY theorists.
