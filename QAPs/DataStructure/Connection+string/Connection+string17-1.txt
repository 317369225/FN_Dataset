If I had a taut string connected between me and a branch of a tree in another galaxy, could I pull the branch at the instant I tug the string?Or does this violate the faster than light thing
No, the moment you pull the string at one end, the pull doesn't infact travel instantaneously. Remember that the string is made of an infinite number of atoms (since you've made the string to some distant far away galaxy). Now, when you act as you're pulling the string, what you really are doing is that you are pulling the atoms that are frictionally in touch with your hand. These atoms pull the nearby atoms and so on. Since it's more of an electric force that pulls these about, and forces can only travel at the value of the speed of light, these atoms will pull the nearby atoms and so on, only by a value of speed of light, and this total sum change can be seen only to be a speed at which the string can stretch (its elastic spring speed). Hence no, it cannot go faster than light.
