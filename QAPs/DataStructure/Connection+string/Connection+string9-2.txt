Is there any connection between String Theory and the Higgs Boson?
There better be (better for the string theory, that is). We already know, from the experiment, that Higgs boson exist, so the string theory must include it, or be discarded. Also, I'm not an expert on string theory, but I think the basic mechanism for creating particle masses in it is also Higgs-like, so it must contain Higgs-like bosons.
