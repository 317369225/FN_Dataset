String Theory: What is the connection between quarks and string theory?
It's like asking what's the difference between a car and what makes the car move. Quarks are fundamental particles which combine to form protons / neutrons / mesons and other particles. The theory which describes this mechanism is called The Standard Model of physics and incorporates theories like quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics. Another language in which these phenomena are explained is the quantum field theory. But one shortcoming of these models is that they are not able to incorporate the gravitational force. These theories can explain what gives rise to other three forces - electromagnetic force, weak force, strong force (which quarks exert) and how they interact. But cannot bring gravity into the equations. This is where the string theory comes in. It so happens that the gravitational force pops right out of the equations of string theory rather naturally - along with the other 3 forces. So it is believe that this formulation is a strong contender of being a unified theory of everything. The paradigm upon which the string theory is based is that instead of point like particles, the fundamental entities of nature are one dimensional strings - very very tiny strings - which vibrate and different vibrations are manifested as different fundamental particles. But it's way beyond the scope of current technologies to probe the lengths and energy scales at which a "string" could be observed.
