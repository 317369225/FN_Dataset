If I had a taut string connected between me and a branch of a tree in another galaxy, could I pull the branch at the instant I tug the string?Or does this violate the faster than light thing
A similar thought experiment  that will illuminate this question is "What would happen to the orbit of the Earth if the Sun suddenly vanished?" The answer is that reality itself  travels at the speed of light, that is...the Earth would still orbit the spot where the Sun used to be for 8 1/2 minutes more. Then it would proceed on a tangent straight course. So any effect of pulling a string attached to a tree in another Galaxy would  only proceed at the speed of light. If, one second after pulling it, the Earth disappeared, the pull would progress at the speed of light.
