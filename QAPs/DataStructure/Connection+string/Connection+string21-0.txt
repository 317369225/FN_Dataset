What may be centrepetal acceleration if you imagine that you are rotating because of the revolving string connecting you with the centre of earth?
The centripetal acceleration of a particle moving in a circle or radius r is v 2 /r  , where v is the velocity of the particle. On equator, you can easily do the math using these additional info r = radius of earth = 6372 km (=R). v=(2∗pi∗r)/T  , where T is the time period of rotation of earth around its own axis (=24h) At a latitude φ, you should replace both r by R cosφ (where R = radius of earth as before), as this will be the effective radius of the circle in which you are (or the particle is) rotating. PS: The connection with string part is irrelevant. It will be needed only when you are looking for the force-acceleration equation of the particle. Updated 29 Dec 2014 • View Upvotes
