What are some examples of domain specific languages?Such as CSound for example.
http://github.com/jed/fab is a DSL for cleaning up asynchronous programming in http://nodejs.org. NodeJS uses event callbacks for everything, the goal is to be non-blocking. Deeply nested callbacks create nasty syntax and difficult to follow program flow. This area is ripe for DSLs. Erlang http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erl... started as a DSL for building reliable networks for telecoms, but is now used by a few web startups because they face the same problems. The problems of that domain are common problems for many tech companies today. OpenCL, CUDA, and experimental programming languages for multiprocessor programming like http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/n... are currently DSLs. X10 http://x10-lang.org/ is a new language where concurrency is the center of attention, but it looks like a complete general purpose language.
