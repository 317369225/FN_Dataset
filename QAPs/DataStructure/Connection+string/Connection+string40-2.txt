Who are the some of the best young theoretical physics faculty today?I am applying for grad schools soon and would be delighted if someone could tell me who the best young faculty are and what they work on.
Apart from Arpan's amazing list, I would add these names: 1. Davide Gaiotto: Works at Perimeter Institute mainly in Mathematical physics and field theory. 2. Daniel Baumann: Works at DAMTP, Cambridge mainly in cosmology and string theory. 3. Liam McAllister: Works at Cornell in string cosmology.
