What are some must-watch Bollywood movies which did not do well at the box office?
Originally Answered: What are some of the good bollywood movies that were flops at the box office?I will present my list of five movies here: 1. 1971 (2007) If you like Manoj Bajpayee this is a MUST. If you don't like him, this movie will change your mind about him. It is NOT a war movie, mind you. It is about how some Indian soldiers try to escape Pakistan imprisonment. The last 5 minutes steal the show. 2. Dhoop (2003) You cannot expect Om Puri to champion his roles. He is always at his best. Then comes along this simple movie, Dhoop. A little about the movie: it's about corruption and an old man fighting his way out of the quicksand sucking him in. If you need a reason to cry, watch dhoop. It is deeply influential, so watch with caution! 3. Buddha Mar Gaya (2007) Extremely hilarious. Vulgar. Stupid. Unabashedly so. Look at the cast. When stalwarts like Paresh Rawal, Anupam Kher and Om Puri share screen with Rakhi Sawant, something fishy happens. It is called Buddha Mar Gaya. Also add the cult of an actor Ranvir Shorey. If you are in the mood of some quirky adult comedy, look no further! 4. Dor (2006) A multitude of emotions captured expertly by a very talented cast and superb director. When someone utters the words 'progressive cinema', Dor comes to my mind. Ought to watch it to believe it! 5. Well Done Abba (2009) Movies like these come and go unnoticed. These are the ones we should be on the lookout for. Boman Irani has delivered stellar performances and this is one of his best yet. A very simple, straightforward and a slightly naive approach to rampant corruption. Very sarcastic movie, it will make you fall in love with Indian Cinema all over again. Please do share with me your experiences if you've watched any of these 5 movies. I'd love to know you, the rarest breed of the Indian movie watchers!
