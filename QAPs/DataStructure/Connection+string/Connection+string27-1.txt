What are the challenges faced by CS/IT engineers when hired by mass recruiters like TCS, Infosys, Wipro?
Having spoken to lot of people who have got into product companies from the TCS's of the world, I can tell you that most people are challenged with poor quality of work. A client's work is broken down to 100s of parts and assigned to 1000s of engineers and at the end of the day, work is mechanical with no learning in terms of domain skills, cross platform technologies etc. People who are lucky and get a good manager get to learn a lot, some wait for their time to come, others move on.
