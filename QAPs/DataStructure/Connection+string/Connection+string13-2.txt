How does Java overload operator "+" connect two strings? How does that invisible part work?
In java Concept of  Operator overloading is removed which was in C++. Operator overloading is way of assigning many task to one operator like "+" can be used for addition, concatenation etc. But in java,methods are used for concatenation. String a="abc"; String b="pqr"; String c=a+b; String Buffer/StringBuilder class is used internally as follows: String c=new StringBuilder(a).append(b).toString(); So, Java is simple and easy to use difficult concepts like operator overloading and pointers are not there.
