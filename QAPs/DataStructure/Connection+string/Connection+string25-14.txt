What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory in layman's terms?Akash Shah seems to have a great answer to this question so check his answer out. If his answer wasn't enough, or you would rather enjoy listening to a few hours of fun conversation about Newtonian and Quantum Physics, then these two podcasts from Talk Nerdy are a great way to prime yourself on the subjects. The discussion leads the listener through the basics of physics in general and culminates in a decent description of String Theory, so be sure to listen to them in order. Feel free to skip the first one if you are complete sure you understand the basics of physics. Talk Nerdy Podcast: Episode 41 - Mark Jackson Episode 54 - Shaun Maguire Have a supersymmetric day.
