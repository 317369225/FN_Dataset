What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is a simple way of understanding string theory?Well, if I'm understanding the "understanding string theory" right, then no one "understands" string theory yet. If the question is to understand the what we know about string theory today, then it depends on your background. You at least need a solid knowledge of classical and quantum mechanics. In that case, you can pick up the book by Barton Zweibach which was intended to be an introductory course for undergraduates. This will give you a good flavor of string theory. To get a good grasp over string theory concepts, you should first study graduate level quantum field theory and general relativity. Then you can dive into supersymmetry theory. Though there are non-SUSY string theories, the string theory people work on today is superstring theory. The books by Polchinski are a very good reference to understand the core concepts of string theory and after that you are on review or research papers.
