Is it possible that you and I will dream the same dream if we're connected with a string?
From a scientific standpoint, it may be awhile before the same dream landscape can be shared like in the movie INCEPTION or DREAMSCAPE. However, it is technologically possible right now to achieve rudimentary dreamer-to-dreamer communication using the scientific principles of dream incorporation of external stimuli and deliberate ocular signaling from within a dream. Dreamers wearing home EEG or REM detection devices can hook up over the internet to send simple signs or semaphores to each other. The website Sleep Stream Online is currently coordinating these experiments.
