What is string theory?
Originally Answered: How do I explain string theory to a five year old?Tell him or her about how things get smaller and smaller. You have a car. The car is made of parts like tires and doors. The Door is made of smaller parts like the handle. The handle is made of metal (or plastic). The metal is made of small parts called atoms. The atoms are made of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Those parts are made of quarks, and the quarks behave as if they are made of even smaller strings which may or may not be made of something smaller. Tell them about how it's hard to see something so small so we have to observe behaviors to understand such small structures. At 5, I think just being interested in such things is awesome! :)
