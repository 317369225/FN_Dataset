Epics and folklore of India: Is there any connection between String Theory and the Sanskrit sound of Hindu origin "Aum"?
There is no connection. Both the concepts are independently developed and separated by thousands of years. Om is a philosophical concept and frankly there is a lot of inconsistency in different texts and cultures. In some texts it refers to the moment creation of the universe and in some text it is the all encompassing mystical sound. In some contexts Om is called as "Adi-Anadi" without beginning or end and in some it is referred to as  manifestation of god at the beginning of our universe. In many cultures Om is used as a "Mantra" for stimulating your senses while meditation. String theory is a contemporary scientific theory. Mathematical modeling is used to formulate and test the theory in various configurations. It tries to address the issues like the nature and behavior of your universe at particular level while combining concepts of gravity and quantum mechanics. In some cases it is possible to draw parallels between philosophical concepts and scientific theories. And it could be even be possible for one to get inspiration  from other. But in this case it all seems too far fetched.
