Do theories with extra dimensions display too much freedom?Like string theory has 11 dimensions and other theories involve extra dimensions and universes. The things i could do if i had an extra dimension. Isn't it a cheap way of just making things easy?
Physicists didn't just add extra dimensions simply because they could. When physicists started with string theory, say, they assumed four dimensions. They didn't even state the assumption, they just took it for granted. But, as often happens in the quantum mechanics of non-trivial systems, a crucial calculation didn't converge, essentially giving infinite results. But it was noticed that in certain dimensions the terms contributing to the infinities could be made to cancel each other out giving a finite answer. This has usually been what has determined the choice of dimensions. It's classical mechanics that displays too much freedom. In classical mechanics, say, you can investigate gravity in spaces of any dimension. The physics has absolutely no explanatory power when it comes to understanding why we live in a universe of a particular dimension. Â String theory and supergravity, say, have no such freedom. Classical mechanics is pretty lame in this respect. The fact that quantum mechanics sometimes picks out particular dimensions is a nice feature to have.
