My amplifier is producing a slight buzzing sound when i connect it to my guitar. This sound stops when i touch the strings. Whats the problem?It is an ashton amplifier. The sound is more noticeable with distortion on higher volumes. The wires seem to be okay.
Single coil pickups will always be more susceptible to buzz, when you touch the strings you are grounding. Tom lists the usual fixes above in great detail - I would usually move the amp to a different spot in the house first.  Try different outlets, don't be close to computers or fluorescent lights.  All things being equal, the house electricity / grounding is the culprit in the majority of cases. Good luck and let us know how you get on.
