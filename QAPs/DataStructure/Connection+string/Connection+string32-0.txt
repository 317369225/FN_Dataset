In the string theory, are the small rolled up dimensions connected or are they local only to the individual string?
An excellent question.  Although I'm not acquainted with the mathematics of strong theory, I am aware that the strong nuclear force, for example, involves "small rolled up dimensions".  Naive calculations based on assuming that this field permeates all of space lead to enormous cosmic energies that have not been observed.  The best proposal to resolve this that I've read postulates that the field applies only inside particles (e.g. protons).
