If you had a string on Earth connected to Mars and pulled one end, wouldn't that information travel millions of miles a second?
No one of these answers are enough I think. A string made of neutron star is good case. Assume we are pushing this rod 1 meter sticking somewhere in the middle. I think there should be a lab test for this to measure. It seems it will not exceed the speed by 2c.
