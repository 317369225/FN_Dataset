What am I seeing when I look at an electron microscope photograph?For example in this photograph It's an electron microscope photograph of a piece of Gore-Tex(polytetrafluoroethane).Â  What are the blobs and connecting strings we can see? What would the size scale be for this type of image?
What you see are strings and blobs of polytetrafluoroethane produced bny sudden stretching of a membrane of the heated material. I cannot find the scale for this particular magnification but this phrase from Gore-Tex webpage can help you to figure out if you know how large is a water droplet: "The amazing part is that these pores are actually 20,000 times smaller than a water droplet, but 700 times larger that a water vapor molecule.That is what makes the Gore-Tex membrane functionally waterproof, while at the same time allowing perspiration to escape from the inside."
