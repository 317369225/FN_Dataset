What are some must-watch Bollywood movies which did not do well at the box office?
Originally Answered: What are some of the good bollywood movies that were flops at the box office?A lot of great movies are mentioned here but how come people forget this? Nayak: The Real Hero (2001)  :- You need only One Indian to change One Billion. A political thriller movie which is about the rise of common man into this dirty politics, which made a real effect in Indian political theater. You can't watch this movie without getting goosebumps, you can't hate this movie even if you're watching it 50th times and you can't describe the beauty of this movie with words here. The film was a box-office failure, primarily because of poor marketing and no star value. Edit:-As people keep telling, The film is a remake of S. Shankar's successful Tamil film Mudhalvan (1999). One more movie which has not been mentioned,  I'd like to add is :- Hungama (2003):- An Epic comedy film, which became successful on DVDs. Film barely recovered it's investment from theaters. p.s.:-At first Nayak movie was offered to Aamir Khan, but he didn't believe in this concept so he declined it. If he would have done it, then this movie could have got the much-deserved audience. pps- I'm not mentioning about other movies which has been mentioned in other answers already.
