What is the best way to connect a SQL server with Android using a connection string?
There are many options available. I'd like to share a few one. 1. Make a web service that process a request from app and responds accordingly. That is, you pass some SQL query parameters from app to the web service and let your web service handle the request. This web service can be of any type JAVA, PHP, etc. You just need to use standard HTTP methods. Android PHP/MYSQL Tutorial 2. Make a web server. It does the same task as above but you dont need to host your services. Your PC will do all the task. For that, you need to do SOCKET PROGRAMMING You can learn Socket programming in java.http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077322/core-java/sockets-programming-in-java-a-tutorial.html
