How can I create a database using Java, as I have to design an online library management system using Java only?
If my understanding is correct you are looking to create a database rather than use any of the existing RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle or SQLServer etc etc. If my understanding is wrong, you can go with any of the above two answers. Creating an RDBMS requires high level of knowledge of Operating systems, computer architecture etc. For a simple Online library mgmt system, you can rely on a flat file system, where data can be stored and retrieved from flat files like txt, dat etc. Another option would be using combo of MS Excel and Apache POI. This is far better, reliable, scalable compared to flat file systems.
