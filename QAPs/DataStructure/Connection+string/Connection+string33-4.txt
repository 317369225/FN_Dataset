If you had a string on Earth connected to Mars and pulled one end, wouldn't that information travel millions of miles a second?
Usually notion of information is whatever travels is information whether its random or anything. Firstly, Information is something ,what is conveyed or represented by a particular arrangement or sequence of things. So no information is conveyed or transferred. Just another spooky action even if it has enough to travel at such speeds rather it gonna slow down and will be travelling at much lower speeds.
