Can an automaton develop a desire to live through this connected-thought logic string?Death. Life. Life is opposite to death. One does not exist without it's opposite. Immortality. The absence of death. If there's no death, then there's no life. If there's no life, then you're not alive. If you're not alive then you can't live. If you can't live, then you die. So why don't I?
