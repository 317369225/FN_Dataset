What is a coder's worst nightmare?
Having to explain THIS to your boss: The Mars Climate Orbiter (formerly the Mars Surveyor '98 Orbiter) was a 338 kilogram (750 lb) robotic space probe launched by NASA on December 11, 1998 to study the Martian climate, atmosphere, and surface changes and to act as the communications relay in the Mars Surveyor '98 program for Mars Polar Lander.  However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was  lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based  computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound-seconds (lbf×s) instead of the metric units of  newton-seconds (N×s) specified in the contract between NASA and  Lockheed. The spacecraft encountered Mars on a trajectory that brought  it too close to the planet, causing it to pass through the upper  atmosphere and disintegrate.[1][2]
