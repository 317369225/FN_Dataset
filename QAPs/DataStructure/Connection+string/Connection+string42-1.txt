What am I seeing when I look at an electron microscope photograph?For example in this photograph It's an electron microscope photograph of a piece of Gore-Tex(polytetrafluoroethane).Â  What are the blobs and connecting strings we can see? What would the size scale be for this type of image?
The picture you are seeing is probably one taken with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Since Gore-Tex is not conductive, what is inside the image has probably been coated with in thin film of metal, usually gold. The SEM can't tell you what those blobs and connecting strings are with just the images collected from the back scattered electrons. You have to use other material characterization methods to determine their chemical composition.
