If proven, how does String Theory connect GR and QM?
General Relativity concerns the very, very large: the motions of planets, stars and galaxies. Quantum mechanics can't handle anything much bigger than an electron. It is the kingdom of the very, very small. GR is geodesics and straight lines and determinism. QM is fuzziness and uncertainty and probabilism. Yet the stars ruled by GM are made up of atoms, which are made up of quarks and electrons whose behaviour is governed by QM. The two overwhelmingly successful theories both describe the same universe at different scales, but their rules appear quite incompatible. There are four conventional forces in the Standard Model of particle physics. The strong force is mediated by gluons. The photon is the quantum of electromagnetics. The W and Z bosons transmit the weak force, which is involved in beta decay, amongst other things. However, no evidence has been seen of gravitons, the theoretical quantum of gravity. Yet gravity is at the heart of General Relativity. If only it can be shown to be quantizable, there is an automatic link between GR and QM. String theory considers the graviton to be a closed string (a loop), and the graviton is a massless, spin 2 node of vibration on the loop. The graviton as mentioned above is effectively a link between the quantum world and the relativistic universe. However, string theory has been almost the only game in town for cosmologists for over 30 years, and it isn't showing much progress yet, while the reverberations from the discoveries of QM and GR just keep on coming.Â  One consequence of a "correct" new understanding of the universe seem to be quick and plentiful. But I'm still waiting for my string telephone (although if the cosmic tin can is real, I had one when I was a kid)
