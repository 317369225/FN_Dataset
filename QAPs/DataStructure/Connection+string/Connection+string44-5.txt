My amplifier is producing a slight buzzing sound when i connect it to my guitar. This sound stops when i touch the strings. Whats the problem?It is an ashton amplifier. The sound is more noticeable with distortion on higher volumes. The wires seem to be okay.
Back in the day, during my garage band days, I used to face this issue all the time. There were a whole host of issues to look into: right from poor amplifiers, to cheap cables, faulty connectors and what not. After months of struggle, I finally met a recording studio engineer who opened my eyes to the value of purchasing good quality cables, connectors and jacks. I managed to resolve the hissing issues by replacing the connecting jacks on the cables with the ones manufactured by this company: Connectors for audio, video, fiber optic and industry Hope this helps!
