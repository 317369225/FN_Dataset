What is string theory?
Originally Answered: What is string theory in layman's terms?Akash Shah's answer covers most from what I recognize as physicist Brian Greene's layman's explanations on String theory. There are several youtube videos by him. I would like add to the testability part of the theory which is missing in Akash Shah's answer since this is important and governments are investing a lot on this. String theory also seeks to explain why gravity, one of the 4 fundamental forces, is extremely weak relative to the rest and why this offers an opportunity for testing string theory. ​ ​ I refer to this figure on branes (membranes) from Akash 's answer. String theory suggets gravity appears weak to us since we observe it only in our membrane  when it actually pervades across all the membranes. Therefore, the particles that are responsible for gravity, gravitons, must be passing through membranes. So, if we can observe graviton passing to another brane (basically vanishing into thin air) then that would prove multiverse and String theory. I know this is a very fragile explanation. But just thought of letting you know so you can poke further on the web. Updated 4 Jan • View Upvotes
