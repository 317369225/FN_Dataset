My amplifier is producing a slight buzzing sound when i connect it to my guitar. This sound stops when i touch the strings. Whats the problem?It is an ashton amplifier. The sound is more noticeable with distortion on higher volumes. The wires seem to be okay.
I always carry a ground lift adaptor with me to gigs etc. oftentimes you can solve the 60 cycle Hum by putting the ground lift between your amp and/or pedalboard and the power outlet. Cheap solution!
