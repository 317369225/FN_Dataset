Do theories with extra dimensions display too much freedom?Like string theory has 11 dimensions and other theories involve extra dimensions and universes. The things i could do if i had an extra dimension. Isn't it a cheap way of just making things easy?
I am probably the only one who will post here who has also created a new theory requiring extra dimensions - my Guidance Wave interpretation of quantum mechanics. I absolutely hated putting in extra dimensions, but the reason I did was that it was the only way to make the theory physically self-consistent and consistent with observation. I decided that either the theory was wrong, or a least one extra dimension applied.Â  The fates will decide, especially if anyone can be bothered to try one of the two experiments I proposed.
