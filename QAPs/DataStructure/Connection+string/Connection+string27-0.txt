What are the challenges faced by CS/IT engineers when hired by mass recruiters like TCS, Infosys, Wipro?
Main challenge is to raise your knowledge level to the expectations of some learned people in the organization. These people know nothing about CS whatsoever. And whenever there is a problem, they suggest nonsense workarounds. Once I was trying to connect to an Oracle Database using VB Script. But there seemed to be some problem and it was not getting established. The genius lead suggested add the connection string of DB in the browser proxy settings. ThenÂ  it will work. And I was like Whatttttttttttttttttttt !!
