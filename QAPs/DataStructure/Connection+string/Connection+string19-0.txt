What happens if a string connecting a heavy object and a merry-go-round is cut when it is rotating?
I am considering that merry go round is in motion. Okay when you will cut down the string, radial force will be lost , but there will be a tangential force, and then tangential force will do the work and the merry go round will move in the direction of the that tangential force and will do a projectile motion .
