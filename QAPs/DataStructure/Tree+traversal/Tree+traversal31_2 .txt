What is meant by vertical order traversal of a tree? What is the exact and forma definition of vertical order traversal?The following example illustrates vertical order traversal.  1  / \  2 3  / \ / \  4 5 6 7  \ \  8 9 The output of print this tree vertically will be: 4 2 1 5 6 3 8 7 9 The idea is to traverse the tree once and get the minimum and maximum horizontal distance with respect to root. For the tree shown above, minimum distance is -2 (for node with value 4) and maximum distance is 3 (For node with value 9). Once we have maximum and minimum distances from root, we iterate for each vertical line at distance minimum to maximum from root, and for each vertical line traverse the tree and print the nodes which lie on that vertical line.
