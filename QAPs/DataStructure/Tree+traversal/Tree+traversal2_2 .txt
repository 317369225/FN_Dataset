Why does tree traversal always go left subtree before right subtree? Is there any logical reason?The names "left" and "right" are just artifacts of the source code and could be changed to "banana" and "lamp_shade" without affecting the tree or a particular traversal algorithm. If you mean, "Of the the two pointers or references to children that appear in the tree's node data structure, why is the one that appears first in the layout of that structure the one that is often explored first in various traversal implementations?" then this is the same question as asking, "Why do we often iterate over arrays from item 0 to n-1 rather from n-1 to 0?"
