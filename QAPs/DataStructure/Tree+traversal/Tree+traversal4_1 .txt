What is an intuitive explanation of preorder and postorder on a tree traversal?Imagine doing a headcount at a company. The CEO thinks "I'll ask my VPs one by one for their division headcount, then I sum it together for the result" (i.e. traverse each subtree in turn, then perform action at root). Each VP in turn thinks "I'll ask my department heads one by one for their headcount, then I sum it together for the result". Repeat down the line, and note that the flow of orders and summations is precisely post-order traversal. Now imagine a shake-up is needed at the company...courtesy of a tanker-load of pungent cow poo. The CEO thinks "I'll divide the load into barrels, then dump them on my VPs' heads one by one." (i.e. perform action at root, then traverse each subtree in turn). Each VP in turn thinks "I'll shovel this crap that got dumped on me into buckets, then dump them on my department heads' heads one by one". Repeat down the line, and note that the flow of angry feelings and crap-handling is precisely pre-order traversal. Having said all that, I wouldn't want to work at this company.
