Why is it that for the equality checking of binary trees, an inorder + preorder or inorder + postorder traversal is done? How do these combinations ensure the equality of trees?So as you can see in the above image, there are 2 trees that are structurally DIFFERENT. But the content of the tree is the same, the number of nodes are the same and their inorder traversals are the SAME. So, does it mean that the two trees are one and the same? No. As you can see, 5 is the root node in the first tree but it is the right child of the root node in the second tree. So as you can see, there can be multiple trees constructed with only one traversal order (inorder/preorder or postorder) but there can exist only one tree with a particular pair of (inorder + preorder) or (inorder + postorder) traversals. And that is precisely the reason a combination of tree traversals is used to check equality of trees.
