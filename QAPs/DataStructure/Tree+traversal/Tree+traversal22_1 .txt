If the post order traversal of a binary tree is DEBFCA, how can I find out the pre order traversal?Since Root is the last node to be traversed in a post order traversal we know one thing for sure. A is the root. Next, we are left with only DEBFC. Here some of the nodes belong to the left side of the binary tree and some belong to the right side. How many nodes belong to the left and how many belong to the right. Since left side of the binary tree is considered first, and since every node is expected to have at most two child, DEB will be the left side of the binary tree and FC would be the right. Now, we know that FC is in the right side of the binary tree. Again the last node would be the root of the sub tree and F its left side. Next we come to the left side of the binary tree and it is DEB. Again B would be the root of the sub tree. D and E are its left and right side respectively. So the binary tree would look something like this given below. After constructing the binary tree, writing the preorder traversal is very simple. In preorder traversal root comes first. Since A is the root, A would appear first. Following Root would be the Left and Right sub tree and so the left subtree would be BDE. Again B would be the root of the left sub tree followed by D and E which are the left and right child respectively. SO the preorder traversal till now would be ABDE. Last comes the Right sub tree. Here again C would be the root of the right sub tree followed by C its left child. So the entire preorder traversal of the tree would be ABDECF.
