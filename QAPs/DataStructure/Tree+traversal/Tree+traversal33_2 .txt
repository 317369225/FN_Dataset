How do I calculate the height of a full binary tree given its preorder traversal?Given a full binary tree (one in which the nodes have either 0 children or 2 children) and its preorder traversal, how to calculate its height using recursion/iterative method? Question link: http://www.spoj.com/problems/NIC...If you have N elements, the minimum height of a binary tree will be log2(N)+1. For a full binary tree, the maximum height will be N/2. For a non-full binary tree, the maximum height will be N. This is basic of binary tree and you will find it in any data structure book. Also please look into this link Height of a Complete Binary Tree
