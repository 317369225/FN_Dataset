Why does tree traversal always go left subtree before right subtree? Is there any logical reason?Well, it really depends on what you want to do. If your only goal is just to visit every node (say, you just want to count the number of nodes), then of course it doesn't matter. If your tree is, say, a binary search tree, and you want to visit nodes in ascending order, then you'll need to visit the left subtree first. This is because in a binary search tree, nodes are sorted such that nodes on the left are smaller than nodes on the right. This is just a convention, of course; you could do it all the other way.
