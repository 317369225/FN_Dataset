Is there a way to do a BFS traversal of a binary tree with recursion (using Java)?I know just the standard way - with using queue, but is it possible to do this with a recursion, and if yes, how?I assume this question was asked in an interview, since BFS is one of the classic applications of queue data structure. Its preposterous to implement BFS using a stack in a real-world scenario. Anyway to answer this question, Implement the queue in your BFS using 2 stacks. Then convert this iterative stack code you have to a recursive one. - O(N) OR Write a code where for every level in a tree you recursively print all nodes in that level. ( O(n^2) time complexity) . This isn't actual BFS but solves the problem nonetheless. All these doesn't make any sense at all though, in a practical scenario.
