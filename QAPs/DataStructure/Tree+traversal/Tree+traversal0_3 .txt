What can be done to master recursion in tree traversals?Read, understand and implement the three recursive tree traversas - PreOrder, InOrder and PostOrder. It should be clear when you use each but if you're not comfortable yet practice with questions (google competitive programming for a list of sites). If it's the recursive formula that's confusing you then try writing it in pseudocode on paper first, that might help you get your head round what you're trying to do.
