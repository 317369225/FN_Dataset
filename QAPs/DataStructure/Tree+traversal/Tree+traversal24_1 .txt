What are some of the use cases of various traversal methods for trees?Are there examples where inorder, preorder or post order are particularly helpful? For example, inorder of a parse tree gives you the original expression.Preorder Traversal: Clone a tree Count the number of tree leaves Convert expression tree to prefix notation Postorder Traversal: Converts post fix notations to expression tree. This method is heavily used in calculator based programs. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rev...) Stack based programming languages(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sta...) Inorder Traversal: Sorting a binary search tree
