An efficient representation of a tree in a relational database is with Modified Preorder Tree Traversal (MPTT). As explained well in the Django MPTT app's README file [1]: MPTT is a technique for storing hierarchical data in a database. The aim is to make retrieval operations very efficient. The trade-off for this efficiency is that performing inserts and moving items around the tree is more involved, as there's some extra work required to keep the tree structure in a good state at all times. Here are a few articles about MPTT to whet your appetite and provide details about how the technique itself works: - Trees in SQL [2] - Storing Hierarchical Data in a Database [3] - Managing Hierarchical Data in MySQL [4] [1] https://github.com/django-mptt/d...
