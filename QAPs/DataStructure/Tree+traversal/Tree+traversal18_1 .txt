Most companies in bay area and else where concentrate on algorithms centered around: Linked lists (singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, list traversal, hare and the tortoise algorithm) Trees (B-tree, B+ tree, Binary tree traversal) Hash maps and their distributed variants. Graphs (breadth first and depth first traversal) Cache implementation. (FIFO, LIFO, LFU) Heap (Min-heap and max-heap) The harder interviews like google, FB etc also dig deeper into: Networking algorithms. Online algorithms. Combinatorial algorithms. Dynamic programming problems. It may also be helpful to know a few algorithms in distributed systems space.
