Why is it that for the equality checking of binary trees, an inorder + preorder or inorder + postorder traversal is done? How do these combinations ensure the equality of trees?Lets first look at the defination of all these three traversals. Inorder - left , root , right Preorder- root ,left , right Postorder - left ,right ,root So if one asks me to determine a tree exists or not with the given preorder and postorder traversals is it possible? The answer is NO..because in preorder the first element of tree is first while in postorder it is last due to which i would have no idea to what elements exist in the left subtree and what elements exist on the right subtree. This is the reason why inorder traversal along with any other traversal determines the existence of a tree because in inorder traversal the first element occurs in the middle which means that the elements to the left would be a part of left subtree and elements to the right would be a part of right subtree . Hope this helps !!
