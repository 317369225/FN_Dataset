What is the best way to perform a spiral level-order traversal of a binary tree iteratively?A spiral level-order traversal goes right, then left, then right, etc. down each level of the tree.Do a Breadth First Search. Maintain 2 stacks. stack1.add(root). while(true)  while (stack1 is not empty)  pop from stack1 and push its children to stack 2.  if stack2 is not empty, stack1 = stack2 and clear stack2.  else break from the infinite while loop. end while.
