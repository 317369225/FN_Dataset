What is the best way to perform a spiral level-order traversal of a binary tree iteratively?A spiral level-order traversal goes right, then left, then right, etc. down each level of the tree.As you execute a Breadth-first search, push the children into a Double-ended queue. A double-ended queue allows efficient insertions to, and removal from both ends. Pop from the double-ended queue in alternate directions for each level (depth) of traversal.
