Is topological sort on a tree equivalent to a pre-order traversal?yes, a pre-order traversal yields a topological sort. This should be easy to see - by definition, a pre-order traversal visits each node before visiting the node's children, which is precisely the property you want to have for a topological sort. On general DAGs, though, this reasoning doesn't work. You can have portions where two nodes have an edge to the same node (think of a diamond shape) - preorder might visit one of the two parents first, and then visit the child before visiting the other parent. I should add though - a preorder isn't the only possible topological sort. For example, a BFS on a tree from the root gives another topological ordering. In general, a topological sort on a tree is any ordering of the nodes such that 1) the root comes first 2) the rest of the sequence is some interleaving of a topological sort of the left subtree and a topological sort of the right subtree. On general DAGs, reverse post order always satisfies these conditions, but most DAGs (and trees) have multiple valid topological orderings.
