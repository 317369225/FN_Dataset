Given an in-order traversal of a special binary tree having property that the node is always greater than its left and right child. How can we reconstruct the tree efficiently?Since each node is greater than its children, hence the largest number is the list is root of the tree. --> Iterate through your in-order-traversal-list to find the largest number, and that becomes the root of your tree. Also the largest number in you list will split your list into two parts. Since it is an in-order-traversal, the first part of your list forms the left subtree of your root and the second part of your list forms the right subtree of your root. Now apply the above step recursively on the two sub-list thus obtained
