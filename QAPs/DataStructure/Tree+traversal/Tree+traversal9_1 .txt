How many ways can I traverse tree?该网页不存在附加信息...I'll use pictures to explain the different types of tree traversals. 1. In-Order Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the in-order function. Display the data part of root element (or current element). Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.In-order: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I 2. Pre-Order Display the data part of root element (or current element) Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.Pre-order: F, B, A, D, C, E, G, I, H 3. Post-Order Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the post-order function. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the post-order function. Display the data part of root element (or current element).Post-order: A, C, E, D, B, H, I, G, F 4. Breadth-First Search BFS searches an entire row (the breadth) of the search tree before moving on to the next row. 5. Depth-First Search DFS searches the tree by going down as far as possible and then backtracking when necessary, making a sort of outline of the tree as the nodes are visited. In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals are different variations of DFS traversal. A special type of DFS is iterative deepening depth-first search. Instead of a single breadth first search, run D depth first searches in succession, each search allowed to go one row deeper than the previous one. That is, the first search is allowed only to explore to row 1, the second to row 2, and so on. This "simulates'' a breadth first search at a cost in time but a savings in space. 6. Level Traversal Another term for breadth-first search.
