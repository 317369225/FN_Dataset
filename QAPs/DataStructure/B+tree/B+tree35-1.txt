What is the comparison between a binary search tree, an AVL tree, and a red black tree & B tree?
Binary Search Trees are simple unbalanced trees. When learning, you write one of these first. AVL Trees are balanced binary trees and you write these next (or pinch the source code from somewhere). These trees are the real McCoy of data structures. Red/Black Trees are another form of self-balancing tree but they are basically rubbish. B Trees store multiple keys per node in an attempt to optimise fetches on a Hard Disk Drive. They are incompetent because you canâ€™t iterate upon them. B+ Trees also store multiple keys per node (and store the key twice). They are commonly used for databases an... (more)
