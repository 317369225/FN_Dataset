Why are B+Trees insufficient for storing and indexing the types of data stored by R*-Trees?
A b-tree can be thought of as a special case of an r-tree. B-trees can order and compare the keys only over one dimension which allows them to access the data mapped to keys spread over a single dimension. R-trees on the other hand  can map the data to n-dimensional bounding boxes, which allows them to "compare and order"  over n dimensions. For example, r-trees can answer geospatial queries, which involves searching for objects in 2 dimensions; b-trees are not suitable for these kinds of use cases. 540 Views · 5 Upvotes
