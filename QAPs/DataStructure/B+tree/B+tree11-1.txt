What does it mean for B+ trees to have high fanout?
B+ tree is a dynamic data structure. Inserts or deletes leave tree height-balanced. The fanout of a node in a tree is defined to be the number of children the node has. The fanout of a tree is defined to be the maximum fan-out of any node in the tree. Because of high fan-out, B+ trees have a low height, which is log N to the base F, where N is total number of index records and F is average fan-out. B+ trees provide search in less number of disk hits. This is because B+ trees have very high fanout (typically on the order of 100+), which reduces the number of I/O operations required to find an e... (more)
