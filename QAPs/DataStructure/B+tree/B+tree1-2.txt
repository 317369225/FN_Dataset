What are B*trees?
B*trees are a special case (of mostly historical interest) of B+trees which guarantee that nodes are at least 2/3 full. They do this by requiring the root node to be 2 disk pages in size, and by using a node splitting algorithm that splits two full nodes into three nodes 2/3 full, and a node merging algorithm that combines three nodes 2/3 full into two full nodes. The splitting algorithm also shifts items to adjacent nodes when a node is full but its neighbors aren’t. The merging algorithm borrows items from neighboring nodes when it is less than 2/3 full but its neighbors aren’t. The extra ... (more)
