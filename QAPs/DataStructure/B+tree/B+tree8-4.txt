What are some real-world applications using B-tree?
any time I need to keep data sorted and conveniently searchable. nodes have the structure treenode treedata: whatever type of data (key) itemless: pointer itemmore: pointer so treenode->itemless points to nil (unused) or another treenode that has a key less than the current treenode->treedata I usually initialize pointers to -1 to indicate nodes are unused. insertions and searches are usually Log2(n) unless the data is already sorted on insertion into the tree. In that case, it becomes a horribly inefficient linked list. If unsure, use Knuth Shuffle on the data. Or if using strictly for sea... (more)
