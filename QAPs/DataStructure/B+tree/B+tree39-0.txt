Does mysql B+ tree store all important information in internal node?
Well it is dependent on what kind of storage you use. Each MyISAM table is stored on disk in three files. The files have names that begin with the table name and have an extension to indicate the file type. An .frm file stores the table format. The data file has an .MYD (MYData) extension. The index file has an .MYI (MYIndex) extension. All the data in InnoDB is stores in single tablespace be it index, table format or data. Tablespace can be raw disk partition. All InnoDB indexes are B-Trees where the index records are stored in the leaf pages of the tree. The default size of an index page is 16KB. When new records are inserted, InnoDB tries to leave 1/16 of the page free for future insertions and updates of the index records.
