What are the pros and cons of using a hash index instead of a B-tree index?
Short answer: hash indexes can be used for equality only.  They're faster than B-Trees for equality tests.  B-Trees support full order, so they can be used for all the comparison operators as well as allowing passive ORDER BY and GROUP BY statements, as well as stuff like prefix LIKE if the db engine is coded to allow this, but are slower for absolute equality than hashes as they're O(log N) to do lookups. Note that many non-memory hash index implementations are basically hash maps with btrees underneath for their individual "collision sets", so they aren't strictly O(1) lookup times, more... (more)
