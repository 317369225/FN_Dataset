How does a relational DBMS internally store its data? In what type of data structure? How does it offer the rapid retrieval without loading the entire database into the main memory (I have heard many DBMS use B-trees)?
How does DBMS 1. store data internally such that it overcomes main memory disadvantage ( i.e. rapid retrieval ) of file system ? There's no way to overcome the disadvantage vis-à-vis the performance of a file system compared to accessing data in main memory.  DMBSs go to great lengths to minimize file I/O, but it can never be eliminated. [Edit: I am speaking of persistent databases here; not in-memory databases.]   Database systems typically store data in fixed size blocks called pages.  The pages are (should be) a multiple of the disk blocking factor.  Recall that a disk is a 'block devic...
