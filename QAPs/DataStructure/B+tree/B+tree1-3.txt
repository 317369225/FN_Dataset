What are B*trees?
B-trees are preferred when decision points, called nodes, are on hard disk rather than in random-access memory (RAM). It takes thousands of times longer to access a data element from hard disk as compared with accessing it from RAM, because a disk drive has mechanical parts, which read and write data far more slowly than purely electronic media. B-trees save time by using nodes with many branches (called children), compared with binary trees, in which each node has only two children. When there are many children per node, a record can be found by passing through fewer nodes than if there ar... (more)
