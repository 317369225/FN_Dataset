What are the advantages of B+ Trees over B Trees?
Binary Tree : It is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. As such there is no relation between a parent and its left and right descendants. Hence they are unordered. Binary Search Tree : These are ordered binary trees with a recursive relation left<root<right which is followed at every node. Its due to this rule that helps in faster search,insertion and deletion. The best case is achieved when the tree is balanced. Note: Not all BSTs are self balancing. B-Tree : It is a generalization of a BST in that a node can have more than two children. These are self balanci... (more)
