What's the cost of searching an element in B Tree and B+ Tree?
Searching in any tree takes an amount of time proportional to the height of the tree. B and B+ trees are balanced trees so given a B or B+ tree with n  n nodes, the height of these trees is log(n)  log(n) . Therefore, it should take log(n)  log(n) time in the worst case to find an element because both B and B+ trees have a height of log(n)  log(n) . 3.1k Views · 2 Upvotes
