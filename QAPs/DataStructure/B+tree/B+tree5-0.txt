In filesystems, what is the advantage of using b-trees or b+trees as opposed to using inode indexes?
B-trees are balanced search trees that are optimized for large amounts of data. They are particularly well suited to on-disk storage. Searches, insertions, and deletions all take logarithmic time. The b+tree is a modification of the b-tree that stores data only in leaf nodes, minimizing search cost in the common and worst case, and (optionally) links together all the leaf nodes in a linked list, optimizing ordered access. The main benefits to a b-tree or b+tree is scalability and minimizing I/O. The rest of this answer applies to both trees, but for brevity I will just write "b-tree." B-t... (more)
