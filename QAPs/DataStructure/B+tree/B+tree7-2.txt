What is an intuitive explanation of the B-tree data structure?
B-Trees are very similar to indexed sequential search. Imagine you have a line of 100 buses, and each bus is named, and they are arranged sequentially. You can always use binary search to find the correct bus you are interested in. This will cost you at most 7 "looks" at the buses. Looks are the only thing of consequence in this model, since we assume that moving from one bus to any other bus is a O(1) time operation. Now, consider that you pull out every 20th bus, so that you have 20 sets of 5 buses each. Now, we can get to the correct set of 5 buses using just 5 "looks" and then we can ... (more)
