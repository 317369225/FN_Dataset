What is the meaning of B-Tree?
B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children . Here the specialty of B-tree is it allows node splitting and node redistribution when the number of elements inside the node exceeds its capacity. A B-tree is kept balanced by requiring that all leaf nodes be at the same depth. This depth will increase slowly as elements are added to the tree, but an increase in the overall depth is infrequent, and results in all leaf nodes being one more node farther away from the root. 370 Views Â· 4 Upvotes
