Why do most commercial RDBMSs use B+ Tree as the default indexing structure (preference over B-Tree, sequential indexing, etc.)?
There are two main reasons. The fanout in a B+ tree is much, much higher than in a B tree, so you can find an element with fewer I/O operations. Minimising the number of I/O operations is almost always the most important efficiency concern. Scanning the index is much more efficient in a B+ tree than a B tree.Scan operations are useful for queries like this: SELECT name FROM person WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 65 If there is an index on the age field, the DBMS can execute this query by finding the first record with age >= 18, and then scanning upwards from there until it finds a record with age > 65, or some variant of this method. In a B tree, this scan operation would require traversing up and down the tree, whereas in a B+ tree, you just follow the leaf blocks. 759 Views Â· 4 Upvotes
