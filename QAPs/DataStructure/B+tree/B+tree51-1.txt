What is the difference between a B-tree index and a Bitmap index in Oracle?
B-tree and Bitmap indexes are internally different but functionally they are same in retrieving rows faster than a full-table scan. Bitmap indexes are used on the columns which has lots of duplicate values(low cardinality) while B-tree indexes are useful when there is less or no duplicate values (high cardinality). And finally there is structural difference also, B-tree index uses a tree-like structure with index nodes, where Bitmap index uses a two dimensional array with zeros and ones (bits) values.
