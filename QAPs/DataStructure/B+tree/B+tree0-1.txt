What are the advantages of B+ Trees over B Trees?
Short Answer: It's all about branching factor. Because of the way B+-Trees store records (called "satellite information") at the leaf level of the tree, they maximize the branching factor of the internal nodes. High branching factor allows for a tree ofÂ  lower height. Lower tree height allows for less disk I/O. Less disk I/O theoretically means better performance. Long Answer: B-Trees ("B Trees") and B+-Trees ("B Plus Trees") are balanced search trees that perform well on magnetic media and secondary storage because they minimize disk I/O ops. * As a matter of background information, in ...
