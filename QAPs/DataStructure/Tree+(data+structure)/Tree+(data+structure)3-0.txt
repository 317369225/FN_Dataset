Which algorithm uses suffix tree data structure to store data?
Suffix tree is the tree made of suffixes of a string. However most of the algorithms uses suffix array which stores the suffixes of a string in lexicographical order. Suffix array can be used to find if some string is the substring of our original string. Ex. banana possible suffixes banana anana nana ana na a Suffix array a ana anana banana na nana Now suppose we need to find if ban is the substring of banana, Then in that case we search if ban+(some suffix)=banana. There are other applications of suffix tree and suffix array. Fore details Suffix Array | Set 1 (Introduction) - GeeksforGeeks
