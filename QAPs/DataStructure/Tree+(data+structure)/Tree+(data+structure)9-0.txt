Is there any book, which has all the codes for all the data structures? At least for all the tree data structures?
There are number of such books, but I recommend being very careful with them. For example, Sedgewick's classic two-volume book is available with C, C++ and Java codes (different variants). The algorithms are covered well, but students find the C++ codes difficult to read, and the codes look like they were just adapted from C (the C codes should be alright). Steven Skiena's algorithm design manual has sufficient codes to explain the algorithms (and good, compact explanations), but it does not explain programming technologies well. If you are interested in C++ rather than Java, my strong recommendation would be Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++: Mark A. Weiss: 9780132847377: Amazon.com: Books This is the 4th edition. The 3rd edition may still be OK, but not quite at the same level. Don't use older editions - the codes there as outdated as the codes in the books by Sedgewick and Skiena.
