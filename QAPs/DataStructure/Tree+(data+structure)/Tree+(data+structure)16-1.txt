How is a trie data structured considered an ordered tree data structure?
It is the basis of my forest sort. The primary tree has 26, 676, or 17,576 branches depending on list size. Each branch corresponds to the first letter(s) of words.Â  All A words go to the A branch, etc. This results in a sorted data structure that also speeds searching over the standard binary search. Another advantage is for extremely large lists or limited memory the trie can be coded to only store the remaining character not represented by the structure itself. For example, male, mail, made, machine, etc can be stored as le, il, de, chine in the ma tree saving 8 characters of storage.
