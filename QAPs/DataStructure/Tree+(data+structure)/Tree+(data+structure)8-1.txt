What are the uses of tree data structure?
A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)--or data structure implementing this ADT--that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and sub trees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes. A simple unordered tree; in this diagram, the node labeled 7 has two children, labeled 2 and 6, and one parent, labeled 2. The root node, at the top, has no parent. Uses of trees are: Representing hierarchical data Storing data in a way that makes it easily searchable Representing sorted lists of data As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects Routing algorithms
