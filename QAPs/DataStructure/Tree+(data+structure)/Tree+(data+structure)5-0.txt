What is the best web API for creating images of graph or tree data structures (nodes and edges)?
Arbor.js has some interesting characteristics and a simple API. For graph visualization, you will probably find it the easiest to get something up and running quickly. http://arborjs.org With the exception of Google Charts, Protovis and Processing.js, the others listed here so far are not web-based. The Google Charts graph library, based around GraphViz, is fairly ugly and clunky. There can be some issues with depending upon their API. Make sure you read the licensing. Protovis doesn't have very good examples for graph visualization, but does for tree rendering (dendrogram, etc). However, Protovis has been deprecated in favor of Mike Bostock's latest library, d3.js: http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ The comments for Protovis apply equally to d3. Processing.js is a good option. Raphael was not listed here, but is another best of class JavaScript library for SVG: http://raphaeljs.com
