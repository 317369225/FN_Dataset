What is the real life application of tree data structures?
Trees are helpful whenever hierarchical data is in use. File structures - Each file is located in a particular directory and there is a specific hierarchy associated with files and directories. Auto-complete feature - Predicting words based on particular prefixes Decision Tree based Learning actually forms a formidable area of data mining research. Numerous famous methods exist like bagging, boosting, and modifications thereof which work on trees. Such work is often used to generate a predictive model. Needless to say most XML/Markup parsers use trees. See Apache Xerces for example. Or, the Xalan XSLT parser. A common problem in bioinformatics is to search huge databases to find matches for a given query string. Tries are a common occurrence there.
