What are the differences between B+Tree and B-Tree?
B+ Trees are different from B Trees with following two properties: B+ trees don't store data pointer in interior nodes, they are ONLY stored in leaf nodes. This is not optional as in B-Tree. This means that interior nodes can fit more keys on block of memory. The leaf nodes of B+ trees are linked, so doing a linear scan of all keys will requires just one pass through all the leaf nodes. A B tree, on the other hand, would require a traversal of every level in the tree. This property can be utilized for efficient search as well since data is stored only in leafs. I have written a detail post on this. Might be useful: Memory locality & the magic of B-Trees! by Pawan Bhadauria on Love for Programming
