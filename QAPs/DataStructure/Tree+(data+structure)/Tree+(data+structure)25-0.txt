How do I make an animated trees data structure using Java code?
There is a Java applet called Slady which allows you to create convincing animations of trees in Java.  It has a very simple UI. Its actually pretty good. But here are a few things I didn't like: No speed control on the animation, so it gets a bit tedious (wish it could be spead up after awhile) Nonstandard terminology (what he calls a “B-Tree of order 1” is a 2-3 Tree, usually called a “B-tree of order 3”) No explanation of what is occurring, you just see the insert/delete take place in the animation.
