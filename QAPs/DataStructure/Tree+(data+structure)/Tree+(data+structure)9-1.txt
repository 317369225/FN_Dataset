Is there any book, which has all the codes for all the data structures? At least for all the tree data structures?
You should find this book very useful for Data Structures: Advanced Data Structures: Peter Brass: 9780521880374: Amazon.com: Books It contains clean implementations of all sorts of data structures in C as well as really concise explanations (and some math too!). It's probably one of the most comprehensive books you'll find out there on data structures. For algorithms, Robert Sedgwick's books (Algorithms, 4th Edition)  seem to be a little useful.
