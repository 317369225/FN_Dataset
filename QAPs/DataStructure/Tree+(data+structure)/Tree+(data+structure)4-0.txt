What is a tree data structure?
In CS a tree can be defined in many ways. One is Tree is a collection of nodes.The collection can be empty,which is sometimes denoted as A. Otherwise, a tree consists of a distinguished node r,called as root and zero or more (sub) trees T1,T2, ...., Tk, each of which roots are connected by the directed edge to r. The root of each sub-tree is said to be a child of r and r is the parent of each sub-tree root. From recursive definition, we find that a tree is collection of n nodes one of which is the root, and n-1 edges. That there are n-1 edges follows from the fact that each edge connects some nodes parents, and every node expect the root has a parent. Below is the simple tree diagram: For more detail you can refer below links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre... http://www.academictutorials.com... or can read the book "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C/C++/Java"Â  by Mark Allen Weiss depending upon the language you like C/C++/Java .
