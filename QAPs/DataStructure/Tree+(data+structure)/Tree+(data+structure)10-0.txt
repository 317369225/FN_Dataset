How would you explain a B-Tree data structure in layman's terms?
Consider an apartment complex/condo community that you are visiting, with 1000 apartments/Condos spread among several buildings and a gate in the middle. As you drive in the first board you meet says 1-500      501-1000  <-               -> The Apartment number you want to visit is 807, so take right. Next you see buildings each with numbers such as 501-550, 551-600 etc. Again you pick the building which says 801-850. Next you pick the floor which says 801-810 and finally apartment 807 itself. Now imagine not having the boards with numbers on them. you would have to visit every single apartment in the community to decide if apartment 807 is present there. Also, if the apartment community was not allowed to be split that way, It would be one huge building with 1000 individual apartments in it. A B Tree and a B+Tree are data structures used within a computer to achieve results similar to what is described in the example above. They simplify the search process for a specific piece of information and lets the storage space be organized better.  In the B-Tree picture above(shamelessly borrowed from Prateek Kumar's answer!!), the numbers themselves are the boards in the apartment complex. If you are looking for a number between 7 and 16, you navigate to the cell connected to the arrow between 7 and 16. The cells themselves are like the smaller apartment buildings. Only the specific cell that is likely to contain the information that is currently being searched for needs to be loaded into the memory he rest of the cells can be left out of the memory to optimize space, much like avoiding having one big building.
