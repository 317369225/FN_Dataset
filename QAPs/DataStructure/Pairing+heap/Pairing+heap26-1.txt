What do boating enthusiasts have in common?
Ian's answer fits my boating friends, and many others. However, boating enthusiasts covers a lot of people, including a large number with sufficient resources to pay to have all the work done for them, to keep their boats in marinas built for their kind, and to stay somewhat aloof from the general public. This is a growing group of boaters. As the middle class shrinks, fewer people can afford the cost of a pleasure boat. Kayaks and other small boats are increasingly popular, since storage and maintenance costs are low. I should add that many of the big, expensive boat owners are friendly, and anchor in the same places that the rest of us frequent. One generalization I can make is that almost every boating enthusiast like to eat fresh fish.
