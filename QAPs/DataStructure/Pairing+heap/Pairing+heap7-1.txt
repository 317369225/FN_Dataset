Is there a data structure for key-value pairs that allows insert, update, deletion and finding the minimal value all in log(n)?
Yes. A self-balancing binary search tree guarantees insertion, deletion and searching in logarithmic time. Use a C++ map for storing key-value pairs. It is implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree (Red-Black tree).
