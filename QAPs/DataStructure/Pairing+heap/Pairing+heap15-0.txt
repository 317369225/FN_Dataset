What are some mind-blowing facts about the Sun?
Every few days, the sun ejects a billion or so tons of solar material at a million degrees Kelvin out into the solar system. Sometimes, that mass heads straight towards the earth. It makes for pretty nights: though it causes a lot of sleeplessness among people who care about stuff outside the atmosphere (astronauts, satellite operators). The fact that it's at a million degrees is also pretty weird. Although the temperature inside the sun is much hotter, the surface is at a mere 5,000K, only about twice as hot as a light bulb. The reason for the high temperature of the Corona is still something of a mystery, called the Coronal Heating Problem.
