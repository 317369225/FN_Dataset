What are the most beautiful yet inexpensive places in the world to travel to?
1. Cambodia A favorite of backpackers and gap-year travelers, in Cambodia you can get book a hostel bed for $4. The flight may cost you, but with cheap food and accommodations, and plenty of free things do, this is easily one of the best places to go on a budget. 2. Nepal According to Lonely Planet, traveling in Nepal can cost you $5-$7 a day. That's if you stay in a budget accommodation and stick to eating the local Nepali cuisine. U.S. tourists must acquire a visa, but it's not too pricey -- they start at $25. 3. prague Europe is definitely not a cheap place to travel, but if you're looking for a destination there that won't drain your wallet, Prague is your best bet . Hostels clock in at $10-$15 a night and beer is cheaper than water. Plenty of activity can be had for free -- Prague is an incredibly beautiful city to simply walk and explore. 4. ThailandÂ  The average cost of travel in Thailand starts at $40 per day. That's a little more than other options, but with a number of cities to see, deliciously cheap street food to taste and a range of accommodations to choose from, it's a great place for budget travel. In Phuket, budget accommodations can be as low as $10 per night. For a splurge of around $100 a night, travelers can experience the kind of luxury that costs thousands stateside. Areas in Northern Thailand, such as Chiang Mai, are even cheaper. * I have been to Thailand and Cambodia before , its definitely a beautiful and historically evolved place . source :Huffington Post
