What is a binary heap?
Heap is specialized data structured, basically based on tree data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heap Property: Suppose node A is a parent of node B, there is a special ordering of the value of node A with respect to the value of node B. 'This heap property applies across the heap for every parent-child node pairs. The ordering of the values can be increasing or decreasing order. According to the ordering of parent and child node values, there are two types of heap data structure: Min Heap Data Structure Max Heap Data Structure In min heap, for every pair of parent and descendant child node, parent node have always lower value than descended child node. In max heap, for every pair of parent and descendant child node, parent node have always greater value than descended child node.
