Why does my husband hate me so much for wanting to use my brain?
Good advice already, but I will add this: Domestic violence perpetrators have some fairly common characteristics. At the top of the list is very low self esteem and feeling inferior, which leads to attempts to keep a partner at a, perceived by them, lower level. This can be done by any derogatory comment about your mind, body, family, self, or anything else that might bring you down. A second characteristic that is common, is control. If they cannot love themselves, they live in fear of losing their "partner." They would see Quora as a place where there are many potential competitors for your affection with whom they simply can't compete. Therefore, out of fear, they control your life to remove any influence that could possibly alert you to their imperfections. They will state that they will "never (abuse) you again," and they will make themselves actually believe it. They are confusing their belief that they can simply "make" themselves behave respectfully with understanding what is truly involved. They must learn a vast amount, involving serious self-examination and introspection, before they are likely to heal and change. A third characteristic is that they can be, when it suits their purpose, some of the most charming folks you ever met.
