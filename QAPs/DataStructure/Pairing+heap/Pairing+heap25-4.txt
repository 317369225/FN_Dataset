Why would you choose to have more than one child?
I asked my mother why she opted for me after my elder brother. Mama: Voh akele bore hote rehta tha saara din. Khelne ke liye koi nahi tha. ( Your brother felt bored. He needed someone to play with) On a serious note, Siblings bring a controlled growth. Be it a sister or brother. They develop ways with everything. Parents find it easy to make them learn, as one can set an example(good/ bad) for the other. They have a bit of parenthood in them as they grow together. Elder sibling behaves a mini parent for the young. Tend to be more responsible. Idea of sharing becomes obvious. Children learn to share, from emotions to materials. What else parents can ask for? Sense of security is enhanced. Parents can go to complete errands under the preview of elder sibling. Multiplication of love. More the children, more the innocent hugs and kisses. On the whole, having more than one child is a bliss.
