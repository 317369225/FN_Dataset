I recently noticed that some companies/developers, migrated or adopted Go language over Node.js. Why is that?
As expected, the hype around Node.js is reducing. Not that Node.js is not a bad technology: it introduce a lot of interesting things, but I think it's hard to create complex application with it. Despite what Node.js enthousiast said, callback hell is here, and there are much easiest way to do collaborative multitasking than this. As a result, the trendsetters are moving to the next cool technology, which is currently Go, which solve some the node.js issues, but as always, introduce new problems. But as an advice, both are interesting to know and are potential solutions, depending of your problem..... Updated 29w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
