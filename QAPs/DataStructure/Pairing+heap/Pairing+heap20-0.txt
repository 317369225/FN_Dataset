I recently noticed that some companies/developers, migrated or adopted Go language over Node.js. Why is that?
Your app grows up. A junior developer looks for the ultimate language. An experienced developer knows that a product has different tooling needs when it is in beta compared to a product that has been in production for a year or two. As humans change partners, living arrangemnets , hobbies, habits and food as we grow older, apps will have different needs. Go is a pseudo-system language specifically made for concurrency. While Node.js is a great way to very cheaply get a decently performing message-based service running, it is less ideal once your application starts getting more mature. The flexibility of Node.js is not as important to you any more, since you nowadays know what your app is, unlike in the early days when you weren't even sure if your app was a good idea in the first place. Now, your app is successful, and changes less, and you are more willing to sacrifice that flexibility for ease of maintenance and stability.
