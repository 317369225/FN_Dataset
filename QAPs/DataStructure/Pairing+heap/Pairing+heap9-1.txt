What are the most important data structure and algorithms to prepare for Google Interview?
I've recently faced an interview with google (Didn't get any feedback yet). Hash Tables , Binary Search Trees , Linked Lists are the data structures you will need frequently in the interviews. And you will need problem solving techniques like Dynamic Programming , Binary Search more than algorithms. And even if you are asked algorithmic questions, those will involve trivial classic algorithms like BFS, DFS, Flows ( I was asked a question which I solved with flows ) etc.
