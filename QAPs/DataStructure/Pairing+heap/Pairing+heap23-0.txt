What real world problem does the heap data structure solve in computer science?
Heaps are especially useful when you need to query for the minimum value multiple times from a dynamic collection of values. This is because obtaining the minimum requires constant time, but the insertion and deletion operations are still very efficient, at O(log n) time. Â  There are a couple of common uses of the heap in major algorithms: 1) Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between a pair of nodes: Dijkstra's algorithm The heap allows you to pick the closest unexplored node at each iteration to continue the search from it. One real-world application of this algorithm is the routing of network packets between two nodes. 2) Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree: Prim's algorithm A heap allows you to select very quickly a new minimum-cost edge that expands your current minimum spanning tree. A real-world application of this algorithm is the wire layout for a service network, such as electricity or cable. You want to provide service coverage to an entire area with the minimum wiring cost possible.
