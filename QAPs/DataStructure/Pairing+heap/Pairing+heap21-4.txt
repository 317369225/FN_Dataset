What are the most beautiful yet inexpensive places in the world to travel to?
My answer to this question would be similar to this answer: Onne Vegter's answer to What are the best cities for travelling? Except that I would broaden the destination to South Africa in general, not just Cape Town. I'm sure there are many other contenders, but ever since the South African Rand has slipped to around 12 to the US Dollar, South Africa has become extremely affordable, and is one of the best value for money places among international destinations. And there is no doubt that South Africa is one of the most scenic, beautiful places on the planet. Stunning coastline and beaches, majestic mountains, wide open spaces, beautiful wildlife in several world class game reserves, vibrant cities full of beautiful people, and breathtaking landscapes ranging from semi-desert to subtropical forests. A common concern among people who have never been here is the reportedly high levels of crime and violence. However, the picture painted by the media is very different from the reality on the ground, in particular from the tourist perspective. Most of the crime, violence, protests and, more recently, the attacks on foreign immigrants in certain regions, is localized in the townships or slums, neglected areas with high levels of poverty and unemployment. It does not affect the typical tourist regions and game reserves, and millions of visitors come to South Africa every year and enjoy a safe and wonderful vacation with no incidents. Every major world city has its dodgy neighborhoods where poverty is rife and crime is high, and South African cities are no different. Don't let the media-generated fear about a high crime rate cause you to miss out on this beautiful destination.
