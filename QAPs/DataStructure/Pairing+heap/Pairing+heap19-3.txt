Is it sexism that companies' dress codes permit women (but not men) to wear sandals?
It is discriminatory behavior based on one's sex, so yes, it is sexism. I would need to know the motivation behind the rule to determine if it's body shaming or not. It does seem like something people who oppose gender roles should oppose.
