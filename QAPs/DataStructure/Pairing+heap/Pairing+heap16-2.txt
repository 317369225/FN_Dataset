What is C++ abstract machine?
Abstract machines are the core of what defines a programming language. A wide variety of operating systems and plethora of hardware ensures a bewildering number of things we call computers. When we write a program we generally don’t want to think about the differences between all these platforms. We’d like to somehow be abstracted from all that and simply worry about our problem domain. To do so we choose some portable programming language. Something which doesn’t care about what hardware it is running on.A program is nothing more than a series of instructions; they have to control something. .This machine is called the abstract machine, or sometimes the virtual machine.
