What are some tell-tale signs of a cargo-cult start up?
Perception (or process) over results. An example would be reprimanding an employee for being tardy to a (non-essential and internal i.e., no customers involved) meeting even if the said employee has been working into the wee hours. A qualitative of quantitative dissonance between managers and makers. An example is a company where none of the founders can individually contribute to product development. Another example is one where most employees are given a CxO/VP/Director title. Other examples are companies that have brought in high-profile managers, but have not filled critical individual contributor roles (e.g., product development is either outsourced or hasn't actually occurred). (For software startups aimed at small businesses and consumers), focusing engineering efforts on performance, reliability, and scalability prior to launching. Obviously this doesn't apply to infrastructure startups or consumers startups which have launched and are experiencing actual scalability problems. A more acerbic way to put it would be writing blog posts on how they're using MongoDB, while coyly stating that the entire data set fits in a single machine's main memory.
