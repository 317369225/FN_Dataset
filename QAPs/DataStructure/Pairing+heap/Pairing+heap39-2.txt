What is the fastest way to find the number of common strings in two files?
Convert Each String to a Hash Value : to do this label the characters [0-9],[a-z],[A-Z] from 0 to 62 (10 nos,26 lowercase,26 uppercase,1 '-') and write their string in labels to their corresponding base 62 for example the word "abc" = [0,1,2] = (62^2)*0+(62^1)*1+(62^0)*2 assuming the label for a,b,c are 0,1 and 2 Now choose three distinct big prime nos and mod the corresponding hash value with these three prime nos(say x,y,z). Form a hash Table with these mod values x,y,z with files seperately and have a counter for each hash Note : 1.We choose prime numbers because collision is less (Read Hashing Theory) 2. Choose three because to make sure probablity of collision despite will tend to zero
