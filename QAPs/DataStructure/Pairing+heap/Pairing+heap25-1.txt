Why would you choose to have more than one child?
Having two is harder than having one in some ways, but not in others. There is more work, but less stress. You know what you're doing... not everything causes that gut-clenching panic of "I'm failing this whole parenting thing". Maybe you won't ever want two. Maybe one is enough for you. But don't make that decision in the first few weeks! You change and grow. By the time you think about having number 2, number 1 is easier to handle. You realize those sleep-deprived months and endless diapers don't last forever, and the brilliant, beautiful little person you're raising is a real person! How cool is that? As a mom, it absolutely blows me away that these little people came out of my body, and yet they are their own people. They have opinions and talents and gifts and ideas that are not mine, and yet I have the privilege of helping shape their lives, of loving them and teaching them and nurturing them and even disciplining them. They are themselves but they are also mine... they are part of me and yet they are not me. "Mommy, I really really really really love you." "I love you too, Sweetie." "I love you lots." "I love you even more." "Do you love me more than purple?" *while running* "Look at me! Look at my little legs go! I'm shaking the whole sidewalk!" Because watching a baby giggle at an older sibling's antics is absolutely hilarious. Because you miss the smell of a baby fresh out of a bath, of milk on a pillowy cheek. Because peach fuzz on a soft little head is the most beautiful feeling. Because love stretches and grows; you don't get to the end of it.
