What do boating enthusiasts have in common?
An eye on the weather, epoxy under the fingernails, bruises in some odd locations, some friends of unknown provenance,Â  a skinned knuckle, a shin with some anti foul paint, other fingernails with bird poo under them, a really grotty pair of shorts, a collection of mysterious stainless steel bits that don't seem to go anywhere, a hole in their bank balance, a few scary memories, and whole heap of great memories, and an anticipation of making more.
