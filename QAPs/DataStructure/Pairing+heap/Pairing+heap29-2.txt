What are Master and Slave databases and how does pairing them make web apps faster?
"Master" and "slave" are the two roles in MySQL replication. From the manual (MySQL 5.6 Reference Manual :: 16 Replication): Replication enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to be replicated to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves). Replication is asynchronous by default - slaves need not to connected permanently to receive updates from the master. This means that updates can occur over long-distance connections and even over temporary or intermittent connections such as a dial-up service. Depending on the configuration, you can replicate all databases, selected databases, or even selected tables within a database. One way this could improve latency in a web app: if you have a heavily loaded master, you can distribute read load to one or more slaves (handwaving any consistency issues).
