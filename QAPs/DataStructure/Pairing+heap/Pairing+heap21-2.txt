What are the most beautiful yet inexpensive places in the world to travel to?
Yes Nepal is amazing. I have been to this stunning country 4 times since 2006 and will go back, as I have friends there and it's a holy and life-changing place. My son invited me to visit him there 10 years ago, and he has since founded a non-profit, Beyond the Four Walls empowering Nepali girls with education at his tech hub in Bhaktapur. He has raised $8725 to give shelter food and medicine to the people in the most dire need, every dollar helps Nepal, and his 501 (c) 3 is right now working daily relief help. Lets all do a little and we will help Nepal a lot. Check it out now Â Transparent Direct Nepal 2015 Earthquake Relief Photo credit: Mary Bartnikowski Photographer | bartnikowski.com
