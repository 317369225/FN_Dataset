What algorithms should I know to become a good programmer?
There is no specific algorithm that you should know to be a great programmer. Programming Languages available these days have already implemented most of the important task for us. While implementing sppecific operation, you just need to call Namespace and utilise the implemented task in your business logic. This does not mean that you should not know how to write code. You should be very proficient in writing shortest and bug free code, which requires pactice, practice and lot of practice. You should study Data Sructures religiously and it will be very helpful for you. There are many topics that have already been answered by "Ashish Kedia". Best of Luck.
