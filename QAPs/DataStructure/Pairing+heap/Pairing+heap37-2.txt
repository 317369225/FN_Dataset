Who is the world's greatest living badass, and why?
Larry Page and Sergey Brin founders of google are the greatest badasses who live. I believe this to be true due to their ambitious innovative connection to the future as well as well as their relevance and impact in society today. I feel that if you could see social networking such as Facebook and Twitter to be like the conscious mind of the developed world, then google would be its subconscious mind... It's powerful full of information but these guys know how to actually place the vast pockets of information to use for the future world. They invest in R&D that could revolutionize the way people live again and again, with research and development and company buyouts in the fields of Robots, cars that drive themselves and the development of bioengineered meats so animals don't take up the planet in 2050 when the population is projected to be at 10 billion. These guys get it and their the pioneer leaders of consolidating the technological era of chaos into order...
