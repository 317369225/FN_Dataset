What is a Fibonacci Heap?
A Fibonacci Heap is a fancy data structure designed to support the same operations as a binary heap but has slightly better asymptotic running time: inserting a node onto a heap is [math]O(1)[/math] instead of [math]O(\log(n))[/math]. There's some more detail on the Wikipedia page here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fib... In practice, the high constant hidden by the big-O notation in any real implementation means that it will rarely actually be faster than a binary heap. That, combined with the complexity of the implementation means that Fibonacci Heaps aren't typically actually used, and are mostly of theoretical interest. Updated 314w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
