If you could have any one 'thing' you wanted, what would be that top item on your wishlist?
Ambition. I'd love a bit of that, I have none. I have spent my life helping those less fortunate than me, it's been a great ride. I'm intelligent and introverted, the world often seems too much, it scares the shit out of me, to rise above that, with a definite goal would be be amazing. I worry I'm gonna look back with regret, I've done a lot of good and I'm proud of it, but something is missing. Fulfilling a goal isn't something I remember doing very often, I know it's about the journey, I'd like to take that journey.
