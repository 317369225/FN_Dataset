What are the most important data structure and algorithms to prepare for Google Interview?
Stick to Basics. I would classify the following data structures as **must know** Linked List - Single and Doubly Stack Queues Binary Search Trees or general Binary Tree Heaps Basic Graph Traversal and Shortest Path Hashing Following data structures may be asked. I would say that their probability of being asked is between 50 to 75% - Tries Advance Graphs like flow and min-cut etc. Bit Manipulation You will probably crack interviews with sufficient knowledge of above. Following have very low probability of being asked ( < 25%) : Segment Trees / Binary Indexed Trees AVL Trees B+ Trees Other hard data structures are absolutely unnecessary. Following Algorithms / Tricks / Topics may also be important : Memory Management Basic Co-ordinate geometry - Manhattan Distance, Closest Point Pair Divide and Conquer Greedy Dynamic Programming - Extremely important Probability and basic Number Theory Sorting and Searching Following topics is important for Knowledge / Experience based questions : OS - Threads, Processes and Locks using Mutex, Semaphores (Operating systems Archives - GeeksforGeeks) Scalability Issues, RPCs, Rate limiter, etc. OOP Concepts Databases - SQL, NoSQL, Writing simple Queries, Transactions, ACID Linux Commands - sed, grep, ps, etc. Resources : GeeksforGeeks | A computer science portal for geeks Programming Interview Questions | CareerCup Coding Interview preparation made easy Buy Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions Book Online at Low Prices in India (Bible - Seriously) Edit: Related Answer : Ashish Kedia's answer to How do I prepare for the Google APAC exam?
