What is it like to be chased by a cow down the street?
Does this qualify? While not exactly being chased by a cow... the Pamplona bull run during the San Fermin festival is one of the best things I have done in my entire life. The exhilaration, the thrill is unmatched! being chased by a bunch of big bulls after staying up partying the entire night was an awesome experience! Setting: We were standing towards the end of the run as we wanted to be in the bull ring post the street chase. you could literally feel the excitement in the air as you hear the rockets going up! Since we were standing towards the end of the street, we could see the people running from some distance. we were somewhere near the red circle The actual chase: the actual running in front of the bulls didn't last for more than 5 seconds (the street part). It ended with me and my wife lying on the side of the road with our faces down fearing for our lives. The ending: The shaking of the ground when the bulls ran past us signalled the end of the street run for us. have to say it was a big relief to have walked injury free from this (my wife would disagree, she has a small scar on her hand from injuring herself when we fell). Have to say felt something like this... Plus doing it on the day of our 1st marriage anniversary made it an extra special day! Note: All images taken from the web. too scared to take my camera out from the pocket during the run!
