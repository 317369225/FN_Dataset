What are some mind-blowing facts about the Sun?
Just sharing a few: Each second, the Sun loses 5 million tons of material. timeline It takes up to 50 million years for the energy produced at the core of the Sun to reach its surface. timeline If a drop sized piece of matter from the core of the Sun was placed on the surface of the Earth, no living organism would survive for a distance of 150 km from that drop, as it would be like a nuclear explosion.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eff... The volume of Sun is equivalent to the volume of 1.3 million earths.  http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/educ... Unlike the Earth, the Sun is completely gaseous, there is no solid surface on the Sun. The Sun - Introduction The Sun's gravitational pull is so strong that, even Pluto, (once considered a planet), 5.8 billion kilometers away from Sun, is kept in  orbit. http://www.nasa.gov/audience/for... In 3.5 billion years the Sun will be 40% brighter than it is today. At that point the oceans will have evaporated and all forms of terrestrial life will be extinct. http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ti... Updated 163w ago • View Upvotes
