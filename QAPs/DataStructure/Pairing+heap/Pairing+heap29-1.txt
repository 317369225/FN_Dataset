What are Master and Slave databases and how does pairing them make web apps faster?
Master databases receive data from applications. Slave databases get copies of that data from the masters. Slaves are therefore read-only from the application's point of view while masters are read-write. Writes to a database are more "expensive" than reads.  Most web applications require a much higher ratio of reads to writes.  So setting up master-slave replication in the right scenario lets an application distribute its queries efficiently.
