Is it sexism that companies' dress codes permit women (but not men) to wear sandals?
It's not body shaming, it's about enforcing gendered dress codes. For example, men wearing pumps is not considered appropriate office attire, but they're completely appropriate for women. You may not want to wear high heels to work, so this may not affect you, but it plays very much into our ideas about what is appropriate for women vs. men. The same is true for skirts, dresses, bras, and other items that are highly gendered. For women, dress sandals (either always or usually with heels, I'm not sure) are a fairly common kind of shoe, in the same way that pumps are. They're appropriate for business occasions. For men, sandals are casual footwear, like gladiator sandals, Birkenstocks, Tevas, things like that. Those kinds of casual sandals are available for women too, but if they're not appropriate for men, they're not appropriate for women in the office either -- if anything, women's work attire is expected to be more formal. Eventually, it would be nice for gendered dress codes to be thrown into the trash heap of history. If guys want to wear a dress and a cute pair of slingbacks to work, good for them. But in the mean time, the distinction you're talking about is because sandals can mean different things by gender, not because women are allowed to wear casual footwear thst men can't.
