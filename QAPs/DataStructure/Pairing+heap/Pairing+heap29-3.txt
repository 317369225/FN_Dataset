What are Master and Slave databases and how does pairing them make web apps faster?
It doesn't just speed up things (by distributing reads among slaves), but it will also make it safer. In case of a problem with the master, you can swap any slave into a new master. The only hiccup with this setting, as Toby said, is consistency of data during the replication process.
