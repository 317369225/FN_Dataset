If you could have any one 'thing' you wanted, what would be that top item on your wishlist?
Maybe I should say I would really like to have wisdom, world peace, or a superpower.  But honestly, the one thing I'd really like to have is a Dale Chihuly blown glass art chandelier.  Any Dale Chihuly chandelier. I would not even consider being picky, because they are all so beautiful, I'd consider myself the luckiest person on earth to have one. More : Dale Chihuly - Artist - Chandeliers
