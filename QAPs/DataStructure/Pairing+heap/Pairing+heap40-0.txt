What is it like to be chased by a cow down the street?
Leonard Kim, I tell you about one thing in the middle of a drink and you ask me this question! Sigh, I will honour this though. Because I'm feeling generous. I was on my way home from school once, and as I was walking, I felt that someone was following me, so I looked back, only to find an indifferent cow right behind me. Animals generally make me a little uncomfortable, so I started to walk a little faster, only to see that the cow for some reason also started to move a bit fast as well. I finally started to sprint and realized that the freakin' cow has some vendetta against me and continued to chase me for quite a distance till I finally crossed the road and got to the other side of the road. Relieved because I was certain that the cow wouldn't be able to get to the other side, I ran into a couple of friends whom I was narrating my story to, and happened to discover the freakin' cow chasing me. Again. For some reason (or the only valid one), my friends started running as well, and the cow ended up taking an interest in my friend (she was cuter, that's my reasoning). After a good 20 minutes, we went into hiding and the cow left us alone. Tl;dr, cows are scary, weird and can have random vendettas whenever they want to, and it's terrifying to be chased by one. Also, they can cross the road perfectly, even in Indian traffic. I discussed the incident with my friends later. They said mating season may have been going on (I was a chubby kid). -_- Updated 76w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
