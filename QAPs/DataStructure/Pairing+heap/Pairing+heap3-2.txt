How can we merge two binary heaps efficiently?
If both heaps are empty, return an empty heap.  If one heap is empty but the other is not, return the nonempty heap.  If both heaps are nonempty, convert them into lists, combine the lists, and heapify the resulting list.  If you're clever about how you do that combination, this can be very efficient.
