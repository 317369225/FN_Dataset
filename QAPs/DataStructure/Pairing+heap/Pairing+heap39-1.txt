What is the fastest way to find the number of common strings in two files?
dynamic programming algorithms should be able to speed this up a lot. Look at BLAST+, BLAT, bowtie, RMAP or other read mapping algorithms for a heuristic solution to this problem that allow mismatches. There may be ways to allow for only exact matches using that software. Many of these programs are designed to match millions of short strings (200 characters or less) to a single long string (billions of characters), with high degeneracy (4 letter alphabet). You could probably adapt these approaches for your problem.
