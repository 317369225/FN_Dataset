How do I use dijkstra's algorithm in competitive programming?
You can always use dijkstra's algorithm if you really want to and time constraints are not there. Because Dijkstras' has much more time complexity than other better solutions. Focusing on your question, if you want to use Dijkstra's Algorithm -- Use adjency matrix representation of graph. And for this, <vector> in STL of C++ comes very useful. Have look at some basic operations on vector and you will easily be able to solve your problem. You need not do any linking of node stuff, vector does it for you. It is efficiently implemented there.
