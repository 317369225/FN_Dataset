Why does my husband hate me so much for wanting to use my brain?
Your husband hates you for wanting to use your brain because you are threatening his perceived dominance over you. He wants you to be the lesser and he the greater in the relationship. There are probably other aspects of your relationship where you will notice this. You are not doing anything wrong other than giving in to his childish insecurities. If you threaten him with your intelligence simply by reading, that's his problem, not yours. You can certainly help him get over his insecurities, but it doesn't seem like he wants to. He is insecure and using you to make him feel better about himself. This is an abusive, controlling behavior that can be a precursor to physical abuse. He is attempting to keep you in a subservient and submissive role in the relationship. Do not let him. If you cannot exist as equals, the relationship will not work. Get counseling. If he refuses, leave him. His behavior is toxic and dangerous. It can escalate and it may have already. Does he tell you when and where you can go? Does he control who you talk to or see? Does he tell you what you can and can't wear? Does he threaten you with violence? Does he abuse you physically or mentally? Does he tell you that it's your fault that he has to do these things? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you are in an abusive relationship. He will likely not change and the abuse will continue. Please seek professional help.
