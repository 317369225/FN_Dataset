If you could have any one 'thing' you wanted, what would be that top item on your wishlist?
For a long time now I have imagined a floating city/state in the Pacific, powered by Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). Conceived as new home for boat-people and other refugees. Operating an oceanic trash recycling service, as well as extracting commercial minerals from seawater via electro-deposition. I was thinking it could be boxed out in reinforced ferro-concrete on an iceberg which would also provide the initial water-supply charge. The structure would self-float as the iceberg melted.  The deed structure would provide security and stability while a broad surface structure could create an artificial reef for "sea-ranching" of necessary food supplies. Found a proposal that looks sort of what I imagine the underwater bit to look like: Lady Landfill Skyscraper But something like a cross between the following two images at the surface: "Noah's Ark" and "天上人间 -- Tian-shan-ren-jian"
