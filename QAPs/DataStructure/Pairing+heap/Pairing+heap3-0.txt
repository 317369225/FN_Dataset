How can we merge two binary heaps efficiently?
This isn't exactly what you're asking, but you should consider re-implementing your program to use mergeable heaps. There are actually two variants of mergeable heaps: Leftist heaps and Binomial heaps. I've personally only implemented leftist heaps before, but both of these variants will give you all of the following operations in O(log n) time: Insert a new element Find the minimum (maximum) element Delete the minimum (maximum) element Decrease the key of any given element Delete any given element Merge two heaps into a single heap And the code is insanely short too. (For leftist heaps in particular, once you implement a simple merge function, everything else is just a call to that function.) Isn't that awesome?
