Is it sexism that companies' dress codes permit women (but not men) to wear sandals?
Yes, it is sexism—benevolent sexism, in the sense that it is more acceptable for women to expose their feet than it would be for a man. It's not a black and white issue, though; women have a more developed and varied shoe market and a women's sandal can mean something much more dressy than anything available to men, but it is still technically discrimination. Frankly, though, while equal dress codes fall under issues that would be addressed by the goals of feminism, I think sandals are pretty low on the priority list for gender equality, so I don't think feminists should really care that much about it right now. Considering how trivial a man's right to open shoes looks against ingrained societal attitudes regarding rape, productivity, intelligence, independence, etc. that adversely affect women, wouldn't you agree?
