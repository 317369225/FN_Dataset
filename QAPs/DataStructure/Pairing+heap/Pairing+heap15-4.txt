What are some mind-blowing facts about the Sun?
Just sharing a few that I know of... The color of the Sun is not Yellow, or Orange or Red, but is White. 99.85% mass of our Solar System belongs to the Sun. Now that's mind blowing. Internal Core Temperature is 15 Million Degrees Celsius Surface Temperature is 5,500 Degrees Celsius 330,000 times more massive than Earth. 1.3 Million Earths can fit inside the volume of the Sun Will continue to burn/shine for another roughly 5 Billion years.
