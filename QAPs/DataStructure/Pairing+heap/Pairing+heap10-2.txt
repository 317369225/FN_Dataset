What are the minimum set of required computer science skills for a web developer who does not have a CS degree to be a good programmer?
Honestly, a lot of computer science theory isn't necessary or important for what web developers do on a day-to-day basis. I completed my degree in CS 15 years ago, and the only time I've had to think about linked lists or binary trees have been in job interviews, writing code on whiteboards. As a professional web developer, what you're doing 99% of the time is software engineering, rather than computer science. They have a lot of the same underpinnings, and a lot of the software you use on a daily basis wouldn't work if it weren't for CS theory and research. But if you're programming in ruby, and have an unsorted array, you can just call sort on it, without needing to know which algorithm it's using. I agree with Edgar that hash maps (and arrays) are the most useful data structures to know. It's good to know the difference between linear searches and binary searches, 'cause that gives you insight on why indices are important in databases. If anything, I'd spend some time learning about how databases work, since almost all web applications have databases behind them. Some basic networking is good to know. Maybe learning a bit about cryptography, at least the differences between symmetrical encryption, crypto hashes, and public/private key encryption. In general, just keep learning, especially stuff that is interesting and relevant to your work. If you bump up against something that requires you to learn some more CS theory, then learn it. But it will be in the context of something practical that you care about.
