How is the virtual method table implemented in Java?
From JVM specification Page on oracle.com "The Java Virtual Machine does not mandate any particular internal structure for objects. In some of Oracleâ€™s implementations of the Java Virtual Machine, a reference to a class instance is a pointer to a handle that is itself a pair of pointers: one to a table containing the methods of the object and a pointer to the Class object that represents the type of the object, and the other to the memory allocated from the heap for the object data." That is slightly different from C++ where objects could be placed on a stack and not only on heap so in C++ pointer to vtable would be at the beginning or the end of the object among other members of the class.
