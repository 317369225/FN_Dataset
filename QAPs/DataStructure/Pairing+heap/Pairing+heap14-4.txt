I just bought CLRS. What's the best way to obtain the knowledge this book offers?
Why do you want to read this book? If your only reason is "to obtain the knowledge," you're not likely to be successful. That's too abstract. Pick something more tangible. For example: If you're preparing for a technical interview or competitive programming, find a source of questions, and use the book as a reference when you get stuck. Pick a project to work on, and implement the algorithms/data structures yourself rather than using the ones provided by your language libraries. When you need something, look up how to implement it. If you're trying to make up for some missing background, find a class like Design and Analysis of Algorithms and use the book as a resource. Having a goal will give you something to attach your new knowledge to, and will make it more likely that you'll remember it. You can also take a look at this question: How do I plan and complete reading "Introduction to Algorithms" and implement a decent number of algorithms within a period of one month?
