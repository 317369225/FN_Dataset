Why is it impossible to have a comparison sort better than O(nlogn) time?
In any comparison sorting algorithm, the minimum number of comparisons required is log(n!). But according to Stirling's approximation, we know that log(n!) is in Ω(nlogn), and hence we cannot have a comparison sort better than Ω(nlogn) time.
