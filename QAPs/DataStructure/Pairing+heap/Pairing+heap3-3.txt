How can we merge two binary heaps efficiently?
You can create a heap from an array in [math]\Theta(n)[/math] time using the BuildHeap algorithm.  So just merge the two arrays in [math]\Theta(n)[/math] time and call BuildHeap on it for a [math]\Theta(n)[/math] algorithm. To save memory, you can make a function that takes two arrays as input as well as an index, k, and returns the kth element of the concatenation of the two arrays.  You can use that function to simulate that the arrays are merged, so you won't have to create the merged array.  You will need a similar function for swapping the values at two indices as well. See: Heap Sort for a description of BuildHeap.
