Why would you choose to have more than one child?
So you realize that it's not you, it's them. That your parenting philosophies haven't molded them like clay into the adults they will eventually become; most of thay stuff was already in there, for better or worse. In other words you can raise them exactly the same and they could still turn out totally different. With just one child you would never reach that understanding. Also it gives them someone else to share, play, and fight with. Updated 38w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
