If you could have any one 'thing' you wanted, what would be that top item on your wishlist?
Perspectacles. Not available (or invented) yet, they are a simple pair of glasses that upon donning can help you see things from another person's perspective. And I don't just mean visually. I'd be able to meet people and easily work out what their priorities were and why, what motivates them, what barriers they have to achieving healthy happy lives. This is how I think they'd look: I'd wear them at work all the time. They'd help me figure out how to convince people to get tested for HIV, how to design better programs so that people can access treatment for tuberculosis. Screw focus group discussions I have my perspectacles! I'd never get in a argument again. I'd just slip on my glasses in a disagreement and then let the other person have a look at me through them and we'd intelligently come to a solution. In my leisure time I'd look at artists with them. I'd look at children as they wonder at the world. I'd look at the elderly. I'd lend them to politicians and bureaucrats. Without these I'm forced (happily) to go around and ask people heaps of questions. My biases and experiences make it tricky for me to come around to other people's point of view, I have to work hard to gain insight. My spectacles would make my life full of epiphanies.
