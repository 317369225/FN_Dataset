Is it sexism that companies' dress codes permit women (but not men) to wear sandals?
Yes, it's sexist, but also irrelevant. If closed-toed shoes aren't needed to do the job, then the dress code shouldn't require them for anyone. Keep employees happy, productive, and comfortable, so long as it doesn't pose a safety issue - comfort, and therefore, increased productivity, is much more important than superficial "professionalism." I know I am horribly distracted when my feet are stuffed into cramped shoes and sweating, and no one at my workplace gives two damns if I walk around in flip-flops or barefoot.
