Can the graph isomorphism problem be solved in polynomial time?
The answer is We don't know. It is a long standing open problem, it is also special in the notion that, we also have not been able to prove whether Graph Isomorphism is NP-Complete (which would mean it is unlikely to admit a polynomial time solution) .It is currently one of the two major algorithmic problems for which neither do we know if it is NP-Complete, nor do we have a polynomial time algorithm. (The other being integer factorization). Currently researchers have defined a new class [math]GI[/math] which is the class of problems that can be in polynomial time reduced to the Graph Isomorphism problem. But the problem admits a polynomial time solution for many of the special cases like Trees and Planar Graphs. Check out : Graph isomorphism problem
