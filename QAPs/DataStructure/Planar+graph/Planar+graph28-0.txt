I was told my child who can add and subtract can enjoy Eulerâ€™s formula about faces, vertices, and edges, can someone explain it simply?
I remember explaining this to my sister when she was about that age (maybe a little older), and I think I actually sketched out the idea of the proof. Start with a polygon in the plane, or if you are feeling more adventurous, start with some interconnected polygons in the plane. Something like this: Now, compute the Euler characteristic. This is defined to be the number of vertices [math] v [/math], minus the number of edges [math] e [/math], plus the number of faces [math] f [/math], or: [math] \chi = v - e + f [/math] For the figure above, we have: 5 vertices: A, B, C, D, E 6 edges: AB, BC, CE, EA, CD, DE 2 faces: ABCE, CDE So [math] \chi = 5 - 6 + 2 = 1 [/math] (if negative numbers are problem, you might want to stick to polygons). This might not seem very interesting, but you should try it for other figures of the type that I have drawn. Some examples: What you will find is that the Euler characteristic is always 1. This is pretty easy to prove for a polygon---the number of edges will always be equal to the number of vertices, so they will cancel out. It is a little harder to prove for general planar graphs. To do this, you will need the following (you can show this to your child, even if you don't want to guide them towards a proof---use lots of examples, though): If you take connect two vertices with a new edge, it will not change the Euler characteristic (you get one new edge, but you also get one new face). If you take an edge and build a new polygon off of it, it will not change the Euler characteristic (you get [math] n - 2 [/math] new vertices, [math] n - 1 [/math] new edges, and [math] 1 [/math] new face).Using these facts, you can then do this generally; it is a good exercise to try it for yourself. One strategy that you might try is to split your figure into triangles and do it that way. Now, I want to say a word about the big picture. This part would probably be a bit much to explain to your child right now, but they might be interested to learn about it when they are a bit older. The key is that, while we have only been looking at polygon figures, the actual "straightness" of the lines is absolutely irrelevant. That is, if you were to allow the lines to be curves, you can still calculate the Euler characteristic just as well. It won't change in any way: The reason why this is important is that it means that we can apply these ideas not just to planar graphs, but to other geometric objects. For example, we can now take a sphere and split it up into "polygons": (I apologize for the slightly ugly picture---it looked nice until I converted it to a .png, and I didn't save a copy in the original format. Rookie mistake.) Here I have split the sphere into three "quadrilaterals." Using this, you can calculate the Euler characteristic of a sphere---it is 2. This is independent of how you split up the sphere into "polygons". What this means is that you can use the Euler characteristic to help you distinguish different 2-dimensional surfaces (for example, you can now easily prove that there is no way that you could stretch and bend a torus into a sphere---the two have different Euler characteristics). In fact, the Euler characteristic plays a key role in the classification of 2-dimensional surfaces, but that is a story for a different post.
