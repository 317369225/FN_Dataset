What is the most beautiful equation?
Here's one that has not been mentioned yet: Inscribed in Ludwig Boltzmann's tomb. This equation is the mother of all definitions for Entropy (S) and relates it to the number of energy microstates available to a system: Boltzmann's entropy formula Definitely not as appealing as Euler's Identity or the Golden Ratio, but still pretty damn impressive for those who are always interested in the idea of entropy.
