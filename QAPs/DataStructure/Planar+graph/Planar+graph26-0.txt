How are Combinatorics and Topology connected?
Lots of ways. Here's one I'm particularly fond of: One place to look for combinatorially interesting sequences in topology is in sequences of Betti numbers attached to spaces. Very, very roughly speaking, the kth Betti number [math]b_k[/math] of a space "counts the number of k-dimensional holes" in the space, but this slogan shouldn't be taken too seriously. If [math]X[/math] is a space, its Betti numbers can be arranged into a generating function [math]P_X(t) = b_0 + b_1 t + b_2 t^2 + ... [/math] (very much like the generating functions that occur in combinatorics) called the Poincaré series of [math]X[/math]. One reason it's nice to do this is that the Poincare series is additive and multiplicative with respect to disjoint union and cartesian product respectively; that is, we have [math]P_{X \sqcup Y} = P_X + P_Y, P_{X \times Y} = P_X P_Y.[/math] Example. The n-dimensional Torus [math]T^n[/math] has Poincaré series [math]P_{T^n}(t) = (1 + t)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} t^k[/math] so its Betti numbers are binomial coefficients. This is a corollary of the fact that [math]P_T(t) = 1 + t[/math] and of the fact I mentioned above about the Poincaré series being multiplicative. Now, why is it interesting to realize a sequence as a sequence of Betti numbers of a space? It's because if you know interesting things about your space, they can translate to interesting things about your sequence. For example, if your space is a particularly nice kind of space called a closed orientable manifold, then Poincaré duality tells you that its Betti numbers are symmetric; that is, [math]b_k = b_{n-k}[/math] where [math]n[/math] is the dimension of the space. In particular, the n-dimensional torus is such a space, so this can be thought of as a topological explanation for why [math]{n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}[/math]. For a more sophisticated example, if your space comes from algebraic geometry in a particular way, then the hard Lefschetz theorem (Lefschetz hyperplane theorem) tells you that its even-indexed and odd-indexed Betti numbers are unimodal, meaning that the sequences [math]b_0, b_2, ...[/math] and [math]b_1, b_3, ...[/math] first increase and then decrease. Applying this result to spaces called Grassmannians tells you that a certain sequence counting partitions that fit into a box is unimodal; apparently a purely combinatorial proof of this result isn't known.
