Is there an easy method to determine if a graph is planar or not?
Kouretoski's Theorem ( forgive spelling) ; if a graph on a 2 dimensional plane can have a complete graph K5 or the bipartite graph K3,3 embedded in it then it is not planar. If these subgraphs can not be embedded then it is planar. (I think this is correct; if not I'm sure someone will revise this..)
