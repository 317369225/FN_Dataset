Let G be a simple connected planar graph with less than 30 edges. How can I show that a graph G contains a node whose degree is maximum 4?
Yiu misunderstood the problem. You're supposed to show that if a graph satisfies your hypothesis, then it has at least one node of degree less than, or equal to 4. And in your graph that's obviously the case, all nodes except 4 have the required property. Now let G be a planar graph with at most 30 edges, with all nodes of degree greater than 4. But the graph has 30 edges at most, and the only graph with at most 30 edges with all nodes of degree greater than 4 is K6. (Remove a node and all the others have degree at most 4, add a node and, to satisfy 1. , you end up with at least 35 edges). Now the problem is reduced to figuring out if K6 is/isn't planar, then sticking that into a proof by contradiction (Hint : K6 isn't planar) Good luck!
