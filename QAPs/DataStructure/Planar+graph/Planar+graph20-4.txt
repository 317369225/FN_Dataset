What is the most beautiful equation?
There are some interesting equations which lead to fractals. Consider the MANDELBROT SET. The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical set of points whose boundary is a distinctive and easily recognizable two-dimensional fractal shape. More precisely, the Mandelbrot set is the set of values of c in the complex plane for which the orbit of 0 under iteration of the complex quadratic polynomial remains bounded. That is, a complex number c is part of the Mandelbrot set if, when starting with [math]z_0[/math] = 0 and applying the iteration repeatedly, the absolute value of [math]z_n[/math] remains bounded however large n gets. Treating the real and imaginary parts of each number as image coordinates, pixels are colored according to how rapidly the sequence diverges, if at all. Images of the Mandelbrot set display an elaborate boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications. The "style" of this repeating detail depends on the region of the set being examined. The set's boundary also incorporates smaller versions of the main shape, so the fractal property of self-similarity applies to the entire set, and not just to its parts.
