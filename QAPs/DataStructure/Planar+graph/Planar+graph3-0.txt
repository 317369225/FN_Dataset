Can a disconnected graph be a planar graph?
Yes, a disconnected graph can be planar. As far as the question is concerned, the correct answer is (C). This is a consequence of the Four color theorem Consider any 4-coloring of a planar graph, let [math]V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4[/math] be vertices corresponding to the 4 color classes. WLOG, assume [math]|V_1| \le |V_2| \le |V_3| \le |V_4|[/math]. Since [math]|V_1| + |V_2| + |V_3| + |V_4| = |V|[/math], we have [math]|V_4| \ge \frac{|V|}{4}[/math] Observe that [math]V_1 \cup V_2 \cup V_3[/math] forms a vertex cover and [math]|V_1| + |V_2| + |V_3| \le \frac{3|V|}{4}[/math] So there exists a vertex cover of size [math]\le \frac{3 |V|}{4}[/math]
