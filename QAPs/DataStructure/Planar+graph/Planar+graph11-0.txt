Let G be a simple connected planar graph with less than 30 edges. How can I show that a graph G contains a node whose degree is maximum 4?
The 'trick' in this problem is to consider the average degree of the graph, and argue that it is strictly less than 5. If you can show this, then you can apply the Pigeonhole principle to conclude that there is a vertex of degree at most 4 - which is what you want. Claim Let [math]G(V,E)[/math] be a connected planar graph such that [math]|E|<30 [/math], then [math]2|E|<5|V|[/math] (Note that this claim immediately implies that the average degree is strictly less than 5 since the degree sum formula tells us that [math]\sum_{v \in V(G)}^{}deg(v)=2|E|[/math]) Proof The claim can easily be verified for [math]|V| \le 2[/math] Suppose for the sake of contradiction, that [math]2|E| \ge 5|V|[/math] and [math]|V| > 2[/math] Since the graph is connected and planar, and [math]|V| > 2[/math], we know that [math]|E| \le 3|V|-6[/math] Hence, [math]5|V| \le 2|E| \le 2(3|V|-6)[/math] From the above inequality, [math]|V| \ge 12[/math] From the assumption above, [math]2|E| \ge 5|V|[/math] So, [math]2|E| \ge 5|V| \ge 5(12)=60[/math] Hence, [math]|E| \ge 30[/math] Which contradicts the fact that [math]|E| < 30[/math] (You can also prove this without invoking the pigeonhole principle, by arguing that if all vertex degrees of a planar graph are at least 5, then the number of edges is at least 30. This proof follows the same structure as the proof presented above. You simply take the sum of all degrees and you have the inequality  [math]\sum_{v \in V(G)}^{}deg(v) = 2|E| \ge 5|V|[/math], and the rest of the proof is same as above.) Updated 54w ago • View Upvotes
