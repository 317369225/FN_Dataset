What is the most beautiful equation?
Well one could argue that it's Euler's equation, Friedmann's equation that pretty much sums up the entire universe, Boltzmann's entropy formula, Maxwell's equation, Schrödinger's equation (Oh the uncertainty), Island Biogeography, Nowak's Evolvability, R-nought, The Hot or Not Formula a.k.a mathematics of beauty itself and there are a few more candidates that aren't exactly beautiful skin deep like the ones mentioned but they just produce the prettiest looking graphs but it is of utmost importance to know that when in doubt.... The answer is always BATMAN! Na Na Na Na Na... Edit 1:  For some of you, who might what to break this down and understand it properly, Term by term deconstruction the BatMan Equation would be a good place, hope your doubts rest in peace.
