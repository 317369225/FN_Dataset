What are some common applications of graph theory in statistical mechanics?
The Mayer cluster expansion of the fugacity function (Z) in thermodynamics requires you to calculate two, three. four-body terms and so on. There's a systematic way of doing it combinatorially with diagrams and it helps to know the connectivity of such diagrams. Knowing graph theory can be helpful when you want to sum a subset of these diagrams. Under certain conditions, a cluster expansion can be more useful than perturbative expansion in many-body theory. It is also clearer in cluster expansion why disconnected graphs/diagrams have no effect on the computation.
