What problems were once thought not to be solvable in polynomial time, but eventually were?
My favorite example is linear programming -- the problem has been studied since the early 20th century, geniuses like John von Neumann worked on it, but all the early algorithms took exponential time in the worst case, even though they're decently efficient in practice.  And if you think about it for a bit, it's totally plausible that maybe it shouldn't have a polynomial-time solution -- for example, the feasible polytope could well have exponentially many vertices, edges, and faces. Then in 1979, Khachiyan demonstrated the elliptical algorithm.  It's not at all practical, but it is polynomial. =)  Karmarkar's algorithm (1984) and the other interior-point methods that followed are both polynomial-time and practical. Another example is primality testing -- the problem dates to antiquity, but Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena completed the first polytime algorithm in 2002.  On the other hand, if you believe in either (a) the ERH or (b) derandomization, then you would have considered the problem morally solved in the late '70s.
