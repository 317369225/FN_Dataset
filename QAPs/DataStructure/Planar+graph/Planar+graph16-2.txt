What problems were once thought not to be solvable in polynomial time, but eventually were?
Another example, similar to Michael's, might be counting the number of perfect matchings in a planar graph. Counting the number of perfect matchings in a general graph is #P-complete, but for planar graphs, the FKT method gives a polynomial-time solution.  This also reminds me of Valiant's work on holographic algorithms, which gives polynomial-time algorithms for a bunch of problems that become NP-hard if tweaked slightly. I'm not super familiar with the work, but skimming a couple papers produces amusing examples like the following: The restrictive SAT problem #7Pl-Rtw-Mon-3CNF (counting the number of satisfying assignments of a planar read-twice monotone 3CNF formula, modulo 7) is solvable in P. The same problem #Pl-Rtw-Mon-3CNF without mod 7 is known to be #P-complete; the problem mod 2, #2Pl-Rtw-Mon-3CNF, is known to be ⊕P-complete (thus NP-hard). The surprising tractability mod 7 is due to the existence of an unexpected signature over Z7. (Perhaps not what you're looking for, though, as I'm dubious whether anyone thought long and hard about whether #7Pl-Rtw-Mon-3CNF is in P.) Updated 246w ago • View Upvotes
