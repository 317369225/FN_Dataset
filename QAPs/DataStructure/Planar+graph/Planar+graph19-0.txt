What makes the 5-color theorem so much simpler to prove than the 4-color theorem?
More colors simply give you more freedom. More freedom means that more valid colorings exist, and some of those (or, more precisely, the algorithms used to find them) are easier to describe. For example, if you move even further, from 5 to 6 colors, the proof becomes much more simple again: A planar graph on n vertices can have at most 3n-6 edges, hence there must be a vertex of degree less than 6. Remove it, color the rest of the graph, and then add it back with a color that is not used on its neighbors. The casework that we had to do for 5 colors is now not necessary, because we have more freedom in constructing the coloring.
