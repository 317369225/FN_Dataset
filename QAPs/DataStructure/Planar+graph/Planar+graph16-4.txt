What problems were once thought not to be solvable in polynomial time, but eventually were?
A recent example is the algorithm of Nikhil Bansal [1002.2259] Constructive Algorithms for Discrepancy Minimization for the famous existential result of Joel Spencer 'Six standard deviations  suffice'. You can find the conjecture about the hardness of the problem in the Alon-Spencer book 'The probabilistic method'. Another result that was considered a breakthrough in Probabilistic Combinatorics was the constructive algorithm of Moser-Tardos Algorithmic Lovász local lemma for the Local Lemma. Even if I am not hundred percent sure that people believed that this was hard,  I believe several did.
