What useful properties do planar graphs have?
A rather interesting one is of the existence of separators - a set of vertices that disconnects the graph into roughly balanced pieces; that too in linear time only (in number of vertices). This helps in devising efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms specifically for planar graphs. To put it more formally, the planar separator theorem states that: given any planar graph G, we can find a partition of the vertex set V into three sets A, B, C; such that no edge exists between vertices in A and vertices in B, C has size at most [math]\sqrt{8n}[/math], and A and B have size no more than [math]2n/3[/math]. (where n is the size of V) This was proved by Lipton and Tarjan in their paper titled "A Separator Theorem for Planar Graphs". They actually proved a stronger result: if the vertices have weights adding up to no more than 1, the sets A and B would have cost atmost [math]2/3[/math]. The upper bound on the size of the set C was later improved by Djidjev to [math]\sqrt{6n}[/math]. For graphs with additional properties (like being maximal planar, or 2-connected), Miller and others showed that the separator can be a simple cycle.
