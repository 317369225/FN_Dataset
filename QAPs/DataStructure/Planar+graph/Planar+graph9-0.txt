Discrete Mathematics: What's the largest possible number of edges in a connected, simple, planar graph with 100 vertices?
This would be a maximal planar graph with v=100. Handwave-y proof. Lemma. All faces of this G are surrounded by 3 edges. Proof by Contradiction. Assume G has a face touching more than 3 edges, we can then add an edge across the face. Thus, by 'triangulating' the plane, we obtain the planar graph with the maximal number of edges. All triangulations of a plane has the same number of edges. Starting from v=3, adding a vertex inside any face (and connecting it to the three reachable vertices) creates 2 new faces. Basically, "If a maximal planar graph has v vertices with v > 2, then it has precisely 3v − 6 edges and 2v − 4 faces." (Wikipedia) In short, a connected simple planar graph G has as most 294 edges.
