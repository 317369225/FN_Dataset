What's the most challenging physics or math problem you've attempted to solve?
I tried to prove the four-color theorem.  This was when I was a graduate student just about the time Haken and Appel's proof was announced in 1976.  I had no expectations of proving it, and my attempts weren't serious in the sense that they weren't aimed to result in anything substantial.  I was curious and I wanted to see what it was about.  I succeeded in understanding the problem and doing many small cases of it.  It was enjoyable to work on it, and later I was glad I had when I heard Appel (or was it Haken, I forget now) talk about it.
