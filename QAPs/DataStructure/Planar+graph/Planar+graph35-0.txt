How do I make a convex polygon homeomorphic to one that is not?
Here are three different arguments that you can use. Dirty argument:  If [math]\gamma(t) \subset \R^2[/math] is any (non-self-intersecting, differentiable) path with endpoints [math] p = \gamma(0)[/math], [math]q= \gamma(1)[/math] then there is a small neighborhood [math]U \subset \R^2[/math] of the path and a homeomorphism [math]h:\R^2\to \R^2[/math] such that: [math]h(p) = q[/math] [math]h[/math] is the identity outside [math]U[/math] any finite collection of given curves in [math]U-\gamma[/math] which meet [math]p[/math] and the boundary of [math]U[/math] near [math]p[/math] are sent to curves which travel rouhgly parallel to [math]\gamma[/math] and reach [math]q[/math] before crossing the line which passes through [math]q[/math] and is orthogonal to [math]\gamma'(1)[/math]. It's super tedious to rigorously show something like this exists, but it does.  Just imagine that you are pulling the point [math]p[/math] super fast along [math]\gamma[/math] to get to [math]q[/math], and that to make this happen continuously the points nearby follow along but lag behind a bit; the closer you get to the boundary of [math]U[/math] the more the points lag behind, until there is no effect at the boundary of [math]U[/math]. Now given a planar graph [math]G[/math] and an exterior vertex [math]v[/math], you can pick a path [math]\gamma[/math] in the plane starting at [math]v[/math], ending somewhere really far away from [math]G[/math], and not passing through [math]G[/math] anywhere except at [math]v[/math].  Using the above construction (where the finite collection of curves in (3) is the small bit of the edges of [math]G[/math] incident to [math]v[/math]) gives a homeomorphism of the plane which when applied to [math]G[/math] gives a planar graph which lies entirely on one side of a line passing through the image of [math]v[/math].  This is good enough to allow you to glue two planar graphs along two given outside vertices. Note that I am using the standard definition that the edges in a planar graph just have to be (nice enough) curves--not straight lines.  You'd probably have to work a lot harder to get straight lines without being allowed to insert new vertices.  However, Fáry's theorem says the two definitions coincide, so this doesn't really matter.  Deform your two graphs as I've done here, glue them together, then apply Fary's theorem to get a "straightening," if you so desire. (This argument has the advantage that the embedding of the graph is essentially completely unchanged.  If you are willing to destroy your original embedding, there are "better" arguments.) Cleaner argument: identify [math]\R^2 \cong \C[/math], and suppose we have an embedded planar graph [math]G \subset \C [/math] and any vertex [math]v[/math].  By perturbing the embedding a little bit near [math]v[/math], we can arrange that near [math]v[/math] the graph [math]G[/math] lies on one side of a line passing through [math]v[/math].  (This is a much more mild change to the graph than in the previous argument, where we globally put the graph on one side of a line.)  Pick a point [math]z_0\in \C - G[/math] such that [math]v\in G[/math] is the unique closest point to [math]z_0[/math], which can clearly be done.  Then apply the transformation [math]z\mapsto 1/(z-z_0)[/math] to the complex plane.  By construction, the point in the image of the graph with the largest absolute value is the image of [math]v[/math], so it is pulled away from the rest of the graph as needed. (This argument changes the embedding, but not too badly--we're essentially viewing the point [math]z_0[/math] as lying "at infinity" and otherwise not changing the graph.) Third argument: The proof of Fary's theorem on wikipedia shows that if we add edges to [math]G[/math] so that every face is a 3-cycle and [math]abc[/math] is any triangle in [math]G[/math] then there is a reembedding of [math]G[/math] such that [math]G[/math] is contained entirely in the triangle given by these three vertices.  Furthermore, all the edges can be straight lines. (The proof of Fary's theorem is by induction, and there are many choices involved.  Your original embedding will be completely destroyed.)
