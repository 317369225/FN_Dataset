What's the most challenging physics or math problem you've attempted to solve?
The Hadamard Matrix Conjecture. Hadamard matrix It's equivalent to trying to find regular n-dimensional simplices inscribed on the vertices of regular n-dimensional cubes. But solutions only exist for dimensions congruent to 3 modulo 4, or the trivial dimensions 0 and 1. Also equivalent to finding regular (n+1)-orthoplexes inscribed on the vertices of regular (n+1)-cubes. (Again n is congruent to 3 modulo 4). Â  A108973 - OEIS A124505 - OEIS I spent several months on it, approaching it initially as a geometry problem. I realized that a regular simplex on an n-cube could be constructed from a subset of a cartesian product of two irregular simplices inscribed on the vertices of two lower dimensional cubes, where the irregular simplex vertex coordinates were rows of circulant matrices. This lead me to looking at circular convolution and Fourier transforms, and then from there to cyclotomic polynomials and trigonometric diophantine equations. I managed to independently reproduce results that were already known, which was somewhat satisfying, but I eventually I ran out of ideas on how to pursue the problem any further.
