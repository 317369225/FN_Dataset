Is there an easy method to determine if a graph is planar or not?
For the given graph with [math]v=8[/math] vertices and [math]e=16[/math] edges, we can go through the following rules in order to determine that it is not planar. In general, given an arbitrary graph (which could not be tested for planarity by hand), we would have to use one of the [math]O(n)[/math] runtime algorithms on Planarity testing, like the Edge addition method. 1) This rule can only determine if a graph is not planar. Use the fact that any planar graph must satisfy the following [math]2[/math] conditions (Planarity criteria). [math]v\geq 3\Rightarrow e\leq 3v-6[/math]. If [math]v\geq 3[/math] and there are no cycles of length [math]3[/math], then [math]e\leq 2v-4[/math]. Thus, using its contrapositive, if either of these statements is false, then the graph cannot be planar. For our example, [math]v=8\geq 3 \Rightarrow e=16\leq 3(8)-6[/math] is true, and the second statement is vacuously true, since our graph has cycles of length [math]3[/math] (for example, nodes [math]A,B,C[/math]). Thus, this rule did not tell us that the graph is not planar; we must go to the next rule. 2) This rule can only determine if a graph is not planar. Use the fact that any planar graph must be [math]4[/math]-colorable (Four color theorem). Thus, using the contrapositive, if there is no valid [math]4[/math]-coloring, then the graph is not planar. For our example, there is in fact a valid [math]4[/math]-coloring, as shown below. Thus, this rule did not tell us that the graph is not planar; we must go to the next rule. 3) Since the [math]2[/math] easier approaches of ruling out that the graph is planar did not work, we can now resort to the Kuratowski's theorem. It states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of [math]K_5[/math] (the complete graph on [math]5[/math] vertices) or of [math]K_{3,3}[/math] (the complete bipartite graph on [math]6[/math] vertices). For our example, a subgraph is in fact a subdivision of [math]K_{3,3}[/math], as shown below. Specifically, the subgraph to consider is the one with the following edges removed: [math](A,D),(B,C),(C,G),(F,G),(F,H)[/math]. Then, note the almost-complete, almost-bipartite graph with one subset of nodes [math]\{A,F,H\}[/math] and the other subset of nodes [math]\{B,C,E\}[/math]. If we use subdivision on the imaginary edges [math](B,H)[/math] and [math](C,H)[/math] to obtain vertices [math]G[/math] and [math]D[/math], respectively, then we satisfy the condition for the theorem. Thus, this rule tells us that the graph is not planar. Updated 2d ago â€¢ View Upvotes
