Why do Gaussian processes graphs not look like a bunch of Gaussians?
Consider a Gaussian process GP(x). If you choose an input locations x 1   and then sampled the GP multiple times, the values that the GP takes at the particular location x 1   will be Gaussian distributed. The above statement is a simple way of saying that the marginal distribution of a GP is a Gaussian. When people plot a GP, they are in effect plotting samples from the GP, or more likely plotting its mean. Samples from a GP are functions (vs. samples from a Gaussian are points/vectors). Lets see how: Consider a 100-dimensional Gaussian random variable. A draw from this variable gives us a 100-vector:     [v 1 ,v 2 ,…,v 100 ] T   Let us transform the components of this vector into ordered-pairs by tacking on an x  -coordinate in the closed interval [0,1]  :     {(0.01,v 1 ),(0.02,v 2 ),…,(1.00,v 100 )}  Plotting this ordered set will result in a plot with 100 points. Now, consider even higher-dimensional Gaussian random variables and repeat the above procedure. As the dimension approaches infinity, the points become very dense function plots since infinite dimensional vectors are equivalent to functions. This infinite dimensional analogue of a multi-variate Gaussian random variable is a Gaussian Process. Thus, a sample from the GP is an infinite dimensional vector: a function. In the following figure, we plot samples from multi-variate Gaussians visualized in the interval [0,1]  , as described previously. The red and blue points are from 100 and 200 dimensional Gaussians respectively. With higher dimensional Gaussians, the plots become increasingly dense and start resembling function plots.
