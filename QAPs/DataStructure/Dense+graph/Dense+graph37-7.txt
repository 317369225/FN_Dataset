How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
I'd been working as a software engineer for about 10 years prior to my interview at Google.  There were a couple of different types of preparation I did for it. First, about a week or so before my phone interview, I read through Quora to find out about other people's experiences.  I tried to get a feel for the culture and other "soft" areas.  I spent the day before the phone interview skimming through The Algorithm Design Manual, just picking up the high points.  I also brushed up on my C++ (did some topcoder problems) - my last 7 years or so had been in the .NET world. Secondly, the day before my onsite interview, I did a final read through of the Algorithm Design Manual, got a good night's sleep, and had coffee and a good breakfast.  I figured my brain probably had all the information it needed, and if I screwed up, it would most likely be because I was stressed out or tired. I can't overstate the importance of not being too stressed.  The interviewers are human, and if you are pleasant and relaxed, they will be too.  A casual atmosphere is much better for communication - both in the case of you misunderstanding the question, and for them giving you clarifying info. I think I spent well under the median time for preparing, but I also had day-to-day experience with designing fairly complex and large systems; and i used to compete in programming contests, so I knew that I had that algorithm knowledge in my head somewhere.  It's an entirely different matter if you feel like you need to *learn* as opposed to just *practice*. For the record, I did get hired.
