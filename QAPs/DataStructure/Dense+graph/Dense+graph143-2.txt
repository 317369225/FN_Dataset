82 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend of the 4th of July, 2014. What is the cause of this continued surge of violence and what is being done to control it?See http://my.chicagotribune.com/#se....
This happens in Chicago when ever there is a change at the top of the drug gangs, opening up opportunities leading to turf war. Sadly the FBI success in breaking up drug gangs only makes things worse for example the story below show the break up of the leaders of the Vice Lords which had dominated hispanic west side trade for some time. 33 people — including gang’s reputed ‘king’ — charged in drug conspiracy case - Chicago Sun-Times This does not impact the demand for drugs, the flow of drugs through Chicago as a major hub, or the profits to be made in drugs, it just means that other groups have to fight it out for domination.  It also happened in the early 1990s. Right now the Mexican mafia is expanding from its base in the south in to the newer territory where established Puerto Rican gangs have been pushed out, before them were the African American and before them Italian gangs, all cleaned out by the FBI and each other -- only to open the area for new gangs. Adding to the problem is actually the growing move to make pot legal, gangs need to push more addictive drugs and suddenly heroin is huge. It's being pushed in Chicago to secure revenues that will be lost as policing on softer drugs dries up. Just 20 years ago a middle weight crime figure could support himself and his crew, in style, on just selling grass.  Today they need to move to harder stuff. Added to this the easy availability of guns, Chicago's infamous racial and gang profile, the vast expanse of the city with huge sparsely populated areas, the city's location as the hub of traffic of drugs between Mexico and the Northeast, and the higher than national level of unemployment and Chicago has a real problem.
