Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?In 2013, a number of outspoken conservatives were named Top Writers: Tom Byron, Susan Moy, John Fogh, Chris Bast, Gary Teal, to name a few. Marc Bodnick is one of the grand poobahs of Quora, and is a self identified conservative. Like others have pointed out: Quoras membership is international: and there aren't a lot of people to the right of many American conservatives outside of the US. Upvotes ( atleast from me ) aren't a sign of agreement or endorsement per se. Edit: Jennifer Dowdy Is a newer Quoran who is Conservative who has already written some terrific answers. Plus she has a cute baby in her profile pic
