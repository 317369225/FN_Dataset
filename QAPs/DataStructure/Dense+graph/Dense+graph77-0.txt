What is it like to study Applied and Computational Mathematics at Caltech as an undergrad?
It was an ideal fit because I wanted a foundation in pure mathematics along with the intuition that a physics or engineering student might gain. The courses were generally very well taught. The department also hired undergrads to TA major classes, and I immensely enjoyed teaching ACM 95 for a term. The workload was reasonable compared to other majors, yet some classes could be conceptually dense and required time to digest the material. Many finance/econ types tended to use it as a gateway into finance, although I viewed it as a foundation for graduate school.   Here are some of the courses I took towards the major categorized by Math, ACM, and Science/Engineering:   Math Department: Ma 5: Abstract Algebra (Groups, Fields, Galois Theory, Representation Theory) Ma 6: Discrete Math (Counting, Graphs, Logic) Ma 108: Real Analysis (Metric Spaces and associated concepts, including continuity, convergence, completeness, compactness, inner product spaces, function spaces.) Ma 129: Information and Complexity (An introduction to information theory,   complexity theory, and computability theory.) Ma 127: Coding Theory ACM Department: ACM 95: Introductory Methods of Applied Math (complex analysis, odes, pdes) ACM 104/CDS 201: Linear Algebra and Operator Theory ACM 116: Introductory Stochastic Processes ACM 216: Markov Chains Science and Engineering: CS 156: Machine Learning CS 21: Decidability and Tractability Ph 129b: Group Theory in Physics EE 111: Signals and Systems
