Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Why is Quora and its users so left-leaning/liberal?They don't lean particularly left as a whole, though the Quora you see is probably very different than the Quora I see. The site as a whole segregates your view to just what you follow and whose content you've interacted with recently, so it can be possible to think there is a monolith of opinion when in fact the entire range exists -- but it's only SHOWING you one side (the side the algorithms have decided you want to see).
