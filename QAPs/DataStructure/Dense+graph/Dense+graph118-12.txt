Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?I find it an interesting phenomenon that sites that are open to all contributors such as Quora and Wikipedia show or are at least accused of showing a liberal bias, whereas only sites set up specifically for conservatives show a conservative bias. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I've never heard of liberals getting upset with a site's "conservative-bias" and splitting off to form their own liberal variant. The other part is, when they do split, instead of making a more "balanced" site, which is their purported complaint, they purposefully create a conservative echo chamber like Conservapedia. It's almost as though their problem wasn't that the original site was too liberal, but that any position other than accepted conservative dogma is intolerable. If there is in fact a liberal bias on Quora or Wikipedia, it is likely due to demographics. Users are young, well-educated, and computer literate. However, I see this same situation in older media as well. Fox News was created as a counter to the perceived liberal biases of contemporaneous news channels. In newsprint and magazines, many highly-circulated publications are accused of liberal bias, while conservative publications tend to be more explicit about their position. It brings to mind Colbert's quote, "reality has a well-known liberal bias". If something isn't explicitly conservative, then it must be liberal. That said, ad hominem attacks should be discouraged and downvoted. Because even if we agree with what they say, they are inflammatory and add nothing to the discussion.
