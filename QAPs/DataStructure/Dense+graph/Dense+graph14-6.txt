What can I read to help me better think in terms of networks?I'm looking to sharpen my thinking in terms of what it means to live in a connected world. Are there any essays or books that you have read that have helped you better approach the world in this framework?
I'm a big fan of: Â "An Army of Davids: How Markets and Technology Empower Ordinary People to Beat Big Media, Big Government, and Other Goliaths" by Glenn Reynolds. It has some interesting case studies of how groups of little guys make a difference. I find myself quoting it an awful lot. I particularly like the segment on September 11th. It feel like it actually finds a lesson in 9-11 that I can embrace.
