What is the graph of (-2) ^x?
I assume you're restricting your consideration to real numbers. [math](-2)^x[/math] has a clear meaning when [math]x[/math] is an integer. It also has a clear meaning when [math]x=1/n[/math] where [math]n[/math] is an odd positive integer. [math](-2)^{1/n}[/math] is the [math]n^{\rm th}[/math] root of [math]-2[/math] and there is only one real number whose [math]n^{\rm th}[/math] power is [math]-2[/math], namely [math]-\sqrt[n]2[/math]. If [math]x=m/n[/math] where [math]n[/math] is an odd positive integer and [math]n[/math] is an integer, then it's quite reasonable to define [math](-2)^{m/n}[/math] to be [math]\left(-\sqrt[n]2\right)^m[/math]. That will be positive when [math]m[/math] is even, but negative when [math]m[/math] is odd. But if [math]x[/math] is a irrational number, or a rational number which in lowest terms has an even denominator, there's no reasonable definition for [math](-2)^x[/math]. So when you graph [math]y=(-2)^x[/math], it can at most be defined for [math]x=m/n[/math] where [math]n[/math] is odd, and in that case, when [math]m[/math] is even, then the point [math](x,y)[/math] will lie on the curve [math]y=2^x[/math], but when [math]m[/math] is odd, then the point [math](x,y)[/math] will lie on the curve [math]y=-2^x[/math]. That means the graph consists of a dense subgraph of the equations [math]y=\pm2^x[/math].
