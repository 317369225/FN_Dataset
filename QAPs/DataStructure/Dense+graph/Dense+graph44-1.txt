What are some things famous people or characters were adamant about to ensure that they themselves never break their principles or policies?
A fictional representation of this was Captain Katherine Janeway, the protagonist of the Star Trek franchise series, Star Trek:Voyager. As written, the character remained obsessed with adhering to the Prime Directive, a set of rules and regulations which govern Starfleet, the military unit of which she was an officer and members of the Earth-based interstellar political organization which she belonged, The United Federation of Planets. While this would have been understandable and even necessary while Captain Janeway and her crew were in or very near their home region of space, when as series depicted, her vessel was transported to a region of space requiring a 70-year voyage to return home, it became unwise and more than a little dangerous. Janeway's refusal to bend or even break the Directive cost crew members their lives and prevented her ship returning to its home space despite several clear cut opportunities to do so. While series was written to present this as her being a morally strong and consistent character, what it did is make her appear to be a martinet more interested in blindly following rules than dealing with problems and providing her crew with pragmatic solutions to their ongoing dilemma.
