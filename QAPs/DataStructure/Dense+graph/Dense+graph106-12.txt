Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013–present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
Obviously, the right wing would be happier. White people? I am pretty darn white and I would not have been happy to see Ron Paul as president. I would have endured Mitt Romney but Paul Ryan was too, too extreme a choice for VP.  Again, I would have endured Romney, but certainly not been happy. If the right wing press can make President Obama to appear to be governing as a liberal, imagine the material abd unwilling-to-compromise liberal would have given them to sell papers.  But I am also a woman, and neither candidates mentioned are known for their support of income equality or other womens issues. I agree with another poster, who said that many conservatives saw through Romneys etch a sketch policies. More than half this country self identifies as conservative or moderates. Obama was not elected by liberals.. Many of my brethren voted for Jill Stein. Updated 18 Jun 2013 • View Upvotes
