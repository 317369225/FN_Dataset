Linear Algebra:Â How do I interpret singular value decomposition (SVD) for visualization?
Heres a great example with using the first two terms of PCA on the 2 and 3 digits from MNIST. Above is an example of the digit 2, and the digit 3. Then we will reshape all of our data so that each is a [math] 1 \times 64 [/math] vector. and produce a matrix that is [math]n \times 64[/math], where [math]n[/math] is the number of examples of 2s and 3s in our data. Now we take the first two coefficients of our Truncated data. and plot them for visualization. Here RED=2, BLUE=3: So it seems that the x-axis somehow figured out how to separate 2s and 3s... Lets take a look at what the components look like! First Component Notice that it kinda looks like a 2 and a 3, accept the bottom portion is missing. Interpretation: When we write a 2 or a 3, the top curve look the same, as with the bottom line. however the 2s swerve to the left before making the bottom line, while the 2s curve to the right. The first component explain similarities between 2 and 3. Second Component Notice this one is a bit different, there is a dark left side (5,3) and a light white side (5,5). This component explains our intuition! if the second component is positive, it becomes a two since we darken the left side of the 2, while if the second component is negative, it solidifies the right side (negate the image) Scatterplot with digitsIt seems that not only does one component seperate 2 vs 3, it seems the other one looks at skewness! So there you go. An interpretation. EDIT: I've added the ipynb if you want to run this yourself for other digits. Quora_PCA_2D.ipynb you'll need sklearn, pandas, and matplotlib.
