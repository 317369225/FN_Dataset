What are some things famous people or characters were adamant about to ensure that they themselves never break their principles or policies?
Read Benjamin Franklin's autobiography. The man was jaw-droppingly brilliant, tireless and creative.  The real definition of an entrepreneur. He was also obsessed with living a life of virtue.  He identified ten virtuous qualities or behaviors, like "working diligently" and "not indulging too much in gluttony or sex."  He carried a little notebook full of graph paper everywhere with him, arranged like a calendar with ten boxes under each day. And every time he failed to live up to a virtue for a given day, he would pencil in a little check in the appropriate box like a demerit. He wrote that when he first began this system, he saw a depressingly dense crowd of check marks on his paper. But in time they became fewer and fewer until whole pages were blank.
