If f(x+y) =f(x) +f(y), what would f(x) be without the assumption of continuity?
It would be a function solely composed of additions (and substraction because theyâ€™re an addition of negative numbers). No other operation involving x can be can be included. This means no multiplication, division, exponents, roots, modulo, trigonometric functions,...
