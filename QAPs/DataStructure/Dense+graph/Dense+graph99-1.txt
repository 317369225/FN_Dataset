How many pages should a 'good' business plan be - on average?For a startup - not establishished business
Generally, the shorter your business plan can be, the better. Most business plans are much too long and no investor is going to read a business plan cover to cover. First and foremost, you want to aim for clear and concise executive summary. The executive summary should include a clear and simple explanation of the problem your company is addressing and how your product solves your customers' needs. You should also include a summary of the total addressable market, the management team, and an overview of your financial projections. The rest of the business plan is essentially just more detail on the above topics. But, while you are offering more detail in the body of the plan, it's critical to keep the plan as easy to read as possible. Use short paragraphs, bullet points, illustrations, and charts and graphs to make consuming the information in your plan as easy as possible. Typically, your business plan will be the starting point for discussions, so you don't need to cover every last granular detail in the plan. But, remember, the planning process should have forced you to think about a lot of the details, so be prepared to answer detailed questions in your meetings with investors.
