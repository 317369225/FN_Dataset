Did a phase transition cause the large scale structure of the universe?
What exactly do you mean by bubble like nature of galactic structure? The large scale galactic structure is actually a network of galaxy clusters. And yes, a phase transition is consistent with inflation. The bubbles they speak of are actually from QFD. These are different phases of the quantum fields that quantum tunnel into our observable universe and create a bubble. This could happen even with the Higgs field. But they do not have anything to do with the current density of the universe. The structure of the universe arises from, according to inflation, quantum fluctuations in the uniform CMB.Â  The Inflationary Universe
