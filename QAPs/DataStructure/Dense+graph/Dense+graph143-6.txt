82 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend of the 4th of July, 2014. What is the cause of this continued surge of violence and what is being done to control it?See http://my.chicagotribune.com/#se....
Having lived in Chicago most of my life i've noticed that gun violence picks up significantly around the summertime. This may be due to the heat which has been show to affect aggression or it can have more to do with schools being out for the summer. That said I think there isn't a single contributing factor to the surge, moreoverr there are just more people out during the 4th. Which means the aggression that typically takes place is more likely to lead to victims.
