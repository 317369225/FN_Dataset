How can I do a projection with a 100-dimensional vector to preserve the inner product?
Agree with the other posts, except in the case of: Your data set actually lies on a manifold with <=10 dimensions You are willing to accept an approximation that's reasonably close. Either way, you can play around with techniques like SVD to detect a new basis. If the data set has 10 dimensions or lower, the 11th singular value will be zero. If the 11th singular value is small compared to the largest singular value, then your data set can be fairly well approximated using the first 10 singular vectors.
