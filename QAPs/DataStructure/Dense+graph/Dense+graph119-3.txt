I would definitely suggest checking out Klipfolio, Your Online Business Dashboard Platform. All of our dashboards update automatically; you can see what needs to be actioned on the moment it happens! With Klipfolio, you can build powerful and fully customizable dashboards in 3 ways: 1. You can use our KlipStart dashboards - pre-built(but still totally customizable) dashboards for Google Analytics and Google AdWords (more KlipStarts coming soon).
