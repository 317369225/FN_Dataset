What is the threshold of queue size at which a Fibonacci Heap becomes a good priority queue?Fibonacci Heaps provide a great asymptotic time complexity for a priority queue implementation but they are hard to implement and have poor time constants.  Ignoring the annoyance of implementation, at what point is a Fibonacci heap a better priority queue than other heap implementations?
My impression is that Pairing heaps are often used in situations with way more decrease-keys than deletes. They have slightly worse asymptotic behavior, but makes up for it with simplicity (loglogn  is basically 6, exploglogn − − − − − − −  √   ... use your imagination I guess).
