Lists of Top Quora Content: What are some of the best answers on Quora?Could be the most brilliant, detailed, enlightening, greatest, best source, smartest, wittiest, mind blowing, simple, crazy, touching. In short, answers that makes you say wow...this should be on the all time top answers list of Quora.   For starters, I nominate Tim Morgan 's answer to What do all the controls in an airplane's cockpit do?
In terms of sheer usefulness and attention to detail, I'd suggest Alecia Li Morgan's answer to How can I make a homemade mocha that tastes as good as Starbucks? I was hoping for a little guidance, instead I got 5 years' worth of barista experience and a whole lot of passion thrown into the mix.  And all within a few minutes of posting the question. Amazing!
