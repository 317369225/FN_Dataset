How do I switch from wetware neuroscience to computational neuroscience?
Math math math. The easy way which is very popular is to learn Matlab, the mathematics libraries are extensive, but you should know how to apply them. You also should know statistics, there's no way around that. Matlab has plenty available code for computational neuroscience, and you can run it on your local cluster computer, if it's available to you. They're often offered on lease so you can run your Matlab programs on them and Matlab parallelizes the calculation across the cluster automatically so you can avoid learning that. In NYC I know people who use the Courant institute's supercomputer and the one at Bloomberg. IBM is installing Watson on Astor place but that may not be available. Computational neuroscience is all about parallel computation so unless you want to get into multithreaded programming in c, Matlab is the first choice. I heard that scala and clojure (new "functional" languages) will parallelize your code too. I learned some clojure and it's an interesting way to organize programs; I find it more fun than Matlab or c. It's used in finance for time series analysis.
