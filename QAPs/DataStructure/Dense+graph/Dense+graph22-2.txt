What is the process for a normal student to start from very basic coding to high level coding so I that I can solve problems from CodeChef TopCoder etc?
Thanks for A2A. Answers in sequence. 1) You can start with C,C++,Python. All are more or less equally good and have their own pros and cons. Personally, I would suggest you beginning with C. (Rest of the answers will be given in the context to C) 2)Start with reading first 5 chapters of Yashwant Kanetkar. Once you are familiar immediately switch to 'The C Programming Language' by Dennis Ritchie. 3)Start trying the warm up question of HackerRank . 4)Once you are done with Dennis Ritchie, you can anytime start data structure. 5)For algorithm purpose : Data Structure(Schaum Series)             For programming purpose: Data structure by Tanenbaum 6)Along with data structure you can also start Algorithms.              Book for Algorithm: Introduction to algorithm by Cormen 7)Anytime when you feel comfortable with programming and you think now you have started thinking in programming language and you are more logical now. If you can't solve question, don't get dishearten. Review your concepts. Study more algorithms. Think more logically. Try again. Try try till you succeed. 8)Keep following good sites like Hot Questions - Stack Exchange , Page on geeksforgeeks.org and some good blogs on programming.
