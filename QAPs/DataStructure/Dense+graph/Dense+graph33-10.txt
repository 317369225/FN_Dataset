If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
It will crack the container enough to form ice. However like Joshua Engel pointed out, if the container is hypothetically unbreakable (I am not sure if there exists a commonly available material which is unbreakable at all pressures), then a different phase and state will be formed. A different form of "ice" which is denser than water.
