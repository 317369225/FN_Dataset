How do I decide between the Dijkstras and Floyd Warshall algorithm?Floyd Warshall takes O(n^3) time while Dijkstras takes O(n^2) time per vertex and for all vertices it takes O(n^3) time. If we apply adjacency list representation, Dijkstras takes O(V^2logV) time. Isn't it faster for graph with no negative weights? Also, does Dijkstras work with graph with negative sdges but no negative cycle?
