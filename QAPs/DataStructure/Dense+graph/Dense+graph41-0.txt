Why doesn't the water at the bottom of the ocean freeze?The deeper in the sea, the lower the temperature of the water. So why isn't the temperature of the water at the bottom of the ocean extremely low and, if so, why doesn't it freeze?
First of all, it's cold at the bottom of the ocean, but not that cold, between 0 to 3 degrees Celcius (32-37F). (Reference: Deep ocean water) Second of all, water freezes from top to bottom, and most of the salt leaves the water as it freezes, which makes the water around the ice saltier. This has two effects: first, it lowers the freezing point, and second, it makes the water denser, such that it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. Now, since the temperature at the bottom of the ocean is only 0-3C and not colder, this very briny water simply does not freeze because 0-3C is well above the freezing point.
