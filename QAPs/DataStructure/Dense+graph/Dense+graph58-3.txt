How did Tinder grow so quickly?
I don't have any inside knowledge but I was an early user of the app. One thing they used was a flexible algorithm for showing matches. You can set how far away you want your matches to be and what type of matches you want but that doesn't guarantee only those matches. For example early on, I had the radius set to 50 miles, but I would sometimes be shown potential matches that were much farther away.  This helped to ensure a good first experience. Also they had good a good buzz in the target market of young single adults with smart phones who are willing to try new apps. And since the potential reward (dates, love, marriage) were high and the opportunity cost (click the sign in via facebook button) was low, a few new people in your area would sign up every day.  This accomplished the initial seeding.
