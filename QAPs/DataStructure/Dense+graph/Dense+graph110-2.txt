What is a good workflow in documenting responsive web design?
Ugh. Don't document this.  Who cares?  Get the site working, test it, make it great. Move on! What kind of horrible bureaucratic nightmare place do you work? Responsive design is a pretty new technique.  Devices are changing every day. Sizes are changing, browsers are changing, everything is changing.  Whatever you document will sit on a digital shelf and never be read again. Work on something more important, for the love of God!  Create lasting value.
