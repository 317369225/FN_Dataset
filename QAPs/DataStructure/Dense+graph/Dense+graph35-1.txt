Is Gravity higher 1000 meters under earth surface than 9.81 m/sÂ² ?
Mark Barton answered the question well, but here's an interesting related fact from Newtonian physics; first, imagine that the Earth is made up of an infinite number of shells, all enclosing one another, and that the matter of which they are made is of the same density everywhere. As you dig deeper into the Earth, you have more and more of these shells above you. Inside any shell of matter of any thickness, the gravity balances out to zero relative to that shell of matter. You only have to pay attention to the mass below you to calculate the gravity. Isaac Newton worked this out (Principia, Proposition 70, Theorem 30). Technically, there's still a gravity field, but it all balances out equally in all directions from the forces of the shell. In a perfectly amorphous, equally dense sphere, the gravity would decrease as you went deeper, but that's not the case with Earth.
