Can you construct a sinusoidal function using only a straightedge and a compass?I assume it's impossible, due to the issue of squaring the circle - however, I know you CAN construct square roots, which are solutions to sine - does this make at least a convincing approximation possible?
You can make an arbitrarily good approximation using straightedge and compass, but the smooth curve would require an infinite number of steps. Make a circle Draw a line through the center of the circle, to be your x axis Bisect it to get a y axis Keep bisecting every angle that you construct to get a bunch of equal angles intersecting the circle. For example, 256 equal angles each of 2pi/256 radians The length of a chord through each intersection point and parallel to the y axis is proportional to sin theta. Now you can approximate your sinusoid by copying chords in the right order, as vertical lines equally spaced along the x axis.
