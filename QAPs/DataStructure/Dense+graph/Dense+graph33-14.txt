If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
Originally Answered: You have a small box that cannot expand whatsoever. The box is filled with water to the point where there is no air inside the box. If the box is put in a freezer, what will happen to the water if it can't expand?The question is not really what happens to the water. It will expand. The box will break. This is the exact problem that leads to burst pipes during the winter, when the temperatures are below freezing.
