Can you construct a sinusoidal function using only a straightedge and a compass?I assume it's impossible, due to the issue of squaring the circle - however, I know you CAN construct square roots, which are solutions to sine - does this make at least a convincing approximation possible?
You can't construct  sin 20° with straightedge and compass, so you can't construct the graph of a sinusoidal function with all its points. Many points of the graph of a sine function can be constructed, in fact, a dense subset. And that means that you can get as close as you like to the value of  sin 20° or any other angle. That's how Ptolemy created his trig tables. Sines of some angles can be directly constructed from constructible triangles.  Three constructible right triangles are the 45°-45°-90° triangle, the 30°-60°-90°, and the 36°-54°-90°.  Those give sines for 30°, 36°, 45°, 54°, and 60°.  With sum and difference formulas, you can construct, sines of all multiples of 3°. Then with half-angle formulas, you can all multiples of 1.5°, 0.75°, etc.
