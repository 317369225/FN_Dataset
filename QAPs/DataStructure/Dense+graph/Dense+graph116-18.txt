Lists of Top Quora Content: What are some of the best answers on Quora?Could be the most brilliant, detailed, enlightening, greatest, best source, smartest, wittiest, mind blowing, simple, crazy, touching. In short, answers that makes you say wow...this should be on the all time top answers list of Quora.   For starters, I nominate Tim Morgan 's answer to What do all the controls in an airplane's cockpit do?
I highly recommend : Lors Soren's answer to Mathematics: Both physics and math, at their highest levels, are fairly obscure topics that require advanced skills to understand, but contain immense beauty. Yet physics seems to enjoy a much more prominent seat in pop culture. Why is this? How come there are so few prominent 'pop-mathematicians'? I have just been completely blown away by : Mark Eichenlaub's answer to Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time? The question sounds boring, but the answer is so epic and informative that all of the comments say so.  I'm amazed and privileged to be the first person adding it to this list.
