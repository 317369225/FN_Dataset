Originally Answered: What are the all-time best Quora answers?There are so many but I'd like to submit one truly great one that I stumbled upon today: Mircea Goia's answer to "What does it feel like to be shot/wounded by a bullet?" I love this answer and I think so many Quora users also do (or will) because we are driven to Quora again and again by our curiosity. This answer is a wonderful and incredibly entertaining tale: one person's story of executing a creative idea and the consequences of insatiable curiosity. Though not all of us (probably few of us) have been wounded by a bullet many of us will relate to experiencing insatiable curiosity and the fascinating, frequently entertaining paths this trait has led us down.
