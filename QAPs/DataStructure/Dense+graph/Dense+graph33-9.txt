If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
What kind of sadistic person puts water in an unbreakable container with no room to expand and then tries to freeze it?! Hasn’t cold water had it hard enough?  First, we created the horrific ice makers in home freezers that crank out putrid ice cubes to be crushed between the teeth of hyperglycemic children.  Then, some aquaphobic madman with a chainsaw convinced us to brutalize ice chunks and pass them off as sculptures at weddings.  At weddings!  Is it any surprise then that our society has devolved so far that there are people cursing the melting glaciers of Iceland as if the ice was to blame?  And now this person wants to freeze water in an unbreakable container just for kicks.  Unreal.
