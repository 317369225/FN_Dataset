Does ice weigh more than water?If I had one gallon of water (about  8.35 lb.), then froze it, what would it weigh afterwards?
As Stuart Hagler hinted: As water goes from a zero-degree Celsius liquid phase to a zero-degree Celsius solid phase, a certain amount of heat energy associated with the "heat of fusion" must be removed. E=8.35lb×333.55joulegram =1.26∗10 6 joule  According to Einstein, the mass equivalent is m=Ec 2    The water in frozen form would have less mass in the truest sense -- in this case, approximately 14 nanograms less. $ units You have: 8.35lb*(333.55joule/g)/(c^2) You want: nanogram * 14.056324 / 0.071142356
