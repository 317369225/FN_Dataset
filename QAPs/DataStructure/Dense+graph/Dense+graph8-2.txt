For what kind of problems is Borůvka's algorithm useful?
Adding points not mentioned by other answers: Boruvka algorithm solves only one problem  - Minimum Spanning Tree. Currently it is not useful in simple one-processor settings, since other algorithms are either simpler or more efficient, as mentioned by others.  Interesting fact is that it was developed from a practical need - the problem was spanning electricity grid on the area of Moravia, now part of Czech republic, and probably was reused as electricity networks were being developed at this time. So the answer to this question at that time would be that this method is useful for planning electrical networks in an optimal way. Another notable point is that it is in the base of distributed version of this problem, when network of computers with unknown topology is tasked to build a minimum spanning tree of itself. Each computer runs its own program instance and in the end every node knows which of its edges are contained in the MST and which are not. This is useful later for tasks like broadcasting data across network. All distributed algorithms for MST (starting with Gallagher-Humblet-Spira and until latest near-optimal algorithms) rely on Boruvka algorithm at its core.
