Population: How have you noticed the increasing population in your country?How have you noticed the difference in population when you were born(or when you were little or a teenager), when there were billions of people less.
Not really, but what I have noticed is those nasty white housing schemes (sorry, executive developments) being tagged on to the edge of every town and village in the area. That would be a sign of increased population, or a social move to multi home living or more single person households. A true sign of population growth is an increase in the number of schools, where I work schools are being built, but people are moving out of the city too. So in certain parts of the country population is growing, but this is mitigated by population movements from other parts of the country. So although in my rural paradise we are getting plenty of "incomers" we're not tripping over immigrants. (I asume that's the drift of this question)
