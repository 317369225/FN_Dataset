Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013â€“present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
Maybe. As Non-Republican White I would not be. I also tend to think Romney would have had a fight with the tea party had he been elected. Ironically Romney and Obama are not that far apart ideologically especially on trade and Wall Street issues. Are all of Obama opponents racists? No but it is in the mix with criticism. I know a graphics artist who was asked to accentuate Obama lips on some artwork.
