How do I do graph theory?
Learn? Well there are many good books on the subject. I liked Harary, Norman, Cartwright, Structural Models (1965), which discusses directed graphs. It is very approachable but may be a little dated now. You could look at the Graph section (5 chapters) of Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen, et al). Diestel's Graph Theory (2005) is freely downloadable online, but I find it dense. Oystein Ore's Graphs and Their Uses (1990) Shimon Even's Graph Algorithms (1979) Dieter Jungnickel, Graphs, Networks and Algorithms (2005) Also free online is Graph Theory with Applications, Bondy & Murty (1976) http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Perso...   Algorithmic graph theory by David Joyner, Minh Van Nguyen, and David Phillips: https://code.google.com/p/graphb...
