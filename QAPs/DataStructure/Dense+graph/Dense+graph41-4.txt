Why doesn't the water at the bottom of the ocean freeze?The deeper in the sea, the lower the temperature of the water. So why isn't the temperature of the water at the bottom of the ocean extremely low and, if so, why doesn't it freeze?
One reason that water doesn't freeze at the bottom of the ocean may be because it's salty down there. Cold water is more dense than warm water, so it makes sense that the coldest waters lie at the bottom of the oceans. In the same way, salty ocean water is more dense than pure water, and the saltiest ocean water sinks to the bottom of the ocean too. Remember how salt melts ice? This happens because salt atoms get in between the water molecules, which prevents them from lining up into the nice, regular crystal pattern they need to turn into solid ice. Basically, this lowers the freezing point of ice, which means water can be below 0 Celsius at the bottom of the ocean and not turn into ice. Actually, the main reason water doesn't freeze at the bottom of the ocean may be that it rarely gets that cold down there. Water freezes at normal pressures (on land, at sea level) at zero degrees Celsius. However, it rarely does dip that low. And even if it does go below freezing, several factors (mentioned by others here on Quora) explain why it would not stay down there. Mostly, it's because the density of solid water (ice) is less than liquid water. Saltiness may have little (or nothing) to do with it, however. Interestingly, there are forms of ice that are denser than liquid water: High Density Amorphous Ice, and Very High Density Amorphous Ice. These forms of ice could form at the bottom of the ocean, IF some very unusual conditions were met. Sadly, the bottom of the ocean is very unlikely to meet these conditions.
