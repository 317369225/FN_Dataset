Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
Well are those persons fulfilling the purpose of Quora? I cannot imagine that to get those upvotes all they had to do was type long nonsensical sentences? You insult the intelligence of the Quora community by implying that we don't read these posts because they are too long and we just assume that "because it is long then it must be important so here's an upvote!". I have never seen any online community work like that and neither does Quora. Nobody can get maximum upvotes without the  evaluation and consensus of the users unless they hacked  the Database.
