What is the best algorithm to match resumes with jobs?
The trouble with parsing resumes is that their data is inconsistent because everybody writes it differently. Computers rely on structured data (i.e. first name, last name, etc.) to be an efficient tool. Unstructured data (job postings, resumes) is not defined. There is no definition of what data is in the job posting or resume.Â  You could submit a recipe for an omelette and call it a job posting or resume and the computer will happily process it. Most people use their one-size-fits-all resume for all job applications even though the requirements are different with every job posting. This means that resumes do not correlate well with job postings. There is always information missing because people simply omit it. No algorithm or even reading by a human can fix that. You have to go back to the candidate and ask. A better way is to help job seekers find job postings where they match the requirements and demonstrate this to the job seeker and the employer. That allows HR sort the resumes in a transparent way. This reduces the reading of the wrong job postings for the job seeker and wrong resumes for the employer.
