What are some unsolved problems in graph theory?A basic explanation of the problem with pointers to its current status would be appreciated.
For me the biggest unanswered question is, can a graph express more than a relational model? I am not a mathematician I do not know how to express more than bijective. This a really puzzling problem, I do know that a graph is more efficient than a relational model (from a technical point of view). But I am not sure if they are more expressive. I looked into Bayesian networks and matching theory, but I could not find any theory regarding that. It would be interesting to know that, because in that case all relational models would be a special case of graph model. Further can a graph express any relationships and states in a protein or a whole DNA/RSA set. If protein folding could be expressed as a graph, I think that would also be very interesting. At the moment graphs are used for any kind of optimization problems, routing, CPU optimization, execution optimization in programs, train timetables, buying preferences, navigation -> linear optimization. In the graph DB community the overall claim is-> everything is a graph, graphs are everywhere, but as far as I know their is no proof for that claim. The universe is probably a discrete one, graphs are discrete, may be graphs are really universal.
