If f(x+y) =f(x) +f(y), what would f(x) be without the assumption of continuity?
Even without the continuity assumption, it turns out that there is a constant c such that f(x) = cx whenever x is a rational number. I'll defer to Wikipedia for a proof of this: Cauchy's functional equation Adding in a continuity assumption at this point would be enough to show that f(x) = cx for all real x. In fact, it's sufficient for f to be continuous at just one point to show that f(x) = cx for all x. If we do not assume continuity, then f can look really weird. It still looks like f(x) = cx on the rational points, but it's all over the place on irrational points. In fact, if f does not satisfy f(x) = cx, then you can prove that its graph is dense in the entire plane. What this means is, if I tried to graph the function like I did below for the function f(x) = x, the entire picture would be blue. You could pick any point on the xy-plane, zoom in as much as you want, and you would still see blue. Because of this, these functions are usually called pathological.
