How much of the difference between Democrats and Republicans is attributable to the difference between rural and urban life?
Rural life used to mean agriculture, mainly.  That didn't require a lot of formal education (for the help, anyway; managing a modern farm efficiently can involve complex investment decisions).  Less education suggests more influence for church leaders and their socially conservative mores.  And, things change slowly in the countryside, making people uncomfortable with change of any kind.  Conservative => resistance to change and Conservative => republican. Living in a city means a much wider choice of opportunities are just a subway ride away, if you have the skills and training to take advantage of them.  That tends to promote education, and competitive businesses promote change.  Also, new immigrants traditionally went to cities, so city-dwellers have to be more accustomed to more social diversity, and changing neighborhoods (as the immigrant sources change over the years, and former poor immigrant areas become gentrified).  People comfortable with change and complexity tend to be democrats. The other factor is income/wealth.  The modern republican party is fundamentally dedicated to making wealthy people even wealthier.  Since it's hard to win elections with only the votes of the wealthy, they also claim to promote social conservatism, figuring that the less well educated rural people can be persuaded to vote against their own interests.  So, old money, both urban and rural, votes republican.
