Why are countries like India and China so densely populated? What are the circumstances and reasons?
In pre-industrial societies, populations grew in relation to the resources available to them. If a region had a stable climate, good soil, and plenty of water, the population would rise quickly. Eastern China was one of these regions. Beyond that, what crops could be produced also played a role. Places which produced rice, such as China, often have very high population density. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wi... https://commons.wikimedia.org/wi... This is because a rice paddy could produce more calories than a wheat field (or other crop) of similar size. Rice production was also very labor intensive, which incentivized farmers to have large families. China was one of the first places to develop agriculture, much to the benefit of the Han Chinese. The Han Chinese population was able to grow rapidly and displace other populations and this allowed the later Chinese Emperors to raise massive armies which they used to unify and maintain what we now think of as China.
