Did a phase transition cause the large scale structure of the universe?
The large scale structure of the universe is well modelled today by attraction of dust produced according to the different energy densities consistent with the microwave background fluctuations. There isn't a need to assume there was a gross phase transition. If there were a gross phase transition, then it is not likely to have so many bubbles, if it is a first order transition, you would expect one or two bubbles that collided once, so universe-scale sheets, not this filamentous structure. The filamentous business is reproduced from collapse of the hydrogen and helium produced in the big bang under the action of gravity, remembering that only the locally densest parts produce galaxies of stars that we can see. The phase transitions in the early universe was a popular topic in the late 1970s, early 1980s, and the upshot of this research is that there was inflation, through a smooth settling of an inflaton field. This is consistent with observations. The phase transitions in the early universe include a transition to electroweak breaking, but this was likely smooth (second order), as the Higgs field settled gradually, when the potential acquires a minimum away from zero. This doesn't lead to bubble formation, but a lot of Higgs fluctuations, which would eventually decay to standard model matter. This phase transition is hidden, because the earliest we can see experimentally from standard matter is around 3 minutes past the beginning, when big-bang nucleosynthesis was happening.
