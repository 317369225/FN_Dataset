Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Why are Quora users predominantly liberal?One thing to consider is that many other originally tech/startup sites—like HN, /.—tend to lean classical liberal/libertarian. They're very big on privacy, civil liberties, freedom and individualism. Quora has a bunch of policies just tailored to alienating people like this. In particular: Forcing everyone to use real names—"hackers", especially, love pseudonyms—see gwern. You wouldn't write an account of using the Silk Road on Quora! Facebook integration. For people who value privacy, prevalent Facebook integration is anathema. Not letting unregistered viewers read answers. Why bother writing an answer if it's going to be hidden away from most people? All this keeps a good portion of the HN crowd off Quora. It kept me from joining for a long time! And even now, it keeps me from caring too much about the quality of what I write here. By now, Quora has also built up its own hivemind which is rather pro-government and not very individualistic. So this also keeps people who largely disagree off the site. This is reflected far more in voting patterns than written answers, but it is pretty evident. Updated 17 Aug • View Upvotes
