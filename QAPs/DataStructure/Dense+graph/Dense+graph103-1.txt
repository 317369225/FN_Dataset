Does ice weigh more than water?If I had one gallon of water (about  8.35 lb.), then froze it, what would it weigh afterwards?
8.35 lb, just the same, however the volume of the ice would be more than the volume of the water. To be really nitpicking  the MASS of the water is unchanged but since ice occupies more volume than the water its center of gravity will rise and be a few millimetres  further from the center of the earth. Thus the WEIGHT of the ice will be a tiny, tiny amount smaller.
