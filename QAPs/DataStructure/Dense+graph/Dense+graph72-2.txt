What are some alternatives to standard written music notation?
Klavarskribo is a notation for keyboard music. Personally I don't think it's much easier to read than regular notation. It looks like the "piano roll" notation that sequencer programs use. There is a Braille music notation. It is quite clever in using shortcuts to keep it compact. Tablature notation is quite popular for guitar, since it explicitly indicates where to put your fingers. Unlike with a piano, where there is a single key for every note, on a guitar you have some choice. Therefore tabulature is in some ways preferable over regular notation. Tabulature is also popular with instruments that are often retuned, and historically it was used quite often for lute and viola da gamba music.
