What are some subtle aspects (humorous, romantic or mathematical) of Klein Four's Finite Simple Group (of order two) song?I get some of the jokes like wordplay on 'function', 'tensor' and 'identity', but I feel like I'm missing out on some of the more subtle jokes (especially the ones with category theory references). Thanks.
