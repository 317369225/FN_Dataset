Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?To add to what Nate and Graeme mentioned, I think that there are some incorrect assumptions in the question. First of all, Quora isn't "aspiring" to be anything other than a damn good community for intellectual discussion. Unlike Daily Kos or Huff Post, it's not trying to promote any particular political views. In fact, Quora itself does not generate content - its users do. And because of this, the content on the site is going to reflect the opinions and beliefs of its users. The only way I can imagine that Quora might be able to represent the entire swath of American political views would be to make sure that answers reflecting moderate opinions got 40% percent of upvotes, conservative answers 38% percent, and liberal answers 19%. Somehow I don't think that's a good idea. To reiterate my answer to your question, no, Quora does not aspire to be a "fever swamp for liberals and progressives," it just wants to create the best possible experience for its users.
