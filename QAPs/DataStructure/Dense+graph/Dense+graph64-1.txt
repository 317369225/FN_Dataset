What are some of the common parallel algorithmic problems?
I can't decide what you mean by interesting. To me, interesting means not-so-easy. Well-known highly parallel algorithms like matrix-matrix-multiply are are not interesting to me. The simplest, and very interesting algorithm, I can't stop thinking about is a parallel histogram. I did do some analysis of it here: http://www.futurechips.org/tips-... . Once you get past the histogram (which can consume months), you can look at some task-parallel workloads. I have an example of a simple maze problem on my blogÂ  too. I hope it helps.
