Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013â€“present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
I think given the current state of Journalism and what has been happening to the the freedom of the press they might actually look upon a 'Ron Paul' character more favorably today than even 2 years ago. I think Mitt Romney is a different creature and there is no evidence that Mitt would treat the press or the constitution any differently than, Bush, or Obama.
