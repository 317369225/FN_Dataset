Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?No, I've gained a lot of insight into politics from both sides of the aisle from the site. Compared to most other political forums, Quora is incredibly open to opposing views and honest discussion. Go on Daily Kos, FreeRepublic, Reddit r/politics etc. and see how the discussion goes. Getting banned is not hard. I'd call those places a fever swamp. Most of the internet leans left compared to America, and there is really no "neutral ground" - every place is self selecting to some degree. Yes, I notice liberalism is far more popular on the site, and comment chains or snarky answers that are liberal get upvoted, while conservative posts that are not super-carefully phrased end up collapsed. There are some topics where the "Overton window" of discusion is pretty narrow - if your view conflicts too much with the left-leaning one of Quora too much, gg. Sometimes you're even called a troll, ostracized etc. This happens on hot button social topics especially - religion, abortion, etc. It bothers me sometimes, but such is life. People are people. Most importantly, not everyone subscribes to political relativism - many people are very passionate about subjects and find certain views very repugnant and/or morally wrong. Would Quora be better if it had more conservatives participating?
