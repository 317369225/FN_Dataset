Where do most web startups fail?
(1) Marketing.  It is easier to launch a product today than it used to be.  But you cannot expect "if you build it, they will come".  You can build the best darn product in the world, but if no one knows about it, it will fail.  Guerrilla marketing and social media are key when you are on a shoestring budget.  Be creative.  Experiment.  And don't forget good old fashioned offline networking.  Meet people and convince them what a great idea it is, so they can become your evangelists and brand ambassadors. (2) Be flexible.  You may not end up where you were planning to go.  But you need to adapt.  Experiment.  Listen to feedback.  Fail fast.  Try lots of things and see what works.  Launch fast and see what users think.  Don't try to to be perfect.  I see too many entrepreneurs try to "perfect" their products instead of launching and iterating. (3) A product feature is not a business.  One app is not a business model.  Lots of people have an idea for a product or feature that is not enough to sustain an entire business, but they mortgage their entire future on it.  (4) Make sure you offer something scalable.  Custom services are not scalable.  A platform is scalable.  If you want to build a business, it can't be dependent on hands-on FTE hours per customer.  It has to be something that can (eventually) be low-touch, usable by many without a lot of variable cost and extra hours.
