What are some alternatives to standard written music notation?
In addition to standard notation, contemporary composers have utilized: Aleatory, from the Latin word alea, meaning "dice", is music in which some element of the composition is left to chance, and/or some primary element of a composed work's realization is left to the determination of its performer(s). Example: Terry Riley's In C consists of 53 short, numbered musical phrases, lasting from half a beat to 32 beats; each phrase may be repeated an arbitrary number of times. Each musician has control over which phrase he or she plays: players are encouraged to play the phrases starting at different times, even if they are playing the same phrase.   Graphic notation, the representation of music through the use of visual symbols. Example: Mark Applebaum's The Metaphysics of Notation, "a unique work of visual art teeming with evocative glyphs and densely arranged pictographs. The meaning of these visual figures is deliberately left undefined by the composer. Each performer is invited to make a sonic realization of the score by articulating its signs according to a personal interpretation." Text based pieces Example: John Cage's Aria, a "piece to be singable by any male or female vocalist, and he wanted them to freely choose 10 different singing styles that could be rapidly alternated.  Each style is represented by a different color and the shape of the squiggles indicates the general melodic contour.  He was interested in constructing a complex intermingling of disparate styles and genres, but wanted to leave the particular pitches, durations and timbres to the performer’s discretion." Proportional, temporal, and grid notation Example: Xenakis' Psappha is written in a unique graph notation and consists of 2,396 segments and presents a greater demand on the performer due to this unique style.
