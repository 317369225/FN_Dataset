How does sparsity of a matrix affect matrix inversion?I want to know the time complexity involved in computing the inverse of matrix. In general it is O(n^3) where is the matrix size (n rows / n columns). But what if the matrix is sparse, can the time complexity be expressed as a function of non-zero elements in the matrix?
