Lists of Top Quora Content: What are some of the best answers on Quora?Could be the most brilliant, detailed, enlightening, greatest, best source, smartest, wittiest, mind blowing, simple, crazy, touching. In short, answers that makes you say wow...this should be on the all time top answers list of Quora.   For starters, I nominate Tim Morgan 's answer to What do all the controls in an airplane's cockpit do?
Originally Answered: What are some of the best answers that you’ve read on Quora?Honestly, that answer really made my day when I read it: Anonymous' answer to What does it feel like to have the top answer on a question (for a long time), only to just get a notification that a Quora power user has just answered it? It just so happened that the one who wrote it was one of these power users, and so it's a big troll on behalf of that user, but it still did express my views exactly on that topic. Quora is awesome because some creative minds come up with answers which you would never have imagined possible before. Two very good examples of this: Jon Davis' answer to Military Strategy: What are the optimal siege tactics for taking Magic Kingdom's Cinderella Castle? Ariel Williams' answer to Can a lightsaber be created? There are some very insightful and personal answers that could really change your point of view on stuff in the "cheating", "drugs", "dealing" and "prostitution" sections of the website. Anonymous' answer to Drug Dealers: What is it like to be a drug dealer? Tommy Winfrey's answer to What does it feel like to murder someone? What is it like to be a stripper? Anonymous' answer to What are different reasons why people cheat on their partner? I remember reading some other really personal answers that moved me a lot, but can't seem to find them. However, the questions of the type "what is it like to [something personal]" give the opportunity to people to express themselves and share life experiences. You can learn a lot from them.
