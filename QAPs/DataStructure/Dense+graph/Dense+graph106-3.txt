Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013â€“present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
If a white Democrat were President, and he or she: 1. Passed the ACA without a single Republican vote containing 20,000+ pages of undecipherable new regulations encompassing fully one sixth of the U.S. economy and making a complicated healthcare system even murkier and less accessible. 2. Had an HHS Secretary that thought it ethical and legal to demand donations for ACA implementation from companies that she is regulating, 3. Had an administration that unquestionably botched the pre-Benghazi consulate security requests, the military response during the attack, and then the aftermath as well. 4. Had an hyper-partisan IRS that deliberately targeted multiple conservative groups throughout America. 5. Had a Department of Justice that pulled records to 20 phone lines and 100 reporters while investigating a single security leak. Republicans and conservatives would be equally unhappy. Why bring race into this? For the very large majority of Republicans and conservatives, this is an issue of politics, ethics and competence.
