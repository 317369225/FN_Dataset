82 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend of the 4th of July, 2014. What is the cause of this continued surge of violence and what is being done to control it?See http://my.chicagotribune.com/#se....
I lived in Chicago for about 4.5 years and I worked in the area for another two years after I moved away. From anecdotal evidence (which isn’t the best) and media sources, the majority of the violence in Chicago is tied to the city’s booming drug trade. On the Chicago’s West and South Sides there are large areas which are being fought over by various sets (groups) of local gangs. The reason for this is that the drug trade in the city has become even more lucrative since the economic downturn, making it “necessary” (at least in the minds of local gangsters) that they defend their territory by any means at their disposal. The majority of Chicago residents who don’t live in these areas, and who are not involved in the drug trade, have no reason to fear this violence as it occurs in pockets around the city, most of which are already known for their high rates of crime. The local media unfortunately is making it appear that shootings are occurring all over the city, including nominally safe areas such as Lakeview/Andersonville, Hyde Park/Kenwood and the Beverly Hills/Mt. Greenwood. It isn’t. Also, a smaller number of the shootings are interfamilial/intra-relationship violence. While these are also tragic, they aren’t the gang-related violent activities which are predominating and the media should do a better job of delineating which acts of violence are related to drugs and which are unfortunate, but personal, violent disputes.
