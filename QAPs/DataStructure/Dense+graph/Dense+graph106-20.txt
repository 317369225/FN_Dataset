Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013–present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
Gary Teal, I do not find the question offensive. I personally do not know one African American, Hispanic, or Indian that is a republican. That says to me that those in power before other races could vote are still fighting to control America. There was nothing wrong with Mitt; he just changed sides on issues too often. Ron Paul is another matter. Paul and his followers are paranoid that the American Government is out to get them. The American people decided at the last election that they are happy with the direction the country was going. – Weldon Young (white republican that voted democratic in 2012)
