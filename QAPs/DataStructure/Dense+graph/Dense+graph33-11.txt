If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
No, it would not freeze. Water expands as it turns to ice because the molecules arrange themselves in a rigid lattice structure wherein the molecules are farther apart than in liquid water. Without room to expand, the water molecules will be unable to rearrange themselves into this lattice structure and will remain in liquid form. Another way to think about this is that pressure as well as temperature controls phase changes (which is why water boils at lower temperatures when it's at high altitude). The pressure exerted on the water molecules by the unbreakable container would offset the freezing temperatures and prevent the water from freezing.
