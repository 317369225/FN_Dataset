Where do most web startups fail?
People: Because you can't hire belief and devotion. Being part of a start-up isn't like any other job. Getting a staff which has faith in the good times and bad times is something which is hard to do. Money: Wasting money on excessive office space/equipment. Marketing: Another case of wasting money. Trade shows, throwing swanky parties, SEO (which is earned by good sites anyways) and single use ad campaigns that run for too long and are not inovative or well designed.
