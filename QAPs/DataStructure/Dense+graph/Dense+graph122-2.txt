Why does gravity decrease beyond 4500 meters below sea level?
As you go deeper into earth, the 'sphere' on which the object is 'sitting' is the effective sphere/mass would attract it. Since, the effective mass decreases as you delve deeper into earth, the pull of gravity too decreases. But, that is theoretical answer, because it assumes that earth is having same density everywhere. The fact is, earth's density increases as you go deeper into it. Thus, the upper crust is very light compared to the inner layers of earth. So, in reality, as you go down, for the initial 50 kms, the pull of gravity increases, but after it, it decreases rapidly.
