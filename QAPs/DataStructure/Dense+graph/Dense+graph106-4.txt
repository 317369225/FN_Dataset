Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013â€“present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
As a Conservative of the "non-white variety" I find this question offensive. This is just the type of BS that liberals are famous for. Lets deflect the real issues with race-baiting, name-calling and accusations of sexism. If Mitt Romney had won, I would be happier. Hopefully by this point in his presidency he would have begun implementing his agenda and working on deficit reduction along with possibly repealling Obamacare. I know the retort will be that the ACA was actually a Conservative brainchild, but whether it was a Republican or Democratic idea, It simply stinks. Although there are some good protections in there for patients with pre-existing conditions, the bulk of it is just another progressive tactic to bend businesses over and give them the fiscal shaft.
