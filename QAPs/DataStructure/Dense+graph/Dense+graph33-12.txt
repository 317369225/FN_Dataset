If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
As someone not formally trained in science but with a reasonable grasp of both basic physics and analytical thought, I think Alan is right to invoke the definition of "freezing temperatures" in answering the question.   Before reaching his post, I was thinking that the key lies in the definition of "frozen," which, I suspect is similar to Alan's point. As I understand it,  water's phase changes involve a change in molecular arrangement that results (in layman's terms) in a different substance. In one scenario, that substance is what we call steam; in another it's what we call ice. Their different molecular arrangement imbues them with radically different properties (which can thus be exploited for different purposes). But under the conditions discussed here, what forms is neither steam nor ice. It is (assuming it doesn't remain liquid water) a third, still different substance. Which, if I'm right, makes the question as much a semantic one as a physics one. (BTW, are there different kinds of water? I.e., liquid H2O with a different molecular arrangement than what I drink?)
