Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013–present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
The right wing press would not be happier, because we would not be significantly better off, and they wouldn't have had a scapegoat.  But don't get me wrong, I am not endorsing the current administration.  The only candidate who would have made a serious difference in the country was Ron Paul (or maybe Gary Johnson, who I voted for), but that's off topic.
