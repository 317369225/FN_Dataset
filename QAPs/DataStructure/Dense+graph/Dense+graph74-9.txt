Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
I'll just add to the pile of answers here. I have been writing here for three years and have 1,700-ish answers under my belt, and I still can't predict very well which of my answers people will love and which will go ignored forever. Like other folks, I have had huge "hits" that were short off-the-cuff remarks, as well as long detailed essays. I think anybody who would try to game the system with long answers would quickly learn that it did not yield results and was a waste of time, and stop.
