Does a Facebook Page, in any way, affect SEO?
Not at the moment. And probably not in the future. It's still a debated issue and one that I see come up quite frequently, but the fact remains that Google canâ€™t crawl Facebook share data, and it has a lot of difficulty getting reliable data crawling Twitter or most other social media networks. After the Google+ uproar last year, Matt Cutts pretty quickly dispelled the rumors of Google +1s having a ranking effect. Pretty soon after all of that, my company wrote a post that goes into more detail regarding the situation and attempts to dispel that social signals will effect rankings any time in the near future. Hope this helps. Why SEO Social Signals Will Never Be a Thing
