Is 50% solar efficiency enough to power a home on a cloudy day?
If you are seeking to be truly off the grid, even 100% solar efficiency is not going to be enough to power a home on a cloudy day. Clouds can reduce the incoming usable irradiance substantially - nearly to zero in some cases. Most solar systems are "grid-tied", so that when it is cloudy, or night time, or if you simply aren't producing enough solar energy to fully power your home, you can pull energy off the grid. When you produce more energy than you need, you provide it back to the grid. This is a very effective method of deploying solar electricity. I would argue with Robert J. Kolker that is more effective than centralized solar plants, where the cost of transmission is substantial. Utilities don't like it, because it is a resource they typically can't monitor and control that changes the load on the grid. But, I suspect that the utilities will embrace it and own it eventually. Or, SolarCity will be your new electric utility at some point.
