Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?Without taking a stance on whether Quora ought to promote politically neutral perspectives, it's worth noting that, from a strictly demographic perspective, Quora appeals to groups likely to support Democratic candidates. Given Quora's other characteristics, I think the political makeup of its users was pretty inevitable. It's based in Palo Alto and clearly draws a number of members from Silicon Valley. Obama won 73% of the vote in San Mateo County, home to Stanford/Palo Alto. Obama won 69% of voters in Santa Clara County, home to San Jose. Quora users are disproportionately younger. Obama won 67% of voters under 29 years old. Quora users are disproportionately well educated, which isn't surprising given the level of interest in high-tech start-ups. Obama won 58% of voters with a postgraduate degree, more than any other education level. In affluent/progressive coastal states, these numbers are higher. For instance, Obama won 66% of voters with a postgraduate degree in California, which is a large reason why Democrats do so well in places like Silicon Valley, Boston, Seattle, etc.
