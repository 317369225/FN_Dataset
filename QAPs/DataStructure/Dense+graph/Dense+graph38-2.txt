Can you construct a sinusoidal function using only a straightedge and a compass?I assume it's impossible, due to the issue of squaring the circle - however, I know you CAN construct square roots, which are solutions to sine - does this make at least a convincing approximation possible?
Using a straightedge and compass, you can't make any curve except part of a circle.   You can approximate curves with short, straight line segments. The set of points that can be reached by straightedge and compass is dense in the Cartesian plane. This means you can get arbitrarily close to any x,y point you want, even though you can't reach most of the points exactly. And of course you can draw a line between any two points you calculate. So you can connect the dots with any accuracy you want.   Pretty tedious way of drawing a sine function.
