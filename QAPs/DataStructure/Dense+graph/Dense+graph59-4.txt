How fast is lithium ion battery technology improving each year in terms of power density, costs, recharge cycles, etc.?
Currently, one of the biggest problems of lithium-ion batteries is that they can’t be charged very quickly. By replacing the graphite anode with NTU’s titanium dioxide gel, the researchers say they've created LIBs that can be recharged to 70% capacity in just two minutes. Furthermore, because the new gel is much more resistant to micro fracturing and dendrite formation, the new batteries have extreme endurance of over 10,000 charge/discharge cycles — about 20 times more than current LIBs. In real-world terms, this new lithium anode could triple or quadruple the battery life of your smartphone or electric vehicle — or, alternatively, make it so you can get away with a much smaller battery. For EVs, where the cost of the batteries is a major barrier to mass-market pricing and adoption, this could be a very serious breakthrough.
