Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
By just changing the algorithm that data is written with this SSD breakthrough means 300% speed boost, 60% less power usage even on already purchased existing drives This should also extend SSD life because it reduces the numbers of writes necessary to get your data onto the SSD.  It can be put into use on many existing SSDs just with a firmware upgrade.   In tests, drives using the technology wrote data 55% less often than drives without and performance increases of up to 300% were noted. This could enable high-end devices to easily reach transfer speeds of 1.5GB/s as current models achieve around 500MB/s typically; 60% less power was also used in the lab tests due to the lack of additional drive writes.   See link below for more details...
