Do BCS computer rankings update previous game difficulty based on new information?In other words, if Stanford beats a seemingly bad team in Week 2, the computer rankings will give them some middling score for that win. If that bad team ends up being dominant, do the rankings update, giving Stanford more credit for the Week 2 victory?
Yes, your scenario is correct. The computers take in to account your strength of schedule. That is obviously based on how strong your opponents are. The more games your opponents play, the more accurately computers can guess their strength. So if Boise State beats Georgia in week 1, and Georgia starts out 0-2, that doesn't help Boise State's case in week 2. But by week 8, Georgia is 5-2, riding a 5 game winning streak, and that helps Boise State's strength of schedule. This is why the Toldeo-Syracuse game was so critical in the BCS. If Toledo wins that, it helps Boise State's strength of schedule. Because the call was blown, they lost, hurting the SOS. So after you beat a team, you want them to win the rest of their games because that will make you look all the better.
