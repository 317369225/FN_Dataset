How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?
Learn data structures and algorithms by taking relevant classes at your school, reading textbooks, reading online material, and watching video lectures. Make sure you understand all of the following algorithms and concepts: Breadth First Search Depth First Search Binary Search Merge Sort Quick Sort Tree Operations Bit Manipulation Recursion Big-O Performance Implement data structures and algorithms. See: Algorithms to Implement Data Structures to Implement If you lack a basic understanding of data structures and algorithms, start with a class or textbook. I'm using Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java (3rd Edition): Mark A. Weiss. Get an interview preparation book like Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell that includes programming practice problems. Solve problems from the book. Search online for real interview questions from the companies you are interviewing with. Solve problems. Some popular websites: CareerCup TopCoder GeeksforGeeks Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) Project Euler HackerRank There are also some good MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) on algorithms. I've seen a few over on Coursera that might be good as a supplement to an algorithms class (or a replacement, if you can't take one at your school). Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 (Stanford) Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2 (Stanford) Algorithms, Part I (Princeton) Analysis of Algorithms (Princeton) When solving problems, emulate the interview environment. If you'll be coding on a whiteboard during your interview, don't only solve practice problems on your computer. Updated 21w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
