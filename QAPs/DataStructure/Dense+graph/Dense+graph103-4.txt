Does ice weigh more than water?If I had one gallon of water (about  8.35 lb.), then froze it, what would it weigh afterwards?
Water is a very very unusual fluid. The answer to your question does not lie in the weight as much as it does on the density of water. Mass, as a fundamental property of matter is independent of temperature variations. Density which relates to mass as it divided by volume (m/V) thus varies with temperature as the volume of matter depends on temperature. Volume varies directly with temperature, inversely with density, hence density varies inversely with temperature. However, for now, we shall stick to weight density which equals simply weight by volume (w/V), as it is more fitting to the question. However, like i mentioned, water is a funny funny fluid. For water, its maximum density is reached at 4 degrees Celsius. It then decreases again as we go on towards freezing point. As ice is formed, the nature of the hydrogen-oxygen bonds change such that the hydrogen dominates the inter-molecular forces as water compacts itself into ice. Hence, ice is less dense than water (see graph) Thus, even though you may take a gallon of water and froze it to ice, you have essentially contracted its volume. Now ice at 0 deg celsius will weigh less than water at 4 deg celsius due to the difference in density, but if you see from the above graph, there will come a point when both will weigh exactly the same as we move towards room temperature and beyond. Infact, boiling water weighs the least of all.  ( see below table in the page : Water Density (water properties), USGS Water Science School ).
