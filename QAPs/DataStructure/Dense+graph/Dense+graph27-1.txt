Where do most web startups fail?
There are three superficial reasons, but I think they're important to point out because increasing the level of detail on potential reasons for failure doesn't help if you don't understand the larger reasons behind them: Picking a small market - that is, if the company were to develop a killer product that wins 85% of target customers that encounter it, the total number of such potential customers is too small for the company to succeed. Failing to develop a killer product. Either the product is not worth building (and therefore using) because it doesn't provide a significant advantage over the status quo, or the product is poorly designed (has the wrong features, has features that are poorly implemented), or the product never ships. Poor operations that fail to find/ship a killer product and/or fail to scale it. Perhaps you've built something great, or are almost there, but don't have the operational support to scale it up to a meaningful, profitable, large business.These three things are the only things that matter. Everything else (getting the people and relationships right, fundraising, paperwork, sales/marketing, etc. etc. etc.) are just means to an end. If you're doing something that doesn't help you improve upon these three points, you're doing something wrong.
