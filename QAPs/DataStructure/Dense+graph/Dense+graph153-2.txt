In what situations would someone use Dijkstra without a heap over Dijkstra with a heap?My guess was that the heap version would consistently outperform, but this is not so. How can one make the distinction in contests? EDIT: I see the time complexity for the regular version is O(V^2). However, the time complexity for the heap version is O((V + E) log V). So for a sufficiently large number of edges, would it be better to use the algorithm without a heap?
