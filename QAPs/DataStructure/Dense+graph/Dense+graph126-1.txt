Given a volume consisting of a number of locations within a defined 3-dimensional space, and each of these locations is assigned some number, is there some obvious metric that can be applied that measures the complexity of the distribution of the measurements?
I don't know of an "obvious measure".  I can tell you how I would approach this problem. I assume that the value A= f(x,y,z) + Noise The function f parametrises the way the A varies in space  and "Noise" represents the sum of random variations,measurement error, and extraneous influence e.g. g(w) where w is some unknown or unmeasured independent variable. If the function f is a good fit of A then noise will minimised. The goodness of fit may be measured by the least value of the RMS of Noise. IMHO, What you need to do is to find a suitable 'simple' function f which represents the variation of A in space whilst minimising noise. If A were the temperature and each point received hear from a number of sources of heat. Then we might be able to describe the temperature variation in terms of the temperature and location of a number of heat sources. As you arbitrarily increase the number of heat sources, you will increase the complexity of the fitting function and reduce the Noise. If we take the conductivity of space( eg within a material) as a free parameter, then complexity rises with the number of heat sources, and zero noise could be obtained with a million heat sources and zero conductivity. At the other extreme, we could take f as a constant and all variation in space as noise. I conclude that complexity is a measure of f but this measure will be dependent on appropriate modelling and an understanding of acceptable noise.
