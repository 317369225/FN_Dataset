Is it possible to adapt sql to do graph database query? Are there any available tools?
I have built a solution to do this for small, number of nodes that are not dense in terms of relationships.  It does require procedural element to do pre-processing. You have to pre-process the edge-node combinations using something similar to depth-first algorithm that you can pick up in Algorithms or data structure book.  When I did this, I recorded node-child relationships and distance from a root node.  You vary the root node to get different pathways. You can then morph this into node-edge-node rows with root node, distance and edge number provided as extra attributes.  Insert that into a table.   Have tables for node attributes and edge attributes.  Now, you can use SQL to find number of out degrees or in-degrees.  You can find shortest distance(s) or path(s) between two nodes.  You can look at a specific part of the graph and use edge/node attributes to do summary statistics.  You can group nodes and then look at the group behavior as a weighted graph. It's not ideal in that it only works for small graphs and you can be limited in the type of analysis.  I did it as an experiment after reading papers on modeling social networks and becoming curious about web links between websites.  It does provide a framework to ask some network questions.
