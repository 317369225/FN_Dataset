Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
I think some people do give long answers to get up votes. Does this work? If the answer is compelling and inciteful, I would say it does. If the answer is just repetitious dogma or claptrap BS, then no. It won't get up-votes. It will get snarky remarks poking holes in the windbag who wrote it.
