What are the Dover Publications on mathematics that are absolutely fantastic readings for an undergrad?I’m reading “Infinitesimal Calculus”, by Henle and Kleinberg, a fantastic Dover Publication. I’m loving it, hence this question for people better read than me. I'm looking for books like the one I mentioned: the topic is modern, all the relevant technical details are there, the writing is excellent, and it’s easy to follow even for an undergrad. Thanks!
