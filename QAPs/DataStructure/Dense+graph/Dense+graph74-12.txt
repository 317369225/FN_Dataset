Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
I think this thought comes out of the need to feel special. Also, to have more credits means that you can easily find large audience and express your inner thoughts and uncertainties. Quora is a unique place to attract a lot of people to bother about you.   The Quora credits are moral rewards. The most interesting is that you are  actually rewarded with something you can "touch".
