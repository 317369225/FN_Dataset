Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Is there a liberal bias on Quora? Are Quora answers liberal, on balance?There is an increasing amount to research relating personality types to where people lie in the political spectrum, see for example Personality and Political Attitudes. This relates Big Five personality traits to political persuasion. The main result seem to be: Conscientiousness (A tendency to be organized and dependable) is linked to the right; Openness to experience (reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety) is linked to the left. There is a less pronounced result for Emotional stability tends to lean right and its opposite Neuroticism leans left. Agreeableness, tends to lean left on economic policies and right on social policies. Extraversion does not seem to correlate to political persuasion. Of these Openness to experience might be the trait we would expect to see more of on Quora. The way the site is structured with many questions across a wide range of topic areas is attractive to those who love new ideas. I'm less sure how Conscientiousness works with Quora. Certainly those who write a organised and detailed answer will do well. However, I think there is a certain chaos and unpredictability to the site which might put these peopleÂ  off.
