Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Is Quora a liberal-based website?It's not a "liberal website" in the sense that it's designed or restricted to and for those users.  Everyone can and will voice their own opinions, regardless of their political views.  However, I would agree that the majority of the users on this site are more liberal. I'm 100% in the middle in regards to politics.  I've had some of my more liberal answers on here upvoted hundreds of times, but when I answer something more conservatively, I immediately get flak in the comments section and downvoted.  It's pretty shitty that people can't upvote answers based on the quality of the content rather than the contents of the content, but that's life I suppose.
