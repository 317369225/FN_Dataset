Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
I am not so sure. On one hand, some people would accept what you are saying without further comment but others might not be so forgiving. It really depends on your viewpoint and how cynical you are. Some people give long and detailed refutations of your point of view and some don't. Other people give equally long answers to questions because they like to sound knowledgeable. In the end, you can always tell which is which by the length of their reply. Short answers are alwaysÂ  preferred because they are not so obvious as attention seeking answers. So to summarize, answers that appear to be all things to all men are suspect.
