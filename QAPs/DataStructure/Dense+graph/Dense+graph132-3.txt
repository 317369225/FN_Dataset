Edward Tufte vs Wisdom of the Crowd: given the technological capability to evaluate the merits of a visualization technique on massive numbers of ordinary people, has any of Edward Tufte's wisdom been upheld, disproven, or found to change (in the society) over time?This question raises one practical possibility of answering this related question: Is there any "bad advice" in Edward Tufte's data visualization books? My motivation for this question comes from the well known fact that large internet companies tend to evaluate web design by doing real-time A/B testing, as a matter of the final stage of validation.
