Where do most web startups fail?
Well I just so happens that CB Insights actually ran a study to try and get a more accurate picture of what it was that cause startups to fail. What they did was, they went through 101 Startup Failure Post-Mortems, which are the articles founders write as a way to inform the community of their unfortunate demise. They also serve to inform those who might be wondering, why it is that they are closing shop. Well having gone through all these articles this is what they came up with. As you can see according to the study the top 3 reason are: "No market need" "Ran out of cash" "Not the right team"Surely this cannot be seen as the de facto reason. After all they only went through 101 out of the thousands of startups that die everyday. In that same breath, however, this does provide a some good insights as to why startups fail.
