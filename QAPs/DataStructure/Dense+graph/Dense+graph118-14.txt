Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Why does Quora have a political bias toward leftist thoughts?It isn't a bias.  A bias is a systematic difference between what is presented and what is the truth. In my experience the discussions on Quora are generally more informed than other forums, so you should regard Quora as less biased than other sources.  Even the Quorans I strongly disagree with tend to argue from positions of facts and reasonable logic, whereas outside of Quora there is a lot more meaningless ranting.
