Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?Quora has given me more access to intellectually rigorous conservative thought than any other site on the web. I absolutely LOVE following Gary Teal, and I just followed Michael Lee as well, based on his important distinction between "liberal answers being popular and liberal answers devolving into name calling." As a lifelong resident of the Bay Area, it's obviously very easy for me to have liberal blinders on. I know this. To keep my brain challenged, I need to actively seek out people who disagree with me on the key controversial issues of the day. Unfortunately, my observation has been that a lot of conservative-oriented media is so full of spin and misinformation that all it does is lower my opinion of conservatives. That's obviously not that helpful. My interactions with conservatives on Quora have had the opposite effect. In more than one instance, I've come to understand an issue from a conservative point of view for the very first time. I may still disagree, but I firmly and solidly grasp where the other person is coming from. I clearly see that their position has intellectual merit. That type of respect and understanding is incredibly valuable in a time when our nation is so divided. Sometimes it's not that fun to be a minority, so I am personally very grateful for the conservatives who frequent this site even though a lot of us disagree with your political views. I'm sure that's kind of exhausting at times! Thank you for being here.
