How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
Brief answer : 2 weeks. Detailed Answer : I was an intern at Google Bangalore and had a job conversion interview at the end of internship. The preparation time varies from person to person. I had done my Data Structures and Algorithms course at college. I used 'Cracking the Coding Interview' book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell in addition to CLRS. I strongly recommend these two books for Google interviews. I started my preparations two weeks before the interview and with some luck managed to clear them. I would be joining Google in October 2014.
