Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?If my answers hadn't revealed it by now, I suppose it's a good time to out myself as a fairly strong conservative.  But I've never experienced what the questioner identifies - even on some relatively controversial questions about the Obama Administration's actions in certain areas, I've generally been treated quite well by the ideological opposition, as well as similarly-positioned answerers. Diversity of thought is just as important as other forms of diversity.  I don't think Quora should encourage one viewpoint or another as long as all such views are expressed with respect.
