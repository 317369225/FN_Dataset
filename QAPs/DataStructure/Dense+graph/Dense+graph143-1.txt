82 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend of the 4th of July, 2014. What is the cause of this continued surge of violence and what is being done to control it?See http://my.chicagotribune.com/#se....
According to the FBI, 50% of violent crime, nationwide, is tied to criminal gangs.  In some jurisdictions, as much as 80% of violent crime is tied to criminal gangs. It's a safe guess that Chicago is much closer to the 80% number than the 50% number. As pointed out by Jon Mixon, such gang violence isn't random or widespread.  It's tied to a limited set of geographic locations, and a limited set of people.  (Sidenote: The idea that white people are in danger in these areas is actually laughably inaccurate.  White people are buying the drugs, and as such the gangs who are selling the drugs have a strong interest in making sure no harm comes to them...  Not that I recommend wandering through the west side at oh-dark-thirty). Now, in these limited areas, and among those limited populations, the violent crime rate is insanely high.  These groups of people are tightly interconnected, and according to some research as few as a dozen or so people may be connected to half or more of homicides, even in a city the size of Chicago.  Read that sentence again, and ponder on the full meaning of it: 50% of homicides in Chicago may be tied, indirectly, to less than 50 people. The solution for crime is fairly simple.  Identify those people, and send them to far away prisons for a long time, where they don't have access to their social organizations.  Doing that, of course, is tougher than it sounds.
