In order to do any project in a developing country, you need reliable information from within that country. The start-up world is full of horror stories of well meaning, wealthy westerners with ideas of how they think things should be done elsewhere. Successful ideas are built upon the specifics of the problems and particulars of life on the inside, not from transplanted ideas from people in a completely different place, culture and infrastructure. Your starting place should be research, with the nationals, in a specific place. It would be interesting to know what aspects of SolarCity you'd like to emulate, but I don't think it is relevent. If you don't have a way of getting an inside view, I suggest pairing up your own areas of expertise with others who have already gotten a start and need help. There are many who are trying to do what you'd like to do, there is no need to go it alone.
