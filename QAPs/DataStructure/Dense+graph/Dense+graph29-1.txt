How do I do graph theory?
Apparently there are about 10,000 videos about this topic that you can list using "graph theory" - YouTube. As usual, some are in series and the quality probably varies a lot. I would use software for visualising questions and problems. Some of us answered about this recently: Bill Bell's answer to What software can I use to visually make a graph (as in graph theory, not as in charts) ? I'm talking about an end-user software, not development tools. As I try to improve my meagre skills in various areas I look for collections of problems by scouring google for "problems and solutions". Some problems on the combinatorics section of Brilliant | Build your problem solving skills. are of a graph theoretic nature. (If you find other good collections I hope you'll send me a message.)
