What can I read to help me better think in terms of networks?I'm looking to sharpen my thinking in terms of what it means to live in a connected world. Are there any essays or books that you have read that have helped you better approach the world in this framework?
I recently read "Too Big To Know" by David Weinberger. It's an exploration of the way that our concept of knowledge is evolving as we move from a print based system of knowledge to a networked/linked system of knowledge.Â  He has an optimistic outlook and suggests that networked knowledge allows us to build more accurate (albeit incomplete) models of reality. He also has several chapters that imagine how we can start to build business models that exploit and take advantage of this new type of knowing. I highly recommend it.
