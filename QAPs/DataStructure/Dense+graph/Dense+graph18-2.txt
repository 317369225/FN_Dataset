Why is mathematics so addictive?
Interesting mathematics often relates one subfield to another. The fewer areas of mathematics that you understand, the less sense this makes. But the more sub-fields you apperceive, the more things every new fact you learn has a chance of relating to. I could explain it in graph-theoretic terms. Learning an isolated few mathematical facts is like isolated points. It doesn't seem to relate to anything. But those who keep at it, build up a fairly dense graph. A new fact, or point, is more easily learned and remembered because the existing structure can relate it to known things. Likewise each new fact (point) could contribute to your understanding of (make new edges to) other things you already know about—either clarifying something you thought you already knew, or making a surprising connection that makes you see the stuff you already knew in a totally different way. Suppose the utility of learning a mathematical fact is proportional to the number of new edges created in your current graph of known mathematical facts, and that the probability of forming an edge is a fixed likelihood per node, constant irrespective of how many nodes there are. (Let's say there's always a fixed 1% chance that any new fact you learn will relate to each already-known fact, regardless of how many facts are already known.) This assumption would generate the observed distribution: beginners have a very low utility whereas the advanced will be "tempt[ed] to indulge in mathematics and neglect important, but much less exciting, mundane activities."
