What are the best rules for reading effectively?
There is effective learning but no effective studying, in a way. What I mean is, whatever way you study, if you learn something as a result of it, then your study is effective. So, there is no method of study is effective. Now, if you quantify learning by pages or chapters, perhaps some way could be said to be most effective. Even then, though, I suspect that the e effectiveness will be limited. The more you learn, the better your study technique is. That's the only rule, ifÂ  you want to call that a rule.
