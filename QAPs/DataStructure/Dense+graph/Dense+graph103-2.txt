Does ice weigh more than water?If I had one gallon of water (aboutÂ  8.35 lb.), then froze it, what would it weigh afterwards?
Well, if you freeze a kilogram of water, you still have a kilogram of water. But if we look at water versus ice, then ice is actually lighter than water. A cubic metre of water is heavier than a cubic metre of ice (how much will vary with temperature). That's why icebergs or icecubes float.
