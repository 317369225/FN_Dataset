Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Why do answers on Quora have a liberal bias?People's biases tend to color the answers they write.Â  Liberal Quorans often answer with a liberal bias, conservative Quorans with a conservative one, and the same with libertarians, socialists, religious, atheist, urban, rural, American, European, Asian, white, black, Hispanic --- you get the picture.
