What is a book that you would recommend buying a print version of rather than digital and why?
Any book that you need or want to flip backwards and forwards to refer to/remember something from earlier in the book. A Song of Ice and Fire series comes to mind, but really any long, involved story with many characters and multiple plotlines would be this way, and e-books are horrible for flipping through.
