Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
When I write long answers, I think the detail is necessary, to provide necessary background or context. I also might write longer answers if I'm telling a personal story that actually happened to me, to provide the relevant detail. One of my most popular answers, though, is three sentences, and many of my longer ones have gotten a handful of votes, if any. So writing a long answer certainly is no guarantee of popularity. If anything, a short and pithy answer or witty one-liner is more likely to be read in full by more people. Someone wanting to get a lot of upvotes would probably write a lot of those, hoping one of them "catches on". I write answers in the hope they'll be helpful to whoever is reading the question. If that requires length I'll do that, if it doesn't I'll be brief. I answer questions because they happen to catch my attention and I think my input might be useful. If I wanted a popularity contest, I'd go post kitten memes somewhere. But long answers certainly can work. The top answer to How do atheists explain how the world was created? is one of the most beautiful narratives of the universe's history I've read anywhere, not just on Quora. It will keep you riveted to reading it. I do tend to skew toward long answers, both reading and writing, because they are detailed and informative. It also doesn't hurt that I both read and type a good deal faster than average, so it takes me little time to read or write a long one. So, yes, Quora is about sharing knowledge. Some people here have a lot of it to share, and that's not always possible to condense to a sound bite. I'm glad they're willing to give a full explanation and I find that very useful.
