How fast is lithium ion battery technology improving each year in terms of power density, costs, recharge cycles, etc.?
Very slowly, and jumpy... in short, the way most specific technologies advance. You get a big jump in capacity when there's money to spend or when someone realizes a big breakthrough. Cost is largely a function of volume... one of the reasons that Tesla is using Lithium batteries in their home power unit, where energy density is less of an issue than cost, is because they're leveraging that to drive up volumes on their batteries. This isn't unique to Li-ion. The same slow improvements have taken place over the course of the life of the NiMh cell as well. It's only when a new technology gets to market, in most cases, that you see a big overall jump in many factors, like the jump from NiCAD to NiMh or NiMh to Li-ion. But money can play a part. General Motors design for the Chevy Volt, which is really an "extended-range electric", not a hybrid, called for a battery that could be longer cycled than the typical 60% capacity of a hybrid cell (it never goes to empty, it never goes to full, and that keeps the battery lasting indefinitely). So they pushed vendors hard, and wound up with a cell that benchmarks at 5,000 charge/discharge cycles, versus the usual 300-500 of your typical laptop or cellphone battery. It's also the case that many of these things are known but not yet practical. The Li-ion cell was in various stages of experimentation for nearly 30 years before the first practical cells shipped. And it's only recently they've had the surge current capacity to be useful in EVs. That's progress, but often progress in directions that the average consumer doesn't appreciate -- because that's where the funding is.
