Is it possible to adapt sql to do graph database query? Are there any available tools?
SQL was not really built for graph problems.  ANSI-99 made recursive SQL standard but few data bases do it well. Oracle's optimizer is by far the best, Postgres is solid, MS SQL Server kind of works and MySQL doesn't do it for all practical purposes. Even with Oracle you are really only talking about hierarchical trees.  That is barely scratching the surface of real graph problems.  I do not want to make SQL part of the solution. I personally do not think we have the right technology for working with graph problems.  We do not need to make the problem harder by forcing SQL into the problem space. Neo4j is a lot of fun upto a healthy medium size amount of data.  But it is not fun when things get into the billions or more.  Other tools are trying but I am not crazy about anything.
