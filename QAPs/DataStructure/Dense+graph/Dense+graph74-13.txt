Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
Probably some of them. My experience here has been brief, but it seems most people here want to be helpful. The long answers I've read, and written, came from genuine concern or passion about the question. I don't care if anyone, what, votes for me? I really, really like helping people, the rest is ego bs.
