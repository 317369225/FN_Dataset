Why does gravity decrease beyond 4500 meters below sea level?
Think of an onion and its layers. Now if you think a worm crawling on that onion (at A), this whole onion is pulling the the worm towards it and vice versa. Now think of another worm a few layers inside the onion. Only the inner layers of onion apply effective pull of gravity on this worm. Net force by outer layers (2-3 in this image) on worm at B will be zero. Earth's gravity acts just like that. When you go deeper, you are not feeling net pull from outer layers, like the worm at B. This means that you are pulled by the mass beneath you (the inner layers). If you assume density to be constant, mass is decreasing with radius^3. Gravitational pull is inversely proportional with radius^2. You can work it out and will find that gravity will turn out to be proportional to radius (if you are inside the onion or any body).
