How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
I just did a bit of preparation the night before, and I got an offer. I think you might be one of those people who is wildly exaggerating the difficulty of questions. You really don't need to know a ton about fancy algorithms; that's not what Google is looking for. That would be testing memorization and knowledge. They want to know about how good you are at solving new problems. Also, I think you don't understand how interviews are judged. It's not about if you can solve the questions. It's not a binary yes/no situation. It's about "How well did you solve the questions relative to other people?" If you're preparing for interviews, focus on interview prep. You're only sometimes trying to solve Google's interview questions? This should be your primary focus. I know that this sounds self-promotional, but get Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions (also available on Flipkart and Amazon India). It's written for this purpose and it works. Just read the 175+ reviews (with the book still being 5 stars). Read the entire 60ish page intro about how the interview process works, what the companies are looking for, and what you really need to know. This will help you get into the mind of an interviewer and understand what interviews are all about. Having some friends do a mock interview (ideally friends who have gone through interviews at Google or a similar company), or you can pay for one on CareerCup. Then focus on solving the questions in the book, and doing some more mock interviews. By the way, there's nothing special about Google interviews. Ignore all the hype. Google asks basically the same types of questions as every other major tech company.
