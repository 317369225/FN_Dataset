How can a high schooler start research in graph theory?My mathematical knowledge goes up to advanced algebra/trig, that's about it. However, I do find graph theory to be an interesting field considering its various applications in the real world. Thanks! Edit: This is for actual research experience for a college level research research I will have to take during my senior year of high school.
Art of Problem solving has a good intermediate counting and probability book that has a few chapters on graph theory.
