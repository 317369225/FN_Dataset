Where do most web startups fail?
Having myself known both failures and successes as an entrepreneur, and having accompanied +80 startups as a consultant for the last 15 years, some of them having failed, I draw this answer from that experience: I think most of startups fail because they do not put enough focus on creating actual Value. By Value, I mean both internal and external values, i.e. value inside the company and outside on the market. Most of them focus on making money, which is one way to get inside value, which is good, but it's not enough. Some of them focus on releasing killer products, which is one way to bring outside value to users and customers, but this is not enough again. There is not enough space here to come into details but the key thing is that a startup must focus on creating inside and outside value at the same time to limit the risks of failure. The strategy should be aligned accordingly. Then, and only then, the revenue model could be maximized, the cost structure could be minimized, thus optimizing operational margins and bringing additional lifetime and investment capabilities. And last but not least, focusing on creating internal value do include creating key assets, whatever it is a technology, a production and delivery system, a large user or customer base, a wide and dense social graph, etc. This for sure make the cake more appealing for stockholders, including investors. I have observed that most startup failures were linked to a clear lack of creating either internal or external values or both. This is why I will soon be publishing a full methodology on "Value Development" for startups, giving the rationale of what I said above. For those interested, stay tuned... (@ypconsulting)
