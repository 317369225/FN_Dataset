Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
Personally, I prefer shorter to the point answers, the long ones I only read if the narrative is really captivating.Â  So most long answer at the most I scan quickly. Did I write long answers? Sometimes, yes, because I needed to address many issues precisely, mainly by copy- pasting suitable illustrations and graphs into my answer, so the answer isn't so dense and more easy to read. If an answer is good I'd upvote it even if I feel it's too long. But no, I don't think people write those long answers just to get more upvotes.
