Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?I think I qualify as someone who is comparatively active in the Politics topic, and that if we stick to a single axis left <-> right political spectrum, that I'm demonstrably on the "left." However, pulling from Who are the (compelling) third party candidates for the 2012 US Presidential Election? I'm increasingly attracted to the idea of subsidiarity and pushing solutions as far down to the local level as is reasonably possible. It is largely my interactions on Quora and having to defend my assertions & arguments to the varied likes of Erik Fair, Bill McDonald, Barry Hampe, Michael Lee, Tom Byron, Charlie Fortin, and true-blue (red???) Republican Gary Teal that has brought me to that position. Part of what keeps me investing my time here is the rigor of the discussion, the challenging of my positions, and the general civility with which it is all done. Echo chambers give me headaches; as much as I value the agreement with many, it is the disagreements that keep me engaged. I'd be curious to see the specific answers with scant intellectual merit referenced in the question details. There are certainly many out there, but I'd want to know where they rank in the answer list. None of the active participants in the Politics topic tend to suffer poor argument, and unpersuasive answers that resort to ad hominems or appeals to emotion tend to fall in my experience.
