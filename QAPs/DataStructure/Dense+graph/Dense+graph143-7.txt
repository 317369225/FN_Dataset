82 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend of the 4th of July, 2014. What is the cause of this continued surge of violence and what is being done to control it?See http://my.chicagotribune.com/#se....
Living in Chicago my feelings are that the biggest issue isn't gun control laws but that schools in low income neighborhoods are being shut down. This results in the combining of kids who are in rival gangs into one school system, the result is devastating. There is no support for these kids because the schools and kids are seen as a lost cause and not "worth" the money to keep certain schools and after school activities open and running. They have no outlet to express themselves so they turn to gangs for the support that should be given to them by community leaders
