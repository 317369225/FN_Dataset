If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
It depends what you mean by "at freezing temperatures".Not only can you prevent water from freezing, but you can also melt ice by increasing the pressure - but only so long as it's not too cold. As you can see from the phase diagram provided by Joshua Engel, the pressure needed goes up very quickly as the temperature drops. At around -10 Celsius it takes about 1000atm of pressure to maintain the liquid phase (so your pipes will probably burst!) and if you try to take it below around -20 Celsius without expanding then it will just either burst your container or go into one of the exotic high density solid phases mentioned in Joshua's answer.
