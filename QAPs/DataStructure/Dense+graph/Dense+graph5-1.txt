What is the difference in Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm?
When to use each of these algorithms? Answer: Use Prim's algorithm when you have a graph with lots of edges. For a graph with V vertices E edges, Kruskal's algorithm runs in O(E log V) time and Prim's algorithm can run in O(E + V log V) amortized time, if you use a Fibonacci Heap. Prim's algorithm is significantly faster in the limit when you've got a really dense graph with many more edges than vertices. Kruskal performs better in typical situations (sparse graphs) because it uses simpler data structures. Source: Kruskal vs Prim
