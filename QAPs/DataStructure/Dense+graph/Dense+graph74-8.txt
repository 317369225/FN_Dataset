Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
I suppose it might be true in some cases, but in my experience after just a few months on Quora is that those most seekng attention are people who post troll-like questions, such as anonymous theists always looking start something with atheists like me.  I don't mean that they targets me personally, but rather atheists as a whole. As for why so many of post detailed answers, it's because that's how Quora is designed.  It's one of the few places online where lengthy answers are not only tolerated; they are encouraged.  Speaking only for myself, there are three main reasons why I write long, detailed answers: 1)  I do it because sometimes it just takes a lot of words for me to accurately express what I want to say.  There are many other Quora  members who are far more skilled than I am at providing succinct replies.  People are free to just scroll past my answers if they prefer short, to the point replies.  I don't much care if they do! 2)  I try to provide useful information based on my own life experience.  This sometimes means providing examples taken from something I've been through and/or that I've read a lot about. 3)  Quite often I find it difficult to figure out a questioners probable age and maturity level.  Someone very young, say in their mid-teens, can ask question that come across as though the OP is in their 30s, while others are obviously very young even if they don't state their age.  Another problem is realizing that for many who use Quora, English is not their first language and North American culture is very foreign to them.  I try to phrase all my answers in a way that can be understood by the majority of possible readers who might see it later, not just the OP.  All of these factors, and sometimes even more, contribute to the length of my answers. Hope this helps!  :-D
