What are the safest London boroughs?
From CityBusters Weblog - London Data Series Part 4 - Community Safety and Crime Rates in London Boroughs On this graph, you can see the distribution of crimes per thousand population in London and in which boroughs it is the most prevalent. Overall, it is not surprising to see the densely packed inner city boroughs with the highest crime rates (more than 100 per 1000 population in 2013/14) while the outer boroughs looks much safer. The good part here, is that crime has been falling across the board over the past few years, some people say the ubiquitous CCTV helped while others argue it had nothing to do with it. The least safe London boroughs The next figure gives us the exact numbers for the top 5 boroughs in terms of crime rates: We can see that the inner-city borough Westminster leads by a very large margin. That doesn't mean you have to fear for your lives when walking through Green park or hanging out in Soho though. Remember that Westminster (and the other inner boroughs) have a massive number of people staying/visiting at all times which are not counted as population. I.e., these numbers include many typical tourist crimes such as pickpocketing and the real average crime number is certainly much lower. Similar reasoning helps to explain the numbers for Camden, Kensington and Chelsea, Islington and Hammersmith and Fulham. The safest London boroughs If, on the other hand, you are looking for the definite list of the quietest and safest boroughs, check out this graph: As we can see, Bexley takes the crown of the safest London borough in 2013/14 with less than 50 crimes per 1,000 population. However, Harrow is really on a very similar level with 50.2 crimes, and Sutton, Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames following suit. Updated 7 Jul â€¢ View Upvotes
