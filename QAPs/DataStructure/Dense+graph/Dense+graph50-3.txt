Robotics: Who are the foremost roboticists in the world and what are some of the projects that they are working on right now?
Tom did an excellent job, but I'd like to add... Kurt Konolige and Gary Bradski of Willow Garage. http://www.willowgarage.com/page... These two men are not just cutting edge in the fields of machine visual perception, but are the leading guys in charge of the Robot Operating System. This project is essentially the Unix of robotics, being the first open source, general-purpose operating system specifically targeted at a machine that uses sensors and manipulators. Ben Goertzel is in the forefront of Open Source Strong AI. His project, OpenCog, is an open source attempt to create a strong AI for the use in robotics and other applications. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben...
