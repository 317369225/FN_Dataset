Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Why does Quora have a political bias toward leftist thoughts?I addressed this elsewhere, but Quora writers from the U.S. are more often than not from the west coast.  It was a Bay Area startup after all.  So that influences the politics section answers. I would argue that it's not really "leftist."  It's very pro-capitalist (did I mention it was a startup?) but in the Bill Clinton, Tony Blair style of pro-corporate liberalism.
