What are examples of one CPU architecture clearly beating another, despite both chips' implementations having similar semiconductor process sizes and die areas?
Well it is fairly hard to nail down processes since there is so much variation. And circuit design being so complex so it can be hard to nail one from the other. Those are two big metrics for performance. We might have to nail down Instruvtions per clock cycle or clock speed as being some architectural metrics as well as capabilities of the instruction set like multicore support or multithreading, vector ops, atomic ops/transactional memory etc. Im not quite sure about the early histriy though i do know in the 90s DEC and motorola had famous designs along with the k3d from amd and the p6 from intel. DECs now famous Alpha 21264 was a very advanced and high speed design. No id say if you want to look at similar processes and sizes around the 65nm range id point to the pentium vs athlon debacle or the rise of the chip multiprocessor. You see intel had yet to test the limits of Instruction Level Parralleilism and tried to game clock speed by using a technique called deep pipelining. I wont go in to the instrcacies but it says to say that each stage modules the clock speed by decreasing it and increasing throughput but also increasing latency. This gave rise yo the clock speed wars which is what gave rise to the power wall in architeture. You see the clock speed was increduble and intel had introduced mutlithreading. But the heat output and the IPC were poor in vomparison to amd. Amd instead went for multiprocessing. Pants on head wreckrd intel that generation. id like to stipulate this was the 90nm range and not 65 as you asked. After the spin off of gloflo from amd and the tsmc being overloaded with chip requests from everyone else. Intel has locked things down pat in a near vertical takeover from arfhitecute to silicon. Their process is watertight.
