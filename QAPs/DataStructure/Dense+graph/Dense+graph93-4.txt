How can I do a projection with a 100-dimensional vector to preserve the inner product?
You may be able to construct an Effective Operator that preserves the norm you want, or at least approximates it warning:  this is highly non-trivial we did this in quantum chemistry http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1... using some very advanced techniques in quantum mechanical many body perturbation theory Page on Washington , although usually we did not try to preserve the norm -- we were more interested in computing matrix elements,.  That is, this approach would allow you to preserve the  matrix element of a Kernel in the reduced space This paper reviews a large number of the known formalisms, although it is a bit dated The algebra of effective Hamiltonians and operators: Truncated operators and computational aspects I believe we can reconstruct an effective similarity matrix, or norm, for the reduced space, although it is a numerical approximation based on certain assumptions that need to hold about the projection and the data.   We did this to compute the polarization effects that arise in certain kinds of spectroscopy, Scitation: Application of the effective valence shell Hamiltonian method to accurate estimation of valence and Rydberg states oscillator strengths and excitation energies for π electron systems and I would imagine we can do it for the kinds of machine learning problems that arise in data spectroscopy Data Spectroscopy:  Gaussian Kernels and Harmonic Oscillators I have worked out some relationships between this approach and what we do in machine learning, both for linear regression (supervised learning) https://charlesmartin14.wordpres... and for eigenvalue problems (i.e unsupervised learning) Effective Operators for Eigenvalues and Clustering Eigenvalue-Independent Effective (Semantic) Operator although this is more of a sketch of an idea , and there may be typos and just general mistakes . it may be possible to use these ideas to construct what you want, although this really depends on the application.  if you like, we can try to work it out and publish I hope this is helpful
