Why are sparse matrices an important consideration in optimization and machine learning?
When you have very large matrices, say 1000 x 1000, which you might encounter solving some large systems of partial differential equations, optimization becomes very important.Â  Such a matrix has 1 million entries, and when you try to factor it it'll consume a hell of a lot of memory. But if you know the matrix is sparse, you don't have to waste time going through each of those entries. You can instead represent it using a sparse matrix data structure and apply special numerical techniques to solve it. A matrix which takes hours to solve can be factored in minutes.
