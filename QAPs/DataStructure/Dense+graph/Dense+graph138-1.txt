What fluids or materials reduce their volume when the temperature rise?Preferably by a reversible process
Remarkably, there are a number of materials that contract reversibly as they are heated: this is called negative thermal expansion. My favorite example is the rubber band, as Richard Feynman explains the video below. As Malcolm pointed out, liquid water exhibits this behavior in a narrow temperature range just above it's freezing point. Other materials, such as cubic zirconium tungstate, exhibit negative thermal expansion over a very wide range of temperatures. The wikipedia article has many more examples: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neg....
