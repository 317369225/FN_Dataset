Is there any reason not to use OrientDB?
Main reason: Bugs, lots of them. Secondary reason: Lack of proper documentation. Last time we tried to use Orient it was impossible to use at scale in a production environment. Why? Simply because we couldn't move beyond development mode. We could not even move it to testing. What are those bugs? You can read the forums about all those or just google "bugs" "orientdb". Having said that, the technology looks promising and we might give it another go in two years when it is more mature. Why does it have so many bugs? Like someone said, a hybrid db is a complex thing to tackle, lots of room for errors. It's hard. Another aspect was that Orient tried to build too many features instead of stabilizing and cleaning existing ones. Why they did this? I guess it's a matter of company valuations and time to market. Even though this reply might sound a bit negative, I still have great expectations on the this tech and wish the Orient team a very bright future!
