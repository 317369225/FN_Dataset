Why are countries like India and China so densely populated? What are the circumstances and reasons?
My 2 cents on high population in India. Back in early 1900s, owing to lack of medicinal facilities in rural areas, child death rate was very high. Thus, it was normal to have 6-8 children in a family, considering that only 2-3 of them would survive to adulthood. Post independence, there was a general improvement in medicine availability and healthcare facilities in India, making the death rate go down drastically. However, Indian government during mid-twentieth century had a poor policy of advocating the importance of family planning to the masses. As a result the trend of having more than 4 children in the family continued for a few decades. The lag between fall of death rate and birth rate led to the exponential increase of the population in twentieth century. Thus a population of 200 million in early 1900s shooted upto more than a billion by 2000.
