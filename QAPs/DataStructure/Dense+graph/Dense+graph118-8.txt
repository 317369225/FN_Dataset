Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?This is an excellent question/comment and as someone who uses Quora, I'm concerned that the site will be limited to the 25% of America that identifies themselves as being liberal. Do Quora users value diversity of opinion? How can those using Quora encourage non-liberals to participate in political discussion when such ad hominem comments like the following from the question about "War on Women" aren't voted down? " cannot help but wonder if the republican party and Fox News are for real? They just sound like a parody of some crypto fascist Christian clown convention!" To permit this type of comment to stand is to accept that the political discussion part of Quora will be nothing more than liberals validating their own views and doom this section to reading like the a blog on a college paper. And this ignores that polls repeated show that America is a slightly right of center country politically. Where is the moderator in permitting this type of post that neither addresses the question or provides commentary other than just to attack those with a viewpoint that the author disagrees with? I'd like to suggest that Quora political commenters refrain from and vote down comments that are just ad hominem attacks. Can we accept contrary opinions without taking it personally?
