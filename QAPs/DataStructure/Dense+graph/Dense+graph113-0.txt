How does the refractive index of a material change?
I will give a short explanation based on what I already know for each question, then show how the data in this document backs it up. Question 1: Refractive index may change because the density of the material changes. The higher the density, the larger the refractive index. Liquids change density with temperature more easily than solids so temperature is usually not considered when measuring the index of a solid unless extreme accuracy is required. Most materials become less dense as temperature increases. Water has a somewhat unique property that it will become more dense when increasing temperature from zero degrees Celsius to 4 degrees Celsius and will then decrease in density when heated above 4 degrees Celsius. From one of the graphs (fig. 3) you see just that: the index decreases as temperature increases (graph sloping down). Also note that density and its Greek symbol rho is mentioned repeatedly in the article. Question 2: Again, the atmospheric pressure can change the refractive index because it can affect the density. As pressure increases, the density becomes greater because you are compacting the material more which makes the index higher. This factor will affect gases more than liquids and liquids. From the graph showing the index lines (fig 5), you will note that for any given temperature, the index will increase as you increase pressure (you cross a higher index line when moving up along the vertical axis). Question 3: The index of refraction is technically only defined for one wavelength. Longer wavelengths are refracted to a lesser degree so they tend to make index of refraction measurements lower. Higher wavelengths refract to a higher degree and would give higher a higher index of refraction. In fig. 2, you see that the index tends to decrease as you increase (move to the right on graph) wavelength.
