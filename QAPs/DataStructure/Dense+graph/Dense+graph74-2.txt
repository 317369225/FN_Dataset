Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
Do some people do this? I'm sure some do. But it's a bad strategy, I think.  At least with me, my most upvoted answers are the shorter ones. Indeed, I sometimes think there is an inverse relationship between how much time I spend on an answer and how many upvotes it gets. If a person wanted to simply maximize upvotes, that person would want to answer a lot of questions on popular topics with short answers that are quick to write. But.... so what if they do?  I mean, let's say someone got on Quora and decided that his only purpose was to get as many upvotes as possible. How would he do that? By answering lots of questions. Answers that don't answer the question don't usually get many upvotes; they often get collapsed; I think a consistent pattern of doing this might get a person banned.
