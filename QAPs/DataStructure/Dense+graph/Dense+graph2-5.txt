Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
From the world of distributed algorithms: Google Spanner's approach to implementing a global "almost" synchronized clock, called TrueTime, and how it's used for synchronization. Whereas traditional approaches to synchronization algorithms in distributed systems have been designed around the approach of saying "Don't trust clocks." Spanner flips that around and uses a combination of GPS and atomic clocks to implement a reliable global clock with an error bound within which you are guaranteed to get the correct time. This is a great enabling approach for building distributed systems which require far less overheads to perform distributed transactions as compared to some classical approaches. I think it's very innovative for a few reasons: 1) It's driven by very large scale present applications rather than being theoretical ( and I guess my personal biases of being a systems guy are probably showing here ). 2) It's out of the box thinking that combines hardware with revisiting fundamental assumptions about global clocks, and about how large scale can come with external consistency guarantees. 3) The core idea lends itself to a number of interesting use cases.
