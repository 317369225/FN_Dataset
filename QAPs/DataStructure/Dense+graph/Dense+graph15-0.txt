Is there any reason not to use OrientDB?
Hi, I'm an OrientDB fan, please keep that in mind.  There are a few things that cause concerns but thankfully some of these are being addressed as we speak. (2.1 and 2.2) I will keep this brief and skip the longer list of why you should, perhaps, use OrientDB :) 1. Dense graphs can be a problem (vertices with millions of edges) if they need to be scanned in their entirety to find a small subset of suitable out-vertices. (ordered edges are supported now but indexing is missing) 2. Storage utilization (encoding/serialization etc.) could be a lot better. Take a look at something like Parquet 2 (not a graph or a database just data storage format) and then you see an example of efficient data storage.  In some cases OrientDB will store property names with every record/document and even simple values like dates take too much physical space. 3. Sharding is (almost) there and at full speed. This is only a concern if you have a really large data set that needs to be sharded right now. (2.1 improves this a lot and is bound to hit production quality soon) 4. Free text search could taken up a notch. Lucene can be used to index documents with only on a strict per-document-with-limitation basis. Building "searchengine like" indexes as you would typically do with Lucene/Solar/ElasticSearch is a non trivial task. If you need a graph or a multi-model database then I can recommend OrientDB, at least for non-huge-datasets (and this may change soon). Updated 15 Jul • View Upvotes
