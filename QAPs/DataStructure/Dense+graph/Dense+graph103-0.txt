Does ice weigh more than water?If I had one gallon of water (aboutÂ  8.35 lb.), then froze it, what would it weigh afterwards?
It's total weight would be pretty much the same, it'd just expand by up to 9% (depending on the starting and ending temperatures), so it would be 9% less dense. I say "pretty much" because there's a tiny effect whereby the increased volume gives increased buoyancy in the air and so decreases the weight as measured. This would be like a 1 part in 10000 effect.
