What is the process for a normal student to start from very basic coding to high level coding so I that I can solve problems from CodeChef TopCoder etc?
I suggest you learn C++, because it provides lot of features to develop your coding skills by practicing day by day. Some helpful websites are The C++ Resources Network C programming.com - Learn C and C++ Programming - Cprogramming.com Â  and also you can develop Algorithm and data structure skills here www.geeksforgeeks.org Then i suggest to solve problems on spoj website by clicking below link... http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/sort=-6
