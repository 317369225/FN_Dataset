What is a book that you would recommend buying a print version of rather than digital and why?
As someone who has a good many books in print and only fairly recently began collecting digital editions (e-books), I cannot give specific examples but as a general rule.  Reference materials, especially technical ones should be print.  The Reason I say this is an observation that at least at this point the editing standards of digital material are ..... spotty. Educational materials, especially if the subject will be tested should be print.  See reason above for reference Materials.
