Do BCS computer rankings update previous game difficulty based on new information?In other words, if Stanford beats a seemingly bad team in Week 2, the computer rankings will give them some middling score for that win. If that bad team ends up being dominant, do the rankings update, giving Stanford more credit for the Week 2 victory?
That should be true although 5 of the 6 algorithms are not published and thus cannot formally be verified (the only one which is, the Colley rankings http://www.colleyrankings.com/me..., does indeed apply all available information in ranking teams). Since there are 119 Div-I teams and most play 12 games, the opportunity for getting a dense graph is not available in any given year, so single outcomes among two teams seemingly unrelated to the top ranked teams can have an effect (e.g. the Toledo/Syracuse example Dan cited).  When you add in the required 8-9 conference games, the amount of information between conferences is very small.  Stanford's win over San Jose St (currently 3-6) doesn't provide much information about how good they are since they beat a weak team (as was their win over 3-6 Duke).  Their remaining non-conference game is Notre Dame (6-3) so having them win out would be an important factor of making a victory over ND more significant. FWIW - the Colley ranking system allows for you to add/remove games and see how the rankings change.  You can evaluate the indirect effects of outcomes by trying to add games there and seeing how the top rankings can change.
