How would you prove that the maximum independent set problem in graphs is in class NP?
A useful informal defintion of the class NP is that it contains all of the problems for which, once you're given a solution, it's easy to verify that the solution actually works. (This can be made into a formal definition, but that's probably not very helpful.) Now as a technical note (still speaking informally), the class NP is defined only for problems whose answer is yes or no. So the question we want to answer is not "How large is the largest independent set?" Instead, we ask, "Is there an independent set of size k?" If there is such a set, and someone hands you a list of the k nodes that belong to it, you can easily (i.e., in polynomial time) check every possible pair of nodes and make sure that none of them are connected. This is sufficient to prove that the proposed solution is valid, that is, that the list of nodes is an independent set. Therefore, since a solution can be easily verified, this problem is in the class NP.
