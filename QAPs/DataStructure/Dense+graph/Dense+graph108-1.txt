Why isn't India a superpower or global leader?India is considered to have a stable economy. China is almost similar to India, but is way ahead in terms of trade and economy. India is lagging behind and has been said to be developing for the last two decades. What actually is the problem in India? Is this the result of the attitude of the people or poor governance?
It is the curse of socialism. Indians are not free in their own country.The state interferes in every area of individual's life. Just try starting a new business and you will come to know how much state creates a problem. It just does not allow them to grow. Indians excel abroad  but they fail in India, so any thing to do with race or  attitude is plain wrong. It is systemic issue. It is the whole ideology of socialism which has paralyzed growth in India. Also our middle classes have shun politics. They will ask very intelligent questions on Quora and also write great answers, but when it comes to involvement in politics they will all develop cold feet. Even a Narayan Murthy with all worldly success is afraid to get involved in politics.This apathy of educated middle class has caused the worst to occupy political power. The worst then unleash the worst of socialist policies, which then leads to more problems. It then becomes a race to bottom. In short the ideology of socialism and the disengagement of middle class in India with Indian politics are the main reasons why India is not able to realize its own potential. The educated middle class of India has shut eyes like Dhritrashtra, while disrobing of India goes on. If India has to become a global leader then it should make bringing more liberty to Indians as primary goal.
