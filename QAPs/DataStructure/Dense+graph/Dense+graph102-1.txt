Commodities Markets: What are some reasons behind the Brent-WTI spread?
Oil transport links were not prepared for decreasing US demand, increasing North American production, and exploding demand in Asia. Pipelines aren't easy to reverse, so when relatively land-locked oil like WTI needs to change direction, it takes years. Brent is tied into the world seagoing tanker network, which more flexibly routes supplies to arbitrage away cost imbalances. Basically, Brent has become the true global price of oil, whereas WTI is depressed by unexpected market forces in the US.
