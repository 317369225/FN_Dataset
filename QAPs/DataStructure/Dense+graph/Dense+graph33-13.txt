If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
Good question. But don't get hung up on the idea of normal pipes or containers to do this in: work like this is done in special presses, of varying designs. You can produce a very large range of pressures and temperatures in commercial ultra high pressure apparatus: up to about 6 GPa it can be done without any problem with volumes of several hundred ml. This is done on commercial processes to convert graphite to diamond. And above that you can use something called a Bridgeman Anvil cell, that can go up to 40 GPa (or more), but with smaller volumes (a few ml). It's used of research purposes. You use diamond anvils for the really high pressures. So with that capability, you can form various states of ice: Ice IV etc. Ice VII has been studied up to 36 GPa. If you put some water into one of these high pressure cells, as you cooled it, it would expand, thus creating the pressure. And remain liquid until it created a high enough pressure to become ice, at one of the higher ice forms. I don't have density data, so am not not sure which one. But yes, it will freeze before it goes past the limits of the cell.
