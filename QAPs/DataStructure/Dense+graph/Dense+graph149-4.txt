Is there any reason not to use OrientDB?
Hello, I am on the Orient Technologies team, so please consider this natural bias up front. First, thanks for considering OrientDB. You have recognized our most prominent design goal - to create an operational grade database that covers the largest use case possible without compromising speed. As you've seen on our website, we are a document-graph database, meaning you can work with OrientDB very similar to MongoDB as a document database or as a native graph database. Your use case will dictate which feature set you will rely on more heavily. OrientDB will handle either use case natively. Recent benchmarks with our version 2.0RC1 release are unreal! We are thrilled with the performance gains we've made since 1.7. In particular in the areas of distributed graph and mass insertion. On the graph front, I would encourage you to think twice before choose a generic platform for graph data. Many technologies are now offering a "graph layer" to give you the usability of the graph, but OrientDB and Neo4J are you best options as they are both natively designed for graph vs having a translation layer stuck on top. We released a new introductory training course - maybe that would be your best first step.
