Why is mathematics so addictive?
Personally, I find that mathematics is so addictive because it has an special esthetic, a beauty all its own. People are attracted to art, architecture music and literature for their beauty: mathematics is like that. There is just something wonderful about the beauty of a well written proof. Some examples: Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem The Godel Incompleteness Theorem And since I am involved in computer science: Hopcroft and Targan's planarity testing algorithm and especially the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem Which Immerman proves in two paragraphs of plain English with no equations! By the way, physics is like that too. Like "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" by one A. Einstein
