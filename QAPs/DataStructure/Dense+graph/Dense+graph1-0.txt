What are some practical examples of sparse and dense graphs?
Several examples of sparse graphs are: Transportation and road networks where the intersections are vertices and roads are edges. For such networks, the number of roads isÂ  not significantly larger than the number of intersections (in other words E~=c * V, where c is in the range of 2-3). While in many cases real-world graphs are sparse, it is possible to create weighted graphs that are highly dense with the edge weight representing some sort of relationship - such as a large edge weight if two people visited the same store at the same time or had coffee at the same coffee-shop. Another example might be to take a "sub-graph" of a sparse graph that represents a community of people that are highly connected.
