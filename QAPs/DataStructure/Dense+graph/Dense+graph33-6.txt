If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
Originally Answered: What would happen in you filled an unbreakable and unexpandable box to the brim with water and then froze it, would it expand still?If you filled a box with water and froze it, the water would expand exerting pressure on the walls of the box which would also expand. The amount of expansion would depend on the the material of which the box was made. Because this particular box couldn't rupture, it would simply be in an expanded state. -------------------------- Dad blast it! The question got changed. ------------- Now the question says that the box is "unexpandable" (can't be deformed). I don't know the ultimate answer. Most materials deform. The way I would approach this is to determine the pressure the ice would exert and apply this pressure to the walls of the box (ignoring the mechanical properties of the walls). Then someone with a phase diagram for the ice can tell us what the state of the ice would be. No more changes please. I have a day job.
