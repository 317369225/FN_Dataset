Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does the Quora community have a "liberal bias"?Yes. Quora does have a liberal bias. However, I disagree vehemtly with User and Charles Lyell that the entire web has a liberal bias. I think they both have made this observation because they personally visit more liberal websites, most likely because they both seem to have liberal political views. People are naturally attracted towards like minded people, and thus the communities that these two, or any liberal for that matter, are likely to join on the web, will tend to lean liberal. Unless you can give me statistical proof otherwise, I think this is a observation bias, and not a true fact.
