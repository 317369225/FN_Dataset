Why is mathematics so addictive?
I think what keeps people from understanding or enjoying it is what seems like a barrier to entry. My barrier to entry was a constant habit of trying to draw an analogy to some image or experience I'd already had. Once I got over that need, the barrier eased up a bit, and I felt like I belonged. Once past my personal barrier, the addiction set in. I'm always on the lookout for ways to describe my "mundane" and work related scenarios mathematically. I find it makes doing those tasks much more fun and actually much more productive.
