Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
I believe just last year it was found that the maximum network flow problem can be solved in O(VE)  time. This bound was first achieved for dense graphs, i.e., E∈Ω(V 2 )  , by the relabel-to-front algorithm, a particular version of the push-preflow method, which runs in O(V 3 )  time. This algorithm was published by Goldberg and Tarjan in 1986, and you can find it in CLRS. In 1994, King, Rao, and Tarjan gave an algorithm that runs in O(VElog(V)/log(EVlogV ))  time. This reduces to O(VE)  for all graphs that are not too sparse, i.e., E∈Ω(V 1+ϵ )  . (Graphs with constant or logarithmic average degree are still a bit too sparse.) Finally, in 2012, Orlin put the final piece in place, finding an algorithm that runs in O(VE+E 31/16 log 2 V)  . For E∈O(V 16/15−ϵ )  , that is, graphs that are sparse enough, this reduces to O(VE)  . By combining the algorithm of King, Rao, and Tarjan, and Orlin's algorithm, we see that maximum network flow can be solved in O(VE)  time. I think that's pretty awesome.
