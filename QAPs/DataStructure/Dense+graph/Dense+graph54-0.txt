How would we be affected by gravity if we were sitting in a room in the centre of the earth?
Not only would you be weightless (if somewhat dense) at Earth centre, on the assumption that the Earth is radially symmetrical, but you could hollow out the planet to any degree you like, as long as the remaining shell is radially symmetrical, and if we neglect your own mass, which is trivial, you would be effectively weightless anywhere within that hollow. And if you carried out the hollowing to its conclusion, then you still would be weightless... Added later: I see that a lot of folks are saying that the zero gravitation at the centre (and in any concentric spherical hollow) depends on constant density of the Earth. It does NOT. All it depends on is radial symmetry (that is what the Newton's shells thing is all about). Someone also said that you get heavier as you go down. That is only true to the extent that we see in the graph that Shashanka Dutta posted. Your weight rises to a maximum as you approach the dense core, and thereafter it falls to zero as you approach the centre (or of course, any empty hollow around the centre, which in our case we have not got).
