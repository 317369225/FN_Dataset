Where do most web startups fail?
Failure to build a truly compelling user experience is a big culprit. Web success begins and ends with the user experience. You need to be maniacally focused on it. Do usability sessions all the time. Measure everything. Strip things out. A/B test all the time. One other thing: I have signed up for countless web services but never hear from most of the companies. If a user has shown the slightest interest, engage them. Send them an update once/ month with all your cool new features. Showcase other users succeeding with the service. Bring people back to the table. It blows me away how few companies do this.
