Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
Really good approximation algorithms for many different connectivity related problems on planar graphs, which are very similar to common road/infrastructure networks. See http://cs.brown.edu/~klein/publi..., which gives arbitrarily good polynomial time approximation algorithms for the Steiner tree problem on planar graphs. Using a simpler technique, one can obtain approximation algorithms for the traveling salesman problem on planar graphs. Some of the constants can be difficult to deal with in this algorithm. Here is a good attempt at implementing the Steiner Tree algorithm. Also, there are similarly great approximation algorithms for Euclidean connectivity problems, some of which can be seen here. For more information on these algorithms, there is a wonderful course at http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.8...
