Why doesn't the water at the bottom of the ocean freeze?The deeper in the sea, the lower the temperature of the water. So why isn't the temperature of the water at the bottom of the ocean extremely low and, if so, why doesn't it freeze?
The most important to know facts for this question are: 1> Water expands on cooling between zero and 4 degree (Celsius) i.e. ice is lighter than water at 4 degree. (This can be explained with the bonding between the atoms in water) 2> Ice is a poor conductor of heat. When it starts getting cold water gets denser and the colder water starts sinking to the bottom being replaced by the warmer one. This continues till a huge portion of the water body is at 4 degree. Now the top portion gets colder but does not sink and continues to get colder till water freezes. Ice being a poor conductor protects the water below the surface from getting colder. The salt content has hardly any significant role to play in this process. The only thing salt is going to do is to decrease the freezing point so that the top layer freezes at a lower temperature than 0. "Fresh water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), but the freezing point of sea water varies. For every 5 ppt increase in salinity, the freezing point decreases by 0.28 degrees Celsius (0.5 degrees Fahrenheit); thus, in polar regions with an ocean salinity of 35 ppt, the water begins to freeze at -1.8 degrees Celsius (28.8 degrees Fahrenheit)." (Source: National Snow and Ice Data Center) The temperature in the Arctic Region is well below zero and if salinity played a significant role than water at the bottom of the ocean would have frozen.
