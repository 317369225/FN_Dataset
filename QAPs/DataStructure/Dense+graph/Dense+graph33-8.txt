If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?

In this situation any pressure exerted would be from the attempted crystallization of the water itself, there was no room for expansion to take place.  Traditional ice would not form.
