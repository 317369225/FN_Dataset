Why doesn't the water at the bottom of the ocean freeze?The deeper in the sea, the lower the temperature of the water. So why isn't the temperature of the water at the bottom of the ocean extremely low and, if so, why doesn't it freeze?
Firstly, let me give you a little basic knowledge about a property of liquids, then i'll proceed to the answer. As the temperature of a liquid/solid increases, its volume increases. Most liquids behave this way. But, water has a unique quality, above (almost) 4°C water behaves normally i.e its volume increases as the temperature increases. However, between 0°C and almost 4°C its volume decreases with rise in temperature( or increases with temperature drop, thus making it less dense). Now to the question, Say the water at the surface is at 12°C and its cooling down. Now, as the temperature decreases, its volume decreases and density increases. As the surface water reaches about 4°C, it becomes more dense and "sinks" to the bottom allowing the less dense water to surface up. As temperature falls below 4°C, surface water becomes lighter( less dense) compared to the water below and floats until it freezes. Once frozen, the ice insulates the water at the bottom from cooling so its temperature is maintained between 0 and almost 4°C, keeping it from freezing. Thanks to this quality of water, aquatic animals do not freeze to death!
