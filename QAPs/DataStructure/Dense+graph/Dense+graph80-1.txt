What is the best algorithm to match resumes with jobs?
Disclosure: I cofounded Predikt (www.predikt.co), an artificial intelligence technology for hiring   Rather late to the party, but wanted to share some information.   There are multiple technologies and algorithms which simply match keywords in the resume against job descriptions and assign a value, which isn't a very good approach. Resumes containing a lot of stuffed keywords will usually rise to the top, which does not indicate the quality of a resume. It is useful to eliminate the obviously unqualified candidates who do not even have basic skillsets required for the job, however when it comes to ranking candidates who possess those skills or experience, it is really tricky, especially when you want to apply this algorithm to your entire database of say 50,000+ resumes.   Another important aspect to talk about is the discrepancy between the job description which employers post and the actual experience /skillsets of a candidate which gets shortlisted/interviewed/hired. Most of the times you will realize that the JDs overly state the requirements to create a good pipeline of resumes. Also, due to overwhelming number of jobs out there and no proper tool for job seekers to find the relevant opportunities, they end up applying to random jobs without putting in much efforts reading the description or customizing their resumes. Effectively, there are a significant chunk of resumes in a recruiter's database which are no where near the requirements, which just adds up more unnecessary work on the recruiter's end.   At Predikt, we have researched for over a year, what makes a good resume / candidate. The signals we found useful while building our artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms were career progression, experience, projects, publications, skillsets, company/college reputation, social contributions and many more.
