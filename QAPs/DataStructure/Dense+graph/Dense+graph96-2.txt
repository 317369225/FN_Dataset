How do I start a SolarCity-like company in a developing country?A group of us is in the early planning stages and would appreciate any input, basic or strategic. Contact us at brightpowercorp@gmail.com and we'd be happy to talk more!
A group of us based in Bangalore/San Jose started EnerMark , India, with the same thesis in mind. Although Andrew's answer above has some very good points but there are some things that work against a company like Solarcity. And will actually work in favor of a company starting today and that too in a developing country : 1. SolarCity started in 2006: The cost of solar panels in terms of $/KWH produced, has dropped by almost by a factor of 3. So a company starting today will not be saddled by that much initial Capex for a given amount of KWH produced. 2. In US soft costs are of late becoming a major portion of installation costs: NREL Reports Soft Costs Now Largest Piece of Solar Installation Total Cost These based on our models will be lower in a developing country, like India. This is not to say that there are no disadvantages specific to developing countries that need to be overcome in order to start a SolarCity like company. But we at EnerMark believe that these risks/disadvantages can be managed. It is just that you cannot transplant the SolarCity business model as it is to a developing country. You  have to comprehensively change the model to work in developing country conditions.
