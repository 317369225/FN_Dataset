Commodities Markets: What are some reasons behind the Brent-WTI spread?
In theory, the WTI should be more expensive than the Brent. The lighter and sweeter the crude, the more valuable. Historically, WTI crude has traded at premium to Brent and served as the global benchmark. Though both are “sweet” crudes (sulfur content < 0.5%), WTI’s sulfur content of 0.24% is slightly lower than Brent’s 0.37%. A high sulfur content lowers the value of crude, as sulfur is a pollutant which reduces total energy output and can corrode metal in pipelines and tankers. Additionally, WTI has an API gravity (a measure of oil’s density) of 39.6 degrees compared to 38.3 degrees for Brent. A higher API means the oil is less dense, and thus, more valuable. It is summed here below, where you can see the WTI and Brent at the bottom right of the EIA graph: So historically, WTI crude has traded at premium to Brent and served as the global benchmark. In reality, the Brent is still more expensive than the WTI. See the graph below, put together by the EIA: In reality though, the infrastructure issues mentioned by Ryan Carlyle in answer to "What are some reasons behind the Brent-WTI spread?" are one of the reason why the Brent is priced higher than the WTI, or why the WTI price has been depressed. But for how long? But infrastructure constraints in the US are only temporary. European slump should also be a depreciating force on the Brent price.
