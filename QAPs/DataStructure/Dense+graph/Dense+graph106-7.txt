Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013â€“present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
Based on numbers only, white Americans would on average be happier - 59% voted for Romney. So would right-wingers and by extension the right-wing press: 82% of conservatives voted for Romney. CNN 2012 Exit Poll Ron Paul is a much larger wildcard. If you look at exit polls from the Republican primaries, his supporters tend to be more "moderate' or "somewhat liberal" than the average Republican. "better off" is impossible to tell. That said good job race baiting.
