What is the difference in Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm?
Both Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm are greedy algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree. For Prim's algorithm, the graph has to be connected, but that is not true in the case of Kruskal's algorithm. In Prim's algorithm, the next edge in the MST shall be the cheapest edge in the current vertex. In Kruskal's algorithm, we shall choose the cheapest edge, but it may not be in the current vertex. Prim's algorithm is found to run faster in dense graphs with more number of edges than vertices, whereas Kruskal's algorithm is found to run faster in sparse graphs.
