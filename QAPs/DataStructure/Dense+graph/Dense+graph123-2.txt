Linear Algebra:Â How do I interpret singular value decomposition (SVD) for visualization?
The classic approach is to take the top two dimensions of either U or V (depending on whether you want to visualize the documents or the terms), and use those as coordinates for a scatter plot. This is because successive dimensions in an SVD decomposition capture the linear dimension that explains the most variation in the data while still being orthogonal to all previous dimensions, and the top 2 will usually capture a substantial amount of all variation. If you do this, you'll find that documents are generally closer to similar documents and terms are generally closer to similar terms, but you'll certainly find outliers and other messy things.
