Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013–present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
I don't get why people are considering this question offensive.  There's nothing that derails an honest dialogue more quickly than someone throwing down the "I'm offended" card. The fact is only about 37% of whites voted for Obama, as opposed to 90% of blacks, 70% of hispanics, and 80% of "non-whites" (all others).  Source: http://www.gallup.com/poll/15455... It appears that race was in fact a significant predictor of whether or not people voted for our current President.  There's a reason for this, and I'm pretty sure that reason has common cause with the motivation for this question.   So my answer is yes, excluding the 37% who voted for Obama, whites would be happier if their guy got in (and of course the right wing press would be happier).  As far as how the country would be better off - I don't think it would, I voted for Obama.
