If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
Do you remember a Pepsi Cola brand soft drink called Josta?  I think it was just test marketed in a few areas.  It didn't last long, even though it was the single best tasting soft drink OF ALL TIME!! Anyway, I used to stick a bottle of THAT in the freezer.  If conditions were right, it wouldn't freeze, even if you left it in there all night.  Then the next morning when you woke up to breakfast (I know, soft drink for breakfast.  Don't judge me.  You go through 5 years of Architecture without getting addicted to caffeine.) you open up the bottle of LIQUID Josta.  It would stay liquid until the instant your tongue touched it.  Then the drink would wrap its lovely deliciousness around your tongue as it froze in your mouth.  Amazing sensation. I think it works with Coke too, but it's not nearly as rewarding. Anyway, in answer to your question.  The liquid, in your case water, remains liquid as long as it doesn't have room to solidify.  You might even be able to open the bottle without it freezing.  It could be 30 below zero and it would still be liquid!, Until you agitate it or provide a seed for it to grow.  Then it will freeze. It's kind of like making rock candy.  Ever do that?
