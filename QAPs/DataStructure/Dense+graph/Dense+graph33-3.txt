If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
Originally Answered: What would happen in you filled an unbreakable and unexpandable box to the brim with water and then froze it, would it expand still?Initially the pressure would just go up with the water remaining liquid. This phase diagram shows that water remains liquid at lower temperatures at higher pressures: However, you can see that, no matter the pressure, there is no liquid (green area) below 251K (-22C), so eventually it would freeze if you cool it enough. There are many different kinds of ice. The one that forms when you cool water at normal pressure is Ice Ih. This ice takes up more space than water, which is why the freezing point drops when the pressure is increased. The pressure pushes equilibrium towards the denser phase, that is water. But at high pressures there are other kinds of ice. These ices are denser and therefore needs the pressure to be stable. Some are even denser than water, which is why the blue area surges back towards higher temperatures at extreme pressures. So you can see, if the water tried to make Ice I, then there would be no space for it and pressure would go up. If it tried to make Ice X, then it wouldn't take up the whole box, and the pressure would drop. In the end, depending on temperature your box is going to contain a lot of Ice III, II or IX, and have a pressure of a few hundred Mega Pascals.
