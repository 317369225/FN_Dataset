What can I read to help me better think in terms of networks?I'm looking to sharpen my thinking in terms of what it means to live in a connected world. Are there any essays or books that you have read that have helped you better approach the world in this framework?
Chris Dixon gave a good talk on "graph" theory as a Google Tech Talk. Here's a link to video + slides: http://talkminer.com/viewtalk.js... Chris also posted a cleaner version of his slides: http://cdixon.posterous.com/grap... Graph theory in math can get out of hand pretty quickly, but thinking about it as a set of basic relationships allows you to have a pretty handy framework for thinking about how a network functions. Basic graph theory is: Node A < -edge- > Node B The thing that connects them is an edge. To paraphrase Chris, in social networks, nodes are people and the edges "friendship." In a search rank graph, pages are nodes, links are edges. There are a lot of people who are happy to just say: everything is a network now. But that's usually just a proxy for talking about how something is experiencing some kind of geometric/exponential growth. It's imprecise and not that helpful as a framework for thinking about how things work. Most people have a pretty good concept of how graphs effect different competitive scenarios (some more than others). For example, USV is really only interested in dense graphs of users where the nodes overlap functions. But the thing that most people haven't actually thought through is how to think of their product in terms of nodes and edges--and build that into the way they think about their community and how they test the strength of those relationships. You can think of almost everything in terms of nodes and edges, but not all nodes have the same strength of polarity.
