What's the best parallelized sparse SVD code publicly available?
You need only follow the trail of the estimable Jake Mannix. Decomposer (http://code.google.com/p/decompo...) should fit the bill for what you're looking for: sparse svd, matrix too large for memory, parallelizable. But don't use it!Â  Instead, use Apache Mahout (http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/), a project to which Mannix ported decomposer's parallel Lanczos SVD solver. As for Python access, Mahout runs on Hadoop, so you could arguably coordinate via dumbo (http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/...) but I haven't tried this myself.
