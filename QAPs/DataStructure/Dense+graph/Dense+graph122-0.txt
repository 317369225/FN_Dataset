Why does gravity decrease beyond 4500 meters below sea level?
Because there is less mass under you pulling down. Within a spherical shell, the gravity of every part of the shell cancels out, and the net gravitational force is zero. If you consider a sphere of perfectly uniform density, it's fairly obvious that gravity must be strongest right at the surface- if you descend into the interior, the mass of outer shells of the sphere stops contributing anything, and it's exactly like being on the surface of a smaller sphere of the same density, which therefore has lower gravity. Outside of a spherical mass, however, gravity also drops with distance. For a mass of non-uniform density, therefore, it is possible that the increase is gravitational force from moving closer to the dense center can overwhelm the reduction from passing through lower density out shells. The Earth is such a non-uniform mass: the core is very dense, the mantle less so, and the crust less so still. So, for the first little bit as you descend into the Earth, getting closer to the dense mantle and core makes the gravitational force increase. Eventually, though, you pass a point where you've moved through enough material with high enough density that eliminating shells of matter from consideration overwhelms the effect of getting closer to the center. After that point, the force of gravity begins to decrease, until it drops to zero exactly at the center.
