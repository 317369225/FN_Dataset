Does ACM-ICPC or IOI success correlate with industry success?You might suspect that programming competition winners would be particularly brilliant or at least particularly good programmers, but you might also suspect they would be toy-problem-oriented and do better in academia. Adam D'Angelo and (potentially) some of Team Ksplice are positive examples, but that's not a ton.
Most notably, Tony Hsieh, Zappos CEO and 1993 ACM-ICPC World Champion, has accomplished such a high level of industry success that his ICPC achievement is practically never mentioned in his biography, even on Wikipedia.
