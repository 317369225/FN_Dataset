What are the applications of sparse graphs?
This is a vague question. Victor Pontis covers the interpretation "what is nice about sparse graphs from an applied viewpoint?", I'll cover the "where do sparse graphs show up in real-life applications?" angle:   Gene networks are sparse graphs   Quoting [1]: Empirical observations indicate that most genes are regulated by a small number of other genes, usually fewer than ten. Hence, a genetic network can be viewed as a sparse graph, i.e., a graph in which a node is connected to a handful of other nodes. If directed (acyclic) graphs or undirected graphs are imbued with probabilities, the result is probabilistic directed graphical models and probabilistic undirected graphical models respectively.     [1] A linear programming approach for estimating the structure of a sparse linear genetic network from transcript profiling data
