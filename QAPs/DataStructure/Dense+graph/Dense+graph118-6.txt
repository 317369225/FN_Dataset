Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Why is Quora so liberal?I think this may have been truer in the past than it is now. Previously it seemed there were only a handful of Quorans willing to defend conservatism, but now we have quite a few (rather prolific) conservatives on Quora. Ask any question that operates under the assumption that conservatism is wrong/crazy and you'll get a chance to meet them. Some examples: Why are K-12 public school vouchers such a bad idea? Why are Americans against good public health care given to all American citizens? Why do Republicans listen to Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, et. al., even though they make the party look crazy?
