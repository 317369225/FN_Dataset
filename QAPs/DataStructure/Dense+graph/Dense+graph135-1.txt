What are the Dover Publications on mathematics that are absolutely fantastic readings for an undergrad?I’m reading “Infinitesimal Calculus”, by Henle and Kleinberg, a fantastic Dover Publication. I’m loving it, hence this question for people better read than me. I'm looking for books like the one I mentioned: the topic is modern, all the relevant technical details are there, the writing is excellent, and it’s easy to follow even for an undergrad. Thanks!
A more advanced topic, but if you're at all interested in physics, engineering or even financial mathematics, I recommend "A First Course in Partial Differential Equations with Complex Variable and Transform Methods" by Weinberger. It's a really rigorous, really excellent introduction to all of the necessary mathematics for solving PDEs. While at times you may need to re-read sections to understand them completely, getting through it will leave you prepared for pretty much everything to come in that subfield.
