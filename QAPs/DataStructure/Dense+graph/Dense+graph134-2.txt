I'm a newbie at algorithms, but I'm capable of writing codes in C++ & Java. Do I have a chance to win the ACM ICPC 2016 title? Do I have the time to study and practice the knowledge needed?Do anyone here (or anyway you know) have the courage to (or even can)  put a feasible plan for achieving target in next 16 months?
Unless you are really talented in algorithmic design and coding + having two other really good teammates that you three can work well with each other, the chances are fairly low practically. There are many competitive coders from Russian and China that have been practiced in competitive programming since their grade schools. Many have won IOI medals before. And Many continue their competitive programming journey in college and participate in ICPC. Knowing this shouldn't stop you if you really want to learn a lot from the experience. I would say don't think too much about winning the gold medal, try your best at solving each problem and have fun. Just thinking that you must win the gold medal won't help you as  much and would probably make you feel really stressful and in the end not enjoy the process as much.
