I'm a newbie at algorithms, but I'm capable of writing codes in C++ & Java. Do I have a chance to win the ACM ICPC 2016 title? Do I have the time to study and practice the knowledge needed?Do anyone here (or anyway you know) have the courage to (or even can)Â  put a feasible plan for achieving target in next 16 months?
No, assuming you're in a team with 2 people in the same circumstances. Most people in the finals have been doing this for many years. I've seen some exceptionally smart people with strong mathematical background being among the best within a couple years of work. However, winning is not a realistic objective. I'd aim for qualifying to the final. Even qualifying for the final will be difficult, depending on your ICPC regional, but it's possible if you study and practice hard.
