What is a graph database? Why would someone choose a graph database over a relational database?I would also like to know the particular areas of application where one can choose a graph database over a relational database.
Graph databases are the modern take on Navigational database data models, which are actually among the oldest data models used by something that could be called database engines.  The big difference between navigational or network data models and relational models is whether links between db records are physical or direct links as in graph db's, or computed links, also known as joins in relational databases. The best application for navigational data models is where you do lots of chasing through records, particularly records of different types, and you have extreme performance requirements as well as a fairly static schema.  While both Document-oriented database and graph db's are described as "NoSQL" databases, they're used in almost opposite use-cases.  Graph db's have even stickier schemas than relational db's, as they're so dependent on hard links.
