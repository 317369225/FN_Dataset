How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
I spent my childhood, teenage and early adult years just trying to become a good software engineer, and that prepared me for the Google interview. Unfortunately, I didn't get the job because I didn't pay enough attention to my communication skills as I was growing up, and therefore couldn't communicate effectively with the interviewer.
