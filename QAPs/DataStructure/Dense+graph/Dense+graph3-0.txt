What is the time complexity of this implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm?[C++] #include<stdio.h>  #include<stdlib.h>  #include<limits.h>  #include<algorithm>   - Pastebin.com
Given a graph with n vertices and m edges, the code will run in worst-case time Θ(n 2 +nm)  , which is Θ(n 3 )  for dense graphs. The author has no idea what they are doing. They are "using" a heap, but not really --  instead of inserting into the heap, each "update" takes linear time, and additionally it breaks the heap so the heap has to be rebuilt from scratch after each vertex is processed. Even a simple implementation with just a distance matrix and an array to store the best distance so far is better than this code.
