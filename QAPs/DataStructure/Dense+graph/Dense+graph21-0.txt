What is a book that you would recommend buying a print version of rather than digital and why?
So far I'd pick print over digital for science and math textbooks.  Books with dense graphs and color graphs are much better on paper than on a Kindle, although they'll display somewhat better on a laptop or full size monitor.  As Margaret Plotkin said, the biggest difference is the ease of flipping back and forth.  Digital isn't there yet.  But in principle digital could become better.
