Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does the Quora community have a "liberal bias"?I don't think so, but then I can understand why you would think it does if your worldview is fairly limited. Take gun control for example. In America it tends to be viewed as a liberal/conservative issue. Only liberals are in favour of stricter gun control so anyone advocating for further gun laws is a liberal. In the rest of the world this simply isn't the case. Here in Australia, the notoriously tough gun control legislation of 1996 was proposed by the most conservative Prime Minister the nation had elected since WW2. He was notoriously right-wing at the time and still is. The gun legislation was his idea (although it received support from both sides of the political spectrum). In Australia gun control isn't really a liberal/conservative issue. Consequently I've seen Aussies on Quora argue in favour of strict gun control who I know for a fact don't identify themselves as liberals. They identify with the conservative side of the political spectrum but US Quorans have written them off as "liberals" because of their own definition of an issue.
