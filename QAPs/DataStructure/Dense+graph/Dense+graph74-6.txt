Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
Upvotes are not a finality, but to me they are an indication that my contribution is appreciated. If I write a long and detailed answers and it gets a lot of upvotes, it means many people read it and found it interesting enough to press a button. That will be a motivation for me to write other similar answers. If nobody upvoted my answers, it would mean that nobody reads my content or finds it interesting and I would probably write less because I find it a waste of time to publish content nobody cares for. That's all.
