How would you prove that the maximum independent set problem in graphs is in class NP?
Timothy Johnson's answer is a good way to show "from scratch" that a problem is in NP.  The other alternative is to show a reduction to a problem already known to be in NP.  (This is particularly useful for NP-complete problems.) A set in G is independent if and only if it is a clique in the complement of G.  Therefore, given a maximum-independent-set problem, convert the graph to its complement, a step which takes only polynomial time and does not increase the problem size. Now, we know that the problem of finding a clique of size at least N is in NP, so our transformed problem must be in NP as well. (There are some technicalities here--- what if our graph is sparse, so that the complement is dense?  Could that take more than polynomial time to convert?  But these can be dealt with in a more formal proof.)
