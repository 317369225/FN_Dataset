What are the best rules for reading effectively?
1. Don't read from cover to cover 2. Use table of contents for active pre-reading 3. Take notes as you go along 4. Learn to skim-read and scan-read; - look at the pictures, graphs, diagrams first - use visuals to guide you (headings/subs, bolded/italicised text, etc.) - look for keywords and key concepts (**Disclaimer: This is a risky technique, but I sometimes use it; don;t do it at home :))***. My secret technique for dense texts with little white space, no visuals and lots of fluff: I read the first sentence of each para; usually this is what's the para is about) 5. Put stuff you've read into practical use asap 6. Learn to use Index My approach to quickly reading and remembering here: Fast and forever - an unauthorised guide to quickly learning and remembering anything anywhere How to read a textbook I hope it helps
