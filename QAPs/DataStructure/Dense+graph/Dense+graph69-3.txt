What are some good computer science final year project ideas?
Firstly, read this Sameer Thigale's answer to What are the hot topics for projects a final year student can do?. No project/domain is best. Just go with the field that interests you (and your guide) and have knowledge of. Finally, I can suggest domains and not projects: 1. Networking And Information System Security 2. Wireless & Mobile Based Communication and Applications 3. Intelligent System, AI / Expert System / Pattern Recognition / Multimedia 4. Communication System / VLSI / Embedded Technologies 5. System Applications / Storage And Database 6. Digital Signal Processing / Speech Processing / Image Processing
