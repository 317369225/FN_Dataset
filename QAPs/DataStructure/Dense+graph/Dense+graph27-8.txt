Where do most web startups fail?
Most web startups -- hell, most startups, period -- fail at finding, engaging with and capturing revenue from the customer. It's called marketing, people, and it's the solution to almost every pitfall highlighted in other answers. Effective market outreach in advance of product development will ensure you are building something that has a compelling value proposition and solves a real pain for a large enough group of people to make the enterprise worthwhile. Effective promotion of your vision, even if it's within a tiny local community, will attract the team members you need. Scale the scope of that as your requirement to bring on more and more talent also scales. I don't know what the pursuit of funding is -- if you need funding, which many web startups don't -- if it ain't simply highly targeted marketing. Identify the right customer, craft the right pitch, deliver it persuasively. And then get out there and market the hell out of it. That doesn't have to mean expensive trade shows and costly advertising. It does mean figuring out who your customers are and engaging with them across as many available channels as you can afford.
