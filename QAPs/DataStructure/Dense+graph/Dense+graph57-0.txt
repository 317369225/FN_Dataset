Did a phase transition cause the large scale structure of the universe?
Not really.  The models of structure formation in cosmology model these voids as small differences from the average density and as time passes the dense areas get denser and the non-dense area gets less dense.  There is no sudden phase transition in the models.  It's not that people are against the idea, its just that when you run the simulations you don't get phase transitions. Personally, I'm think that there might be some physics that is similar to phase transitions in galaxy formation (i.e. you have a bunch of gas, when it hits a threshold then boom, lots of stars form), but that's very speculative right now. One other thing is that its not a good idea to try to figure out physical processes from popular press pictures.  What happens is that pictures in the popular press are designed to look good, and often what happens is that they put it through a filter that creates a lot more contrast than actually exists.  So the "phase transition" you see is really a photoshop filter.  In order to do real science, you have to not just use your eyeball, but go into the raw data and do statistical analysis.  What you use to figure out what's going on isn't a raw picture, but rather a graph that shows the statistical properties of the universe. You can see this with the Build your own universe app Build a Universe The fun part is that if you move the dials around, the statistics of the universe change radically, but the "eyeball picture" seems to stay the same.
