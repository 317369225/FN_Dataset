Robotics:Â Who are the foremost roboticists in the world and what are some of the projects that they are working on right now?
Any current list has to include Dennis Hong at Virginia Tech, who just brought the Robocup championship to the US for the first time. And Gerd Hirzinger, director of the DLR Institute of Mechatronics and Robotics. The Institute is one of the biggest robotics research groups in the world. It has flown multiple robotics experiments on the Space Shuttle and Space Station. Hirzinger's group is probably the foremost group in the world at designing robotic mechanisms. Currently their big project is JUSTIN, a humanoid robot intended for use in space, among other applications. And Rob Ambrose. Rob is the driving force behind Robonaut. He directed the Robonaut team for many years. He's now been kicked upstairs. He's one of NASA's best idea guys. And Terry Fong. Terry is the director of the Intelligent Robotics Groups at NASA/Ames. His group developed many of the technologies for the robotic Martian vehicles NASA has launched and will launch. Finally, three of the foremost roboticists in the world are guys who you've almost certainly never heard of - but their work constitute the best known and most influential robots in history. The first is John Lymer, chief engineer of the MacDonald Dettwiler Brampton facility. His folks built the Space Station robot arms: The second and third are Brett Lindenfeld and Thomas Debus of the MacDonald-Dettwiler Pasadena office (formerly Alliance Spacesystems). Brett is the program lead for the Mars Rover, Mars Phoenix, and Mars Science Lab arms. Thomas is the roboticist (kinematics, dynamics, and controls) specialist for those arms.
