What can I read to help me better think in terms of networks?I'm looking to sharpen my thinking in terms of what it means to live in a connected world. Are there any essays or books that you have read that have helped you better approach the world in this framework?
Check out this networks book, "Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World" It's used in a CS/Information Science class at Cornell on Networks and though it might be more technical in nature than what you're looking for, there are parts that are a pretty good read and provide a good framework for thinking about connected networks. Here's a link to the online version of the book (with a downloadable PDF available):Â  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/k...
