Why is mathematics so addictive?
I feel that mathematical education, even in places where we'd normally assume it's being pushed to its limits, can be really reductive and unimaginative. My entire pre-college mathematical education was linear algebra and was entirely focused on computation. I had absolutely zero idea what mathematics even was outside of that until I stumbled upon the Principia Mathematica, and most of my education took place in accelerated programs like the IB. I feel as if mathematics is too often taught by people who aren't mathematicians and, for the sake of testing, taught within very strict guidelines of competency without teaching children why mathematical objects and functions exist or what the history behind this mathematics was. To those addicted to it, it is one of the most deeply imaginative and philosophical fields out there. And the feeling you get upon conquering a previously difficult idea or truly grokking a proof is more satisfying than anything else out there. Plus, even elementary work communes with mathematicians from hundreds or even thousands of years ago. What other field can be said to be so additive? The natural science, literature, and philosophy seem to remake themselves every few years by comparison. What among them can they have relevant devices from several millennia ago?
