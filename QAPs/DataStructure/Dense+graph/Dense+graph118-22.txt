Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Why is Quora so liberal?It isn't, by global or historical standards.  It is only so according to a very recent and very US-centric perception of where the "center" is or should be.  As Guy Taylor kind of says, when you're standing way over on the right everything else is on your left.  Quora is "so liberal" because so much of the culture around it is so not-liberal.
