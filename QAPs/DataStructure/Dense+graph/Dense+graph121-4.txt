When will the financial burden of owning a private automobile be high enough to dissuade most people from buying them?In some places, like New York and more recently San Francisco, one could argue this is already happening. The cost of parking, valet, and gas has made owning a car an unnecessary luxury for many people. In places like Singapore, the license to buy a car (not counting the cost of the car) is something like $68k. In what year will this happen for the rest of us? What has to happen first?
Almost certainly never.  Jon Mixon gives some good answers as to why, but I've always liked this graph of Brad Templeton which points out that the core environmental cost of transportation, energy per passenger-mile, is about equal for cars and public transit.  What really matters, to cut down on those costs, is "details" like whether the car you drive is an electric or not, whether you share a ride to work, and whether the transit system you put in is a bunch of buses with an average of 10 people on each, or sometihing densely packed like the NYC subway system. It also matters quite a bit how many miles of transportation you use, so living near work, and not taking many airplane rides across the continent, are also great ways to save both energy and money.
