What is the best machine learning algorithm for community detection?By communities I mean circles within a social network.
This problem is solvable without machine learning. It is ultimately a graph problem called partitioning. As a solution you could try the random partitioning algorithm that will divide a graph, or network of people, into connected groups by breaking the less amount of links possible. This will in practice identify communities for a certain amount of connectivity. But if you want to know why they are connected, or the nature of their relationship then that will require a special type of data gathering, data mining and possibly human language processing.
