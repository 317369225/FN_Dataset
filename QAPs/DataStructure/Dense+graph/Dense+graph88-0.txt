How can a high schooler start research in graph theory?My mathematical knowledge goes up to advanced algebra/trig, that's about it. However, I do find graph theory to be an interesting field considering its various applications in the real world. Thanks! Edit: This is for actual research experience for a college level research research I will have to take during my senior year of high school.
In my computer science courses, graph theory was touched on in my Discreet Math and Algorithms textbooks. I suggest researching Wikipedia.. Follow links and sources on anything related to graph theory and Discreet Math. That should lead you to other websites and books. Research papers are great but usually dense and esoteric. Wikipedia will be your best friend. Check YouTube and Kahn Academy. You should find references to books and applications of graph theory in your research. Once you've exhausted all that I would go to Amazon and look up any books you've found in all that research. Order a used textbook for dirt cheap there. Just keep going down the rabbit hole while you find it interesting.
