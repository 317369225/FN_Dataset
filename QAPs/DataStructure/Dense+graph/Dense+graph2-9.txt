Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
Conventional pseudo-random number generators pose a problem to parallel simulation software, because of the sequential dependency between one random number and its successor. Counter-based parallel random number generators (from 2011, Salmon et al. "Parallel Random Numbers: As Easy as 1,2,3") make this bottleneck evaporate for most practical purposes, providing copious amounts of spectacularly parallel pseudo-randomness without major drawbacks. It's not so much a magnificent new invention as it is a re-think of the original problem, but this solution definitely made me slap my forehead and collect my lower jaw from the floor. There's a matching implementation that goes with it (http://www.deshawresearch.com/re...) to fully serve a solution to a tired old problem up on a silver plate, I think that's brilliant.
