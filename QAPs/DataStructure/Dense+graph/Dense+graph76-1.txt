What are some examples of Graph Algorithms being used to solve interesting problems?
Bipartite Graphs are used  to represent asset classes and derivatives,with an edge between a derivative and an asset classes if the derivative depends on an asset in the class.  There are M vertices on top corresponding to the derivatives and N vertices at the bottom corresponding to asset classes. Each derivative references D assets in different classes.  such a graph G contains an (m,n,x) graph H, if one can identify m top vertices andn bottom vertices of G with the vertices of H in a way that all of the edges of H will be present in G. Then you solve the Clique problem (depending on the computational power at your disposal and what distributions were used to tailor  the derivative  from assets) to identify booby traps .[A dense subgraph, is a set of derivatives (the manipulated derivatives) and a set of asset classes (the junk classes) that have more edges between them than expected. ]
