What are the two or three graphs or tables that a topline investor pack should contain?
Don't exactly know what you mean by "topline investor" but all investors want to see "growth", "velocity", "defensible space", "sustainability/stability" and depending on vertical, "portability/non-portability of assets in service/product". Depending on what vertical you live in and what you view as progress, said metrics to graphically show the above would be very different.
