82 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend of the 4th of July, 2014. What is the cause of this continued surge of violence and what is being done to control it?See http://my.chicagotribune.com/#se....
Clearly, Chicago has insufficient gun-control laws. What Chicago needs is to enact stricter laws against gun possession/sales, since the type of criminals who are willing to shoot another human being are typically deeply afraid of breaking firearms-possession laws.
