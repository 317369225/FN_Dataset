What can I read to help me better think in terms of networks?I'm looking to sharpen my thinking in terms of what it means to live in a connected world. Are there any essays or books that you have read that have helped you better approach the world in this framework?
I just read a "Social Network Analysis for Startups" by Maksim Tsvetovat and liked it a lot.Â  It's part graph theory, part general knowledge, and really great for a beginner (who knows a bit of Python). Tsvetovat also does webcasts, available for free here: http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au...
