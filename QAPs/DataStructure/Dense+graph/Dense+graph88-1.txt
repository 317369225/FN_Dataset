How can a high schooler start research in graph theory?My mathematical knowledge goes up to advanced algebra/trig, that's about it. However, I do find graph theory to be an interesting field considering its various applications in the real world. Thanks! Edit: This is for actual research experience for a college level research research I will have to take during my senior year of high school.
Before you can run, you need to learn how to crawl. I suggest you look at Free Online Graph Theory Books and Resources | Karussell and find someone who can answer your questions. Graph Theory | Open Problem Garden provide the current research topics.
