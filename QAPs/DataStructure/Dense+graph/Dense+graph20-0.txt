How do I run Floyd Warshall's Algorithm for a big road network?
If we look at Floyd–Warshall algorithm we see the algorithm has a complexity of O(V 3 )  . This means that for 100k=1E5 nodes you have in the order of 1E15=1,000,000,000,000,000 operations. You are basically running into the limits of the complexity of the algorithm. If we read the section on comparison with other shortest path algorithm we see the algorithm is good for  dense graphs, in which most or all pairs of nodes are connected by edges. This is not the case for a road network, typically each node will be connected to about four other nodes, you really have a spare graph and there are other algorithms which are better for this purpose.
