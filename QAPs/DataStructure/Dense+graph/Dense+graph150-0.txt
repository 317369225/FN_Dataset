What is the time complexity of Breadth First Search Traversal of a graph?I was reading somewhere that the time complexity of performing Breadth First Search Traversal in a connected graph is O(V+E), where V and E are the number of vertices and edges respectively. However, I think it should only be O(E).
Actually the Complexity for breadth first search is O(E) or O(V^2) for Dense Graph  as E=O(V^2)  and O(V+E) for sparse graph So you can assume for O(V+E) as complexity . As O is upper bound and can be assumed as worst case complexity    Read Cormen For Reference. It was clearly given in it .
