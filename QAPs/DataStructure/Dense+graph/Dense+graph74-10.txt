Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
Yes, "some" people. In same way that "some" people write funny/sarcastic one liners to get upvotes and decrease Quora's value. While there are many who wish to write "complete" answer from what they know/research.
