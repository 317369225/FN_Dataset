Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Does Quora aim to be welcoming only to liberals and progressives?I should hope not! Seems to me, Quora is simply an excellent place to pose questions and get answers. In politics, that often ends up being a mini-discussion and that's good.  Way too often discussion ends up cyclic and the Quora format allows all of us to post up our primary thoughts, hash it some in the comments, make our edits when warranted and move on. Frankly, that's refreshing!  I enjoy the range of thought here and the quality of discussion is high.
