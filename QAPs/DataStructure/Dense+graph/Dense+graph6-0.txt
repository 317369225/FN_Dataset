What are the state-of-the-art graph matching algorithms?
Best Known algorithms for Maximum Cardinality Matching in general graphs are: [1] for sparse graphs (time complexity O(|E|∗|V| − − −  √ )  ) and [2] for dense graphs (time complexity O(|V| 2.37 )  ). [3] for sparse bi-partite graphs (time complexity O(|E|∗|V| − − −  √ )  ) which is much simpler than [1]. P.S: Assume Graph G = (V, E) [1] Micali, Silvio, and Vijay V. Vazirani.
