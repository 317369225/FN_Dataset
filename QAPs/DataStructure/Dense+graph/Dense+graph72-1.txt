What are some alternatives to standard written music notation?
There are some neat variations on the idea of using numbers to denote scale degrees. This is one of my favorites: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num... A friend who traveled to China brought me back a four-part arrangement of "Jingle Bells", all written out numerically. Ever since then I've used it for notating music when I don't have the  computer handy. It beats carrying staff paper around, by a longshot! (At least for my current purposes, namely, writing for barbershop quartet singers, and transcribing melodies.) Updated 41w ago • View Upvotes
