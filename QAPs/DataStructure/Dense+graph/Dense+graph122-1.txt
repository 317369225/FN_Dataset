Why does gravity decrease beyond 4500 meters below sea level?
If the density of earth were a constant, then you would figure out that the gravity would start decreasing the moment you go below the sea level as rightly indicated by Rakesh Ranjan However, I think your question is for the real earth. In this case, the density is far from being a constant. And it turns out, there is no way we can come up with an equation that can handle earth's gravitational variation as we go below the earth's surface. However experimental results are as follows This graph shows the variation of the density So initially as you go below the surface, you are coming closer to the very dense core which tends to increase gravity, but as Rakesh pointed out, the 'onion layer' which is above you doesn't contribute to the gravity. But since the outer layer is less dense than the core, the net result is, gravity still increases. But you and I can both figure out without much numbers or equations that ultimately as you go deeper, there comes a point after which the outer onion layers become so thick that their absence of gravity starts decreasing the net gravity, and so ultimately gravity starts decreasing. Here is a graph showing variation
