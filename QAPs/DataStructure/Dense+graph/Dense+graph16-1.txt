What is the time complexity of Breadth First Search Traversal of a graph?I was reading somewhere that the time complexity of performing Breadth First Search Traversal in a connected graph is O(V+E), where V and E are the number of vertices and edges respectively. However, I think it should only be O(E).
It is correct to say that the complexity is O(V+E)  . Consider the case where the number of edges is way smaller than the number of vertices, i.e., E=o(V)  . As always, BFS will visit every vertex for each component. Here O(V+E)≠O(E)  . The take home message is that for sparse graph, O(V+E)  is not the same as O(E)  . In all other cases, you can safely assume that the complexity of BFS is O(E)  .
