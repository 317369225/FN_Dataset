What will a business plan look like 10 years in the future?
Although this is my question, after David wrote his great answer I decided to put together a picture of what the business plan of the future might look like.  I uploaded it to Slideshare at http://www.slideshare.net/Execut... As you can see it is a web-based business plan that pulls data from the following sources: Youtube - Elevator Pitch Linkedin - Management Team Klout and Twitter - Your Influence Quickbooks Online - Revenue and Profit Margin Data I think the second page of the business plan which I did not create yet, would take all of the data and information from the first page and put together financial projections and maybe grade the company in terms of chance for success.  Any other ideas?
