I'm a newbie at algorithms, but I'm capable of writing codes in C++ & Java. Do I have a chance to win the ACM ICPC 2016 title? Do I have the time to study and practice the knowledge needed?Do anyone here (or anyway you know) have the courage to (or even can)Â  put a feasible plan for achieving target in next 16 months?
