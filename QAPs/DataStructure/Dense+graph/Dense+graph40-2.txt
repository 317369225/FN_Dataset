How much of the difference between Democrats and Republicans is attributable to the difference between rural and urban life?
Stephanie Vardavas gave lots of information documenting what's going on. I'll only add some thoughts on "attritutable to". This is tricky because it starts to get causal and, as far as I know, we have only observational data.  It would be interesting if we had data on the voting patterns of people who move from urban areas to rural ones, or vice versa. There are many determinants of voting behavior and many are correlated with urban vs. rural:  E.g.  Black people vote overwhelmingly Democratic and are very concentrated in cities.  Income is related to voting behavior and to urban living (although the pattern varies from city to city) and so is education (in particular, the variance of years of education is going to be higher in cities than in rural areas - more high school dropouts but also more MDs and PhDs). The south is more Republican than the north and also is less urban. And some rural areas are pretty Democratic.  E.g. ME-02 (which is inland Maine) is about as rural as any congressional district in the country but Obama won the district in both 2008 and 2012.  Vermont has no big cities at all and is one of the most Democratic states.
