Lists of Top Quora Content: What are some of the best answers on Quora?Could be the most brilliant, detailed, enlightening, greatest, best source, smartest, wittiest, mind blowing, simple, crazy, touching. In short, answers that makes you say wow...this should be on the all time top answers list of Quora.   For starters, I nominate Tim Morgan 's answer to What do all the controls in an airplane's cockpit do?
Originally Answered: What are the all-time best Quora answers?I like answers whose difficulty of comprehension is just right. That is, the answers neither patronize nor are too complex, but start and extend from the cusp of my knowledge.  I nominate: Could two smart computer science Ph.D students create a search engine that unseats Google? How vulnerable is Google to this possibility? What is Seldon Capital and how does it make money? How did people communicate in the pre-internet era? Why is it so hard to find designers (both visual and interaction) who are also great engineers? Why is Quora so addictive? Updated 14 Aug 2010 • View Upvotes
