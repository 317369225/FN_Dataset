What are some unsolved problems in graph theory?A basic explanation of the problem with pointers to its current status would be appreciated.
One which I find interesting is the following problem about increasing simple paths in edge ordered graphs: What is the maximum m  such that every edge-ordered complete graph K n   contains an increasing path of length at least m  ? As simple as this problem seems, no one knows a definite answer to the problem. It is probably true that m≥n−12   , but no one knows (A stronger conjecture of Chung and Graham would imply this). You can find more details about the problem as well as other references here: Increasing paths in ordered graphs EDIT - BTW, there was a more recent development early this year which is not listed in the references above.
