When aeroplanes fly high, does it reduce the length of the flight?
From a pure distance traveled, no.. In fact, it actually increases the total distance traveled because of the required height to get to higher altitudes and then descend. There are three primary reasons airplanes want to fly a high altitude (35-45,000 ft.; Winds Weather Fuel & aerodynamic efficiency (one does not go without the other)These three points outweigh the slight increase of distance traveled / required for point to point flying. There are airplane flights where it makes no sense to fly at elevated heights and thus, they do not climb to altitudes above 20,000 feet. Flights that only fly 1 hour or less are often done so at lower altitudes except where terrain may require flying higher.
