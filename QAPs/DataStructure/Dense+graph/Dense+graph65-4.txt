How does a computer program convert different types of data like images or text files into binary data?
Black and white images are the easiest to describe-- you just have some convention that says that a "0" bit means a black dot and a "1" means a white dot.    Then you decide how many bits across and down the picture should be.Those are just arbitrary conventions.   Then you programatically set and clear its to "draw" an image.  For instance to draw a horizontal white line, you write a loop that sets consecutive bits into memory.   For a vertical line, again a loop, except you skip to the next line down by skipping by the row length. For color images you keep three bitsor bytes, one each for red, green, and blue.
