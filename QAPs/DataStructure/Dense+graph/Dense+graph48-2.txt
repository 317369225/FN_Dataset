If f(x+y) =f(x) +f(y), what would f(x) be without the assumption of continuity?
Well,  it depends a great deal on the situation.  Much of the time in mathematics, such functions exist and are used with no assumption of continuity, simply because the mathematical structures being used in a way where any underlying topology on the structure (where a meaningful idea of continuity generally starts) is either not specified or non-existent. In the subject of linear algebra, for example, the typical functions/morphisms of relevance are generally linear transformations, which satisfies the property you gave (in general such functions are called homomorphisms).  Now, some of the basic examples you'd see in an introductory course would generally be maps from R^n to R^m, but in general a linear transformation is just a particular kind of many between two vector spaces.  For R^n and for many finite dimensional (and infinite dimensional) vector spaces, there is a "natural" topology to use, but there are others as well.  The choice of topology (i.e what we consider to be an "open set") greatly affects where a given function is continuous.  Even on R^n, there are topologies we could use that change whether or not a basic linear transformation should be considered continuous.  In other settings, such as when looking at homomorphisms between quasigroups, loops, groups, rings, fields, etc. topological considerations may not exists in any particularly meaningful way, or simply not be important.  The theory of homomorphisms for objects like groups, rings, fields (and plenty of others) is pretty well established. so you might consider looking into if you want to know more.
