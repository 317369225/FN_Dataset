Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
Deep neural networks: Using unsupervised pretraining has made neural networks with multiple hidden layers usable in a wide variety of areas. Hinton et al (2006)
