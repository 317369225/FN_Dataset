Can we use Map of Map for storing weighted graph?
If you are not worried about space too much, using a 2-D array would make a lot of sense to me. It will still give you O(1) access time. It can waste a lot of space if the graph is sparse, but is a good solution for dense graph. Using a Map which maps keys to values(which in turn is Map) is not a bad solution too. However make sure you read about how java implements maps internally. Because using maps could waste a lot of space too. As internally I guess it would have to re-hash when you try to add more and more keys. But not a bad idea. However if you know already how many nodes will be there in your graph the using a adjaceny matrix for a graph would make a lot of sense to me.
