Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?Quora is more about sharing knowledge and not a race to get maximum upvotes.
No, the reason is because they want their views to be as clear as possible. A lot of us don't think everyone has the same context as we do, hence prefer to explain everything in detail. I do the same thing in real life. In real life, I do have a understanding of the person I am talking to, so I can reduce the length of my descriptions as more context is shared between us. Same is not true on Quora where most of the questions are asked anonymously so hardly much clue about the context between me and the questioner. I mostly answer unanswered questions which don't even get much attention by other users so while I do like upvotes and comments, I don't get that many simply due to unpopularity of the questions themselves. I still prefer to write answers as these are the questions which do need to be answered.
