What are the best rules for reading effectively?
Annotate, annotate, annotate. The research has shown that annotation, not just highlighting, is the key to understand. Use the margins to note key facts, new ideas, questions, synopses. Force yourself to interact with the text, not just read it. Get into a conversation with the author, make connections between what you are learning that is new and what you already know. Strengthen the map you have in your mind for the subject. When you are done with an article or a book, it should be full of your notes so that you can quickly go back and find things...no need to reread.
