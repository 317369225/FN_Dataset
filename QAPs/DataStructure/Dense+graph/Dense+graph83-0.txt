Is there a lot of crime in New York City?
Yes, every time the bodega makes me pay $5 for an orange juice! But seriously, it depends. First, I'm going to assume you mostly care about violent crime (e.g. rape, murder).  If you look at overall statistics[1], its violent crime per capita rate is around average for cities.  Better than San Francisco, but not as good as Denver. The problem is that said crime isn't uniformly distributed around the city.  Take a look at the graph for murders around NYC in 2013.  On a global level, it's also worth noting that 2013 had fewer murders than any year in recorded history[2][3].  For context, there were more murders in Manhattan 20 years ago than in all of New York City last year. So basically if you avoid a few areas of Harlem, South Bronx, and some parts of Brooklyn; you're probably safe.  Anecdotally, I live down in Greenwich Village, walk home very late at night, and feel entirely safe.  I know many women who feel similarly comfortable walking around here late at night.  Depending on where you live, New York can be one of the safest highly dense urban areas in the country.
