How can a high schooler start research in graph theory?My mathematical knowledge goes up to advanced algebra/trig, that's about it. However, I do find graph theory to be an interesting field considering its various applications in the real world. Thanks! Edit: This is for actual research experience for a college level research research I will have to take during my senior year of high school.
Are talking about actual research? You can just contact various local college professors of whether they're willing to let any high school students on their research team. That's what many high school students do to get research experience.
