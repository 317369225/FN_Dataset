How many friends of friends do I have on Facebook?
Per the recent study "The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph", a user with 100 friends has 27,500 friends of friends (May 2011 data). Based on the publicly available data in this paper, the average US user had 214 US friends which based on their estimates, would equate to ~60,000 friends of friends. The paper is dense, but basically, it found that the average Facebook user friends have more friends than they do. This fact is counter-intuitive at first, but true of most networks like this. By definition of the fact that they are your friend, they are more likely to be nodes with lots of friends. See the full paper here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.4503v1...
