How do I run Floyd Warshall's Algorithm for a big road network?
A Floyd Warshall for that many nodes would take eternity to run on any machine. It is an O(n^3) algorithm and n is 10^5. Your standard computer can run a Floyd Warshall for 10^3 nodes in under a minute or so in Java.  Also, it returns O(n^2) possible shortest paths. Jgrapht returns a collection of nodes and vertices for Floyd-Warshall, so it would return 10^10 solutions that would be in 100s or even 1000s GB of data depending on the graph. So what you are attempting is not feasible using Floyd-Warshall. You need to implement your own APSP algorithm for such huge graphs  or use something which already exists. Have a look at this. Distances/shortest paths between all pairs of vertices Maybe you can create a Java wrapper or use Jython.
