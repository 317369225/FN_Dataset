What are some unsolved problems in graph theory?A basic explanation of the problem with pointers to its current status would be appreciated.
Given a biregular bipartite graph, i.e., s+1 edges through each vertex in one partition and t+1 for the other partition, of diameter d and girth 2d is it necessary that s and t are prime powers? (assume s and t are greater than 1 and d is greater than 2 to remove trivial cases) For the smallest non-trivial case (d = 3) this is the same problem as the Prime Power Conjecture. It is open for every other case as well. (* this is a false statement, see the edit) Though I must say that it is not really an unsolved problem of graph theory. Certainly many mathematicians would consider it to be a problem in finite geometry and not graph theory. So, let me give another example: A subset S of vertices V in a graph G is called a dominating set if every vertex outside S is adjacent to some vertex in S. The minimum size of a dominating set in a graph G is called the domination number of G. Must it always be the case that the domination number of the cartesian product of two graphs is at least as big as the product of the individual domination numbers? The Vizing's conjecture from 1968 states that this inequality must always be true. I recently met some mathematicians at the International Conference of Graph Theory who are trying to find counter examples to this conjecture using the kind of bipartite graphs that I mentioned before and the incidence graphs of some other things like Combinatorial designs. Edit: for the case of d = 4, there are known classes of graphs for which s = q - 1 and t = q + 1 where q is a prime power but that's all.  Some references: Finite generalized quadrangles (see chapter 3) Generalized Polygons (Monographs in Mathematics): Hendrik van Maldeghem Updated 26 Jul 2014 • View Upvotes
