What is the difference in Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm?
In terms of visualizing the process of construction the difference is....   In Prim's algorithm at any point of time,  the set of selected edges will form a single tree. In Kruskal's algorithm at any point of time,  the set of selected edges need not belong to the same tree. But at the end we will have a single spanning tree. In terms of implementation the difference is... In Kruskal's every edge is considered only once. Either it is selected or rejected. In Prim's certain edges are considered more than once. So in Kruskal's implementation we can use heap structure for selecting the next best edge efficiently where as in Prim's it is not possible.
