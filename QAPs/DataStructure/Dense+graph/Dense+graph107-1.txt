Population: How have you noticed the increasing population in your country?How have you noticed the difference in population when you were born(or when you were little or a teenager), when there were billions of people less.
When I do think of it, things have really changed. I moved to Kolkata from a small town to the north of the city in 1999, and in time both the places have changed. The northern suburbs of Kolkata had several marshes, which would be breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and the evenings would be intolerable without some kind of mosquito repellent almost all the year round. With increased population, many of the marshes were filled up with settlements and houses, and the mosquito problem went away. The upgrades in infrastructure would also be an good indicator. The government regularly undertakes projects to improve drainage, but the improvements are overwhelmed within a few years, and you have waterlogged streets during the monsoons. The roads have also been expanded to accommodate the increased traffic, yet the roads are more congested and have a heavier traffic than ever before. Barasat, where I lived as a child, has also changed a lot. I distinctly remember seeing the Large Indian civet (referred to as Bham beral), which had a distinct smell, foxes and mongoose in the neighbourhood. Even after moving to Kolkata I would visit the place twice or thrice a year, and would keep an these creatures from the terrace of my uncle's house. Somewhere between my increasingly rare visits and the increasing pace of urbanisation, I saw them for the last time. While some of these changes may be due to increasing affluence and size of the urban middle class, and their desire to own more property (Cars, apartments etc.). A lot of it is also due to a growing population.
