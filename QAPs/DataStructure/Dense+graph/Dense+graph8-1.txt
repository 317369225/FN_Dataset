For what kind of problems is Borůvka's algorithm useful?
Another point to add about Borůvka's algorithm is that it can be made parallel. Since Borůvka starts with multiple components and tries to cluster them with lowest cost of edge, this step can be made parallel as in each thread takes one component and tries to merge with another in a critical section. In unsupervised learning, Agglomerative clustering algorithms work much similar to Borůvka except that clustering algorithms have different metrics like Euclidean, Manhattan distances between vertices instead of edge cost.
