Obama Presidency: Second Term (2013â€“present): If Ron Paul or Mitt Romney were in power, would the right-wing press and (white) Americans be happier?How would the country be better off?
I find the entire idea of asking if "white" Americans would be happier to be offensive and indicative of the ubiquitous ignorance and intentional divisiveness continually propagated by modern American liberals. (Yup, even the "white" ones!) To falsely (and, let's face it- anyone with an IQ above room temperature knows the premise is false and disingenuous) claim or even insinuate that anyone right of center, be they republicans, libertarians, anarchists, etc., are driven primarily (or even by a mentionable fraction) by race, is nothing more than a highly transparent, intentionally dishonest and unintentionally racist (you bet your ass it is) attempt to marginalize the TRUCKLOADS of legitimate complaints about this administration, it's goals, attitudes, arrogance and actions. To even phrase such a question this way only propagates that counter-productive tactic of division, and should be immediately recognized for what it is; "Let's talk about race, so we don't have to talk about issues."
