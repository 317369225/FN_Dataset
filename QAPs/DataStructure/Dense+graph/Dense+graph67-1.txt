Why are countries like India and China so densely populated? What are the circumstances and reasons?
Geography explains most of the population distribution, and history some of the rest. Both China and India are large countries in area.   They have large areas of land that can be farmed for food. Note that China and India were early civilizations, and started farming for food earlier than many other places that humans have lived.  We can see that today in the extensive variety of Chinese and Indian cuisines - which have the benefit of thousands of years of open source development... There is water for people and farming. Compare with the large nations in the Sahara - Algeria, Mali, Libya, Chad, Sudan - that cannot support many people in this climate cycle. The climate is generally reasonable for most of the country. Compare with Alaska (lots of room, but mostly cold), Canada (more cold, eh ?) and Russia (Welcome to Siberia, land of the future !)  Humans could migrate to them easily, compared to Australia or Antarctica. The rest of the distribution looks like a typical Pareto / power law distribution. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pow...
