82 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend of the 4th of July, 2014. What is the cause of this continued surge of violence and what is being done to control it?See http://my.chicagotribune.com/#se....
I believe the biggest problem is the rival gangs that are fighting each other over turf, drugs, forced proximity due to restructuring of schools, and desire to make a name for themselves.   Gang or drug related violence seems to be majority of the violence.   The only way to reduce the violence is to break the gangs.   However, I don't believe that the police nor the government can do that.  I think it will require the community as a whole to say enough is enough.  When all the churches, schools, and families say no more and they won't tolerate any more gangs or drugs, the problem will cease.
