If water is contained in an unbreakable container with no room to expand, would it freeze at freezing temperatures?In other words, can one prevent water from freezing simply by not allowing it to expand? Has it been done?
A few clarifying comments:  1) Water can get colder than 0C without freezing.  If it is extremely pure, it can get down to 225K without special equipment; just without anything to nucleate around. 2) Water compresses.  So the first thing you'll start to see is partial freezing just inside your box, proportional to pressure. Ice is roughly 9% less dense than water, and water compresses at roughly 1% / 22MPa of pressure.  You can calculate that when 10% of the water has frozen, the pressure in the box is ~22MPa. 3) You'll have a temperature and pressure gradient inside the box until it's fully frozen, even at equilibrium. 4) Once you start producing exotic ice such as Ice III, you'll start to lose pressure inside the container instead, as it is no longer entirely full of water and ice.
