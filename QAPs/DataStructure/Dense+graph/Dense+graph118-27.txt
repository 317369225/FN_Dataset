Do Quora users tend to be more liberally biased than the population as a whole?
Originally Answered: Do the voting guidelines expose a liberal bias on Quora?I don't understand what's "inherently liberal" about this policy. I can see that it may interpreted as being a bit "post-modern" - which may be considered liberal - to say that there are no right or wrong answers, but: You could as easily say that the policy reflects a commitment to free speech, which is more of a conservative ideal. The policy is aimed at honoring the quality of answers, even if the opinions expressed don't agree with your own. Factually incorrect answers aren't, and can't be, quality answers, whether they're liberal or conservative.
