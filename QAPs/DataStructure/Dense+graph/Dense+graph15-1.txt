Is there any reason not to use OrientDB?
Having used OrientDB for a while, I think I can now answer my own question. Yes, there are some reasons not to use OrientDB, even though it's a very good database, generally speaking. The graph editor in OrientDB is super buggy. This can be very confusing if you're just starting out. This is not likely to cause any problems in a production website and/or for more advanced users, but it can be demotivating for beginners, who will very likely rely on the graph editor a lot. I find Neo4j's Cypher sometimes much more intuitive than the SQL-based query language in OrientDB. There are query's that are almost trivial in Neo4j that I still haven't figured out how to do in OrientDB, despite reading the documentation multiple times. When using a dijkstra algorithm, in Neo4j, I can simply use the reduce function to output the total weight of all the traversed edges. I haven't found a way to do this in OrientDB (advice welcome, by the way :)).
