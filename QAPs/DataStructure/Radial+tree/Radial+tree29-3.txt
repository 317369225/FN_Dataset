1950s:Â  What would a person from the 1950s think of today?
My father died in 2011, but he told some stories about being a young man in the 1950s vs. modern times. Plenty of changes are for the better -- the racism and sexism of that era isn't gone, but it's certainly died down a lot from the days of Jim Crow laws. But there are other things that have changed for the worse. For example, my dad grew up poor, but he wanted to go to college. He joined the Navy right after he finished high school and used the GI Bill for college. The GI Bill didn't pay for everything, so he had to work his way through college in the 1950s with in a series of menial jobs, but was able to graduate with a Ph.D. without any debt. Just try doing that in the United States today. One thing he told me about was when he was studying for his master's degree at the University of Kansas and he got a letter from his mother saying that his father was in the hospital. He feared that his father might be about to die and needed to fly to New York. But how would he pay for the ticket? Credit cards and ATMs didn't exist yet and the bank was closed for the day. Fortunately, the bank president had a listed phone number. He looked up the number in the phone book and phoned him at home and explained his situation. Even though it meant interrupting his dinner, the bank president opened the bank and let my dad make a withdrawal after hours so he could buy a plane ticket.
