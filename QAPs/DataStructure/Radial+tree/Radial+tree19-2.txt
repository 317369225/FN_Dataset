What are the benefits/differences between wood cut riftsawn, plainsawn, and quartersawn?
Here is how I tend to use the different cuts of wood. I will use the quartersawn wood for items that need to be stable such as the frames used on cabinets and doors.  I also use quartersawn wood for premium decks because the wood does not cup like plainsawn wood.  This is essentially a stability concern. I will use wood sawn on the rift for table furniture legs when the legs have flat sides, especially when I can find the rift at about 45 degrees.  This tends to give a similar grain pattern on all sides of each leg.  Flat sawn or quartersawn wood will produce a grain pattern on two sides and no grain on the other two sides. I will use plain sawn wood for door panels and cabinet sides.  Plain sawn wood produces cathedral grain patterns that can be book matched to produce aesthetically pleasing grain patterns on panels.  I will also note that the center cut of plainsawn wood is also a quartersawn piece.  This has the advantage of being both the widest cut of wood available from the log and is stable.  These cuts make excellent tops for sideboards and tables.
