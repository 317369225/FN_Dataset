1950s:Â  What would a person from the 1950s think of today?
There was an awesome reddit thread on this topic which is worth reading: If someone from the 1950s suddenly appeared today, what would be the most difficult thing to explain to them about life today? My favorite answer was: "I possess a device, in my pocket, that is capable of accessing the entirety of information known to man. I use it to look at pictures of cats and get in arguments with strangers." So, to answer the question, I think they'd be astonished at the prevalence of technology and the fact that we take it so deeply for granted.
