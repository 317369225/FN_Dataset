What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?
One potential answer to this question comes from the Analytics 1305 [2] documentation: Kernel Density Estimation and Non-parametric Bayes Classifier K-Means Kernel Principal Components Analysis Linear Regression Neighbors (Nearest, Farthest, Range, k, Classification) Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Support Vector Machines Dimensionality Reduction Fast Singular Value Decomposition Decision Tree Bootstapped SVM The 11 algorithms implemented by 11Ants [1] provide another potential answer for this question: Decision Tree Gaussian Processes Logistic Regression Logit Boost Model Tree Naïve Bayes Nearest Neighbors PLS Random Forest Ridge Regression Support Vector Machine Another potential answer comes from the algorithms in Oracle Data Mining [3] Classification: logistic regression, naïve bayes, SVM, decision tree Regression: multiple regression, SVM Attribute importance: MDL Anomaly detection: one-class SVM Clustering: k-means, orthogonal partitioning Association: A Priori Feature extraction: NNMF Note: I don't personally endorse these choices, or even naming conventions. Just thought it made for another useful list. [1] http://jtonedm.com/2011/06/07/fi... [2] http://www.analytics1305.com/doc... [3] http://www.oracle.com/technetwor...
