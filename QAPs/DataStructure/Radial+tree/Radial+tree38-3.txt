What are memory maps? How does one use them for enhancing learning ability?
Thnx for a2a As u we know our brain remember much more by seeing somthing rather hearing or speaking something...when u will read articals about the speed learning u will find that the expert advice u to stop mumbling while reading a content and concentrate on visualize that contant... In similar way map making is conversion of typical wrriten notes into visual and creative form by connecting it to the things already present in our solid memory so that one can have a overall view of a subject special helpful in subjects which are complex . It enables one to memorize the content for a relatively long period. If u wanna more indepth info regarding this google it. :-)
