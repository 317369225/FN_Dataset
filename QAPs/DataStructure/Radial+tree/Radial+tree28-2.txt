Why is nature and life in general so often structured symmetrically?
Bi-polarity leads to symmetry and that simplifies the design. Try to imagine an animal without symmetry. Where will the single eye, ear, mouth be placed? Where is the front and back? What will ensure that the baby will be the exact copy of the mother? Two sides and two feet make maintenance of stability and even immobility easy. With only one balance wheel, the organism will probably have to move continually to stay upright - if there are up and down to talk about. If you loose one ear or one eye, you will know immediately what are the advantages of the binaural (that is stereophonic) hearingÂ  and binoccular vision.
