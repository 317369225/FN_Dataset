How does a spider decide where to put up its web?
I have noticed mosquitos (and other flying insects) often fly into the wall, are forced upwards, usually toward the corner, and of course the 'daddy long legs' seem to love building webs in the corner at the ceiling just to munch on these. I am referring to the family Pholcidae, (some refer to as cellar spiders.) - messy, almost invisible web untill it gathers dust.
