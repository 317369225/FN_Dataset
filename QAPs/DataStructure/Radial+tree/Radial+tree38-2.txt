What are memory maps? How does one use them for enhancing learning ability?
Memory Map: According to my knowledge it is the ability of brain to memories specific data. This is of two types 1) Instant 2) long term. The objects we see, hear, taste, perceive are considered in instant type. E.g. when we see something and instantaneously close our eyes, we can see those things for nearly 1 sec. When a mind- diverting or deep impacting things we perceive then it becomes a long term memory. E.g the greatest insult that you had in your school days (can you still remember that?) Now, mind has ability to make link between things that we see, hear etc. Moreover we can memories those things precisely whose links are in our mind. Hence this network of consecutive links is Brain Map. Also, we can make this network strong by repeatingÂ  those things regularly. E.g. you know names of all your friends but do you remember names of historic- leaders, names of different kings?? So the best way to remember all things perfectly is to prepare a poem or shortform. Other way could be reading the things directly after waking up. This goes to long term memory. After all a full attention, concentration to the present will be useful to make strong network for a long time.
