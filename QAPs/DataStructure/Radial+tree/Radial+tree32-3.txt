If the Sun's gravity is constantly pulling planets toward it, why hasn't the Earth been pulled into the Sun?
Because the planets are in motion, allowing them to constantly "sidestep" the direct pull of the sun and swing around to the side. The orbit is a perfect balance between the motion of the planet and the pull of gravity. If by some miracle, the momentum that keeps the planet in motion were to change, then the orbit would change, finding a new balance. Or the balance might be altered enough that the planet (or any other object) is pulled into the sun. More info: http://www.nasa.gov/audience/for...
