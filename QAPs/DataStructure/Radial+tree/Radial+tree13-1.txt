What would be a good way to organize the field of machine learning into sub-fields, for a new research candidate to gain a good overview of the domain. Basically what are the different streams of research active currently?
I suspect that the Wikipedia "Category:Machine_learning" [1] is as good a breakdown as any; so, because I'm interested in all applications of machine learning to dialog systems, I applied that list of sub-topics to a consistent search of Google Scholar [2].Â  What I can see clearly from that exercise is which sub-topics are not covered at all (unlinked) as well as the exact number of hits for each sub-topic, which gives me a good indication of the relative popularity of the various machine learning sub-topics as applied to dialog systems.
