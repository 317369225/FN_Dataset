If the Sun's gravity is constantly pulling planets toward it, why hasn't the Earth been pulled into the Sun?
The planets are in fact constantly accelerating towards the Sun, but they keep missing.  Each planet's velocity perpendicular to the Sun's gravity is the right amount so that the acceleration towards the Sun curves the trajectory just enough to maintain the same distance from the Sun, resulting in mostly circular orbits. Imagine the planet's motion if the Sun suddenly stopped pulling.  It would move in a straight line tangent to the orbit it was in, moving further and further from where the Sun was.  It is the acceleration from the Sun's gravity inward that pulls that line into a circle.
