I'm digging a trench in my yard.  I have come across a dozen or so thick roots from a large/mature magnolia tree.  Is it okay to cut these roots?
When we bought a new home a few decades back, we bought it partly because of the 20 or so beautiful cedar trees on the property. One of them in the front yard was only 25 feet from the bay window of the living room. It stood over a hundred feet tall and was about 30 inches in diameter at the base. Before the first year contractor warranty was over, I started to notice a radial crack in the soil about three feet out from the trunk. A week or two went by and the crack kept gaining more circumference to probably 120 degree by this time. One night we had a terrible wind storm. I thought I would take a look at that crack in the soil. To my surprise the entire root ball of the tree was rising up about an inch above the surface of the ground when the wind would blow real hard. I woke up the family and told them all to sleep downstairs. The next day I had the contractor come out and cut the tree down. That summer I was roto-tilling around the tree stump to dig it out. I discovered that whoever installed the electrical wiring from the street to the house had run a ditch witch within three feet of the trunk of the tree and cut through a main root that was seven or eight inches in diameter. My suggestion is that you never plan to dig a ditch under the drip-line of a tree. Always find an alternative plan to go around the root system. This tree could have been alive today if the worker who operated that ditch witch would not have taken the shortest route possible but instead, would have avoided the drip line of the tree. It had to be one very old tree.
