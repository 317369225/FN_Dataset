Why did animals evolve to be symmetrical?
In evolutionary terms, it is about the simplest form after the flat sheet. Once multicellular organisms developed, they tended to form flat sheets because that has the most are exposed to the outside world where food it. Then one of the easiest ways to develop is to roll up. Which instantly gives you a head, a tail, a bowel - and bilateral symmetry. (The other easy way to develop from flat is like a sponge, which also occurred). So it is easy to form, it seems to be successful, judging by us. Therefore not only is it unsurprising we have it here, but it would be unsurprising if we encountered it if we ever meet other advanced lifeforms.
