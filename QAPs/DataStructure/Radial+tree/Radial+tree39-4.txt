Which are the multibagger stocks to buy in BSE?
If you visit for ex Google and try to find out multibagger stock recommendations, you will probably end up with a LONG LIST OF MULTIBAGGER STOCKS, and as always, preety confusing which stocks to choose from. You see if the market experts were so expert, they would be buying stocks instead of selling advice. Always choose your own stock, don't follow recommendation. WHY TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN MULTIBAGGER? Let me tell you an interesting imaginary story. I am the owner of MYCOMPANY(51% Shares) and i know what is going on with that company. You see, being the owner of MYCOMPANY, even if some guys who works in my office orders a Tea, i will be informed. Now the scenario is that MYCOMPANY gave a outstanding results in last few Quarters, resulting increase in stock price. Now today some guy in my office gave me a bad news for MYCOMPANY. "What do you guys think i will do next? Do you think that i will inform public about the bad news and then sell my shares?" No, I will tell people that this months results are expected to be awesome and will sell my part or all shares. Finally when the results comes, public then realizes that they have been fooled leading to forcefully sell the shares in loss. This is how stock market works, you can be fooled by the news manipulators sitting above us who hides the news from public. Take advice from everybody but do what you think is right. Make your own concept in share market by researching and doing experiments. The people who makes and executes their own concepts/ideas and see the market from a different eye often gets successful.
