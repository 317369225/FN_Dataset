What is the most rational evidence, if there is any, of the existence of God?
EDIT: Let me be clear that I am now an atheist. Original Question: Do theists think they have evidence for God or do they rely purely on faith? When I was a Christian, I used to think that there was general revelation (ex. creation, physical and mathematical laws) and special revelation (specifically the Bible). I used to argue that the world around was proof enough for God. One day, while giving an answer on this site, I realized that I never really did believe in God and was just afraid of being wrong for the past 18 years so I defended a religion I didn't really believe in. Of the many who have tried to revert me, many admit that it's purely faith and that we must blindly believe. Smarter individuals will sometimes try to create logical arguments as to why their beliefs are justified, but I think they're just afraid of having been wrong for so long, in much the same way I was afraid. So theists rely more on faith. Updated 3w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
