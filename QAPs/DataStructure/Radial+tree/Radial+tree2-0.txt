What are most important Machine Learning algorithms?
"LNKnet, developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, integrates more than 22 neural network, statistical, and machine learning classification, clustering, and feature selection algorithms into a modular software package. Recently, support vector machines and naive Bayesian Classifiers have been added and a version of LNKnet has been developed that runs under the Microsoft Windows operating system using the Cygwin environment."  See  http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/co... for the software and http://www.ll.mit.edu/publicatio... for the paper.
