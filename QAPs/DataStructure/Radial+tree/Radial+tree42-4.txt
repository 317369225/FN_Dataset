Is there any stock in the Indian share market which can prove to be multibagger?
hello friend ,                       it depends upon sector , i advise to look in L&T , HCL TECH , SUNPHARMA are the best stocks to invest i don't say they are multi baggers but keep investing in them , they do give you good returns on long term .
