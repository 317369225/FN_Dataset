Is there any stock in the Indian share market which can prove to be multibagger?
If you are considering 5-10 year time period, equities can be a multi bagger in general as our economy is set to grow from 2 trillion dollar economy to a 6 trillion dollar economy in the next 5-6 years.[source:economic times]. Along with this growth, earning of the companies will grow, banks will become larger, consumer spending will increase, infrastructure will grow etc. When all this happens stock market will be on fire once the trigger starts. Also from last diwali to this diwali stock market indices have dipped by 4% which is one of the rarest in the last decade.Everything says it is the better time to invest in stock market with some of the best maneged companies. Invest in sectors like Auto, banking, housing finance, infrastructure etc
