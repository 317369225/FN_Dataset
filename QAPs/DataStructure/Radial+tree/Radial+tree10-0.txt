Can we reprogram the DNA of an apple tree so it creates useful consumer products like computers and coffee tables?
Eventually, yes.  We already have proof of concept for the manufacture of metallic structures (e.g. bones, magnetosomes, hemoglobin) and organic polymer structures both rigid and elastic at scales from nano- to human-.  We have proof of concept for emergent architectures that are rectilinear, radially symmetric, fractal, bilaterally symmetric, circular, pretty much any geometry needed.  We know that symbiotic communities of root and worm and bug and germ in soil can gather and make use of a remarkable range of key elements.  We know that the most common elements in our biome, such as carbon, silicon, iron, and oxygen can be the basis for a complete power generation and storage and computing system.  But we have an incredible uphill climb to figure out how to put all of nature's genius to work for us.  Some day, yes, we absolutely can have living genetic organisms that create objects for us.  It all began when we bred sheep to be fluffier, and corn to be cornier, and dogs to be doggier, and trees to be pulpier.  And there is no end to it.
