Which creatures on planet Earth would count as the most interesting, bizarre or amazing to observe? Give your reasons...
One of the most mind-boggling creatures on earth, that I've heard of (not seen yet, unfortunately) are Tardigrades. Extremophile is perhaps too feeble a word to describe these creatures. They can live on for decades without any food or water, survive in temperatures near absolute zero, to more than 100 degrees Celsius, survive even the vacuum of outer space! They can repair their DNA, and build a protective shell around their body to reduce damage. Now that's pretty extreme, and bizarre, isn't it?
