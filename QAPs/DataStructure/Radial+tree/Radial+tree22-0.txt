What is the origin of biological symmetry?
In Evolution: Probably around 555 million years ago the first animals with bilateral symmetry evolved. The other possible kinds of symmetry are radial: cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, corals and hydras). Sponges instead have no symmetry. In the tree of life Animals divide into no symmetry vs symmetry separating sponges from everything else and after that there is radial symmetry vs bilateral symmetry dividing the Bilateria from the Cnidarians. In Individuals: After fertilisation of the egg the first appearance of symmetry is after gastrulation when the digestive tract forms. If the blastopore only has an entry then the animal will have radial symmetry, instead if there is an entrance and an exit (like a bead) the animal will have bilateral symmetry.
