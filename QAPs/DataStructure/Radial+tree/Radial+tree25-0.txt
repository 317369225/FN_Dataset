Why aren't there any more super genius mathematicians like Newton, Euler or Gauss?
There are supergeniuses today. I love the way someone like Ed Witten, working as a physicist, managed to rewrite a big chunk of math. He was churning out theorems in mathematics using methods from physics that mathematicians were struggling to understand. He had this incredible way of seeing solutions to mathematical problems via physics. And he led the way in a major revolution in physics as well. He has probably influenced the work of thousands of physicists and mathematicians. Actually, that may be an understatement. But (1) all the low hanging fruit has gone and (2) it's much harder for the general public to recognise genius today.
