Why is nature and life in general so often structured symmetrically?
Is it possible, being bipedal, bioccular creatures we are programmed to notice symmetry.  Let's say because most things (visible) that prey on us have an even number of legs and eyes we have evolved to look only for symetrical entities.  Could it be we are ignoring a load of asymmetrical stimuli.  Just an alternative thought.
