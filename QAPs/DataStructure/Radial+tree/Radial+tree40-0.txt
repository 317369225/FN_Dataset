What is the dermal tissue in plants?
Epidermal cells are the least differentiated cells of the epidermis. Their shapes depend on the plant organ they cover, thus they may be e.g. elongated (monocot leaves) or of sinuous cell wall (abaxial epidermis of dicot leaves). They usually contain no chloroplasts, only leucoplasts. They possess a large central vacuole. The outer surface of the epidermis is covered with the cuticle. Its main constituent, cutin is secreted from the epidermal cells into their outer and radial cell walls. Cuticle plays a significant role in the water household of the plant, thus its thickness varies depending on the humidity of the environment. Thick cuticle is the characteristic feature of xerophytes. Cutin consists of polyester derivatives of C14-18 hydroxy-fatty acids. The cuticle is multilayered. In the lower layers, cell wall constituents intermingle with those of the cuticle, whilst the upper layers compose the cuticle proper. Cuticle is often covered also with a hydrophobic layer of epicuticular waxes.but the last layers of a tree are mainly composed of scleren chyma cells which have no gaps in between them and are dead cells
