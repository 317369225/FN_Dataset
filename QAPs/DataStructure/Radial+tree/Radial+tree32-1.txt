If the Sun's gravity is constantly pulling planets toward it, why hasn't the Earth been pulled into the Sun?
Actually, orbiting IS falling into the Sun (or whatever you're orbiting), but you're moving fast enough that your centripetal force balances out the Sun's pull. If you slow down the speed of the orbit, you'll be less able to balance the Sun's pull, and you'll get closer and closer to it until you spiral in. This actually happens to low-orbiting satellites as they encounter the outer reaches of the earth's atmosphere. The friction slows them down enough that they lose more altitude, which means they encounter more atmosphere, which means they slow down more, until they stop orbiting at all and plummet to the earth (gaining so much speed they burn up). Fortunately, since there's little or no friction in space, there's nothing to slow the earth or moon down in it's orbit, so there's little danger of us spiraling into the sun or getting smacked by the moon. Well, certainly not before the Sun goes out :-).
