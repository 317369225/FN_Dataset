What is the most rational evidence, if there is any, of the existence of God?
No.  There isn't even a definition of god that everyone agrees on, much less any evidence for it.  It is my personal opinion that god is basically a meaningless, and therefore useless word.  God is meaningless because everyone uses that word, and pretends we are all talking about the same being.  But the fundamentalist inerrant biblical literalist doesn't believe in the same god as the Unitarian, Catholic, Episcopalian, Muslim, or Hindu, etc... In fact, the reason that there are so many Christian sects today is because down through the eons, when church goers couldn't agree on the nature of god, or how he wanted us to live, they'd have themselves a good, old fashioned schism.  Here is a graphic of the major Christian schisms through the years: Hell, if the Jehovah's Witnesses are correct, then there are only going to be 144,000 souls in heaven, and everyone else goes to hell.  Isn't that special?  Of course, other True Christians™ disagree (Who Are the 144,000 of Revelation 7 and 14), which only proves my point. They cannot all be correct, but they can all be wrong.
