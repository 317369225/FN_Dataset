Why aren't there any more super genius mathematicians like Newton, Euler or Gauss?
Just because you dont know them, it doesnt mean that they dont exist. Of course, past mathematicians are probably more famous. This is because, at that point of time, mathematics was not so well developed and normal people could understand their impact. (you would realize that you were perhaps familiar with Newton's or Euler's work even during high school). As things started getting more complicated, the number of people who could appreciate the work of great modern mathematicians decreased. Secondly, mathematics today is perhaps so complicated and intense that even a super genius would not be able to contribute significantly to multiple fields of mathematics. And that's why they are not so famous. But believe me, they are probably as good(if not better) as these people in the past. Updated 61w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
