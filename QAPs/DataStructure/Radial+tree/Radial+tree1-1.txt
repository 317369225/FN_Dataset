What are some interesting repositories on GitHub that can be used for journalistic purposes?
Tabletop, which is invaluable for taking data in Google spreadsheets (which you should be using anyway) and getting the data available for a website or data visualization. https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop I wrote a small love letter to Tabletop on my personal blog: http://ejfox.tumblr.com/post/225... Jason Davies' D3 cloud is a fantastic resource to turn a plentiful source of data; text, into an interesting visualization. https://github.com/jasondavies/d... Impress.js hasn't been used for any journalistic endeavor yet, to my knowledge, but I think that it's unique presentation style could serve certain stories very well. https://github.com/bartaz/impres... I just released an update to my project sStory which I hope will help journalists create beautiful multimedia sites with minimal effort.
