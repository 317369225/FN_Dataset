What is the greatest mystery of all time?
I think the origins of the Kalash [1] people of Afghanistan/Pakistan/India is one of the most intriguing mysteries. Myth and legend internal and external to the tribe proposes that this people are descended from soldiers of Alexander the Great's Indian campaigns who preferred to stay put rather than slog it back to Macedonia [3]. Blond hair and blue eyes are common (but not universal) features,some contend that their language has different origins to local tongues and dialects [4] and they are, as a group, non-Muslim (although there are obviously individual exceptions or indeed trends towards conversion, given where they are located). This video is rather uncritical and appears to accept all the above claims at face value but is worth watching for the slideshow of images. Just don't blame me for the associated soundtrack. I assume this is how anthropological documentaries are done these days. There is also a challenger to the claim of being Alexander's descendants 'down the road' from the Kalash in the Drokpa of Tibet [5]. This tribe however is far harder to souce data on than the Kalash, I am uncertain why exactly. At this point I need to declare my hand: I am an absolute sucker for this kind of unsolved mystery: how peoples and cultures moved and migrated in ancient times, leading to the diversity we enjoy today. I especially love "peoples showing up where they shouldn't be" as possibly with the Kalash/Drokpa; vikings and/or Irish in North America pre-Columbus; cocaine in Egyptian mummies [6]; red-haired plaid-wearing mummies in China [7], even in my own neck of the woods (please see the answers to Who are the Black Irish?). Why? I don't know really. Partially a strong interest in anthropology, combined with deep love of mysteries but ones that (I think) could really be true, as opposed to the more left field or "science-fiction-y" ones. No disrespect to those who follow the more sci-fi ones, it is just for me the likelihood of a mystery being true adds spice and interest. NB: In a different answer I wrote that the people(s) above were located in India, I cannot find a citation to this effect now but since their origins (whatever those might actually be) undoubtedly predate modern borders I'm going to roll with it =) I also remember a TV documentary I'm still trying to locate (one of Michael Palin's ones?) that said so.  [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal...
