What is the rule of thirds law in photography?
To begin with, the "Rule of Thirds" is a basic principle of photographic composition. The rule behind this principle is to break down the image into thirds (a grid of 3 by 3) so that you have 9 parts. You can find third grid in most of the point and shoot, DSLR & mobile cameras. The theory of Rule of Thirds states that if you place your points of interest (in an image to be shot) in the intersections or along the lines, your photo becomes more balanced. Various studies have shown that when people view an image, the viewer’s eyes naturally (usually) go to one of the intersection points rather than the center of the shot.   However, it takes a little time & practice to develop this as a habit. Hope this answers your question.
