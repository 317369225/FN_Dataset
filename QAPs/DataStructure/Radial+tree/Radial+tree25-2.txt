Why aren't there any more super genius mathematicians like Newton, Euler or Gauss?
Mathematics has become much more developed and specialized since the time of Newton and Euler - it now take much more time to get to the point where you can begin to make large contributions to a field of math.  Also because of the development/specialization, it is hard to make progress across many different fields of math as Euler and Newton did, which led to them being credited as "super geniuses". EDIT:  You should also remember that Newton and Euler were exceptional, exceptional talents and weren't that many people like them in all of human history. EDIT2: I've since changed my mind.  I think the primary cause is that 99.99% of the population only learns about maths developed up until the time of Newton, Euler, and Gauss, so we don't know about any of the geniuses after.
