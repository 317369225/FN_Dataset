Which are the multibagger stocks to buy in BSE?
Can you belive at one point lupin was quoting less than one rupee,Â  It touched a high of Rs2000..!!! You have to sit and study every annual report and avialable news understand them. If possible talk to management understand their business. Then buy them when you see the fruits of their work will leap more profits No one will ever tell if you would have found a multibagger, they first buy and tell the whole world later when they have bought the suffient amount of it The reason i quoted Lupin is when it was One rupee, no one would have dreamt it would touch 2000, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bought it when the prices crossed 100RS, You see it was a hundred bagger when he bought. now it is almost 20 bagger with dividends and still a long way to go Check for stocks which have already doubled in ast one year and whose EPS is growing every quater. It is a good sign that it may continue to do so. But understnad the company, only then you have some chances to undestand before the crowd that something is not right and you can jump out faster When the stocks go up, 20% in a week, we hesitate to buy it. WHen we see the stock has doubled we hesitate to buy, saynig it already at the top i will wait for it come down, But what people dont see is, that stock can only become multibagger, if it continues to make new tops every now and then and remains at top to be a multibagger, not the stock which is stuck in range. Hope it helps.
