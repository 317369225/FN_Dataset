Is there any stock in the Indian share market which can prove to be multibagger?
This Diwali is the best time to invest in shares given the recent market correction and positive futuristic outlook. The market had been volatile with Sensex touching an all-time high of 30,024 and then corrected upto 12% in the last 6 months, over global concerns of a slowdown. This is all set to improve and growth is expected to pick up, especially since India is poised to be the fastest growing nation, overtaking China. However finding the right stock has been an area of major concern. After following a Bottom-Up approach and careful evaluation of the existing opportunities in the current market, we bring to you 7 stocks this Diwali, which we feel are a mix of long term wealth creation and Multi-Baggers ideas.

It is traded in a similar way to how Tata Motors share is traded which own British automobile giants Jaguar and Land Rover. Tata Motors also has a major presence in Truck and Bus segment in India. Investment Rationale : Tata Motor DVR trades at 33% discount to main shares, whereas globally DVR shares trade at a very small discount to the main share. Also, the stock is trading in single digit PE of 5.5, in comparison to 20 for the automobile industry. The growth prospect of its commercial vehicle segment, especially M&HCV where it is the market leader with 58% share, seems bright and is likely to pick-up at a reasonable pace going forward. Jaguar & Land Rover which are globally well-known and mature brands, saw a growth of 9.5% in FY2015, contributes to 83% of the overall revenue. With 2 new models of passenger cars being launched every year till 2020, the revival and growth prospect of the company looks good. Risk : There is a bit of uncertainty about the future growth in China for Jaguar and Land Rover. Evoque sales have not been as per expectation in China leading to negative sentiment on the stock. Why invest now : The stock price of Tata Motor DVR has corrected 32% from its 52 week high due to weak Chinese outlook. Tata motor's exposure to China is 29% of its total Revenue of FY15. Even if we assume there is no growth from China, the stock has corrected more than necessary. JLR recorded increase in monthly volumes (both wholesale and retail) in Sept 15. Tata Motor has also reported a growth in its standalone sales for the month of October. This increase in sales is expected to continue going forward and hence, it makes sense to buy Tata Motor DVR now before others start buying and the stock price picks up.

It covers all spheres of news like international, national and local news which relates to politics, business, entertainment, sports and varied general interests. It is the third-largest read daily in the country with ‘Hindustan’ being one of the fastest growing Hindi newspaper. Investment Rationale : The company reported strong growth in revenues from advertising and from circulation. We expect this growth in both advertising and circulation revenue to continue due to the company’s strong presence in various states and leadership position in Delhi, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh & Jharkhand. Management has also guided that the company is focusing on improving operational efficiencies to ensure the growth of revenue leading to a growth of profits. The company has a strong balance sheet with Net Cash of Rs. 630 crore as of 30th September. The company saw an increase in share of local business across all markets in Q2FY16 and this is expected to continue with it maintaining its leadership position in the northern region and increase in market share of its Hindi Newspaper. With the strong backing of its parent company HT Media the company’s growth prospect seems bright. Risk : Rural slowdown, due to many competitors entering the market, could impact growth in the long run. Company’s expectation of increase in circulation revenue could also not be met. Why invest now : Bihar elections may be beneficial for HMV (Leadership position in Bihar) as according to industry estimates, print ad spend from Bihar elections is expected to go above Rs. 50 crore. Hence one should start accumulating this stock in their portfolio.

The company operates four plants in India, with a current installed capacity of 13.7mn tyres annually. While 75% of JKT's tonnage volume is contributed by the commercial vehicle segment, the passenger car segment accounts for ~15% of the volumes. Investment Rationale : Natural rubber prices have declined to ~Rs. 114/kg levels from the highs of ~Rs. 250/kg in 2011. It accounts for ~40% of total raw material costs, which coupled with low crude oil costs, helps keep the gross and operating margins high. Also, various manufacturers have hardly passed any benefit in price reduction, thus maintaining high margin levels. Given an economic revival, capacity utilization for most players on the radial side is expected to remain high. With demand in Radial tyres expected to increase and the stock having given a negative return of 2% in the last one year despite a favorable performance and earning high margins, the stock seems a good bet for long term. Risk : JK Tyre's deal with Kesoram Industries to acquire 100% stake in Cavendish Industries, located in Haridwar for a consideration of ~Rs. 2200 crore may be a risky bet. The debt equity of the company is significantly higher than its peers. Why invest now : Given the low rubber prices, the raw material cost of JK tyre is expected to be low for the next few quarters, till oversupply comes down. The recent improvement in auto sales no is also a clear indication of further improvement in volumes in the quarters ahead. This Diwali one should accumulate the stock and hold for at least 2-3 years to expect good returns.

It currently operates 647 pre-schools (540 are self-operated) in 97 cities. In 2009, it had done forward integration to provide management services to its 24 K-12 schools in three states. Geographically, its pre-schools are skewed towards Western India wherein it operates 56% of its pre-schools. Investment Rationale : In the past few years, the company has increased its number of pre-school branches at a rapid pace, from 302 in FY2012 to 647 in 1QFY2016 (self-operated branches + franchisees) with major business concentrated in Maharashtra (~40% branches). The company would be adding 150 pre-schools in FY2016 of which 50% of the pre-schools will be opened in the Tier I cities. They have planned for a capital expenditure of Rs. 100 crore in FY16 and pay off its debt completely within the next 2 years. It currently has 90 day-care centers and has tied up with large corporates in the IT, Banking and consulting space. It also is looking to monetize its K-12 school premise and adopt an asset-light model although continue to provide educational services to them. Risk : Currently it has 40% geographic concentration of business in a single state of which around 28% of pre-schools are located in and around Mumbai. The company may face certain restrictions if Government of India introduces regulations in the pre-school segment. Also, attrition of highly skilled teachers and supervisors could badly impact the success of the company. Why invest now : The management had recently clarified with regards to their accounting of Rs. 35 crore worth Receivables that it was consistent with the business practice, given that Rs. 17.5 crore is receivable from its curriculum over the next 3 years and the remaining Rs. 17.5 crore would be received in the form of a service fee from K-12 schools at the end of the academic year. The stock price has halved from its 52 week high of Rs. 548 to CMP of Rs. 273 as of 4th Nov and it is expected to bounce back from current levels, hence one should start buying this stock at current levels.

Redington’s strength in capturing emerging business opportunities across Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud (SMAC) is what makes it a strong candidate for high revenue growth potential. Coupled with the ability to provide wide range of services – distribution, logistics and after sales services, continues to be the unique selling point to the customers. Its UAE subsidiary was recently appointed by Apple to distribute iPhones which is a key addition since the company expects a significant increase in its offerings to customers in the smartphone category. Risk : In Q2FY2016, Redington derived 60% of its revenues from the overseas region which makes it prone to risk of global slowdown of demand for IT and non-IT products. Cross currency movement could have an impact on its revenues as well. Why invest now : With the increased growth of smart phones, one expect significant traction in company’s revenue going forward.

It is the manufacturer of widest variety of farm equipments in India. Investment Rationale : Greaves Cotton earns 96% of its revenues from Engines segment. After nearly 2 years of decline in demand, the Indian Automotive industry recorded a 7.22% growth in volumes in FY2015. Given the improving sentiment, management expects signs of recovery in Automotive Engine business. So far commodity prices have remained subdued and fuel prices have also halved from previous year and are expected to remain low over the short term. This coupled with the increase in demand is expected to boost sales and increase profit margins of the company. Despite the slowdown in the sector, the companies continues to report ~20% ROCE which clearly reflect premium multiple for the company in the future. Risk : Volumes in the Small Commercial Vehicles segment, where the Company has a dominant market share, continue to sharply decline, reflecting a decline in sales recorded in the industry. Fuel price and commodity cost fluctuations could have an impact on the demand as well as profitability of the company. Why invest now : Its recent closure of loss making division of infrastructure equipment business lead to an increase in EBITDA margins. Given the slew of new products being released in the market to gain deeper market penetration, and increase in operational efficiencies it is the opportune time to buy this shares of this company.

It had tied up with NSK which is the one of the world’s leading bearings manufacturer, to produce bearings for transmission and magnetic clutch. Company’s gross block has tripled in the last 9 years, however its sales have stayed the same. When its sales increase, the bottom line of the company is expected to see grow manifold. Risk : Large scale import of low-priced components and bearings, especially from China, has hurt the industry and the company as well. The management states that it may also face issues relating to delay in payment from vendors and delay in repayment of loans to banks, due to weakness in cash flows in case of fall in demand.
