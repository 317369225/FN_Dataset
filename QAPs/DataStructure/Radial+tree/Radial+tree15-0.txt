Is the blood pressure constant throughout the body?
No, it's not constant throughout the body. Simplified diagram of circulatory systems - systemic and pulmonary Image Source: Wikipedia During a single cardiac cycle (one heartbeat), the blood pressure varies between a systolic (maximum) and diastolic (minimum) value. This is what the waveform looks like: Image Source: Wireless Human Health Online Monitor Physiologically, we convert the varying pressures to a single value called Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), calculated as MAP = (CO × SVR) + CVP Where CO - Cardiac Output, SVR - Systemic Vascular Resistance, and CVP - Central Venous Pressure (approx 0 mmHg). Here is a cartoon showing the origin of peripheral pulse pressure Image Source: Blood pressure profile along the arterial tree and genetics of hypertension Here is a comprehensive diagram showing factors that determine MAP Image Source: http://www.cvphysiology.com/Bloo... Practically speaking, however, CO and SVR values are hard to estimate. Instead, we estimate MAP by Systolic and Diastolic pressures in a cardiac cycle. MAP ≈ 2⁄3(Pdiastolic) + 1⁄3(Psystolic) This MAP value varies across the circulatory system considerably. Change in MAP across arteries to veins in systemic and pulmonary circuits Image Source: http://droualb.faculty.mjc.edu/C... Pulmonary Circulation In the pulmonary circulation, blood flows from the lower right chamber (right ventricle) of the heart to the lungs via a pulmonary artery, where it gets oxygenated, and flows back into the upper left chamber (left ventricle) of the heart via a pulmonary vein. In hemodynamic terms, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) can be described by PAP = (CO x PVR) + PVP Where CO - Cardiac Output, PVR - Pulmonary Vascular Resistance, and PVP - Pulmonary Venous Pressure (similar to Left Atrial Pressure) Normally, mean pulmonary arterial pressure is about 15 mmHg, and the pulmonary arterial systolic and diastolic pressures are about 25 and 10 mmHg, respectively. Pulmonary venous pressure is about 8 mmHg. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure of over 25 mmHg at rest is defined as pulmonary hypertension. [1] Pulmonary pressure does not need to be very high, as the blood is pumped nearby, to the lungs, through lower vascular resistance, where it needs to have a slow flow through the alveoli for gaseous exchange, as compared to pumping blood through the entire body. Systemic Circulation In systemic circulation, the blood is pumped against gravity through the entire body and back. Mean Arterial Pressure falls as the distance from the heart increases. However, systolic pressure may be up to 40 mmHg higher in the brachial artery than in the aorta. This phenomenon of systolic pressure amplification is due to increase in arterial stiffness moving away from the heart. As the pressure wave travels from the highly elastic central arteries to the stiffer brachial artery, the upper portion of the wave becomes narrower, the systolic peak becomes more prominent, and systolic pressure increases. [2] Amplification of the pressure waveform moving from the aorta to the radial artery. [2] The mean aortic pressure, the pressure in the main artery leaving the heart, is around 95 mmHg. As opposed to increase in systolic pressure down the aorta, mean aortic pressure stays somewhat constant across other arteries but drops 50-75% in the smaller arteries and arterioles, affected by vessel diameter and vascular resistance. In the capillaries, the MAP may be 25-30 mmHg, depending on the organ. The pressure falls in the venules and veins, getting close to zero in the inferior vena cava, entering the right atrium. [3] This, in summary, is the paradox - the systolic blood pressure (SBP) actually increases with distance from the heart thus causing the pulse pressure to almost double, whereas the mean level of the arterial pressure (MAP) falls with distance from the heart (the fall is only about 4 mmHg) along the length of the aorta. The process of pulse pressure amplification continues in the branches of the aorta out to the level of about the third generation of branches. Thereafter both pulse pressure and MAP decrease rapidly to the levels found in the microcirculation where a quasi steady flow is observed. [4] Change in pressures across the systemic circulatory system [3] The macrocirculation is influenced by concepts of pressure wave propagation, Pulse Wave Velocity and Pulse Pressure amplification. The microcirculation is influenced by steady flow, as results from the Poiseuilles law and the pressure gradient is proportional to the velocity and viscosity of blood, to the length of the arteriolar tree, and mostly inversely proportional to the power four of vascular diameter.
