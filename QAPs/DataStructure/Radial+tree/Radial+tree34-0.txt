What are different drainage patterns?
The three main types of drainage patterns that can be identified are dendritic, trellised and radial. The disappearing streams indicate an area of inland drainage as in deserts or underground streams such as those in the limestone areas. Broken ground is also shown with black lines and found in ravines and badlands where lack of vegetation causes extensive erosion when the rivers flood. Dendritic drainage pattern The name is derived from the Greek word dendron which means a 'tree'. This drainage pattern is similar to a branching tree and hence the name. This pattern of flow of streams and rivers develops in an area which comprises rocks with a uniform structure. Trellised drainage pattern It is a rectangular shaped drainage pattern that develops where bands of rocks vary in resistance. In some areas there are alternate bands of hard and soft rocks. The flowing water can erode the soft rocks and thus flows along the bands of soft rock. Radial drainage pattern It is a 'spoke- like' pattern. Water channels flow from around the top if a hill or the top of a dome type feature in numerous directions like the spokes of a wheel. Such a pattern of drainage may develop from a volcano or conical mountain. There are a few other drainage patterns as well, which are uncommon. The centripetal drainage pattern is the opposite of radial drainage pattern. The streams converge in an area which is either a depression or a basin. For more information : Ground Drainage Systems
