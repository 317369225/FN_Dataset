What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?
Over the past a few years, I have interviewed many candidates with machine learning on their resume, got disappointed by 90+% of candidates. Good candidates should have a deep understanding of a broad set of algorithms and math; hands on (familiar with common tools/utilities, could or have efficiently implemented dozens of advanced algorithms before); practical and love tweaking until it works (good sign if s/he had experiences of shipping a few  machine learning components to production before).
