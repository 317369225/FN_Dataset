What are the advantages of logistic regression over decision trees?
As as others have said, in most questions like "Should I use algo a instead of algo b?"，the answer is it depends. To my knowledge, logistic regression and decision trees has the following pros and cons. 1. Logistic regression are easier to interpret and there are lots of techniques developed to do subset selection or stepwise selection, however when feature dimension gets large, it's almost impossible to interpret for decision trees. 2. As Vijay pointed out, logistic regression is faster and more reliable when the dimension gets large. Also note that the decision boundaries of decision trees are parallel to axises. 3. One disadvantage of logistic regression, it is unstable when one predictor could almost explain the response variable, because the coefficient of this variable will be boosted to as high as possible, here is a case when people turn to discriminant analysis. 4. Personally, I favor logistic regression when there is well over 20 predictors at hand because logistic gives me much more flexibility in modeling. I could do subset selection, backward or forward selection. I could link shrinkage methods like lasso with logistic and so on and it is much easier to interpret the results(coefficients and so on).
