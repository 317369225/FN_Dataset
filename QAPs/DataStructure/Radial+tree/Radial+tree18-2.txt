Why did animals evolve to be symmetrical?
As User says, bilateral symmetry just makes sense for something that moves in an environment with gravity.  Symmetry (including radial symmetry like a starfish) is efficient -- both to evolve and to develop in each individual -- because it reuses the same DNA code in multiple places. (another example of such reuse -- but that isn't symmetry per se -- is that each of your fingers and toes shares much of the same code rather than having to develop/evolve completely separately) An interesting (and trippy) example as well as counterexample is the flatfish.  It starts out biologically bilaterally symmetrical, but then deviates from this plan as it develops, and approaches a new bilateral symmetry that is rotated 90 degrees from its original symmetry. As expected its new symmetry is far from perfect, but it seems to work well enough.
