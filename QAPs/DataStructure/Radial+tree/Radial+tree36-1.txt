What does your brain do when you meditate?
Alpha waves are stronger, while beta and gamma waves are weaker. Alpha waves occur when we are relaxed but awake. They also occur when the brain is very concentrated and relaxed in doing something and no interferences occurs in the thoughts: this is called the Zone or Flow (psychology). It is called the Zone because it is the state where our abilities are at their maximum. In this state informations are called by the brain when needed and there are not divisions in thinking making us more powerful. We are whole in what we do, if we are not doing anything than we are whole in not doing anything but just watching. Meditation should bring this state all the time. Neural oscillation 's page on Wikipedia explain more about brain waves.
