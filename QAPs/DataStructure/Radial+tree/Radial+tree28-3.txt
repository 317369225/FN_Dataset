Why is nature and life in general so often structured symmetrically?
Gravity ensures that most living things will have a top and a bottom. And most living things need a mouth at one end and an anus at the other, so they end up with a front and a back. That means any symmetry they do have will be left-right. In terms of genetics, symmetry is efficient. Instead of genes for the left side and genes for the right side, whenever there is symmetry, you can have two-for-one. And in general, symmetry means redundancy. You can lose a kidney, an eye, an ear, even a hand and still function. And then there are specific benefits from symmetry like stereoscopic vision and differential hearing.
