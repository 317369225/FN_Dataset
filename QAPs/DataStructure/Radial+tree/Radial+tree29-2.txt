1950s:Â  What would a person from the 1950s think of today?
There's a sweet and charming movie that illustrates this very nicely: Blast from the Past It's about a young man, born and raised in a fallout shelter, who grows up in a "frozen" state of 50's culture, style & values only to emerge to the streets of LA as an adult in modern times (well, 1999 to be exact). It follows his amusing discovery of developments in today's world and cute interactions with all of the new people he meets. Highly recommend watching if you have this question on your mind.
