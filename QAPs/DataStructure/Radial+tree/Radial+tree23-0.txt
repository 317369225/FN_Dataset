I'm digging a trench in my yard.  I have come across a dozen or so thick roots from a large/mature magnolia tree.  Is it okay to cut these roots?
If you plan to keep the tree, it's probably a better idea to try and reroute your trench.  If it's for something like an irrigation system, see about 45-ing around it, or repositioning your zone so that you can accommodate for the root system surrounding your trees.  Most trees have a root system that will go 2-3 times the distance of the tree canopy diameter.  If it's feasible, try and avoid damaging your tree's roots. If you have to trench in that particular area, you might look at guying or cabling the tree temporarily to accommodate for the lost strength in the roots, but you can make no guarantees as to how the tree will react to losing a large portion of its roots.  The other thing you have to look at is what you're putting in said trench, if it's something that is sensitive to root movement, it's probably better to either remove the tree entirely, or reroute your trench.
