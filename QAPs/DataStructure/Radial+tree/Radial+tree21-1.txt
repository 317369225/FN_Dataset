Classification (machine learning):Â How do I design a classifier for this data set?
Yes this is a valid question. We can design a classifier for such a data. In real life we often find data which has complex decision boundaries, like this. To build a classifier for such data we use kernel techniques. Kernels map the data in the input space to a high dimensional space where data is linearly separable and you can use your favorite classifier after the transformation. To give you more intuition about data getting linearly separable after transforming to high dimensional space, imagine each point as ball of different color on a rack with different rows. Consider crosses be red colored balls and dots be green colored balls. Now take all the red color balls and put them in a row above the current row so that all green balls are on one level of row and all red balls are on one level above this on the rack. Now you can imagine that by using a board and putting it between the two levels of the rack you can separate two sets of balls. This is the intuition behind using kernels. They map the data in high dimensional space such that data is linearly separable in that space and you can use your favorite linear classifier in that space. Hope it answers your question!!
