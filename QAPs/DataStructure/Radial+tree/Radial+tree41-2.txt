What is the most rational evidence, if there is any, of the existence of God?
Original question: Do theists think that have evidence for God or do they rely purely on faith? To even the most uneducated believer, belief without any evidence at all would be tenuous at best. Some theists see the whole concept of evidence unnecessary, as they believe that faith is independent of evidence. I give a critique of this approach here: Stephen Sibbald's answer to What is good or bad about blind faith? Some theists believe they have conclusive evidence for God. I have seen much evidence for God, but in aggregate it is not conclusive. As an aside, people who have proven to themselves that God is real would not act according to faith; they would act according to reason! Some theists think they have evidence for God.  I fall in this group. I see lots of subjective and circumstantial evidence for God. In aggregate, I believe this makes a reasonable case for God, and I choose to run my life accordingly. Updated 5w ago • View Upvotes
