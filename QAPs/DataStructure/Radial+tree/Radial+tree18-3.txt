Why did animals evolve to be symmetrical?
We have bilateral symmetry because our ancestors had it and we're so adapted to it that deviating from it would be bad for us. It (probably; we can never be certain) originally evolved because it makes movement easier. Have you ever played with robots or powered LEGO vehicles? If you put different sized wheels on each side you will have a very hard time making it go the direction you want it to. If they're the same size all you have to do to make it go forward is spin them at the same rate, and turning right and left involves the same ratio of speeds, just flipped. The same is true of undulating worms, swimming fish, and running tetrapods. You'll notice if you ever cut a complex animal open that their innards are almost entirely oblivious to symmetry. We have two lungs and kidneys, and a few others are central, but our heart, liver, stomach, intestines, gallbladder, and most others aren't. Even our lungs aren't symmetrical; our left lung is smaller to make room for the heart. Only the outsides and muscles, which are the parts that are important for movement, are symmetrical.
