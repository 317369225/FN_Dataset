What are the benefits/differences between wood cut riftsawn, plainsawn, and quartersawn?
Each cut has its own advantage in terms of waste, appearance, and strength. Plainsawn is the easiest & cheapest way to cut lumber & results in the least waste. However, it's not as strong & may warp over time. There's also great variation in the wood's appearance depending on how close the board was to the center of the tree. Because of the directional tension across the grain as the wood dries, ages and wears, flat sawn boards can be subject to cupping, twisting and bowing. Often, dry boards will absorb moisture from the atmosphere and will become distorted. Plain sawn lumber has a large variety of appearances based on the angle of the growth rings relative to the surface of the board. Quartersawn is an older method of cutting wood & has two advantages over plainsawn wood. First, it's more resistant to the warping and bending that can come from absorbing atmospheric moisture. Second, it has a unique look (especially in oak) due to the extremely tight rings and the angle of the cut. This is sometimes called "tiger striping." Source: http://treefrogfurniture.blogspo... Riftsawn boards are cut radially from the center of the tree. It produces the most waste, but also produces the strongest possible boards. This wood has a more consistent visual look than plainsawn.
