What is the greatest mystery of all time?
What happened to the Anasazi? Why did they leave Mesa Verde (in what is now Colorado)? Where did they go? How accurate was Willa Cather's "The Professor's House" in dramatizing this mystery? We read that book in high school and I was mesmerized when, many years later, I got to explore Mesa Verde. It is an ethereal, unforgettable place. "About 1,400 years ago, long before any European exploration of the New World, a group of Indians living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For over 700 years their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone cities in the sheltered recesses of the canyon walls. Then in the late 1200s, within the span of one or two generations, they abandoned their homes and moved away." Why? Experts speculate here. A fantastic tour.
