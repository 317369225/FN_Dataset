How does a spider decide where to put up its web?
When I had a home energy audit conducted, I learned that spider webs inside your house are almost always a sign of air drafts. In a quick search to prepare for writing this answer, the main thing I discovered is that people who post online energy savings guides use identical language, without attribution to the original source: If you have an unfinished basement or crawlspace, check for leaks by looking for spider webs. If there is a web, there is a draft. Marc Srour, these are some explanations for indoors cobweb placement that I found on the interwebs... are all correct? Are there better explanations? Small insects breeze in the air around leaks. Insects crawl through wall gaps, and stick on webs covering them. Spiders like cold spaces.
