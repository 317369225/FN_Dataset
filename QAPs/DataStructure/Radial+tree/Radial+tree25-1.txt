Why aren't there any more super genius mathematicians like Newton, Euler or Gauss?
The latter: not as deified. So let's explore the deification: (1) Limited access - used to be physically tough to travel to see people as well as expensive. Newton and Leibnitz didn't even compare notes, after all. I'm fairly sure no one was stressed out at how to manage the plethora of meetings of various Mathematical Societies every April. (2) Limited access - far fewer people used to go to university, and massively fewer used to get advanced degrees. This means the ability to talk directly to supergeniuses and understand them as human beings was far, far lower. I was taught physics by a guy who invented the anti-proton (and received a shared Nobel Prize for it). He wrote his dissertation under Fermi. In grad school I sat and chatted with Binnig at a conference, the year after he won a (shared) Nobel for creating the STM, and thereby birthing nanotechnology. (3) Limited access - it used to be possible to claim territory. Since there were so many fewer people who studied science and math, once someone went down a path, they had that path more or less to themselves. "You mean... Einstein? The Relativity guy?" Ok, maybe a few more people worked on it than just the one; but it wasn't crowdsourced knowledge. My graduate research was first to show monolayer etching, a concept of modest importance,  advancing the idea of nanomachining (in 1989). However, I'm a nobody. I know what it is to be profoundly talented in something, but I was not so talented in science. Giant fleets of people were doing research, some of which  was useful, some not. Now in highly competitive realm of elite science and mathematical inquiry, there are so many geniuses that, well, what is so super about a supergenius?
