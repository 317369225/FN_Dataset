Is there any stock in the Indian share market which can prove to be multibagger?
There are many, while no one will know that in advance, you have go through your investing as per your plan, you will have some of them coming your way. At least that is how I have had many in my portfolio. There have been profits in the range of 300 to 1800%, while again not all the stocks you invest into will be a multibager, you have to brace with some loses too. That is the way investing goes.
