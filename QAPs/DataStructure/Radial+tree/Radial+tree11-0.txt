What is the rule of thirds law in photography?
I would complement answer from Kevin Spinks: it's a rule to help compose an image with the subject off-center. (subject - tree - centered, horizont dead center, boring composition) You divide the screen (mentally or with the aid of an on-camera grid) in 3x3 grid, and try to place subjects in the crossing points or with the lines. For example, the horizon in the low third line: (the horizon in the lower line, and the tree in the right line) (Images from Rule of Thirds) Wikipedia: Rule of thirds Take a note that, most important than using a grid, is to use the subject off-center. There's no objective evidence that the rule of thirds is superior or inferir to the golden section or any other rule of composition, and there are some kind of subjects that are better composed if dead center (subjects with strong radial simmetry, for example). It's more a sugestion than a rule.
