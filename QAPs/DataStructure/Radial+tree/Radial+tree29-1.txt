1950s:  What would a person from the 1950s think of today?
It depends on the country: while the U.S. was booming, other countries were recovering from WWII, and a few were headed into another war.  My grandparents were born in the 20s and 30s in Korea: my parents were born in the 40s and 50s. Until 1945, Korea was occupied by Japan. My grandfathers lived in the north and fled south during the split.  One grandmother was also from there.  The grandmother that was from the south was the second wife: they never said what happened to the first one. 1950-1953: a pretty nasty war. The next couple decades: effectively military dictatorship in South Korea. My father's father was always smiling.  Life evidently was very peaceful after getting through all that.
