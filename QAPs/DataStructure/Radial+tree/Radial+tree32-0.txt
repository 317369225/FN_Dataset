If the Sun's gravity is constantly pulling planets toward it, why hasn't the Earth been pulled into the Sun?
Gravity pulls the object towards the center of the planet and also provides the acceleration that forces the object to travel in a circular path.  The result being, that an object with a certain velocity will achieve stability when it is at a distance from the center of the planet where the equations balance. Force of gravity equals the centripetal force. So, An object traveling at velocity (v) will be in a stable orbit at a distance (r) from the center of the Sun. Let's put the numbers in for the Earth and Sun and see what we get. G = 6.67E-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 M = 1.989E30 kg r = 149,600,000,000 m which makes v = 29,779 m/s.  So, if the Earth is moving at that speed, it will stay in a stable orbit at 149,600,000 km. We can check to see if that velocity makes sense.  A circle has a circumference equal to 2*pi*r.  That means the Earth's orbit has a circumference of 2*pi*149,600,000,000 meter = 9.3993E11 meters.  Divide that by 29,779 m/s and we get 31,563,426 seconds.  That turns out to be 365.3 days and that's just about how long it takes the Earth to travel once around its orbit. To understand more about how the planets got there in the first place, try here: Robert Frost's answer to Why are most planet orbits in our solar system on relatively the same 2D plane? Note: The Earth's orbit isn't a perfect circle, it's slightly elliptical, but this is good enough for government work. Updated 61w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Joseph Dedrick
