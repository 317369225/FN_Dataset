Why did animals evolve to be symmetrical?
Bilateral symmetry is genetically determined. The Bilateria branched out from a distant common ancestor, as shown in this phylogenetic tree for all of Metazoa. Can you find the animals that have radial symmetry or no symmetry at all? Can you find where we fit in the far right column? We are Chordates. You can see most clearly in the embryonic stage the commonality of expression for bilateral symmetry in chordates.

All we really know is that the Bilateria are the dominant form for animal life, and that bilateral symmetry has many variations. It worked well enough for the genes to be passed on and modified through countless generations. What was the last common bilaterian ancestor, the creature to which we owe head to tail, right to left, back to front? Read the link and speculate!
