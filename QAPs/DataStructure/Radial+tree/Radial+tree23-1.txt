I'm digging a trench in my yard.  I have come across a dozen or so thick roots from a large/mature magnolia tree.  Is it okay to cut these roots?
Yikes, hope you haven't went through them yet....Basically, roots feed sections of the trees upper limbs, sever a root and it impairs the trees ability to provide nourishment to the section of tree. It takes 3-5 years, generally, for the damage to show up as dead limbs. So ...no don't cut them, find another way around.
