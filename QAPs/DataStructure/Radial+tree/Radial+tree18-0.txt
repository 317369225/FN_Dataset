Why did animals evolve to be symmetrical?
Lots of animals are not bilaterally symmetric; maybe even a majority of them.  Jellyfish, which are enormously abundant, are radially symmetrical; so are coral polyps, which are very common.  Starfish have five-fold symmetry. And so on. Even animals that appear to be bilaterally symmetrical are not nearly as tidy on the inside as they are outside.  Many organs are asymmetrical.  But many familiar animals are bilaterally symmetrical, on the outside.  Why is this?   As to why species are symmetrical at all, see the answer to this question: Is there an evolutionary explanation for the external symmetry of animal bodies?  The answers there point to movement as one major explanation.  This also helps explain bilateral symmetry: Bilateral symmetry easily gives you a head and tail, which is useful in rapid movement.  The animals you notice most often are highly mobile, and bilateral symmetry helps with that.
