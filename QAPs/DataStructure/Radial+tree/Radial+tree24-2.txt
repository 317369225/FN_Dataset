Which is the best place in India to live peacefully without much money?
In the monetised world it is difficult to live without money. You need to have some sort of income or cash reserve just for sustenance. Living peacefully, is again relative term. People can live peacefully even in a crowded metro city in a single room apartment. It depends on how you define peaceful. Cost of living is relatively less in villages and also immune to lifestyle stresses of City. So one option is to live in a village, do farming or other rural/agri related jobs and survive. If you are not used to village lifestyle , even this will be difficult after some time. Realistically speaking, there is nothing such as best place or paradise. If it is so everybody will go there. If you have a place to live, if you have a dress to wear and if you have enough food to eat, you can live peacefully anywhere.
