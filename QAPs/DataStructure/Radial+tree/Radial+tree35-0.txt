What is the biggest unknown secret in the universe?
Is P = NP? This P/NP problem is one of the major unsolved problems in computer science. We don't know the solution for this problem. We even don't know if there exist a solution for this or not. One of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the answer. Cryptography, for example, relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solution to an NP-complete problems would break most existing crypto-systems including: Public-key cryptography [RSA],a foundation for many modern security applications such as secure financial transactions over the Internet and Certificate Signing, digital signatures. Symmetric ciphers [AES/DES], used for the encryption of communication data. One-way functions cryptographic hashing functions [MD-5/SHA]. The problem of finding a pre-image that hashes to a given value must be very difficult, and ideally should require exponential time. However, if P=NP, then finding a pre-image can be done in polynomial time. This means , Now One can't do anything safe on the internet, A man in the middle finding his passwords, account numbers or any other sensitive information.There will be no reliable way to send classified information. Total havoc in communication. On the other hand, this could also revolutionize the rest of the world. Suddenly, many problems in AI would become easy. Computer-aided design would become much more powerful, as computers could quickly find the optimal design for pretty much anything.
