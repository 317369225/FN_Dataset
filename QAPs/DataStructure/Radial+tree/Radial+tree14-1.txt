Why aren't all the fingers of our hands of the same length? Is there an evolutionary explanation for this?
Comparative anatomy tells us that all hands (or forepaws) follow the same plan with the outer fingers shorter than the middle ones. The why question can be answered only speculatively; the fact that when spread out, the tips of the finger form a circle may have something to do with evolution. Flex your finger onto your palm, keeping the middle and distal phalanges straight and you would notice another reason for the difference in length; the tips rest right in front of the thenar and hypothenar eminences instead of sticking out awkwardly. Part of the reasons why the index finger looks shorter than the middle finger is in the length of their respective phalange bones but there are variations I have not seen mentioned in available literature. Look at these two pictures from Wikipedia:      Most 2nd metacarpal bones "look" longer or equal in length to the 3rd but mine is even shorter that the bone in the lower X-rays. The variants cause different configurations of the openings formed by the thumb and index finger when they wrap around a branch or a tool handle. Which configuration is more advantageous for human, I don't know. If you look at the cavity formed by the semi-flexed fingers, you can see that it has a globular instead of cylindrical shape so the hands can hold a round fruit neatly. What researchers have been spending more time on is the digit ratio, that is the ratio between the lengths various fingers, in particular that of the index (2nd) and ring (4th) fingers; they are [from Wikipedia]    Males: mean 0.947, standard deviation 0.029    Females: mean 0.965, standard deviation 0.026 And speculations is that the ratio represent the effects of the different of androgen levels on the fetuses. [from Wikipedia] Why there is this difference and why it is more marked on the right hand, nobody knows.
