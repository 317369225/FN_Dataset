I want to know everything about bikes. How do they work? What should be looked for before categorizing them into good and bad? What are cc, strokes, etc.?
If you want the whole syllabus refer to Kshitiz's answer but for a beginner all you need to know  is - 1. Two stroke bikes are old school and awesome, generate more power and are so much fun to ride eg. Yamaha Rx100,Rx135 also the indestructible Rajdoot.... But they're banned now because they pollute more. So you're stuck with 4 stroke. 2. Cubic capacity means the size of the engine, generally more cc's means more power, a bigger bike profile and a more macho engine sound eg. Royal Enfield. Remember cc and power are not linearly related, it depends on the engine manufacturer. Eg. A KTM duke 200cc develops 25 bhp  Royal Enfield 350 cc develops 20 bhp. Also more cc's mean a lower mileage. 3. Fuel injected bikes give better mileage than carburetted ones.... Though carburetted bikes are easier to modify. 4. If you're riding an old bike especially a Rajdoot or an old Bullet remember to wear shoes or the vicious back kick may cause injury.... Mostly you can kiss the skin on your heel goodbye. 5. Helmet. Helmet. Helmet. Most important part of the bike, sits on top of the riders head. 6. Trying out stunts in an open area with a helmet never kills anyone. Rash driving does. And lastly remember Four wheels move the body, two wheels move the soul.....
