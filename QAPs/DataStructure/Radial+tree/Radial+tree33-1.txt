Could it be possible that there is a relation between the rise of an embryo and the forming of the universe?
Well, first of all, you say universe in your question, but then you change it to galaxy.  I'm just going to assume you meant galaxy. No, there is no correlation between the developments of a galaxy, and the development of a human embryo.  Firstly, you state that galaxies have spiral forms, which is true, but not for all galaxies.  Take for example a starburst galaxy, which has no spiral shape.  Secondly, you state that humans have a spiral form.  I'm going to assume you mean the embryo inside the womb is curled up into a spiral.  This is just a coincidence.  Nature, very much like Beethoven, likes to use the same themes over and over again, with different variations, such as the orbit, which is used from the atomic level (sort of) to the biggest of galaxies.  The spiral is no different.  Plants have used the spiral shape for their petals because it allows for each petal to get sunlight.  Animals have used spirals for the shapes of their shells.  So the conclusion isn't that one caused the other, rather they both (embryo and galaxy) just followed the laws of nature and independently came to the same conclusion.
