Is the blood pressure constant throughout the body?
Certainly NOT constant!  Just as jumping into a swimming pool will quickly impress upon you that pressure on your ear drums becomes an issue as you 'stack' water upon yourself, so too, your feet (when standing) are seeing a marked increase in pressure compared to within your skull.        Positional pressure changes become really obvious when you pay attention, or adjust  'where' you place a blood-pressure cuff relative to the position of your heart for example. Just one inch change can generate data that puts you on the needs 'meds' , and the reason many doctors prefer to do the measurements themselves.  It's "consistentcy" in just how you do this procedure if you are doing it yourself. Consistency on the physical placement of the pressure monitor, your body position, as well as state of 'relaxation' you (consistently) adopt.     Other factors besides position: a) Chemical. Sodium salts (table salt), even a few grains can instantly raise pressure for example. Alcohol; and 'hormonal' (read: stress). Every morning before waking up there are differential changes in hormones that impact (raise!) blood pressure; (MANY adults 'stroke out' at this early AM hormonal cycle.  Meat wagon at the elderly neighbors in the AM? Give them a 50/50.) How many people 'die in their sleep from a 'bad dream' (scared to death)? -We'll never know, but it's probably MILLIONS per year! b) Nature of the pliability of the capillaries and etc., c) Nature of 'plugging' or 'filling' of your 'pipe lines' with 'plaque'. (You can greatly improve this situation with diet and exercise, or avoid it... but that's a different 'question.')
