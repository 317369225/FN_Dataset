Is it okay for a beginner to take a lot of time to implement advanced data structures such as AVL trees or 2-3 trees? Frequently asked inRecently I tried to write a program involving AVL tree and I I took a lot of time. Though solved it eventually, I got frustrated because of time I took.
TL;DR: Yes, "these things, they take time." Starting out, it doesn't matter how long they take, as long as you eventually finish them. The software industry has a bad habit of rushing things. We write buggy code too often that could be improved with 5 minutes of extra thinking, all in the name of shipping early and iterating quickly. Don't rush things. Correctness is more important than development speed. That's why it's okay to learn getting things right first and worry about finishing them quickly later.
