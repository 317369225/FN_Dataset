Is it okay for a beginner to take a lot of time to implement advanced data structures such as AVL trees or 2-3 trees? Frequently asked inRecently I tried to write a program involving AVL tree and I I took a lot of time. Though solved it eventually, I got frustrated because of time I took.
Yes, it is perfectly reasonable for it to take some time. In fact, as a professional, I find that those hard jobs take a lot of time. Ok, yes, the first pass feels like it's easy, but then I find out how many mistakes I made and then it feels like it has taken forever to get all of the bugs out. Such is the human condition: imperfect.Â  Accept it and move on.
