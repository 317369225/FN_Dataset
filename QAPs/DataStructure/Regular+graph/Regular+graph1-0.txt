Graph Theory:Â How can I prove the maximum number of 3 cycles In tournament graph T is when T is regular?
Look at the number of of [math]3[/math] cycles at each vertex. If [math]i(A)[/math] and [math]o(A)[/math] are in-degree and out-degree at [math]A[/math] , then the number of [math]3[/math] cycles containing [math]A[/math] is at most [math]i(A) \cdot o(A)[/math]. This expression is maximum when [math]i(A)[/math] and [math]o(A)[/math] are as close to each other as possible. Apply this to every vertex (then we have counted each [math]3[/math] cycles [math]3[/math] times, but this doesn't matter in this problem).
