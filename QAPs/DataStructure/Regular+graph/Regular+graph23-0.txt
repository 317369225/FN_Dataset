What are the main standard results from graph theory that have a natural extension/generalization to hypergraphs (or k-regular hypergraphs)? And which ones are no longer true?
According to Wikipedia, most standard graph theoretic results hold true inÂ  hypergraphs too. However, they make a special mention of Ramsey's theory. Also, there is a mention of how a hypergraph can be represented as a bi-partite graph However, hypergraphs are more closely related to intersecting families of sets and can be partially ordered by set inclusion. So, I think results related to partial orders, order theory will be more clearly applicable or useful as compared to visualizing them as (E,V) graphs. Hope that helps to some extent.
