What is the total number of k-regular graph on n vertices?
McKay and Wormald conjectured that the number of simple d-regular graphs of order n is asymptotically where [math]λ=d/(n−1)[/math] and [math]d=d(n)[/math] is any integer function of n with [math]1≤d≤n−2[/math] and [math]dn[/math] even. Bender and Canfield, and independently Wormald, proved this for bounded d in 1978, and Bollobás extended this to[math] d=O(logn−−−−√)[/math] in 1980. McKay and Wormald proved the conjecture in 1990-1991 for[math] min{d,n−d}=o(n1/2) [/math][1], and [math] min(d,n−d)>cn/logn [/math] for constant [math]c>2/3[/math] [2]. These remain the best results. The gap between these ranges remains unproved, though the computer says the conjecture is surely true there too. The formula apart from the [math]√2e 1/4[/math] has a simple combinatorial interpretation, and the universality of the constant [math]√2e 1/4 [/math] is an enigma crying out for an explanation. Incidentally this conjecture is for labelled regular graphs. For isomorphism classes, divide by [math] n![/math] for [math]3≤d≤n−4,[/math] since in that range almost all regular graphs have trivial automorphism groups (references on request). For [math]d=0,1,2,n−3,n−2,n−1,[/math] this isn't true. [1] Combinatorica, 11 (1991) 369-382. Page on anu.edu.au [2] European J. Combin., 11 (1990) 565-580. Page on anu.edu.au
