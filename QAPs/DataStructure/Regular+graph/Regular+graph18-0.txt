How can we make sure that some players do not make a group together and isolate an individual?
The goal is to maximize the edge-connectivity of the graph. Given a fixed number of edges, the edge connectivity is maximum for a regular graph. But a regular graph can be constructed only when [math]\frac{2e}{n}[/math] is an integer, where e is the number of edges and n is the number of nodes in the graph. So, we may have to settle for constructing a graph which is as close as possible to a regular graph. See  Graph Theory with Applications to Engineering and Computer Science for a formal proof. Here's an intuitive algorithm: Initialize the degree of each vertex to 0.For i in 1:e    Find two vertices v1,v2 with the lowest degree that are not connected to each other    Add an edge between v1 and v2    Increase the degree of v1 by 1    Increase the degree of v2 by 1 Updated 30w ago • View Upvotes
