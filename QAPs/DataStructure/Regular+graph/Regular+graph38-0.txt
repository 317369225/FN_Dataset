I want to start sketching/drafting before I do it in Photoshop or Illustrator. What should I do to get started?
Thank you for A2A. There aren't any specifics the way I see it. You should try different kinds of pencils in terms of the hardness of the lead (Hb, 2HB, 4Hb and the like) and use them on differnt kinds of papers. There is nothing better than experience as a teacher. Fool around with different pencils on different papers and you will soon come up with your own comfort zone. The make/brand of the pencil is a choice based on your budget. I still use a regular notepad (generally graph paper since it helps keep perspectives and ratios in place). You will zero in on to a pencil and kind of paper depending on the accuracy of the sketch you are trying to achieve before you touch the digital medium. For me, a normal o.5 mm pen pencil on a regular graph paper works best. I dont use a fine graph paper, one with 10mm x 10 mm squares also works great. Practice getting standard shapes right, like squares, circles, rectangles, triangles, hexagons and the like right. If you get a good handle on these, basic mock-ups become simple to illustrate. Everything that you want to sketch is possible as a combination of circles, ovals, lines, rectangles & squares. You don't need to be an artist, but you definitely need to get the basic shapes right. Try and be as accurate in your sketches as possible. Run it by other people. It is very difficult for one to judge how circular is a circle that one has drawn. There is a visual bias that our mind plays. Not so with a critic. Practice & feedback are the two pillars self-learning is pegged on. Hope this helps. Cheers.
