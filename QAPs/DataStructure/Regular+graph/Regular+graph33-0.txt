I am now 76kg my age is 21 am hitting gym for couple of weeks now I want to reduce weight to 70 to 65 what diet chart to do regularly in a day?
There's no specific chart to follow. Check out my blog My body I've already written about how to form a diet to help you lose weight. It's really about calculated how many calories you burn in a day, then making a diet that is slightly less than the number of calories you burn. If you're eating less calories than you burn, you'll lose weight. I also discuss how many, fats, carbs, proteins your diet should consist off, so as long as your macros are in proper proportions and you're eating a variety of foods, it will be healthy weight loss too. You can see my results below, I lost over 19kg in 6 months.
