I want to start sketching/drafting before I do it in Photoshop or Illustrator. What should I do to get started?
You need a notebook not less than 60GSM .... and a 6b and 2b steadler mars lumograph.. These things doesn't matter most of the time... I use uniball eye..black which creates much contrast in any type of paper ... some guys use sharpie.. IF IT DOESNT LOOK GOOD IN BLACK AND WHITE ..IT WILL STILL LOOK BAD IN COLOR... I engage in brainstorm before I start my sketching... then I chose the base colour ..it's shade and tint....and the additional colours..[not more than 2 colours]. Then I switch on the computer.... 1.more space 2.easy reading 3.nice colour.. 4.better contrast. 5.typography. 6.audience.
