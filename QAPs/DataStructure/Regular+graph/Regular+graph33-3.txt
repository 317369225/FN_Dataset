I am now 76kg my age is 21 am hitting gym for couple of weeks now I want to reduce weight to 70 to 65 what diet chart to do regularly in a day?
The first thing u have to do in order to reduce weight is make your mind in a such a way that no matter what , you should take only healthy foods and never skip exercise.Try this for your diet Early morning have some green tea with honey or luke warm water with lemon and honey. Breakfast:Cereals with almonds and walnuts.Use only skimmed milk,for sweetness add only honey. Between breakfast and lunch have another cup of green tea. Lunch:Mixed Sprouts(All kinds) or Fruit Salad with Some vegetable juice. Dinner: 3Chapathi with any veg curry with less oil and can have one glass of butter milk. Apart from diet,you have to do exercise for atleat 1 hr like jogging or cardio or yoga. I hope this may help you in some way or the other.
