Why are US budget deficits rapidly falling right now?
The deficits have fallen from the all-time high annual high of $1.515 trillion in 2009 to $642 billion in 2013.  This stunning figure was 3x the prior record high of $504 billion in 2004.  There have been incremental reductions in the last 4 years because the spending was lower and the revenue was higher as the chart below demonstrates.  Yet, this welcome improvement to $642 billion in the most recent year is still demonstrably higher than the deficits and surpluses experienced during the 15 years between 1993 and 2008.  So in short, when the deficit balloons by orders of magnitude, it is easier to show improvement in succeeding years by exercising some degree of restraint.
