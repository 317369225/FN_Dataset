What are the uses of linear algebra in theoretical computer science?
The computational and conceptual formalisms of linear algebra and numerical linear algebra - implemented in the context of data applications - bridge many gaps for researchers and engineers working on massive data sets, error-corrected coding, encryption, 3-d rendering, integer factorization, matrix factorization and other areas. As pointed out in the attached article, it’s useful to model large data sets as matrices, as the [math]m \times n[/math] real-valued matrix [math]A[/math] provides a natural structure for encoding information about [math]m[/math] objects, where each object [math]m_i[/math] is described by [math]n[/math] features.   Matrix computation is also useful in the analysis of algorithms and their solution sets, linear programming, and complexity theory where there are many interesting unresolved problems.   This article gives more insight: Page on mmds-data.org   Also I find this course/text by Philip N. Klein very insightful. Coursera
