What is your favourite area of mathematics? Why?
I'm interested in almost anything related to discrete mathematics - especially if it has some sort of algorithmic flavor. I am also interested in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. Some problems in these areas (especially extremal combinatorics) are relatively easy to state but may be extremely difficult, and they almost always require some new and interesting construction or insight of some sort to resolve them. Extremal combinatorics is also full of short, simple, highly original and extremely beautiful proofs. Who wouldn't be interested in such a branch of mathematics :)
