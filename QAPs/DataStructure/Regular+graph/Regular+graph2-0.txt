Mathematics: How to show this? If 0 <= r <= n-1 and n is even then there exists an r-regular graph of order n.
If r is even: Arrange n vertices in a circle, and connect each vertex to its r closest neighbors. [This works even if n is odd] If r is odd: Arrange n vertices in a circle, and connect each vertex to its r - 1 closest neighbors, as well as to its furthest neighbor [which will exist because n is even]. (Of course, there are all kinds of variations on this you could use which would work just as well. For example, in the odd r case, you could connect each vertex to its r furthest neighbors.)
