I am now 76kg my age is 21 am hitting gym for couple of weeks now I want to reduce weight to 70 to 65 what diet chart to do regularly in a day?
Losing weight at your young age should go well if you eat whole foods like fish, chicken, eggs and veggies. Eliminate all sugars including juices and sodas, even diet sodas. Drink plenty of water daily and eat only when you are hungry and just enough to satisfy your hunger. Eating a clean diet with whole organic foods is the best thing you can do to lose the weight. Drink lots of water everyday and that too will go a long way to helping you lose the weight. 80 to 90% of weight loss is your diet and exercise is the the other 10 to 20%. I go to the gym every week and I see the same people that are working out every day and they look the same as they did a year ago. They workout all the time but they don't see results because their diet sucks.
