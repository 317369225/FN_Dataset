What is the major contribution of Indian mathematicians to the world?
The introduction of linear algebra methods in Combinatorics, discovery of a counter example to Euler's conjecture, introduction of Strongly regular graphs, Association schemes and many important concepts/results in design theory, coding theory, graph theory and finite geometry by  R. C. Bose. Contributions to probability theory, especially the theory of large deviations by S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan, for which he won the Abel prize in 2007. PRIMES is in P by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena. Several contributions in Algebraic Geometry by S. S. Abhyankar. The work of Navin M. Singhi, S. S. Shrikhande, S.S. Sane in combinatorics and graph theory, especially in the theory of combinatorial designs and projective planes.   Harish-Chandra's contribution to Group Theory. The work of C. R. Rao and Mahalanobis in Probability Theory and Statistics. C. S. Seshadri and M. S. Narasimhan's work in algebraic and differential geometry. For example, Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem and Seshadri constant. Several contributions in number theory by Ramachandran Balasubramanian. Gross-Prasad conjectures and other work in number theory by Dipendra Prasad. Chandrashekhar Khare's proof of Serre's conjecture. Subhash Khot's work on Unique Games Conjecture. And perhaps the most famous of all, Srinivasa Ramanujan's work in number theory. Edit: I am only focussing on the contributions of Indian mathematicians to mathematics, as that is what a mathematician does. These contributions may or may not be contributions to the world under your particular meaning of "contributions to the world". Updated 16w ago • View Upvotes
