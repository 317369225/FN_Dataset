I want to start sketching/drafting before I do it in Photoshop or Illustrator. What should I do to get started?
Thanks for the A2A :) It actually depends on what you want to sketch. I suggest you get some drawing paper and HB pencils and practice a few sketches. Remember to start shading from the top to avoid smudging :) You can also see various video tutorials on YouTube to help you out. Hope this helped :)
