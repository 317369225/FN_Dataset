I am now 76kg my age is 21 am hitting gym for couple of weeks now I want to reduce weight to 70 to 65 what diet chart to do regularly in a day?
Hi Suresh - Thanks for reaching out! From a dietary perspective, eat (organic) meats, vegetables, (raw) nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no (added) sugar. Eat ONLY when hungry, and just to satisfy - NOT to stuff your face. Hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to email me at the address below. -- Peter Weintraub | Weight Loss Professor at Fitness Retriever | peter@fitnessretriever.com
