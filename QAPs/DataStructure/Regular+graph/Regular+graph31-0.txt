How can I prove the following graph theory problem?
Your family of graphs is not an expander family. One easy way to see this is to take the set of vertices [math]S = \{0,1,\dots, k, n/2, n/2+1, \dots, n/2+k\}[/math]. Then [math]|E(S, V\setminus S)| = 4[/math]; it contains the edges from 0 to [math]n-1[/math], from [math]k[/math] to [math]k+1[/math], from [math]n/2[/math] to [math]n/2-1[/math], and from [math]n/2+k[/math] to [math]n/2 + k+1[/math]. Choosing [math]k \approx n/4[/math] gives you an expansion of [math]\frac{4}{3(n/4)} = \frac{16}{3n}[/math], which goes to 0 as [math]n[/math] goes to infinity. However, if you only take prime [math]n[/math], and instead of connecting [math]x[/math] with [math]x + n/2[/math] you connect it with [math]x^{-1}[/math] (setting [math]0^{-1} = 0[/math]), this is an expander family. This is quite hard to prove; in general it is quite tricky to show that any explicit family of graphs is an expander family.
