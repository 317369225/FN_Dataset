What is the significance of Ramanujan graphs?
Ramanujan graphs are of interest as they provide the best family of explicitly known expander graphs and as their properties are similar to random regular graphs. Expander graphs are good models of communication networks as they model the smallest number of edges and the greatest connectivity. They are also of interest to number theorists as their associated Ihara zeta functions satisfy the Riemann hypothesis (see H.M. Stark, A. Terras, Zeta functions of finite graphs and coverings, Adv. Math. 121 (1996) 124 â€“165.) and as they lead to rapid confusion for the random walker.
