What is a 3-regular planar graph?
First, let's define what a planar graph is. A planar graph is a graph which can be drawn on a 2D plane such that no two edges cross each other. For example, consider the following graph: We can redraw this so that the two middle edges are not intersecting by moving vertex B under the edge that connects vertices A and D. These are both topologically the same graph, but simply drawn differently. Note that even though the above graph is drawn such that two edges are crossing, it is still planar as it can be redrawn such that they are not crossing, seen below. Next, let's define what regular means in the context of graph theory. For a graph to be regular, each vertex must have the same number of edges connected to it. For example, the graph above is 3-regular as there are three edges connected to each vertex. So, a 3-regular planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in a 2D plane with no two edges crossing such that there are three edges connected to each node.
