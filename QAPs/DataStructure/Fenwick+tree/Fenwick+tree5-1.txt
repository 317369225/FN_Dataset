CodeChef: What are some suggestions for problems where Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) / Fenwick Tree is the primary concept?I recently learned about BIT and want suggestions for problems that I may be able to solve using this concept.
From someone who works in CodeChef - Another problem which uses BIT. You can find the editorial here: DOWNLOAD - Editorial. Just to make things a tad easy for such queries, you may search for any key word (an algo or a concept) here: CodeChef Discuss and you may reach the problem from the results. It is a bit tortuous, I agree. A better problem tagging feature is coming soon. Edit: The tags are live since quite sometime now: You may search for problems of any topic here: Codechef - Tags | CodeChef Updated 15 Sep 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
