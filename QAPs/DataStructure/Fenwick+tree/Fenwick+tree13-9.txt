As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
Considering the prevalence of statistical machine learning, randomized algorithms, and scientific simulations, algorithms to efficiently sample from probability distributions could be very useful. They are often also very simple and elegant. See Darts, Dice, and Coins, and Gumbel-Max Trick (also Gumbel max trick).
