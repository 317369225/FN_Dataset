What is the most complex line of C code you have created or encountered?
Back in the day, I was an Assoicate Editor at Softdisk Publishing, the same outfit where Id Software founder John Carmack worked. Once I was given a submission to review in which the entire program had been packed into a single interation (for next) structure. We did not buy that program. The C programming language doesn't kill brain cells, dumpy-in-the-brainbox programmers who think it's cool to find out a way to do anything possible with the language kill brain cells. Computers programs should be written so as to be easily understoof by humans. This rule should be violated ONLY WHEN REQUIRED to meet functional performance specs (i.e. optimize bottlenecks). Or to paraphrase Jessica Rabbit, "C isn't bad, it's just coded that way." That said, C was a minefield in the making. Any 3GL that will happily let you try to execute video memory....(shudders)
