How should I learn advanced data structure for solving competitive problems for must needed topics (the segment tree and the Fenwick tree)?Hey , I am new to programming and I have a problem of solving advanced data structure problems . jus suggest me some ways
You have written that you are new to programming,so i will advice first try logic based and simple data structure questions and then move toÂ  advancedata structures questions. You can take a course at Advanced Data Structures(MIT OCW) for advance data structures.
