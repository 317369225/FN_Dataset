Why is there no theory on fenwick trees (Binary indexed trees)?Binary indexed trees are used in a lot of online judges questions, still I find no mention of it in any standard algorithms textbook. The only reference material that I found for studying fenwick tree is the topcoder algorithm tutorial. Why is this so? Is it not used in industry?
The original paper for binary indexed trees, "A new data structure for cumulative frequency tables", was published in 1994, so it just hasn't really had time to percolate into the major textbooks.  And they may be hot in topcoder right now, but they're still a somewhat specialized data structure.  The average college course in data structures or algorithms is only about thirteen weeks long, and there's a lot of more fundamental material that needs to be covered before you get to something like this.
