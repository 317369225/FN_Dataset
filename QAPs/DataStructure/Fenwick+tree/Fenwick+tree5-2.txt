CodeChef: What are some suggestions for problems where Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) / Fenwick Tree is the primary concept?I recently learned about BIT and want suggestions for problems that I may be able to solve using this concept.
Here are a few from SPOJ: CTRICK, KPMATRIX, MATSUM, NICEDAY, NKMOBILE, NKTEAM, RRSCHED. I'm told INCSEQ is also solved with a BIT, but I'm having a mental block right now so I'll neither confirm nor deny.
