How can we solve the following question for a full 100 points, asked in the eBay Hiring Challenge on HackerEarth?
I am the author of this problem that appeared in the eBay Hiring Challenge. This problem can be reduced to the following problem: Given a rectangular matrix, perform 2 kinds of queries: Find the sum of a range of cells. Update the value of a single cell.So, we have Range Query and Point Update operations on the given matrix. This must give you a hint that the problem could be solved by a Segment Tree or a Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree. Here, one possible solution is to build a 2D Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree and perform range query and point update on that structure. Point Update: Old value = initial value New value = Z * initial value Hence, we need to add (New value - Old value) to (x, y). -> add ( x, y, new_val - old_val) Range Query: Let sum(x, y) represent the range sum from (0, 0) to (x, y). For querying the sum of the sub-rectangle (x1, y1, x2, y2), we will have to apply inclusion-exclusion principle. Required sum: Rect(O, D) We can get that through: Rect(O, D) - Rect(O, B) - Rect(O, C) + Rect(O, A) The final result for range sum will be: -> sum(x2, y2) - sum(x1-1, y2) - sum(x2, y1-1) + sum(x1-1, y1-1) You can learn about Binary Indexed tree here: https://www.topcoder.com/communi...
