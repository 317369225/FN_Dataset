Did Brian Bi think his Google interviews were challenging?
I had two sets of technical interviews with Google: the first set was a phone screen to get my internship, and the second set was to convert to full-time at the end of my internship. I didn't think the phone screen was challenging. I did at one point admit that I probably would not be able to accurately code O(log n) binary search in a Fenwick tree, but the interviewer didn't make me try. (I'm not going to reveal what the actual problem was.) Toward the end he gave me a very difficult problem that I didn't get too far with, but I later found out that other people had also gotten that problem, and it was probably an open problem, which means the interviewer presumably didn't draw any negative conclusions from my inability to solve it. The conversion interviews were very easy.
