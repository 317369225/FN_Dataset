phoenix_2 - Codeforces This might be a lesser known fact to some. Apparently Ayush Jaggi decided to give a div2 round through this ID(even though he was in div1). That was Codeforces Round 302 and it turned out to be quite a memorable round as he got Rank 2! I guess this tells a little bit about who he is, he is the guy who sets the bar incredibly high for the rest of us but also motivates us to do better! PS: He also has a Facebook Hacker Cup T-shirt! :P
