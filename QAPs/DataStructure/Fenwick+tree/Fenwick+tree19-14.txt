What is the most complex line of C code you have created or encountered?
Answering an implied question here: In general, I strongly disdain complex lines of code.  I think the second part of my reply here provides a nice example:  Mike Kelly's answer to What was the most confounding computer program bug that ever happened to you and what in the end was its mundane or fascinating solution?   Complex lines of C, or any code, is not a mark of a top flight coder. First, make it work. Second, make it easy to read and understand.  Often you must get something working before you can really understand the problem.  Then, you can make it elegant.
