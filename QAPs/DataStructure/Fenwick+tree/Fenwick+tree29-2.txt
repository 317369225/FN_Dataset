How do I start competitive programming?
I would say, just JUMP into the sea of competitive programming. From my personal experience, I would suggest you to go for the online judge for which editorial or solutions of others are also available. It would help you to start. I myself spent many hours just to understand first few problems. But then you will find what you are supposed to do after solving 10-15 problems. If you beginner to programming, then I would say pick codechef or hackerrank. Hackerrank provides very good sections due to which you can practice various algorithms and data structures and it will be easier for you to think about the solution if you know which data structure would be useful for beginning. Then, you can move on to some other judge may be Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ), Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming, HackerEarth - Programming challenges and Developer jobs, etc. You can also choose to solve first few problems of About - Project EulerÂ  . It provides very good problems and doesn't focus on code. After solving its problems, you can go to hackerrank and there is also one coding contest of projecteuler problems. It will give you exposure to coding with the same problems in generic manner instead of solving only for constant values. Happy coding. Thanks for A2A.
