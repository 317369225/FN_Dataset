How should I learn advanced data structure for solving competitive problems for must needed topics (the segment tree and the Fenwick tree)?Hey , I am new to programming and I have a problem of solving advanced data structure problems . jus suggest me some ways
MIT OCW has two great courses Advanced Data Structures and Advanced Algorithms which talk about some very cool algorithms and data structure they run on. However, I am not a competitive programmer, so I am not sure these courses are exactly relevant for such competititons.
