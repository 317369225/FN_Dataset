What is the most complex line of C code you have created or encountered?
This one is for 8 queens. board|= (0xffULL<<(current/8)*8)| (0x0101010101010101ULL<<(current%8))| ( ((current%8-current/8)>=0)?

PS: The fact that constant negative shift isn't allowed made it twice as long as I expected and 64-bit binary operations of C is much harder than that of 8-bit's Updated 21 Oct â€¢ View Upvotes
