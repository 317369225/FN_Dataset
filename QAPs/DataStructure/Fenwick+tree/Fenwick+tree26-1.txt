How can we solve the following question for a full 100 points, asked in the eBay Hiring Challenge on HackerEarth?
Fenwick Trees/Segment Trees. I used Fenwick Trees to get a correct answer. Create a 2D array (matrix) to maintain the initial values. Create an array (size = N) of Fenwick Trees to maintain cumulative sums. Update(x, y, Z): Update matrix[x][y] by Z*matrix[x][y] - Z. Update the Fenwick Tree x using y as index with an update of Z*matrix[x][y]-Z. Query(x1, y1, x2, y2): For x1th to x2th Fenwick Trees query the cumulative sum between y1 and y2 and add them. Return the sum. Use long long int to avoid overflows. Can provide code if required.
