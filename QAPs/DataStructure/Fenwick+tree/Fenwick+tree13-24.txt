As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
The topics which I would like to see in the new edition of the book:- Add, Kirchhoff's matrix free theorem that provides the number of spanning tree in a graph. Transitive closure and its reduction which is used to represent a graph with as few edges as possible that has the same reachability relation as the given graph And, Matching and Independent Set. Please consider removing linear programming, This is just in the gist you have mentioned new edition can't be longer.
