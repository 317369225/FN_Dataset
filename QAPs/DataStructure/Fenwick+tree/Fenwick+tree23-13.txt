What all basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
Originally Answered: What are the algorithms I should learn for competitive programming?Its not necessary to learn all of them or a particular list of algorithms, but you should be able to design your own algorithms on the basis of other algorithms, because in competitive programming what matters is your approach towards the problem. Thus, I recommend getting a thorough knowledge and analytical ability in applying and developing algorithms. You could refer standard books on this and Youtube lectures from Stanford university could help too. Thanks for A2A.
