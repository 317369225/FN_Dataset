How should I learn advanced data structure for solving competitive problems for must needed topics (the segment tree and the Fenwick tree)?Hey , I am new to programming and I have a problem of solving advanced data structure problems . jus suggest me some ways
As far as advanced data structures are concerned like Segment trees or Fenwick trees I would suggest two sources to start with Lecture Videos | Advanced Data Structures | Electrical Engineering and Computer Science | MIT OpenCourseWare Data Science Tutorials (These are algorithm tutorials on TopCoder) These are excellent sources to get the basics for these problems right. However, as you very well know that just knowing the concepts is never enough as far as Competitive Programming is concerned. So you need to practice a lot. An extra effort is needed for these data structure based problems because they are hard to code and to come up with an optimal solution during a contest will take a lot of problem solving. So get on with it. Happy Coding !!
