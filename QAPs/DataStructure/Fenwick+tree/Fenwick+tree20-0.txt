What are the real time applications of Binary Indexed tree(BIT)?I learnt Binary Indexed Tree aka Fenwick Tree. I wonder how Fenwick came up with this beautiful idea of using bits to store cumulative sum. I would like to know if Binary Indexed Tree has any practical applications or anyone using it for a real time application ?
Fenwick tree and segment tree are very powerful data structures, but you will seldom see them alone in a real life applications. They are always used to implement other algorithms efficiently. For instance, BIT is used to implement the Arithmetic coding algorithm. Also, if you do not know segment trees, try to learn them. They are more powerful and usable in more applications than BIT and as efficient as the BIT in querying and updating.
