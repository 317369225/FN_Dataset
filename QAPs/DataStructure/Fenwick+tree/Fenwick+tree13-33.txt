As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
I do believe CLRS should keep its fantastic features such as subject orientation, great ideas for practical use,etc. I think you'd better consider something beyond worst case analysis. Introducing how sufficiently we can work with ,for instance, those NP-problems that have already been implemented in industry. regarding for ex. Competitive analysis in Online problems. I believe wost case is rare in reality and its better have another tools for algorithm analysis.
