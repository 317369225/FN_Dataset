What are the real time applications of Binary Indexed tree(BIT)?I learnt Binary Indexed Tree aka Fenwick Tree. I wonder how Fenwick came up with this beautiful idea of using bits to store cumulative sum. I would like to know if Binary Indexed Tree has any practical applications or anyone using it for a real time application ?
I had an exchange of emails with Peter Fenwick about 2.5 years ago. Mostly I asked him about a paper he had written about Fibonacci numbers, but I also brought up the BIT data structure and this is what he wrote: ... in my recent work I have largely abandoned it, at least for the PPM compression that has been my interest. For contexts with small alphabets (ie most) it is faster to have a simple serial-search structure and it uses much less memory.Â  The large-population contexts are relatively infrequent so the serial-search time is no problem.
