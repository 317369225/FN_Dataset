How should I learn advanced data structure for solving competitive problems for must needed topics (the segment tree and the Fenwick tree)?Hey , I am new to programming and I have a problem of solving advanced data structure problems . jus suggest me some ways
Thanks for A2A. One way to do so is to keep solving problems and if problem demands the use of some new data structure, learn it at once. Probably this the best way as suggested by many veteran programmers. You can refer this: Data Structures and Algorithms for getting different sources of learning. Read editorials of problems, you will get useful links there too.
