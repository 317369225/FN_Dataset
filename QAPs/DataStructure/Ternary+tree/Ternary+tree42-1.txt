What are different ways I can enhance my knowledge, skills, build my personality (1st year at MAIT), so I can secure a good job. What are some books and coding competitions that can help me in building my skills?
This is my first answer on Quora,  and probably too late. But still there are few things you should know since you mentioned Microsoft and coding. First,  Microsoft has 3 units the IDC, IT and GD. Google it,  you'll get to know about them. IDC is the core developing unit,  and the one which comes to our college is GD ( Global Delivery). GD requires an all round personality like Arushi mentioned.  IDC is hardcore coding,  they take a mcq round and coding round for selecting students for interview(which also involves 3-4 rounds)  which is very hard to crack. GD is mcq and interview, easier than IDC.  They look for smart people for GD. But,  for IDC intern they look for very good data structure knowledge and coding skills. IDC is not an option in this college. Coming to coding, Cormen is the bible.  Start competitive programming right now.  Even in classes you can't learn some necessary data structures like interval trees,  segment trees,  trie etc. And let me point out that,  coding and competitive programming are not the only way to get in top companies so please dont do it for the sake of it.
