I am a college student and I am studying computer science. I want to become a good programmer (software). What should I learn?
As shevendra said, start reading up on data structures, algorithms, and run time complexity. You can learn as many languages as you'd like, but there are only a few common data structures shared between them all. This holds true for algorithms and runtime complexity as well. You could be an excellent programmer, but if you don't understand how long it takes your program to run (runtime complexity) or how to implement a binary search properly (algorithms), then your programs will fall short in reusability and effectiveness. That being said, learn a staticly typed language first (java, c++), so you can develop good programming habits. Many people will say to start with Python or the like, but these languages are dynamically typed, and can lead to bad programming habits in the future. Having a good amount of mathematics under your belt doesn't hurt either, but isn't as much a worry as the other two IMO. How much math you need to know depends on what you want to do. Game development, for example, requires heavy math, vs web development for instance which usually does not. tl;dr: learn the basics of data structures, algorithms and runtime complexity. Learn a staticly typed language. Brush up on necessary math skills based on what you'd like to do in the future.
