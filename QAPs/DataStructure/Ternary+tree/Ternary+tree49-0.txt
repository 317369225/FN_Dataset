What CS topics should a self-taught front-end developer be learning to become a good fullstack developer?
Thanks for the A2A! I'll echo Daniel H Chang; while web development is made up of a lot of different CS concepts you're not likely to use most of them yourself. I would highly recommend you practice algorithms and get familiar with the common data structures (linked list, graph, binary search tree, hash table); you will likely call upon these skills in an interview environment. The majority of the CS you will be using as a front-end developer for application development involves: variable assignment (learn how to create defaults with ||) conditionals (be hip and learn some ternary as well) while/for loops (or, better yet, .forEach, .map, .filter, and .reduce) writing functions (learn closure scope, learn about 'this') async functions (because you'll likely write some flavor of AJAX) recursive functions (learn when to use them instead of loops) arrays and objects (learn when to use each)The majority of those are taught in the first two semesters of computer science (assuming no previous experience). After you understand those concepts well enough, move on to the remainder of the web-oriented skills that Daniel listed and you'll be pretty competent as a front-end engineer.
