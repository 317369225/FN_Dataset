Is two months enough to get well-versed in competitive programming?
Yes and No. Yes because you can improve a lot in these 2 months. No, because that shouldn't ideally be enough for you, as your goal should be to keep the learning curve increasing even beyond those 2 months. Devote 8-10 hours daily, smartly, in these 2 months. If you want a structured breakdown of how you should practice, then you should use search feature, there are many questions already answered by brilliant competitive programmers. I'm giving some pointers although, use them wisely, don't let them become dangling pointers: 1. Saurabh Kumar Mishra's answer to How do I use TopCoder efficiently? 2. How should I practice so that I will be at a level where I can approach TopCoder's Div1-500 problems with confidence? 3. Pradeep George Mathias' answer to What is needed to become good algorithmist like top rankers in Topcoder/Spoj/GCJ?
