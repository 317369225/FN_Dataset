Is it a good idea for a first-year algorithm student to implement some of the data structures (binary search tree, etc.) by myself to understand them better?
YES. [Update 1]:Â  Justification : There are two main key reason why implementing this will help. Learning by doing: You will learn the key data structures and also the programming language you are using to implement. I have seen many people who can explain the data structure but struggled whey they need to code them in their own language. Best possible implementations to compare: You can download the source code for your programming language and verify the implementations provided by great programmer. For Java, you can download the source code and look into the code how these are implemented. In simple words, implementing these data structures on our own is one of the best possible way to become a better programmer. One other way is, take any real word project or a game, implement on your own. Hope this is useful.
