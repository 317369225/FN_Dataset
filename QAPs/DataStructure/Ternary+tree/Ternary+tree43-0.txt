What is a ternary search?
Hi, A ternary search is basically a technique in computer science for finding the minimum or maximum of a function that is either strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing or vice versa. Suppose that you have a domain. You divide that domain into 3 parts(first thirds, second thirds, last thirds). A ternary search determines either that the minimum or maximum cannot be in the first thirds of the domain or that it cannot be in the last thirds of the domain, then repeats on the remaining two-thirds. A ternary search is an example of Divide and conquer algorithms. A textbook definition would be like this : a 3-way tree where every node's left subtree has keys less than the node's key, every middle subtree has keys equal to the node's key, and every right subtree has keys greater than the node's key. If the key is a multikey (string, array, list, etc.), the middle subtree organizes by the next subkey (character, array or list item, etc.) (even i didn't grasp anything on first read). Sample Algorithm :- function ternarySearch(f, left, right, absolutePrecision) //left and right are the current bounds; the maximum is between them         if (right-left < absolutePrecision)         return (left+right)/2     leftThird := (left*2+right)/3     rightThird := (left+right*2)/3         if (f(leftThird) < f(rightThird))                 return ternarySearch(f, leftThird, right, absolutePrecision)         else                 return ternarySearch(f, left, rightThird, absolutePrecision) end I hope this answers the question.
