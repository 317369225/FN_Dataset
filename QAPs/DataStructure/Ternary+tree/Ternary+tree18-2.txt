I am a college student and I am studying computer science. I want to become a good programmer (software). What should I learn?
Program program program.  You don't learn how to cook by studying nutrition. Algorithms and data structures are something that you learn the basics of during school and the advanced topics naturally as needed. You should focus on programming little projects whenever you feel particularly inspired.  Use whatever language gets the job done. You will get more and more practice over time and one day you will realize that one of your small projects has become much bigger than you anticipated.  You're on the road to becoming a great programmer.
