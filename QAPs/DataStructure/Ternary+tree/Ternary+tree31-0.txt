Do big tech companies give a chance to freshers (new grad or entry level) who have failed some subjects and hence have taken an extra semester or year to complete their course/degree?
I don't know of any official policies, but I can tell you it took me 7 years to get my bachelors. I spent 3.5 in other majors at another school before I settled into CS. I also had my share of rough semesters, and had to take a couple summer classes to finish when I did. My overall GPA was not very impressive in the end. Despite all of that, I never had trouble finding work as a developer. Then, almost a year ago (~2 years after graduating) a Google recruiter called me out of the blue and brought me in for interviews. I guess they liked what they saw, because I had an offer within a couple of weeks. TL;DR: You're education is important, so don't intentionally slack off, but you can still have a successful career, even if you weren't necessarily a stellar student.
