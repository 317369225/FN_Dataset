When should I begin competitive programming and is it possible for a beginner?
I would suggest that you first learn data structures and algorithms, particularly complexity of algorithms. Once you have a necessary foundation in that, then you should jump right in. Regarding the mathematics, whatever you learn in algorithms should suffice. Competitive programming rarely requires things like probability theory or calculus, but discrete mathematics, combinatorics, number theory, etc. are very important. Over and above C++, yu should also learn STL before competitive programming.
