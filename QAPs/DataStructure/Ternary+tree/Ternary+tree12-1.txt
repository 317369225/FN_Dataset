What are good side projects to get better at data structures and algorithms?
Data structure and algorithms are an important part in studying programming. However, when you work in programming you see that all that was already implemented in most frameworks. Since they are so useful, most languages has libraries for most of them already. Most programmers never have to implement a queue or a sorting algorithms. Those that implement them, usually do that since they face unusual constraints. So, if you want to get the feel of their real world use than you really should use them, not to implement them. I cannot think of a specific recommendation but this is since they are so common that most software is using them. However, if you want to get better in algorithms and data structures, I think you'll benefit more form impelmenting them. If you want to learn how is programming in the real world, you indeed try contributing to open source project but this is a different story.
