Do big tech companies give a chance to freshers (new grad or entry level) who have failed some subjects and hence have taken an extra semester or year to complete their course/degree?
If you can solve a dynamic programming problem in air, if you can write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and can reduce it to O(log n) and subsequently to O(1) [if possible], if you use Ternary Search Trees or Suffix Arrays for solving many of your string problems etc. than you don't even require a formal degree to work in those companies. I have worked for one of the above and I had a couple of guys in my team who were XII pass outs with less than 70% but they were super brilliant in solving algorithmic problems (irrespective of domain).
