What are some neglected but important topics in Computer Science?
Are you thinking of topics that are not part of degree programmes in computer science, or are you thinking of areas of research that do not get the attention that they deserve? In the former case, there can be no good answer – the focus of a degree programme is highly dependent on the research interests of the local computer science department and on local traditions. For instance, the degree programme that I am involved in does not teach topics in areas such as computational geometry and logic programming – but that does not mean that these are unimportant topics in computer science. In the latter case, this is quite subjective, only for different reasons. Some research topics that were considered highly important in the past have received less attention in recent years.  Have a look at the survey paper An Evolution of Computer Science Research or the ACM paper Trends in Computer Science Research.
