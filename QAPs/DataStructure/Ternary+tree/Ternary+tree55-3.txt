What would a computer do in this situation (see details)?
Of course it depends on the computer's programming! The computer will do whatever the program instructs it to do. Computers are machines, they follow programs and do nothing more. Designers of chess programs actually think about questions like yours. The traditional chess engine is programmed to play in a "minimax" style, that is, it plays under the assumption that the human opponent plays optimally. In the case of your example, that would mean that the program chooses to enter stalemate. But it is certainly interesting for designers of chess programs to try and analyse play styles of individual opponents, exploiting any weaknesses in a particular player's style. So if the program has such a provision, it may decide that against some particular opponent, there is a good chance of winning by playing the riskier move. There are also efforts to construct chess programs that play more like a real human, in order to make them more fun to play with. Playing a traditional chess program sometimes feel like a Kafka novel, where you don't know what you did wrong and yet you're being slowly crushed to death by a long sequence of boring moves. But also in these more humanlike chess engines, there is no magic! It is just programmers telling the computer how to weigh one move against another.
