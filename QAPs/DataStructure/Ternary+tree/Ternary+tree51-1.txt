How do I prepare for IIIT-H lateral entry?
I would like to share my $0.02 on this. I hope that if you already know about Lateral entry program at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) then you must have visited the following link. Lateral Entry after Second Year BE (or) B.Tech in CSE/IT/ECE 2013 It contains the syllabus and exam format in detail. I am also adding it in answer. Computer Science: Objective Exam (120 minutes): General Aptitude Discrete Mathematics CS Subjects: Above topics for descriptive + General Subject Knowledge. Descriptive Exam (60 minutes): Digital Logic; Computer Organization; Programming; Data Structures. For head start you can start with the relevant topics preparation on the lines of GATE CSE exam. The entrance objective question paper would be similar to GATE CSE. 1) For descriptive exam practice, practice and practice. Practice to solve problems in the steps. 2) Practice general data structures and algorithms related problems on paper in timed fashion. 10 minutes for a medium difficulty level problem is a good measure considering your knowledge, experience and maturity about the topics under discussion. 3) For programming part, they would ask the questions where the code would be of maximum 25-30 lines if written properly. Try to code on paper for practice. Study general engineering maths and discrete mathematics topics completely. For general aptitude Practice R.S.Agrawal books. Please A2A to any current BTech or Lateral Entry Student of Check IIIT-H admission forums on IIIT Hyderabad or FB for more info.
