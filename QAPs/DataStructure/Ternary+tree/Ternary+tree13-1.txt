Which data structure is used by samsung swype keypad?
While Tries are suitable for this problem to a certain extent of prediction, Tries can not effectively provide autocorrection which is also an important feature of such applications.... I have presented an answer based on BK TreeÂ  + Ternary Search Tree for a similar problem which can also be extended to suit the needs of this application... Please check it out on Page on stackoverflow.com... In Short ... it involves a Ternary Search Tree ( similar to a trie but more space efficient ) for auto completion and BK - Tree which is used for finding the closest match when an exact match is not found ( in case of spelling mistake ) .... it internally uses a concept called Levenshtein Distance for this purpose..
