What is the Big-Theta bound of A*?
I'm not sure A* search has a big-theta bound in general, as its behavior depends substantially on the heuristic function. With a trivial heuristic, A* reduces to Dijkstra's algorithm, which is O(E + VlogV) if we implement it using the right data structures. (Here E and V are the number of edges and vertices in our search space, respectively.) If we assume our search space is a tree and that there is only one goal state, the number of nodes expanded will be polynomial in the length of the optimal path. If we additionally assume our tree is binary, ternary, or n-ary for some n, we can derive a sharper bound. Updated 247w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
