How PHP7 will turn out for PHP?
There are a lot! 1. Anonymous classes: rfc:anonymous_classes.  They allow you to create a class and a new instance of it in a single expression. 2. Null coalesce operator: rfc:isset_ternary.  Works kind of like the ternary operator with an isset check as the conditional. 3. Abstract syntax tree: rfc:abstract_syntax_tree.  A complete change to the way in which PHP is interpreted allowing for a greater amount of flexibility and the possible introduction of a just in time compiler in the future.  Without a JIT compiler, PHP 7 is already about twice as fast as PHP5 and on par with Facebook's PHP interpreter (which is JIT compiled).  Adding a JIT compiler would make PHP7 even faster. Also the ones Christophe mentioned and more.
