How do I start competitive programming?
Surely i would say that start with PRACTICE rather than jumping directly on to CONTESTS. Now from where to start practice and what to practice first : Before going to what to practice i would like to say pick up any Algorithm,learn it thoroughly ,search for  problems online  and then implement them.(Once you grab the logic then move on to next algo and so on). Start practicing basic algorithms like brute force,ad-hoc,implementation,simple math,searching and sortings( these algo's  for confidence boosting, Now move to next level). Here comes most interesting,challenging and widely popular DP(dynamic programing).Do as many problems as you can. Also there are some others,which i have not mentioned Greedy,bitwise,geometry. Now the next level or toughest part :P (which i have faced but if you practice and learn,surely if will be easy for you).Graph Theory.(start with ) bfs  and  dfs. Scc(strong connected components). Maxflow. Practice: I suggest   Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ). it have good quality problems,atleast you do 200-250 problems of all domains and then move to contests. Contests: https://www.codechef.com/ (long challenge(10 days) is good,you  may  learn some good algorithms,also cook off(2.50 hr) and lunch time(3.0 hr)). Codeforces  (it will have 4-5 monthly short contests ). After Acquiring enough knowledge and speed,now move to topcoder  (its got SRM's to make you Advanced level coder). Here's a link of Important Data Structures and Algorithms.(Data Structures and Algorithms ). Good bye and Enjoy coding :)
