Should one do programming without having knowledge of data structures and algorithms? How can it be helpful?
Not at all helpful. Data structures is like the heart of programming according to me. You have to know it to even write some simple code. So, if u dunno it then learn it. If you use arrays also, u r using data structures. It's that important. Got it..?
