How can I implement an English dictionary?
Hi, it's a great project to start with. So let us get down to how you would go implementing it. If you intend to you Python or any HLL, they have a data structure like Dictionaries, Hash Maps built into it. These DS maps a key to a value and that is what you want. Now, these DS are internally implemented as TRIES, which makes it easier to find the key. The implementation used would be standard, efficient and also fast. So it would make more sense to use these DS rather than implementing your own. Next is loading the text file that contains the words. As you mentioned, you will use a text file which will store a word and its meaning in each line. In order to have both in the same line you would have to use a delimiter so that your program can differentiate between word and meaning. So each of your line could be something like this: WORD##MEANING, where ## is a delimiter. All you have to do is, read the file, parse it into KEY->VALUE pairs for each line, store it in the above mentioned DS. Now when the user searches for a word, all you have to do is find the value corresponding to that key. NOTE: You can use a JSON file to store the word as a key value pair itself. All you need is a Json parser, for which you can use a json library
