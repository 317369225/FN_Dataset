What are some neglected but important topics in Computer Science?
IT'S NOT A TOPIC BUT , COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING IS MUST FOR EVERY CSE STUDENT. Some topics are not neglected like Data Structures and Algorithms and basic C and C++ concepts, but i have seen that profs don't teach us these subject as they should ! You should understand every basic concept of trees, graphs, linked list and other data structures like tries , suffix trees , ternary search trees and many more , so anytime you can code any algorithm of these topics ! And C programming concepts specially from "Dennis Ritchie" , that's very important. Apart from academics you should also have some knowledge about "development" field. Software , website , android apps or iOS apps anything, but you should have knowledge , because ultimately you are gonna be a developer so develop that skill too !
