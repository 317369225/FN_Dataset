Other than binary search, are there other code examples that have a running time of O(log n)?
Yes, there are a lot of other algorithms: balanced search tree routines priority queue routines segment tree routines heavy-light decomposition routines binary power algorithm euclidean algorithm ternary search everything related to binary jumps: starting from static RMQ's ending with LCA'sand, I bet, a lot more*. *listed algorithms is a random set of examples that came to my mind. They are unique ones in the sense that there is no, at least, reasonable way to reduce one of them to the other. However there is a lot of applications of these algorithms starting from "inverse ring element" ending with "in-or-out point query on a convex polygon" that inherit logarithmic complexity.
