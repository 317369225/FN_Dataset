Do big tech companies give a chance to freshers (new grad or entry level) who have failed some subjects and hence have taken an extra semester or year to complete their course/degree?
If you have enough talent to crack their interview then you don't have to worry about your academics. Btw,Â  I doubt whether IBM will fit in that list. No offense though :)
