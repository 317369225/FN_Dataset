What data structure does Google use to implement the "Did you mean" feature?
No one really knows how Google exactly do this or maybe I have not done enough home work. But the most obvious and efficient approach talked about in papers is about a data structure called Ternary Search trees. TST- ternary search trees are more space efficient as compared to usual Tries. Lets look at one sample TST : Each node is like the node in BST, where its left child represents value less than the root, right child is the one with value more than root and the node exactly descending from it has value equal to next character in the word. Empty nodes are sentinel nodes to mark the end of word. So when you misspelled a word, it looks for words in adjacent nodes. Like in above example if spelled word is READC, it will suggest you asking did you mean "READS". There are still many more factors to be considered but I guess this should get the wheel rolling.
