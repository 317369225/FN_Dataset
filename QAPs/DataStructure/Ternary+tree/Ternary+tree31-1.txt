Do big tech companies give a chance to freshers (new grad or entry level) who have failed some subjects and hence have taken an extra semester or year to complete their course/degree?
I failed many courses (including core cs courses) in my undergrad as a cs major. I graduated with a C- average after all that. Even after all those failures uptil now I have worked for Facebook, and amazon and I am going to start at Microsoft this month. Alright here are some more details: I joined the CS program at my university back in 2009. First semester went okay, but then in the 2nd semester I failed my 1st course and my average dropped to a 60.  At this point I was really reconsidering my decision to go into CS. After thinking about it for a while I realized that I loved programming and building things. I just wasn't any good at proofs and the theoretical aspects of mathematics, being bad at these led me to be pretty terrible at giving exams, hence the bad marks. After realizing this I decided I was gonna tough it out and get my degree. It wasn't easy and I almost got kicked out a few times but I somehow managed to pull through till graduation. My degree is also on a co-op based system, due to my bad marks I didn't get any good jobs in my first 3 work terms. So I decided that I was gonna do what I loved and started building my own apps and putting them on my resume. Then all of a sudden everything changed! I started getting interviews from all the big companies. I ended up at Amazon for my next term, and then at Facebook, and finally at Microsoft for full time. These companies almost never asked me about my marks but focused mostly on my projects and problem solving skills. So again I don't think you need great marks to get a job at any of the big companies. You just need passion for what you do! Updated 78w ago • View Upvotes
