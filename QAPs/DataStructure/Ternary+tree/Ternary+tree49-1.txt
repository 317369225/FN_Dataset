What CS topics should a self-taught front-end developer be learning to become a good fullstack developer?
I'm going to say something likely unpopular, but the extent of data structures and algorithms necessary for 98.5% of web development are as follows: lists hashtables / dictionaries for loopsYou can go through rigorous academic courses but at the end of the day you won't retain anything relevant to actual development.  If you want to become a good full stack developer you should focus on these: MVC paradigm / design pattern.  This is your entire front end.  I recommend AngularJS for its HTML injection which is conceptually natural for use with the HTML DOM hierarchy. Javascript, especially quirky bits like callbacks and promises SQL databases and the theory thereof Database / server security, e.g., handling SQL injections Learning to use libraries instead of writing your own code.I would skip the courses and start building full stack web applications.  You'll learn the important things as you go, most of which are practical.
