What are the most successful pharmaceutical drugs of biological origin?
There are a few I found:   Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) => originally derived from Salix alba (white willow) [1] Digoxin => originally derived from Digitalis lanta (foxglove plant) [2] Rivastigmine => originally derived from the Calabar bean of the plant Physostigma venenosum [3] Galantamine => the bulb of a daffodil (NL: bloem van een narcis) [4] Several laxatives contain parts of the Senna Alexandrina plant [5] Morfine => from the Papaver somniverum plant Penicillin => from a yeast Several antimalaria medications => from the Quina tree, hence the name quinine (NL: kinine) [6] Insulin => originally derived from animals [7] Vaccines Atroprine => from the Atropa belladonna plant Bromhexine (Bisolvon) => originally derived from the plant adhatoda vasica (Acanthacea)   References   1.
