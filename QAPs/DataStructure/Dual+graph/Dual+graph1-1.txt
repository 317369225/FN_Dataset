What is your favorite example of duality in math?
I go for simple things.  Duality in a projective plane. The axioms for a projective plane are simple.  You've got things called points, and things called lines.  Each pair of points determines a unique line, and each pair of lines determine a unique point.  You also usually throw in nontriviality axioms such as on any line there are at least three distinct points, and there are three noncollinear points. A dual of a statement is what you get if you interchange points and lines.  You'll prove, for instance, the duals of the nontriviality axioms.  Then it follows that the dual of every theorem in projective geometry is also a theorem.                 Pappus' configuration in a projective plane. Pappus' configuration is a self-dual configuration of points and lines.  There are 9 groups of 3 lines meeting at 9 points, and there are 9 groups of 3 points lying on 9 lines.
