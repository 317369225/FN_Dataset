What is your favorite example of duality in math?
The dual Banach spaces [math]\{ \mathcal{L}^p(\mathbb{R}), \mathcal{L}^q(\mathbb{R}) \},\forall \ p> 1, \tfrac{1}{p} + \tfrac{1}{q} = 1.[/math] These are spaces of functions which when raised to the [math] p [/math] power, and integrated over the real line, the area remains finite. The "Banach" part isn't so important, so if interested read the wiki link below.  Suppose you have a function [math] f(x) \in \mathcal{L}^p [/math] and another [math] g(x) \in \mathcal{L}^q[/math] where [math] q [/math] is said to be the Holder conjugate of [math] p. [/math] Duality comes in when computing the integral of their product, or when viewed as a functional on the function [math] f (x),[/math] [math] \lambda_g (f) := \int f(x) g(x) dx. [/math] By Holder's inequality, this integral is bounded. A linear functional is an action that has functions as input. It satisfies linearity [math] \lambda(\alpha f_1(x) + \beta f_2(x) ) = \alpha \lambda(f_1(x)) + \beta \lambda(f_2(x)), [/math] for all constants [math] \alpha, \beta [/math] and functions [math] f_1(x), f_2(x) \in \mathcal{L}^p. [/math] We say that [math] \lambda \in (\mathcal{L}^p)^* [/math], the dual space. A deep theorem says that all such functionals are classified as integrating against a function in the dual space. Namely, if you have a linear functional, there exists a function in [math] \mathcal{L}^q [/math] such that [math] \lambda_g (f) := \int f(x) g(x) dx. [/math] The converse is true as well. For every element in [math]g(x) \in \mathcal{L}^q, [/math] there exists a linear functional in the dual space that represents this element.  See Lp space for more details.
