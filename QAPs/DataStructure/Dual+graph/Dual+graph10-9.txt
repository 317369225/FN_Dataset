Can you give me some examples about the dual graph? For example,Cycles and dipoles:The unique planar embedding of a cycle graph divides the plane into only two regions, the inside and outside of the cycle, by the Jordan curve theorem. However, in an n-cycle, these two regions are separated from each other by n different edges. Therefore, the dual graph of the n-cycle is a multigraph with two vertices (dual to the regions), connected to each other by n dual edges. Such a graph is called a dipole graph. Conversely, the dual to an n-edge dipole graph is an n-cycle.
