What does an array mean in C?Arrays are useful data structures that often show up when it would be convenient to have one name for a group of variables of the same type that can be accessed by a numerical index. You can make an array out of any data-type including structures. One way to visualize an array is like this: [][][][][][] Each of the bracket pairs is a slot in the array, and you can store information in slot--the information stored in the array is called an element of the array. It is very much as though you have a group of variables lined up side by side. Let's look at the syntax for declaring an array : int examplearray[100]; /* This declares an array */ This would make an integer array with 100 slots (the places in which values of an array are stored). To access a specific part element of the array, you merely put the array name and, in brackets, an index number. This corresponds to a specific element of the array. The one trick is that the first index number, and thus the first element, is zero, and the last is the number of elements minus one. The indices for a 100 element array range from 0 to 99. Be careful not to "walk off the end" of the array by trying to access element 100!
