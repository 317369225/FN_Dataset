In C programming, how do I replace a sequence in an array?Personally, I'd use strncmp() rather than going about it yourself for the comparisons... However, conceptually, it's rather simple, just change the first element, and use an inner loop to scoot all the elements afterwards down two spaces: pathtoroom[i] = 's'; memmove(pathtoroom+i+1, pathtoroom+i+3, strlen(pathtoroom)-i-2); ... also note that you have an out-of-bounds error in your loop that you need to take care of. 577 Views  View Upvotes
