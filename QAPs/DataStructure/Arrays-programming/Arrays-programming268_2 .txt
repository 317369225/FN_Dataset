In C programming, how do I replace a sequence in an array?I would suggest using a temporary variable to store everything while processing and then finally copy back in your original variable! Moreover i guess than you want to remove 'l','u','l' and place a 's' instead... So, i made a bit of more change to incorporate this and also to avoid segmentation fault i changed the looping indices... Also, i guess 'j' will not be needed anymore (cause it was only checking which characters to not consider)... I would suggest using : . int pathsize = strlen(pathroom); //Calculated once so as to speed up things a bit char* temppath = malloc(sizeof(char)*pathsize); int k=0; for (i = 0; i < (pathsize-2); i++){  if(pathtoroom[i] == 'l' && pathtoroom[i+1] == 'u' && pathtoroom[i+2] == 'l'){  temppath[k] = 's';  i+=2; //Just make sure to skip the next 2 characters  optimizeCount++; //counts how many times I replaced 'l', 'u', 'l' with 's'  }  else  {  temppath[k]=pathroom[i];  }  ++k; //number of characters stored till now  }  temppath[k]='\0';  strcpy(pathtoroom,temppath); //copy the path back to original variable 227 Views  View Upvotes
