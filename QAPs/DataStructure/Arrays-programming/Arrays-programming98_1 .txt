Is array [5000] [5000] possible?I tried this in Perl, Although There are no multidimensional array in perl but we can use it like this and I was able to access and print whole array ref. #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; use warnings;  use Data::Dumper;  my @arr1 = (1..5000); my @arr2 = (1..5000); my $arrRef = [ \@arr1, \@arr2, ];  # Prints Whole Array print Dumper($arrRef); An array in Perl can have any number of "dimensions" and it does not need to form a "regular" shape. Each element can have an internal array. And each element of the internal array can have its own internal array and so on. meaning @arr1 and @arr2 could be an array of array and so on. Is that what you were looking for or something else? 103 Views  View Upvotes
