What are some ways Arrays are used in Java projects?Have you seen this function signature like this: public void foo(final String... args){ ... } ? String… args is equals to String[] args So you can invoke foo using two syntax construction: First final String[] args = new String[10]; foo(args); Second foo("x", "y", "z"); There’s just syntax difference and nothing else. Both of arguements are arrays. This is widely used in methods with unknown number of arguments because syntax is pretty good. In projects: If you want to run some process from java you wrap it’s arguments to array final ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("whoami", "-a", "-b", "--whatever"); ArrayList probably is most used collection. Not a big surprise - it’s an array inside. Interprocess I/O and sockets communication is reading and writing streams. Streams are read by blocks in byte arrays. final byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; final int available = myInputStream.available(); myInputStream.read(buffer, 0, Math.min(buffer.size(), available)); And all java applications definitely have public static void main(final String[] args) { ... } 292 Views · View Upvotes
