What is the need of array variables?I think you meant to ask “What is the need of an array versus primitive variables?” Here’s something to ponder (in Visual Basic): Dim n1 As Integer = 10 Dim n2 As Integer = 20 Dim n3 As Integer = 30 Dim n4 As Integer = 40 Dim n5 As Integer = 50 Dim n6 As Integer = 60 Dim n7 As Integer = 70 Dim n8 As Integer = 80 Dim n9 As Integer = 90 Dim n10 As Integer = 100 Compare the lines above to this single line: Dim numbers() As Integer = {10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100} Or consider this code in JavaScript (most loosely-typed languages): var n1 = 10; var n2 = 20; var n3 = 30; var n4 = 40; var n5 = 50; var n6 = 60; var n7 = 70; var n8 = 80; var fruit = "Apple"; var divisible = function(){return 6/3}; And compare the above to this: var ary = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,"Apple",function(){return 6/3}] Now, imagine you have 100 or 1000 variables (elements) just to store some values. Which do you prefer? This is just one of the many reasons to use Array. Hope this helps. Happy coding! 43 Views
