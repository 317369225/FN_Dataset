How can one access specific values within an array?In JS, if every zip code in the US were formatted as: var zipCodes= ([{"ZIP": 10001, "LAT": 40.750633, "LNG": -73.997177 }, etc]) How can one access the LAT or LNG value after the user inputs the ZIP value? Edit: Forgot to state that it’s in javascript. *facepalm*firstly, your variable zipCodes is an array that has objects as its elements. you have to iterate through the array first and then through each object in your array till you find your desired match. var zipCodes= [{"ZIP": 10001, "LAT": 40.750633, "LNG": -73.997177 }]; var i,obj,index,lat; for (i = 0; i < zipCodes.length; i++) { obj = zipCodes[i] ; for(index in obj) { //the trick here is to find the object key:value pair that has the value of the Zip code you are interested in //assuming your value comes from an input box; if(obj[index] === document.getElementById("someId").value){ //asign your lat or lng to a variable to capture what it is for later use. lat = obj["LAT"]; } } } my answer is in javascripts and it assumes you’d be manually inputting your match in this case ZIP. but from an input box it becomes the value from the input as such: var match = document.getElementById(“someId”).value 135 Views · View Upvotes
