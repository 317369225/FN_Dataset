How do I accept 10 numbers and arrange in ascending/descending order without using arrays in Java?There are two basic alternatives to using an array. Use a binary search tree. (This has the advantage that you can list the numbers in either ascending or descending order by doing the appropriate in-order traversal). Use a linked list and sort the numbers - either as they are entered or after all of the numbers have been entered. (See also Gregory Schoenmakers' answer to How can I implement recursive insertion sort using linked list?). 283 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Easwer Sai Jagadish
