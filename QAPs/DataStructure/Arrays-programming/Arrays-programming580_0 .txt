How can I store a table as time series in which particular column of table has a an array as entry?I want to create a timeseries from the data I've recorded from some sensors. Data is in the form of table with several columns. One particular column is array of values. Example: Data1 Data2 Data3 1.2 1.5 0.45, 0.345, 0.73 1.4 1.7 0.4, NaN, 023 How can I create timeseries from such data?This is a bad idea, and it's been recognized as a bad idea for at least four decades. Go read up on normalization in the context of databases, and you'll see examples of how to store this sort of data properly. 250 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Rahul Kumar Bhadani
