How can I avoid writing all the possibilities of the two-dimensional array?Your code snippet appears to be C#. Additionally, your code snippet is attempting to initialize the array twice. Once using 12.6 Array initializers (although your syntax is a bit off), and again using a nested loop. If your only intention is to have the array full of zeroes, I have good news for you: neither of these is required. C# will automatically initialize any allocated array with the default value for the type (12.2 Array creation). In the case of int, the default value is 0. int [,] worldmap = new int[255, 1023]; Boom, array full of zeroes. 176 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Hal Quinney
