I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.Problem is with the for statement of the block : for(i=n; i>=0; i-1) {  printf("%d\n",a[i]); } It initializes i to n and then it will come in print statement and it will print a[n], but as the array is 0 index based, a[n] will be some garbage value (values will be from a[0] to a[n-1]). That is why it is printing some random value. Secondly the part of the loop i-1 will lead this to fall in an in-finite loop because the condition i>=0 will always be true because the for statement is not decreasing the value of i. So the correct statement can be like this : for(i=n-1; i>=0; i--) Lastly, it will not reverse the array ( it will just print the array in reverse order) Also this C program will give an error because of the declaration of array after the scanf statement. 112 Views  View Upvotes
