When should I use arrays instead of a database?Arrays are temporary data structures living in the computer's memory. A database table is a permanent structure, stored on the disk of the computer (or server in the case of a web application). You never really use arrays "instead of" a database. Most of the time, you'll use both together. A pretty common scenario is to load a set of objects from a database into an array or array-like structure, and work on that array. The only case you use an array and not a database is when you either don't save the data at all (if it just has temporary data that you don't mind losing), or you save it in some other way, like in a file. 218 Views  View Upvotes
