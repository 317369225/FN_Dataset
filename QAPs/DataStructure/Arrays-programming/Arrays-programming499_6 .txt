What is difference between array of character and string?Originally Answered: What is the difference between character array and string? A character array is simply an array of characters A string is data structure that uses an array of characters Some string representations use a null-terminator (like C), others use a length prefix How will you do addition of 2 character array ? char a[10],b[10],c[20]; for(i=0;i<10;i++) { c[i]=a[i]; } for(j=0;j<10;j++) { c[i]=b[j]; i++; //This was simplest way i could think } How will you do addition of 2 strings ? string a="hello",b=" world",c; c=a+b; So with string the way you performs addition also gets changed Thanks for A2A 45 Views  Answer requested by Mehul Jain
