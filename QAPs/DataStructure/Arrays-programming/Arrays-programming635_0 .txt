How do I findout a prime number using arrays?U do not require an array, u could just run a loop and keep on checking if that particular number is prime. Although I guess, u are talking about Sieve of Eratosthenes. If u are concerned about the time complexity of your solution or if u have to find all prime numbers below 10^6 then a boolean array will be necessary! http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sie... - An extremely well explained solution! 98 Views
