How do you remove the last element of an array in c++?Assuming that you use a variable like numElements to keep track of how many elements are stored in the array, you would just decrement this variable (ie --numElements;). If you want to change the maximum size of the array you could use realloc() but this is C. I believe that in C++, std::vector handles this behind the scenes for you. 279 Views
