How do I deal with a coded Array/ rowtype using SQL?Having an array/string like { |7|37|38|36|42|43|50|51|44|45|39|29|18| } I want to associate this codes back to plaintext stored in another table. Is there a method using arrays again or should I decompose the string in his elements and associating them after?Methods: 1. Decomposing in the same table Decomposing the string in his elements and adding a new filed for each element in the array. Them replacing each code by the plaintext using the related table. Problem: The table became to big to work with. Don't do it! 2. Creating a new permanent table Create a new table related to the original table. then outsource the array in a table and decompose it there. Advantage: the table of origin don't grows and everything remains overseeable. 3. Creating a temporary table using a procedure Works fine, but difficult to make. 4. Creating a plaintext string and adding the content in a new field Perhaps there are more methods - I'm only a db-Fan, not an Expert. 93 Views
