Why do we use functions rather than arrays?Function and arrays are different things, meant and used for different purposes. An array is a collection of many similar type of data under one name where as function is a block of code written to do a specific thing. Functions are useful to reuse the code, make it shorter, avoid redundancy and to improve performance. E.g. In a program if you need to find square of 3 numbers, its better to use a function, which eliminates the need to write the code for squaring three times, rather works fine on writing the same code just once, and calling it whenever and wherever required. Array can be used to store large number of data together. Example, marks of 30 students in the class. It would be tedious to create 30 variables like mark1, mark2,â€¦ mark 30, so instead we can use an array under the name mark and containing enough memory to hold marks of 30 students. Also arrays makes many functions easier when combined with loops and conditions. Lastly I am a Programming newbie, hence I have no idea how can we use array in place of function or vice versa, but if I am wrong, please correct me :) 47 Views
