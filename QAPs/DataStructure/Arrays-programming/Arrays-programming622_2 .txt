Int a [n] is this a valid declaration of array in c ie the subscript is not a number?Yes this is a valid declaration. Try this online on any ide: int n,a[n]; This will compile successfully, because compiler inserted random number inside the array declaration. However this is not recommended way of allocating memory. Indeed you should specify a fixed number (either a literal or a constant) as the size of array. C and C++ allow users to attempt such procedures. Java doesn't allow you to specify non-final variable or non-literals inside array declaration. 129 Views  Answer requested by Ritika Mittal
