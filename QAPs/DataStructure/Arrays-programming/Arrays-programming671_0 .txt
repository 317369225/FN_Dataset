Can we find if the array does not contain a majority element in almost constant time?Yes, if we are willing to accept a nontrivial probability of error in our answer. Randomly sample 300 (or 100, or 500) elements of the array.  If this sample does not have a majority element, answer "no".  Otherwise answer "yes". The cost of the sampling and majority-counting operating is O(1), with a very large constant factor.  But it consumes about the same amount of time whether the array has 100, 1000, or 1000000 elements.  (Assuming a uniform-access model, anyway.) The hard part is figuring out how likely you are to be wrong.  Let's look at an edge case as an example (consult your local statistician for the general formulas.)  Suppose we have a million elements and the majority is just 500,001.  Let's use a sample size of 100.  Then the probability that our sample contains at least 51 of the majority is equal to 1 - the cumulative distribution function up to 50 of the Binomial distribution with p = 0.500001 (1−F(50;100,500001/1000000)  1−F(50;100,500001/1000000) ) which is about 46%.  You will do better if the majority is not so close to 50%. 224 Views · View Upvotes
