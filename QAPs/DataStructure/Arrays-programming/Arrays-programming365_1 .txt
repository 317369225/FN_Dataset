Is there a way return an array from recursion?I have done recursion that returns one value like factorial, fibonacci number. But is there a way to return an array(list) of the values the recursion goes through. If possible can someone give an example code?You could return the reference to the array created in the function . But there is a catch . Normal arrays created inside a function have a scope only inside the function . So if you return the array pointer , the address location might be invalid .The solution ? Create the array dynamically and return the pointer . 99 Views  View Upvotes
