Why does C++ Primer say using compiler to count the number of array elements is a bad method?For example, short things[]={1,5,3,8}; This sentence does not explicitly declare the number of array elements. The author says that the compiler will count the number and this is a terrible declaration, because method the compiler count the number is different from what you think.C++ Primer says nothing of the sort. On this subject, it says, in 3.5.1 "Defining and Initializing Built-In Arrays" We can list initialize the elements in an array. When we do so, we can omit the dimension. If we omit the dimension, the compiler infers it from the number of initializers. If we specify a dimension, the number of initializers must not exceed the specified size. int a2[] = {0, 1, 2}; // an array of dimension 3 The line you've shown is from C++ Primer Plus, which is not a good book to begin with, and we can only guess why the author wrote this. 2.5k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
