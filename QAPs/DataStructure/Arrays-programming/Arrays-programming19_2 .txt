How can I find the index of an element in an array in C?For example, if I have an array with 1000 elements with all the first 1000 prime numbers but is stored in an unsorted way. Is there any way to find the index of a particular prime number without searching through the whole array for the element?Since it has already been stated that nothing is known about the position of particular values in the array and also that there is no known relationship amongst the elements (aside from the unuseful fact that they are all prime numbers) then the only method available is to search. One usually simply starts at the first element and proceeds until a match is found—or you might try some scheme of guessing—-either way it will take an average of 500 guesses to find a match: assuming that it is present. If one needs to find all matches (or if the candidate is simply not there) then all 1000 elements must be inspected. 183 Views · View Upvotes
