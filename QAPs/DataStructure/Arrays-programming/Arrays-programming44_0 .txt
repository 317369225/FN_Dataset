How can I write a program in Java to reverse an array using recursion using 2 parameters 1 being the array and the other an integer?Use the integer as an index of the array. If that integer passes the half-way index return, otherwise swap the element at that index with the element at the array length - that index. Incriment the index and recurse. 87 Views
