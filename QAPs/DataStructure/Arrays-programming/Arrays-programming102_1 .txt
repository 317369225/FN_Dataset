How can I find which number appears the maximum time in an array?Given size of array n, find the number p which appears the maximum time in an array. eg. n = 5 a[n] = {2,3,2,3,2} p = 2There are two ways you can do it with respect to time and space complexity. 1. Create map caintais key-value pair having key as number and value is no of times it occurs in given array, After creation of map you may iterate it one more time to find maximum value. Using this method you have time complexity O(n) Space complexity is O(n), because we need to create map. 2. We may sort array first and iterate it once again to find maximum occurence of number, Here for sorting time complexity will be O(nLogn) and space complexity is O(1). Happy finding :) 69 Views
