What do you call the following Arrays in Java?int[][] scores = { {1,2,3,4} , {2,3,4,5} }; Should I say scores[0] points to an array object which holds 4 elements or Should I say scores[0] points to primitive array? I other words, Does scores[0] points to array object?This is a multidimensional array. Scores[0] points to an array object. It is an array of the primitive int type. Make what you will of that. 269 Views  View Upvotes
