In Python - how can I write a loop that will print a value from a column of an array if another value same array different column matches a value?What you can (or should) do depends on the assumptions we can make about the problem. For example, a nave implementation will most likely be sufficient for any small matrix, but if the matrix is very big that might not work. Perhaps you can't even load the whole thing in one go! Other assumptions we can make is that you know the size of the matrix, that the matrix isn't sparse, and so on. If we assume a fairly simple situation, i.e, a regular 2d matrix that's limited in size, you just need to loop over all the potential things to print and check whether or not you should print them. The question is vague on the actual criteria (what is it you're trying to do, actually?), but printing each value in an arbitrary column if the value is the same as in the neighbouring column can be done as follows: # "matrix" is a 2D matrix for row in range(NUM_ROWS): if matrix[row][0] == matrix[row][1]: print matrix[row][0] This just loops over all rows in the matrix, and if the value in the first column is the same as in the second column, it prints that value. Edit: Added after some discussion in comments. In order to reduce an array to a single number, you can use functions like min, max, sum, etcetera. If the values in the array are themselves arrays, you will need to reduce those as well to a single number. The easiest way to do this is via generator expressions. A generator expression looks much like list comprehension but without square brackets. Unlike list comprehension, a generator expression is generated one at a time. It doesn't actually create the full list in memory and then sum it up. array = [[1, "Monday", 3], [2, "Tuesday", 0], [5, "Wednesday", 3]] print sum(d[0] for d in array if d[2]==3) sum( GetStuff(subarray) for subarray in array if CheckStuff(subarray) ) Line 1 creates an array of sub-arrays. Line 2 then computes the sum of the first number of the sub-arrays, but only if the last number is exactly 3. Line 3 shows a more generic example of how you might do that. 290 Views
