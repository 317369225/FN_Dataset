Can we sort an array by multiplying each element of the array with some special number?Any comparison-based sorting algorithm has a lower bound of at least O(nlogn)  O(nlog⁡n) steps, where n  n is the length of the list to be sorted. An algorithm that simply multiplies each element in the list by a specific number uses  O(n)  O(n) steps. So this sense, the answer is no. There is quite a bit of work on integer sorting algorithms and there are algorithms that have lower time complexity than comparison-based algorithms have, but none of them work in the way that you suggest. A well-known integer sorting algorithm is radix sort that uses O(nb)  O(nb) steps for numbers written in base b  b . Moreover, as others have pointed out, a sorting algorithm must return the same sorted list for different permutations of the same set of elements. This cannot be the case if you simply multiply all elements by some given factor. 232 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
