I have a bunch of NSArrays storing strings. Where is the best place to put them?Thanks for the A2A. Again, I'm assuming you want your NSArrays to preserve their contents across launches of your app (a.k.a. persistence). If so, your main three options are: 1: a .plist, which is just an customized XML file made to work with Cocoa objects. There is one such file built in to iOS that you access with the NSUserDefaults class. You can also create your own .plist files, as described by Saquib. 2: Core Data. This is a very powerful object-oriented data management framework in iOS that has a bit of learning curve and is probably not the best fit for storing a few arrays. 3: CloudKit. This is another data management framework in iOS. However, this one syncs all of its data over iCloud (useful if, for example, you're building both an iPhone and iPad app and you want your users to see the same data on any device). As a consequence, it responds mostly using blocks (closures in swift) and has a noticeable latency. You will usually want to have local persistence as well in case the device has no network connection. There are other ways of achieving persistence in iOS, but I'd say these are the three most common. Hope that helps! 87 Views
