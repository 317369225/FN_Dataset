How do you empty the contents of an array?Something like 'Array.clear()' in javaDepends on the language. If it is fully object oriented, and Array is actually a type, then most common uses of that type should be catered for by the designers of the object model with a method. If an appropriate method doesn't exist, then you are down to a loop, clearing references or initialising primitives etc or as illustrated above, blowing it away and starting again. 122 Views  View Upvotes
