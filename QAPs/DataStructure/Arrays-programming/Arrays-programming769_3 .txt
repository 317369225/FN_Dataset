How do I write a C program that reads one array elements of size n, and then separates these elements into two different arrays, one having odd numbers only and the other one having even numbers only?Let input be our input array. Even be the array having even numbers. Odd be the name of the array having odd numbers. for i = 0 to n - 1 if input[i] % 2 == 0 ++even_count; else ++odd_count; malloc of even_count size for Even array malloc of odd_count size for Odd array for i = 0 to n - 1 if input[i] % 2 == 0 even[eindex] = input[i] ++eindex; else odd[oindex] = input[i] ++oindex;  Hope this helps. 1.4k Views  View Upvotes
