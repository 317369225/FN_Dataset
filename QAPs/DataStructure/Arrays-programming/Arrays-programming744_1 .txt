What is the difference between multi-dimensional arrays in Java vs. C?Java arrays have "extra" information such as their length which C arrays do not. C arrays are guaranteed to be contiguous which Java arrays are not. I think the differences are deeply bound in the differences in the languages. In C you use memory addresses but they are hidden from you in Java. Java you trust the compiler to get memory access correct, in C it's up to the programmer but the programmer has greater control as a result. 1.3k Views  View Upvotes
