How is an array of vectors in C++ stored in memory?A std::vector object typically contains a few words: a start pointer, a size value or end pointer, and a capacity value or end-of-allocated-storage pointer. So in an array of vectors, you would have these std::vector objects laid out one after another contiguously. But the actual memory managed by those vectors, the internal arrays where the elements are stored, would not necessarily be contiguous with the array or each other, though each is contiguous in itself. The array of vectors is therefore much like an array of pointers to arrays, where each pointer is separately allocated. 1k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
