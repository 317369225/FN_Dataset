How do I accept 10 numbers and arrange in ascending/descending order without using arrays in Java?If you don't want to use an array then I assume that you want to print the numbers in ascending/descending order. If you do this manually by comparing each variable with all others then it would be a nightmare without using an array as you don't have any indexes to work with but only variable names. If the only rule is that you can't use an array then, I suggest you use a data structure like linked list and sort the linked list. you 689 Views
