How do you know when to use .add or .put to add to an array in Java?In a Java Collection, the add() method adds an object to the collection. It applies to all collections including ArrayList. Add takes one argument which must be of the type of objects in the collection. A put() method exists for Collections that implement Map, it takes two arguments, the first of the type of the Key of the Map and the second of the type of the Value of the Map. Maps also have an add() method, but it is not commonly used because its one argument must be a Map.Entry object containing a pair of references to a Key and a Value object, and it is much easier to use put(key,value) instead. 143 Views
