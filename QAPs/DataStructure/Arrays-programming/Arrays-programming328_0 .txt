How can one access specific values within an array?In JS, if every zip code in the US were formatted as: var zipCodes= ([{"ZIP": 10001, "LAT": 40.750633, "LNG": -73.997177 }, etc]) How can one access the LAT or LNG value after the user inputs the ZIP value? Edit: Forgot to state that itâ€™s in javascript. *facepalm*To access an array element in JavaScript, you would make the statement: var firstArrayElement = array[0]; It looks like your zipCodes var above resembles that of an object, instead of an array. Objects are declared as such: var myObject = {propertyOne:"value1", propertyTwo: "value2", propertyThree : 3}; I think Vikas below has an ideal solution in creating a HashMap, and here is an article to give you an idea on how to replicate a HashMap in JS: JavaScript Hashmap Equivalent 137 Views  View Upvotes
