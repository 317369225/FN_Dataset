How do you access each element of an array by using only pointers in C?First of all, the second print statement doesn't increase anything, it just prints a value from memory. Second of all, *arr is the value under the pointer, so (*arr)++ means "take the value arr points to and increment it by one". That's where the incrementation is happening. If you wanted to move the pointer to the next element of the array you’d need to increment the pointer itself, like so: arr++. Problem is - you can’t modify this pointer, as it is an array. You have two options: you can either create a separate pointer that you will increment, or you can simply read out the value from under arr+1. int arr[] = {2, 8, 4, 9}, *p; printf("%d\n", *arr); // will print out 2   // Option 1: another pointer p = arr; p++; printf("%d\n", *p); // will print out 8   // Option 2: read the value from the next position directly printf("%d\n", *(arr+1)); // will print out 8 108 Views
