I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.I must say you are getting a weird output all because of Logical Error in your code at line no 15 in the for loop because the value of i is not changing it remains constant as at the loop runs , for getting the desired output you need to use either - -i , i- - or i-=1; It will update the value of i and 2nd mistake is that you are taking input in the array from 0 to n-1 but you are printing from n to 0 , at position a[n] there is garbage value so use n-1 in line 15 not n Correct Syntax for(i=n-1;i>=0;i-=1) for better understanding for loop in C 140 Views  View Upvotes
