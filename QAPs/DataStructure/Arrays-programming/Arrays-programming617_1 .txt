Can I get some example programs that are done using Array of structures?When you say array, I presume you really mean array and not dynamically allocated memory and pointers. If so, I've seen a few uses. For instance, state machines, limited but (hopefully) fast allocator, pre-calculated lookup tables, etc. Example, when I worked for a copmpany (That Shall Not Be named) making mobile platforms. In the DSP part of the WCDMA L1 software, someone rolled their own allocator for signals using an array of structs. This was a part of the code where only a limited number of signal structs would ever be allocated, so an array of a size to handle worst case scenario + some safety margin sufficed. For dynamic chunks of structs, that's a bit more common I think. Several examples have already been given in previous answers. En extra example may be reading a MDL (MDL file format specifications (Quake's models)) file (Old stuff, I know). Once you've rfead the header you'll know how many vertices, triangles, frames (for keyframe animation), etc you need space, for and can allocate accordingly.
