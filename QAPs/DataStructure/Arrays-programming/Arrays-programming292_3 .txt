What are the differences between arrays and linked lists?Originally Answered: What is the exact difference between array and linked list?An array is a group of data structures that is stored as a contiguous piece of memory, e.g. Memory locations 100, 101, 102, 103, and so on. While it can be managed dynamically, it's usually cumbersome to edit an array w.r.t. memory usage. Linked lists on the other hand consist of a node, which itself contains a pointer to another node. These nodes are not stored contiguously. e.g. 100, 150, 234, 557, 108, 72, and so on. These are much easier to dynamically manipulate. 1.5k Views  View Upvotes
