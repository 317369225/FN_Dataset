Is there a way to read an array of letters and recognise a pattern in Python?I want to write a programm which can look at a list of letters, ["a","b","c"] and then matches each letter to list item in a list of numbers eg [1,2,3]. And then by using some sort of prediction, it predicts the number which matches to a letter I add to the first list so if I add "d" it predicts 4From your question I guess you are only taking the difference between two elements into consideration in both the lists. So basically you need to find the ratio of difference of the two consecutive characters in the first list to the difference of the two consecutive integers in the second list: I guess this should do the trick for you: char_list = ['y', 'x'] int_list = [1, 3] input_char = 'z' # input character ratio = (int_list[1] - int_list[0])/(ord(char_list[1]) - ord(char_list[0])) predict_int = (ord(input_char)- ord(char_list[0]))*(ratio) + int_list[0] print predict_int Lemme know if that worked for you. 235 Views  View Upvotes
