How can I write a code with 2 loops for this question?You have two problems: 1) What is wrong in your program? 2) How to fix it? So, naturally, you first need to find the bug in your code. Have you any clue? This is a very good exercise, and you should learn how to debug your own code. Try for instance with shorter arrays, e.g. {5, 6, 7, 5}. What does it output? Clearly, the output is a subset of the original array. Figure out *which* of the four numbers in the input are getting printed. Does the first '5' get printed? Does the last '5' get printed? You should be able to deduce that just by examining the output and comparing with how your program works. Now go back and think about the program requirements. Should it print the first '5'? Should it print the last '5'? Then go back to the program and examine your loops and try to figure out *exactly* what your loops are doing, and why it behaves the way it does. If you've still not found your bug (I'm still only talking about step 1, locating the bug. Never mind fixing it, at least not yet), then perhaps add a print inside the inner loop where you print out exactly *which* elements are being compared. This will give you a hint. Now, all the above you need to learn to do by yourself! This is still only step 1. The second step is much harder. You've now realised *what* it is your program *is* doing, and that it is not the intended behaviour. Figuring out what to do to get it working, that's the tough one. This is a good place to ask for help, but only *after* you've figured out, why your program is buggy. 2.7k Views  View Upvotes
