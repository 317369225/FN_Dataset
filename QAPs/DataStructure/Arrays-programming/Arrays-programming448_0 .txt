Is array [5000] [5000] possible?When you use C language or C++ local objects are normally allocated on the stack. If you are trying to allocate a very large array on the stack, more than the stack can handle, then you might get an error called stackoverflow. You get this error because, the array is too big to fit in your program's stack address space. If you want to avoid this error then do not allocate it locally on stack, use some other place to declare instead. This can be achieved by either making the object global (uses data segment for storage) or allocating it on the heap (using pointers). If you allocate such type of large arrays on the heap then it works fine. To do this you can use pointers and dynamic memory allocation techniques to create such arrays. But remember that this will require you to free the memory taken by the array. This example will throw an error, because it is declared locally which means it will use stack: #include<stdio.h> void main() { int a[5000][5000]; //uses stack printf("Hello"); } If we move that array declaration outside main i.e., we make it global so it will not use stack for storing instead it will use data segment and it works fine. #include<stdio.h> int a[5000][5000]; //uses heap void main() { printf("Hello"); } 151 Views  View Upvotes
