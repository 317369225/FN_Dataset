How do you clone an array that is indexed in an ArrayList of arrays in Java in Sam Hill?I am not sure, whether I got it right or not. You are asking: Clone an array that is indexed in an ArrayList of arrays. Does it mean: ArrayList elements are also Array? And you want to copy one of those Array by Index? If I got you right then Use the index to reference the Array and call the clone() method on it to get a shallow copy of the Array. 103 Views  Answer requested by Eduardo Dominguez
