How do I find next greater element for every element in an array?The Next greater Element for an element y is the first greater element on the right side of y in array.this is one of the standard algorithms that we perform using stack ! for every element { : check if there exist elements smaller than current one in the stack from top  : if yes then the current element will be solution for those smaller elements so pop them till this condition is true. :insert the current element in stack } as every element is pushed and popped only once , complexity becomes O(N) 144 Views
