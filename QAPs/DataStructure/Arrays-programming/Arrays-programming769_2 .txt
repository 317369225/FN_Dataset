How do I write a C program that reads one array elements of size n, and then separates these elements into two different arrays, one having odd numbers only and the other one having even numbers only?1. Put a for loop for n numbers. 2. Initialize the indexes for both arrays to 0. 3. Put a sub if loop to check if the current number is even or odd. 4. If the number is odd, add the number to first array increase the index. 5. If number is even, add the number to other array. 6. Let the loop run for all. 630 Views
