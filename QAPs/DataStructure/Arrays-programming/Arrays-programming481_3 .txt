How can I append a number into a java array?In python, you just use ".append" to append a number to a list, is there such method in java. Also, you declare the number of elements in the array. When you add a number, it will show an error.The other answers solve your problem, but I want to note an important difference here: Python lists are not arrays! They are objects with a lot of nice methods. The recommended Java ArrayList is the analogous structure. It's also an object with a lot of nice methods. Java arrays are "primitive" values. They're super-simple, and as such, lack the nice methods of ArrayList. The primitive-nonprimitive distinction does not exist in Python in the same way. What ArrayList is doing under the hood is allocating new, longer arrays whenever its underlying array runs out of space. It allocates these new arrays in a smart way (technically: its method guarantees "amortized linear time" for append) and thus doesn't incur a big performance penalty if used correctly. 193 Views  View Upvotes
