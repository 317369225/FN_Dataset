Are arrays of arrays possible in C?I am aware that multidimensional arrays are possible, but what I need to do is pass a sub-array into another function. For example: if A=[1 2]  [3 4] I need to be able to pass [1 2] or [1 ; 3] (semicolon means new row) as an array into a function.You can do that using the concept of a double pointer. You can create two arrays, say A and B, and then create another array C whose first and second elements are address of A and address of B respectively. You might want to look up dynamic allocation of two dimensional arrays in C. Basically,you'll first create two arrays and then another 'array of arrays'. Like the one shown in this link -> Programming, Numerical Computation and FOSS Hope this helps..XD 125 Views
