I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.In second for section use it instead of your section to get proper results : for(i=(n-1); i>=0; i—) { printf("%d\n", a[i]); } In this case “ i ” must be initialized to (n-1) because the array size in “n” and we are initializing array from 0th index to (n-1) index.Decreasing the counter as i - - will print elements of array in reverse order. 35 Views
