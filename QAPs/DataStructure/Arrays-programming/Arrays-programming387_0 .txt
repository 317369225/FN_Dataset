How do you assign values from structure to array in C?This code is not nearly complete. I assume rep->prodNumRep is the size of the array and that inputProd grabs a pointer to an element of the same type as each elements of the rep->productsRep array. Then I suppose those elements are atomic (either the pointers themselves or int/float/char or variants thereof) otherwise line 6 would be an issue. Nothing in the code you provided helps giving the issue. I’d like to see the definition of both arr and rep, as well as the function inputProd. 301 Views · View Upvotes
