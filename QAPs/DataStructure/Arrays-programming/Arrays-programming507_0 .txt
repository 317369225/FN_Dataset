Why do I find multidimensional arrays hard to use?I'm a beginner at programming,I am learning C++, and I find multidimensional arrays really hard to use and extremely confusing, for example I've been trying for about 3 days now to make a connect 4 game with them, and I still can't do it, why is that? Everybody else seems to do just fine with them?Multidimensional arrays are just fancy single dimension arrays. Want proof? In a 2d array: (length of each row * row number) + (current column position). It returns a conversion from x,y coordinates to linear selection. 3d arrays work the same too, except the conversion gets more complex. Increase dimensions, it's still mathematically possible to convert it to a linear series. Keep in mind, your syntax is as such in C to declare an array is like this: int array[5][5]; With this, the left most bracket is your row, or Y coordinate, selector. The rightmost is your column or X selector. It is backwards of your typical Cartesian coordinate you likely learned in algebra. If it helps, draw out your data structure to help visualize how the data is organized. Do this until your mind is trained to view arrays as such. If and when you learn about the implementation of more advanced data structures, this method will likely be necessary to help you understand what's happening 57 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
