Computer Programming: What approach should I use for level creation in a "match 3" game?I'm trying to create a "match 3" game. What should I use for level creation? a multidimensional array? or should I go for a procedural approach, perhaps a looping approach or a random algorithm?It depends. If your "match 3" game has few "cells" like you can count them under 100 cells. And assuming you are using a regular computer from nowadays with enough RAM, then yes, you can safely use a multidimensional array. The risk when using multidimensional arrays is to get a stack overflow error. This happens when you allocate to much memory from the ammount assigned to your program. Which shouldn't happen if your cell count is low. However, it also depends on what you are storing in your cells. If each of your cells contains some bytes of data, i.e. your objects are not that big. Then it is not a problem, but if you have few cells, but your objects are way too big, then you should use another approach. Also, if your elements repeat, e.g. you have a "candy" game where each cell is a candy, then don't repeat the candies, just store in your cells pointers to a single set of the different candies. Nowadays, computers come with lots of RAM, so in ptinciple a multidimensional array shouldn't be a problem. But be aware that your computer is running other routines and optimizing your memory use is a well-invested effort. Consider a procedural approach if you exceed hundreds of cells, your objects are way too big, or your objects are one-of-a-kind. 425 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
