How do I define a method that gets every possible combination of two arrays in Ruby?a = ["a","b"] b = ["c","d"] c = ["ac","ad","bc","bd"] #This is what I wantYou don't need to! The Array class has the product method which works like this: > a.product b => [["a", "c"], ["a", "d"], ["b", "c"], ["b", "d"]] If you want the products joined, you can run the results through the join method: > a.product(b).map(&:join) => ["ac", "ad", "bc", "bd"] But if you absolutely must reinvent the wheel (not recommended, since the native product method was written in C and is therefore pretty quick), here's what you can do: > a.map { |el_a| b.map { |el_b| "#{el_a}#{el_b}" } }.flatten => ["ac", "ad", "bc", "bd"] 220 Views  View Upvotes
