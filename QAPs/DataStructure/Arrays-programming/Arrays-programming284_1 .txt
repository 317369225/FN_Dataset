How can I swap two strings within an array of strings (2D array) without using an additional string?You can use the trick you did for swapping two integers without using a third variable, ie; Swap (a, b) => a = a + b, b = a - b, a = a - b; Suppose, you have a 2-D character array: str [2][N] Run a loop (0 <= i < min (strlen (str[0]), strlen (str[1]))), and do the following for each character: str [0][i] = str [0][i] + str [1][i]; str [1][i] = str [0][i] - str [1][i]; str [0][i] = str [0][i] - str [1][i]; If the given strings aren't equal, directly assign the excess characters of the larger string to the smaller one and terminate the larger string with a null character at the appropriate position. You can also use xor in place of '+' and '-' . Using xor is a better option, as bit manipulations being closer to the system are often the fastest. The above actions takes place with respect to their ASCII values. 1.3k Views  View Upvotes
