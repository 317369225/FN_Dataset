What is the difference between an array and a variable?variable is any variable like in maths say x,y,z,a,abc etc. It is declared as int a, int b and so on telling it is int(integer) type. An array is collection of variable who have same name and they are identified with help of index Explanation: int a; int b[100]; float c; float d[100]; Now in line 1 I declared a variable a. So you call 'a' it is same that one variable. In line 2: I declared 100 variables with same name b and they are different as b[0] is element 1, b[1] is element 2 and so on.. and this b[1],b[0]...b[99] is all type of int(integer) In line 3 I declared a float variable In line 4 I declared 100 float variables with same name i.e. d and these are differently identified as d[0],d[1],d[2]...d[99] 569 Views
