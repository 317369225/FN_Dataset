What is the space complexity of an ArrayList containing references to TreeNodes?when i look into the Tree node constructor i hope u mean u wanna create tree node of size 5 ...it also depends are u doing any memory intensive job in the constructor but i assume not so u create root note which is 0(1). next link creating arryList is also O(1) or equivalent to space for TreeNode ...array list do u have some additional space but we can ignore that , interesting stuff happened when u add (root) n times....so means memory representation becomes [TreeNode,TreeNode,TreeNode....] making it to keep grow when n increases ....forcing array to keep increasing space so its ~= n*O(1) .better to say 0(n) 164 Views
