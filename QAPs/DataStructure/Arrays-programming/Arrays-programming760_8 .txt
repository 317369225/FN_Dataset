What are the differences between arrays and linked lists?Well everyone has said about this!! 1)The main difference is Linked List varies dynamically. But array size is static. 2)Array are addressed sequential in nature. But Linked lists are arranged in different positions i.e not contiguous. 3)Arrays can hold only one value at a time. But linked list can hold more than one at a time What I mean is struct Node { int d; char c;//in array only d or c can be hold at any point no two variables. Node * n; } 4)Insertion,Deletion operations are costlier in Linked list O(n); but in array it is O(1) 5) Linked list requires extra memory than array. 48 Views  Answer requested by Swathi Rentala
