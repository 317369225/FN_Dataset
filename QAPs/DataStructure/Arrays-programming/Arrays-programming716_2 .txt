What's the best way to learn about one dimensional arrays in programming in C? Are there any simplified methods of learning it?I have an exam next week and I am almost at zero. I would have learned it, but I need to figure it out first, which is where the problem is.Read and write. If you have a written exam then try to write as many programs as you can in your note book and dry run them. Arrays are not that much hard. You just need a little understanding of data structures and variables. If you know what is int , char and you know whats a string. You are almost there. You can do it. (Y). 103 Views  View Upvotes
