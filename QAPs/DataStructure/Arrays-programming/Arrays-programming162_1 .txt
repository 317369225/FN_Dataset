How do I find maximum average subarray of k length?Given an array with positive and negative numbers, find the maximum average subarray of given length.Let us understand this question in more depth, since k is known to us the maximum average subarray of k length will be equal to max sum of k length subarray divided by k. Now the problem we have is to find the max sum of k length subarray in a given array. This can be efficiently solved using a popular technique called Sliding Window Algorithm. We will take the sum of first k elements and now we will move our pointer from k+1 to n and each step we will keep adding the current element to the sum while removing first element of the previous sum from current sum which will give us the updated sum. At each step we will take max of current sum and max sum till know, and this will give us the max sum of k length subarray. Here is a short example: Let us assume our array is {1,4,-2,5,-9} and k=3 so our initial sum of k length is 3 (1+4-2) max value= 3 now moving our pointer to 4th element, we have updated sum: 3-1+5=7 max value = max(3,7)=7 now pointer comes at last position and updates sum = 7-9 =-2 max value = max(-2,7) =7 Once you have max subarray sum, it is trivial to get average. The complexity of this solution is O(n) time and O(1) space. 163 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
