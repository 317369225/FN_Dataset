Is computing the distance between two cells in a 2d array by its row and column a good one?I am trying to implement the A star search. Of course you need to compute the heuristic function. I am wondering if this is a good way.This is a common shortcut and is known as a Manhattan Distance because, when you drive in Manhattan there are very few diagonal roads. Yes, it is a good way to do this. And even if you need a more accurate distance say, using Pythagoras, you can first use a Manhattan Distance as an approximation in order to identify the best candidates or to get close. 350 Views  View Upvotes
