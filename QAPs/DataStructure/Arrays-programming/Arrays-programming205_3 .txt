Is there a way to use billions of arrays or can I develop a new program that can compute billions of arrays?Yes, depending on the language and whether your computer has that much memory and your OS allows you to access it, you can create billions of arrays.  It seems like this question is backwards, though. It sounds like you have decided on what the solution should be, and perhaps later you will think about a problem you could solve. If you ask the right way to solve a particular question instead, you might get a different answer. 400 Views  View Upvotes
