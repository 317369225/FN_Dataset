What does int *(a) [20] mean?When we try to declare a 2D array using pointer in this manner what is actually ignored the number of rows or the number of columns? Thanks in advance."int *(a)[20]" basically means "a" is an array of 20 pointers. Each element in array "a" points to some memory address in memory. When you assign a 2D array to array of pointers, the number of columns are ignored. For example, let us declare an 2D array of 50 columns and 20 rows as following:- int arr[50][20]; We can make array "a" to point array "arr" as following:- a = arr; The number of columns in array "arr" is ignored in above line code. 102 Views
