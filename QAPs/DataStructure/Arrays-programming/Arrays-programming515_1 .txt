In Swift programming; How do I Load different arrays when different buttons are pressed?I have a viewcontroller and a tableviewcontoller. In my viewcontroller I have 6 different buttons which (when pressed on) should load different arrays (in the same) tableview controller. Just need to be pointed in the right direction please!First connect the Interface Builder button to your code, with an IBAction. (Control drag from your button into the code and make an action) When the button is pressed (and released) it sends a message to your code and calls the method. Then put some code in the action method, to load up whatever you want. 332 Views  View Upvotes
