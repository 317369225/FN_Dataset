How do I save words from a string intro a struct array? CWhy are you using an array of int to store strings. The last line suggests that you need array of strings so you have to change your code a bit. int i=0; //int array[10]; I have commented this line. No longer needed char str[] ="This is a test"; char *pch; printf ("Splitting string \"%s\" into tokens:\n",str); pch = strtok (str," "); while (pch != NULL) { pch = strtok (NULL, " "); strcpy(persons[i].name,pch); //you have to use strcpy for copying strings i++; } I am assuming you have initialize your structure element “persons[].name” properly. 131 Views · View Upvotes
