I have trouble viewing algorithms from a broad perspective, and instead get caught up in details. How can I change this?As a simple example, if I'm sorting an array, I find myself getting stuck on how I would sort individual elements of the array, rather than how to get the overall array sorted. I find myself thinking too iteratively. I'm taking my first algorithms class right now, and would appreciate any advice.Your instinct is actually right. If you want to figure out how to sort an array, asking what it means to sort 2 elements, and how to extend that to 4 elements, is the right question to ask. Mathematics and computer science are inherently reductive - everything has to be reduced to operations on individual objects and you need to figure out how those can be built up to operations on larger things. 135 Views  View Upvotes
