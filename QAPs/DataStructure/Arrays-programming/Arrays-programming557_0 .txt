How do I compare a 2 dimensional array and find interesctions with a one dimensional more efficiently?ive got a 2 dimensional array (in c#) and need to compare it with a one dimensional array (second dimension has as many ints as the array with which i compare with) and need to count the intersections ive got this all done now in 3 for loops but i wonder if there is a faster wayYes, you can do this much faster by sorting both data structures first. I'm sure that there are some algorithm specialists that could suggest improvements, but my approach to this would be to store the contents of the two-dimensional array in a binary tree, keeping in mind that each pair in the two-dimensional array is essentially a single data point for comparison. The performance of he algorithm will then be reduced to the natural log of the size of the two-dimensional array. This can get complicated and theoretical, of course, but I believe the solution is fairly optimal. You can speed things up more by rearranging the two dimensional array into sorted order first, a so-called insertion sort. 170 Views
