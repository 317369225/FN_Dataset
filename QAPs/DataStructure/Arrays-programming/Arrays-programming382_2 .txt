Given an array consisting of 0's and 1's which is rotated array of "11111000000.." or “000001111…” how can we find positions of 1's?for eg array can be like this [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,..,1,1,1] or [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,..0,0,0] ie atmost two transitions from [0 –>1], or [1->0]. I’m expecting this in logarithmic time.I am sorry , NO LOGARITHMIC TIME SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE If the array isn't monotonous from any side, this isn't possible. Instead if you know you have only 0s and 1s use getchar() to take input in a faster and print the indices. Gives you a linear online algorithm. 137 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
