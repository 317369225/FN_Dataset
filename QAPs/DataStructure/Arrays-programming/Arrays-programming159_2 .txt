What is the code to divide an array into two equal halves?This solution is basically written in "C", If it is python or JAVA, the code would have much simpler. This code is working, I have already tested it. If not matching your requirements please revert me back in comments. I will see, if I could answer /*code BY CHAITANYA*/ /* Trial no:1*/ #include<stdio.h> int main() { int a[1000],b[300],c[300],count=0,i,n,count_h; scanf("%d",&n); for(i=0;i<n;i++) { scanf("%d",&a[i]); count++; } if(count%2==0) { count_h=count/2; for(i=0;i<count_h;i++) { b[i]=a[i]; printf("the first halved is %d\n",b[i]); } for(i=count_h;i<count;i++) { c[i]=a[i]; printf("the second halved is %d\n",c[i]); } } if(count%2!=0) count_h=count/2; for(i=0;i<count_h;i++) { b[i]=a[i]; printf("the first halved is is %d\n",b[i]); } for(i=count_h;i<count;i++) { c[i]=a[i]; printf("the second halved is %d\n",c[i]); } } 200 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Vinaya J
