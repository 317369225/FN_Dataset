If you mean something resembling a "C-style array" -- just a big block of memory you can index into -- no, by definition the block of memory must have a fixed size. Most modern languages provide some sort of "dynamic array" or "vector" data structure. These usually work by allocating a single block of memory internally. If you need more space they allocate a new, bigger block of memory, copy over the existing data, and free the old block. 39 Views
