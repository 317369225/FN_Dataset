What is the most efficient algorithm to rotate an array by 'k' elements?Problem Description : Solve Left Rotation I thought of 2 solutions: Erasing & Inserting elements simultaneously till ‘k’ iterations. Code @ 4wgrq - Ghostbin Getting all the elements and printing the (i+k)%n th element. Code @ 7ucy9 - Ghostbin (didn’t actually perform rotation operation - is this ok) ?Step 1: reverse array from index 0 to k-1 step 2: reverse array form index k to n step 3: reverse the whole array Example: arr=[1,2,3,4,5] k=2 step 1: reverse array from index 0 to 1 (k-1) 2 1 3 4 5 step 2: reverse array from 2 (k) to n (4) 2 1 5 4 3 step 3: reverse the whole array 3 4 5 1 2 Thanks For A2A. 214 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Balaji Venkatesan
