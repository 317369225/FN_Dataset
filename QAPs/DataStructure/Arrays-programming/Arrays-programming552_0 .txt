Suppose we had an algorithm that took in an array of strings, sorted each string, and then sorted the full array. What would the runtime be?If we use a best efficiency algorithm, it can sort all strings in NClogC time where C is the maximum length of a string and N is the number of strings (and of course, the log is logarithm to base 2). Next we sort the strings as a whole which should take NlogN x C where we assume that the string comparison wrill be O(C) and NlogN is the best case sorting efficiency. Total time should be NC(log C + log N) or NC * max(log C, log N). 159 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
