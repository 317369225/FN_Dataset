How do I make a Java program print all the elements of an array in all possible combinations?Suppose your array has n elements. Then do a loop from 0 to 2^n - 1. Inside the loop, find the bit (binary) pattern of the loop counter (e.g. if the counter is 25 then it'd be 11001), now starting from the leftmost bit, if that bit position is 1, print array[position], otherwise don't print anything. So each iteration you'll get an unique combination of your elements, and by end of the program you'll get all. 580 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Vinamra Das
