How do I check if there are duplicates in the array but the array is very large and had to be distributed across multiple machines?There are several solutions to that problem, and the best one depends on your problem specifics (size of the dataset, expected distribution of duplicates, number of nodes, etc). You say “array” but I will assume “set” (unsorted data); if you know that the data is sorted and every node holds a continguous chunk of it the solution is much simpler (ask your immediate neighbors if they have the items at the end of your chunk). Here is an idea that works if you expect few duplicates: every node maintains a bloom filter for its chunk of the dataset and replicates it to all the other nodes. On any given node you can check the bloom filters for all nodes, so you can verify that any item on that node is not on another node (highly probable because you expect few duplicates). If you get a hit on one bloom filter, you still have to ask the corresponding node to confirm. 48 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
