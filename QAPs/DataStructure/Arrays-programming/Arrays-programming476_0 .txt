What is the concept behind this Java code with arrays and adding to arrays?It's not really adding to the array, it's just creating a new one that's one size bigger, adding all the old shit to it, then adding the new thing. Which is essentially what ArrayList does anyways, though I believe it doubles the size so it's not constantly creating new arrays. 2.4k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Joshua Borland
