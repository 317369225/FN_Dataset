How does the tournament method for finding the maximum and minimum element in an array consist of 3n/2 -2 comparisons?What is the procedure to find the number of comparisons required for finding the minimum and maximum element using the tournament method?Let T(n)  T(n) count the number of comparisons required to find the min/max of n  n elements. Now, in the algorithm above, we divide the n  n elements into two parts, find the solutions to those sub-problems of size n2   n2 and then combine their solutions to get the solution for T(n)  T(n) . Each T(n)  T(n) call returns two numbers, the min and the max. Now after getting the answer to each T(n2 )  T(n2) call, we make 2  2 comparisons between the 2  2 minimums and 2  2 maximums returned. Thus, our recurrence looks like this T(n)=2⋅T(n2 )+2  T(n)=2⋅T(n2)+2 . For n=2  n=2 , we make only 1  1 comparison so the final recurrence is  T(n)=2⋅T(n2 )+2  T(n)=2⋅T(n2)+2 and T(2)=1  T(2)=1 . Solving this recurrence (t(n) = 2*t(n/2) + 2, t(2) = 1) gives us T(n)=3n2 −2  T(n)=3n2−2 1.5k Views · View Upvotes
