How do I find next greater element for every element in an array?The Next greater Element for an element y is the first greater element on the right side of y in array.I learned it from IDeserve Video with animated explanation This problem can be solved by using a stack. We traverse the array once. 1. If the stack is empty or the current element is smaller than top element of the stack, then push the current element on the stack. 2. If the current element is greater than top element of the stack, then this is the next greater element of the top element. Keep poping elements from the stack till a larger element than the current element is found on the stack or till the stack becomes empty. Push the current element on the stack. 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 till the end of array is reached. 4. Finally pop remaining elements from the stack and print null for them. Please note that at any instance, the stack will always be in sorted order having least element at the top and largest element at the bottom.
