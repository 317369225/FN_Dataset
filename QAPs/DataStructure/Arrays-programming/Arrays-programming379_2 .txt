How do you Print inversions of an array?Is this possible using bit or we have to do using mergesort?As people have already talked about it if only the count of inversions is required then BIT or mergesort would do the trick. I have solved this problem on spoj using Mergesort and the basic idea is exploiting the fact that when u merge if the element in the left half is greater than the one on the right then all the elements remaining in the left half wld be greater. You can choose the way u find it easy to understand Cheers 48 Views
