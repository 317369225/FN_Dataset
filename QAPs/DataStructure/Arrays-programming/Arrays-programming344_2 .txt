Why is it necessary to use Java to initialize anonymous array?Of course it is not necessar to use Java to initialize… I assume you ment to ask: In Java, why is it necessary to initialize… The answer would be: because of the Java garbage collector, it is necessary to have a known valid memory state at every time. In particular it must be defined whether someting is or isn’t a pointer. In case of an array, its size must be known for the same reason. 41 Views
