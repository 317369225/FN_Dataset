What are things to avoid when handling big array or object in php?Preventive measures (that might not be applicable in your case): If we are talking data from a database: If you know the data set could be arbitrarily large, then don't load the whole data set to an array. Iterate instead, and in that loop create possible smaller data sets that cater to your needs. PDO's fetchAll is really nice, but be aware of the possible consequences. Also, prune the database query result preventively by asking for the columns you need. When receiving a result from an API request (e.g. from Twitter or Facebook) I always use json_decode($jsonblob, true). I don't have any hard proof, but it should be more efficient than dealing with objects. 163 Views  View Upvotes
