Are arrays in JavaScript similar to Arraylists?Yes they are similar. Cars and trains are also similar :) They do have similar features. They can both grow in size. They can both store different types of data although Java would have to wrap these values into some parent class, like Object, then cast them when they are needed. Of course JS does this a little bit more easily but you will still need to check the type of object when retrieving from the array anyway, you wouldn't want to try to multiply a string by accident. JS arrays and Java array lists both have "built in" methods through prototyping and inheritance respectively. The list goes on (pun intended). At the end of the day they are called array lists because they were built to operate similarly to arrays while benefiting from the List interface's functionality. You'll be hard pressed to find any two structures that are not similar in some ways. 689 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
