Should I use an array or an object for implementing a JavaScript queue class?If you are in need of a Queue data structure in JavaScript for your project, first thing you need to do is to actually identify why you need it. If what you're looking for is basic queue structure with .shift(), .unshift(), .push() functions JavaScript arrays already have those and are perfectly optimized to work with them. In fact you can consider a JavaScript array as an array, a queue, a stack and a map without adding anymore functionality to it. Still feel like you need more functionality? I suggest you to implement them on top of Array's prototype. For example let's assume you want your arrays to be able to return a randomly chosen item from the item they include. This can be implemented like this: Array.prototype.pickRandom = function () { return this[ Math.floor( Math.random() * this.length ) ]; } Note that it's perfectly OK to use classes. But it's JavaScript, not Java. You don't need to have classes for every single thing a programming language ever uses. 201 Views
