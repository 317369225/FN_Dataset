What is the difference between String Array and Character Array?I will try to explain in a non technical way though i am a programmer..! Assume you have an almirah/cupbord and in that almirah you have many shelf. So here we go.. Here in this image we have 5 shelf in the almirah. imagine all Shelf are the string, this collection of shelf in almirah is a StringArray. Imagine you have books in the Shelf then here all the individual shelf is a CharacterArray Now you can replace shelf's with strings and books with Character(A to Z). Here i have tried to explain StringArray & CharacterArray with comparative approach. you can imagine your solution in separate manner. 4.7k Views  View Upvotes
