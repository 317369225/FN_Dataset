How do I put a number in an array such that each digit of a number is saved in one block of the array?I have a 1000 digit number and wish to put the number in an array of size 1000 such that each digit of the number goes into each single field of the array. How to do this using C programming?You can read this number in as a string like so: char number[]="3423498372434...." C will put each char into a char field for you. You can retrieve the exact digit as follows (int) number[index]-48. 357 Views  View Upvotes
