Is it possible to have a dynamic contiguous array without its size being fixed internally?Link which contains some details about the question: Is it possible to have a dynamic contiguous array without its size being fixed internally?Yes, you can use malloc function for dynamic allocation of memory in c language in which can give you dynamic array which is also contiguous. malloc function allocates specified memory at runtime. for example: int *t; int n; //n=number of elements in array. n=10; t = (int*)malloc(n*sizeof(int)); //which reserves the memory for n elements i.e for 10 elements in this particular case and t will be the pointer pointing towards first element. Or you can say that t have the memory address of first element. 22 Views
