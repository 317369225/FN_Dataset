Algorithms: An array of n elements contains only two distinct values. How many calls to the Partition subroutine are needed to completely sort this array? (Select ONE answer) A. O(l) B. O(log n) C. O(n) D. O(n log n)?Originally Answered: An array of n elements contains only two distinct values. How many calls to the Partition subroutine are needed to completely sort this array?I think the answer is A. The pivot is one of the two possible values it can take. In the first and the only partition call, all the second values are re- ordered on one side of the pivot, and all the equals on the other side. Hence O(1). 513 Views  View Upvotes
