How do I make all -ve numbers one side and +ve another?Algorithm is not stable ( means relative position of numbers will differ from original Array A) complexity can be further reduced by small modification to step 5b A[] : input array PosMarker - first positive element index curIndex = 0 ( at every iteration end we will always have ALL -ve element from 0 to curIndex-1) Count = 0 while( curIndex < n) find first positive number after from CurIndex in A[]-> posMarker ( posMarker > n-1 break) find first -negative number after posMarker -> i ( if i > n-1 break) swap(A[posMarker], A[i]) count ++ curIndex = posMarker + 1 FInally A[] will have all element with -ve on one side and +ve on one side and count will have number of minimum swaps ( total number of negative numbers) 281 Views  View Upvotes
