What is the difference between a string and an array?STRING A string is a datatype that can hold a set of characters enclosed with “” in its memory. For ex: A string datatype x can save a set of characters, like “Nice to meet you”. It looks like this in java: String x = “Nice to meet you.”; String = defines the datatype. x = the memory location holding a value of string datatype. The value is “nice to meet you”. 2. ARRAY An array, is also a datatype that is used for holding multiple values. Either string or integer type. The multiple values are recognized by the index number assigned to them. Like: int[] myList = {1, 2, 3, 3}; //same can be dome by using string, just use “” while entering the values. Now by using string will take more time as each value needs to be declared separately. String x = 1; String y = 2; And so onn.. But using array simplifies that because all values can be declared at the same time using one variable. 60 Views · View Upvotes
