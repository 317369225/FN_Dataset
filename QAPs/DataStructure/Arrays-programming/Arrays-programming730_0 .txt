Can someone explain data type formatting in arrays?ArrayLists and other Collections can only hold objects (technically, reference types - types which are a reference to an object, which is always a subclass of Object). They can't hold primitive types. int is a primitive type, and Integer is its corresponding reference type (object). A feature called autoboxing will convert from one to the other when it's allowable. Note that null is allowed anywhere that any object is allowed, so any ArrayList can hold nulls. Whereas a Java array of int, int[], holds only primitive ints and can't have null as a member. All eight of Java's primitive types have corresponding reference types. String isn't one of them; it's already an Object, albeit one which gets a bit of special consideration in Java's syntax. Integer and Character correspond to int and char; in all other cases the class name is the same as the primitive name but with the first letter capitalised, as is the convention in Java. 101 Views  View Upvotes
