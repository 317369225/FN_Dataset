I want to read a .raw image into an array in C. How can this be achieved?There are dozens, if not hundreds, of raw formats in use by different models of digital equipment (like cameras or film scanners). So you need to learn which camera produced the file, what actual format is that, and then search for a library that can read this format. It might be quite complicated inside, don’t be fooled by the “raw” name. 125 Views · View Upvotes
