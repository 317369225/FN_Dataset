How can I write a code with 2 loops for this question?I don't want to do your homework for you, as that will be robbing you of a learning opportunity. But I will give you a big hint. A very big hint. Think about the loop on line 5: for(j=i+1; j<array.length; j++) What is it doing? If you follow what Michael Jrgensen said, you'll find the answer soon enough. EDIT: After a request for more information... Think carefully about what the j=i+1 bit in the loop is doing. Try it with {3, 11}, {11, 3, 11, 3}... why would the wrong answer be printed out in the second set when j=i+1? 237 Views  View Upvotes
