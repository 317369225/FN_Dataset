How do I find the different numbers of contiguous subarrays of an array using Java?Pre Script : I am providing an algorithmic approach, which can be used in java. But I am not sure, if you are searching for some specific built-in method in java which could do this :O The key here is that since we want subarrays, then it means that elements , in each subset,must be taken in order. Now, if we have 'n' elements, then we need to consider each element as the starting element one by one. When we are at the 'i'th element, this means that subsets begining with this elements can include elements form i+1 to n. This can be done by dynamic programming approach easily. Consider an array int no_of_subarrays[], such that no_of_subarrays[i] stores the no of subarrays possible by including 'i' th element as the beginning element. Now no_of_subarrays[n-1]=1 (as no more elements are possible after n-1) for each i, no_of_subarrays[i]=1+no_of_subarrays[i+1] ( element i can be included in all the proceding subarrays) Time :O(n) Finally total no of subarrays= Sum of the elemets in the above array. If you want to find the the subarrays also, the you can store the subarrays for each starting element in a map, form the subarrays for the preceding elements by including them in the already formed subarrays Time: O(n) Space :O(n) 2.4k Views  View Upvotes
