How do I randomise different strings of an array in C?Suppose i have 10 different strings in an array. Now i would want to display 5 random strings among 10. How do I do it?Okay so you have your string array. Let’s call it strings. char** strings; //Or char* strings[10] You want to display 5 random strings among them, but you don’t want to repeat a string two times. So you’ll need to remember which strings you already chose. Create an array of chosen strings. int choice[5]; for (int i=0; i<5; i++) choice[i] = -1; Then, draw 5 random numbers but check if it hasn’t been drawn before int counter = 0; //We will add 1 to this each time we draw a new string int inArray; while( counter < 5 ){ //Do until we have 5 strings random = rand()%5; //Chose a random number — Don’t forget to put srand(time(NULL)) at the beginning of your code and to include time.h //Check if we already chose this number inArray = 0; for(int i=0; i<5; i++){ if( choice[i] == random) inArray = 1; } if( !inArray){ //If we have not, chose the string and increment counter. printf(“String number %d : %s\n”, counter, strings[random]); choice[counter] = random; counter++; } } 236 Views · View Upvotes
