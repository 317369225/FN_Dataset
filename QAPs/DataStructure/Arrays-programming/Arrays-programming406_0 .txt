How do I search element from one array is present in another in optimized way?Method 1: Brute force, complexity O(NM) extra space required none Method 2: Sort the target array and use binary search to find the item in array 2. Complexity O((N+M) log M), extra space required none if array can be changed, O(M) otherwise Method 3: Create a hash of target array and search each element in this hash. Complexity O(N+M) (May go up to O(NM) in worst case). 59 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Vivek Kale
