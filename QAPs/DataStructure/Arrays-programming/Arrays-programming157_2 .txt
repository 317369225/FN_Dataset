When can I use Arrays over Arraylists in Java? And why?When creating array you need to initialize it with the length and type of that array the length can't change so if you need to add more elements you need to create new array, array list on the other hand is expandable it is initialized with zero element and grow every time you add an element this comes with cost of slowness, array list a bit slower than array but it is more flexible 26 Views
