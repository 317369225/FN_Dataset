Can a static sorted array be mapped to a BST? A dynamic sorted array? If yes explain how, if not provide reasons.Technically, an array (or a LinkedList) can also be considering to be a BST albeit one that is not very efficient. To construct an efficient BST from a sorted array, we would want to minimize the height of the tree, which leads to the following idea- 1. Take the midpoint of the array & set it as root of the tree. 2. Recursively construct a BST for the left child and right child using the remaining array. This will guarantee that the BST will be of minimum height (log n to be exact) 98 Views  View Upvotes
