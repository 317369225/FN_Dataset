Why does C++ Primer say using compiler to count the number of array elements is a bad method?For example, short things[]={1,5,3,8}; This sentence does not explicitly declare the number of array elements. The author says that the compiler will count the number and this is a terrible declaration, because method the compiler count the number is different from what you think.For the example you posted, the issue has to deal with how "short" get's packed into memory is not defined. So to calculate the size, you may do this... sizeof(things) / sizeof(short) The size of short may in fact be 2 bytes. But the compiler, if optimizing for speed may use 4. So the size of things would be 16 bytes, / 2 = 8. Which is of course, incorrect. 631 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
