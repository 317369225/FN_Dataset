How might I convert an "in-order" list representation of a binary tree into a balanced binary tree, whose in-order traversal equals the original list?An AVL or Red-Black tree won’t keep the in-order representation of the original list. The definition of balanced would be that the height of subtrees differs by at most one. Assume that the original binary tree representation was also balanced. Note also that the trees are not “search trees”.One method would be to do an in-order traversal of the tree copying each element into an array as you go. Then you will know how many elements you have to deal with. Make the middle element in the array the root of a new tree. Make the middle of the left elements of the array the left child of the node and the middle of the right elements of the array the right child of the node. Recurse downwards this way until the lower and upper index number of the array are the same when you will have inserted a leaf node into the tree. 27 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
