How do I find maximum average subarray of k length?Given an array with positive and negative numbers, find the maximum average subarray of given length.Thanks for A2A. This problem can be solved as follows: Step 1: Find sum of first k elements in the input array. Initialize maxSum to the calculated sum and maxSumStartIndex = 0. Step 2: Add next element to the sum and subtract first element from the sum. Check if this sum is greater than previous sum and update maxSum and maxSumStartIndex. Step 3: Keep adding next element to the sum and removing first element from the sum to get sum of current sub array of size k and update maxSum and maxSumStartIndex whenever a greater sum is seen. Step 4: Finally print k elements starting from maxSumStartIndex. Maximum average subarray of size k Video Solution: Hope this helps. 325 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
