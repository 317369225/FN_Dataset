I have 2 arrays of unequal size. How can I combine them to get a matrix?r = [0.01 0.02 0.03] n = [5 4 3 2 1] How could i get an output of matrix with (1+r)^n?I not quite sure what do you want, but from my point of view, you can built a 3*5 matrix as an output. The answer (1+r(:)).^n seems not working.. Edit: Thanks for additional info. from Leonard Dinu. It works. It does output a 3*5 matrix 85 Views
