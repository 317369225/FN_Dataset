What are the differences between arrays and linked lists?Originally Answered: What is the exact difference between array and linked list?Array is like a notebook. The moment you run out of available space to write, you are only left with putting a bigger size notebook. Linked List is like an Office File/ Office Folder. If you run out of available space, you just add a new paper to it and start writing there. So array is Static kind of Data Structure in it that size does not / cannot grow over time and Linked List is a Dynamic Data Structure as the size can be changed over time. 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
