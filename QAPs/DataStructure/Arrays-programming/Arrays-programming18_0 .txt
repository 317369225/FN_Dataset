What are sub arrays and negative subarrays?How to calculate negative subarrays?A sub-array is a contiguous part of an array. It is usually specified by giving its starting and ending index number. For example, the quicksort algorithm will usually call itself to sort a sub-array and pass the starting and ending index number to itself: quickSort(Array, i, j). This sort is initially called passing the whole array: quickSort(Array, 0, n-1) A negative sub-array is one where the sum of all the integers in that sub-array is negative. 81 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
