What is the difference between an array and a variable?To help develop an intuition, I am going to start from the real world and then go into computer science. You first had one dog and you called him tommy, then you another dog and called her lilly, lilly and tommy had 10 kids and then you got 10 other pair of dogs for the 10 kids and they had 10 kids each and now you have about 10*10 + 10 + 2 dogs, assume at the end there were 100 dogs, you really have a challenge thinking of names for all these dogs, so you just call them dog 1, dog 2, dog 3 and so on. In the above case, a dog is a data type, tommy is a variable and so is lilly. dog 1, dog 2, dog 3 .. are a collection of same datatype that is dog and therefore an array, which in a program you'll refer to as dog[1], dog[2] ... and initialize as Dog dog[100]; where Dog is a struct or a class. Same thing applies for integers, one integer can give given a name x or y, but if you want 1000 integers, naming each one will be tedious so you'll do something like int n[1000] and access each element by n[0], n[1], note that array is 0 based index in computer science, that is it is counted as 0, 1, 2 and so on and not 1, 2, 3.. 438 Views  Answer requested by Rita Sharma
