How do I take one argument (the array) and read five values into the array in C programming using a function?Using the posted code, you just fill in the values in the array. array[0] = getValue(); /* ... */ array[4] = getValue(); Note that the receiving function does not know the size of the array unless you pass it in. void readData(int *array, int size); This implies that the function in your version fills in a data structure that is implicitly five values long. It may be reading from disk or filling in data from sensors. If you pass in a smaller array, you will have a buffer overflow. 71 Views  View Upvotes
