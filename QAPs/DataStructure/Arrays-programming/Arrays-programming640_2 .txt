"An array/vector of size n n has exactly n(n+1)2 n(n+1)2 total number of subarrays / sub-sequences" - Is this theory valid for all n?Please, sorry for my observation but, first: The correct subarrays is: {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3},{2,3}, {1,2,3} - 7(seven subarrays not contiguous and uniques) That rule apply only in contiguous subarrays and so only that. Recently I have resolved any problems in challenges on HacherRank and HacherEarth for Mathematics and in various challenges with not-contiguous subarrays that formula is not return correct value for non-contiguous subarrays. Each problem have one solution about the rules explained on that.  6 Views
