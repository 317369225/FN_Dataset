How do I split an array into two arrays with almost equal sum?similar to How to optimally divide an array into two subarrays so that sum of elements in both are same . otherwise give an error , Only difference is that the difference between sum of two arrays must be minimum if not 0 I have written (Ideone.com) a greedy approach, will if work for all cases?This is a standard dp problem. You just have to find all the subset sums that are possible for the given array. Then do the following for every subset sum possible : Let us denote the sum of all the elements in the array as S. 1) If a subset has sum 's' and you take it as the first split of your array, then the other split has sum S-s. Now you have the sum of your two subsets, you can easily figure out the difference of the sums. 2) All you need is to find the minimum value of the difference across for all the subset sums possible and you are done.
