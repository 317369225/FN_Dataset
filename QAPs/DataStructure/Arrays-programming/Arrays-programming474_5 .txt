Are arrays of arrays possible in C?I am aware that multidimensional arrays are possible, but what I need to do is pass a sub-array into another function. For example: if A=[1 2]  [3 4] I need to be able to pass [1 2] or [1 ; 3] (semicolon means new row) as an array into a function.Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays in C, normally. For example, int **a may be an array of arrays of ints. This also means a[i] will be an array, which you can pass along as a row of the bigger one. However, if you need to slice the array by column instead, you'll have to transpose it first or otherwise build the slice in a separate location. 150 Views  View Upvotes
