How is the map data structure different from an associative array?If you're talking about Java ADT (a.k.a. Map), it is little different than JavaScript and other languages called associative arrays. The primary difference is that the key needn't be a string. Unlike with most associative arrays, the key can be any object for which a hash code can be generated. All objects in Java do this, but you can't use a primitive as a key ... Autoboxing often hides this. 205 Views  View Upvotes
