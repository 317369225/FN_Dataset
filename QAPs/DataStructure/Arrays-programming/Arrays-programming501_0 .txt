How can I remove item from 1D array and leave the next and so on until I have one item in the array?Convert the 1d array in a circular double linked list. Keep a counter (initialized to the size of the array). And now start removing alternate elements. E.g. while(counter > 1) { head = cur ->next->next; delete(cur); cur = head; counter--; } where cur and head both point to the same element at start. This logic can be implemented without a circular linked list, but in that case you will have to do a lot of boundary condition checking. 62 Views
