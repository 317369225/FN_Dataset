How can I transfer a BINARY value which is stored in an array to an integer?Just stating it's a binary value does not mean much. Any value in the program's memory technically already is a binary value. To convert a sequence of bits to integer, add the value of the bit to the integer and perform a bit shift to the left by one. Use unsigned integers of sufficient capacity to store the value. To convert a text string to integer, use the appropriate function in your language. In C, this could be atoi or atol from <cstdlib> (stdlib.h) As I already said, any value in the program's memory already is a binary value. Have you tried to just cast the value to an integer? 127 Views  Answer requested by Nishit Mehta
