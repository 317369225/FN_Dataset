How do I find the smallest and second smallest element in an array?If the array is unsorted, have two variables 'first' and 'second' and keep iterating through the array and keep updating the variables by comparing with each element. Sample Code: for(int i: input){  if(i>first){  second=first;  first=i;  }  else if(i>second)  second=i; } If you want to find nth smallest or largest element, you can use selection algorithm http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S... If the array is sorted, you can get it in constant time. 2.4k Views  View Upvotes
