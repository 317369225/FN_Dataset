Given an array of random numbers, how can one find the longest consecutive sequence?Originally Answered: What is the running time of this algorithm to find the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array?Assuming constant time look-up and insertion into hash table. The running time would be O(N) - O(N) for inserting into hash table map. O(N) for updating G and S. O(N) for finding the candidates. And when you are iterating over G for every candidate element to find the consecutive sequences, you will be touching any given element of the array only once, as an element cannot be in consecutive sequences of more than one candidate. So running time for this will also be O(N). 1.9k Views  View Upvotes
