How can one access specific values within an array?In JS, if every zip code in the US were formatted as: var zipCodes= ([{"ZIP": 10001, "LAT": 40.750633, "LNG": -73.997177 }, etc]) How can one access the LAT or LNG value after the user inputs the ZIP value? Edit: Forgot to state that it’s in javascript. *facepalm*I can provide you with an example in Java (See if you have something similar in Javascript): Create HashMap as: HashMap<String, List<Float>>() hm = new HashMap<>(); Key = Zip code either as string or integer List will hold two values: Lat and Long 2. How to access: hm.get(“1001”).get(0) : Lat hm.get(“1001”).get(1) : Long 105 Views · View Upvotes
