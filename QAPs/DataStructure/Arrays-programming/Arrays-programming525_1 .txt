What will the array be after 1 pass in insertion sort?for example array is 5 6 3 1 2.After 1st pass the array is : 5 6 3 1 2 After 2nd pass the array is: 3 5 6 1 2 After 3rd pass the array is: 1 3 5 6 2 After 4 th pass the array is: 1 2 3 5 6 Insertion sort is just like playing cards. We start the comparison with the 2nd element. Let's say. in your left hand , you have a card number 5 and now you pick up card number 6 which is in your right hand. compare 6 with 5. As 5 < 6, no swap. just put the cards as it is. so after 1st pass no change in the elements of the array. Hope this helps :) 216 Views  View Upvotes
