What's the difference between multidimensional arrays and simply having arrays of arrays?Typically a multidimensional array is rectangular: each row has the same number of columns, each plane has the same number of rows, and so forth. This means that a multidimensional array is really a single-dimensional array with a convenience method for specifying elements: array[x][y] is really array[x*cols+y] (row-major order, as in C) or array[x+y*rows] (column-major order, as in FORTRAN). With array-of-arrays, there is no guarantee that each row has the same number of columns. One row might have hundreds, and the next none. This is occasionally useful, but it leads to greater overhead than the multidimensional approach above, using both more memory and more processor time to access a single element. 1.5k Views  View Upvotes
