What do you call the following Arrays in Java?int[][] scores = { {1,2,3,4} , {2,3,4,5} }; Should I say scores[0] points to an array object which holds 4 elements or Should I say scores[0] points to primitive array? I other words, Does scores[0] points to array object?scores[0] points to an array object. All arrays are objects in Java. Whether they are arrays of primitive types, objects, or arrays doesn't matter. Side note: Java does not support multi-dimensional arrays. The closest you get are arrays of arrays (of arrays of arrays....). 495 Views  View Upvotes
