How do I create arrays implicitly?if n=3 how to create 3 arrays implicitly in c programming language?I never heard of implicit array in C, are you sure you didn't mean C# where you can create array like var foo = new[] {1,2,3}; Or, again making a guess here: int *p[3]; will simply create 3 integer pointers which you can use as 3 arrays once you point them to appropriate places (allocated by either malloc or another storage). 48 Views
