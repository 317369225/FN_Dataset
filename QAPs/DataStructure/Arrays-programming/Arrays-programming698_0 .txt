How can I code in C to find a lonely integer in an array?int occur(int list[], int size, int key) {  int i, count = 0;  for (i = 0; i < size; i++)  {  if (list[i] == key)  {  count += 1;  }  }  return count; }Here you go by defining a function and thus checking the count of each element in the array. Which element has count 1 in the array, namely it occurs only once, that's how you grab your outcome. 532 Views  View Upvotes
