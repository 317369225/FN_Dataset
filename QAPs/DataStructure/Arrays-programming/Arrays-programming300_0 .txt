Why is vectorization important in R?One of the main reasons: operations on a whole data-structure such as vectors are most of the time more efficient than looping through all the elements because a) there are very fast and optimized libraries for vector operations and b) there's an overhead cost for the looping operations themselves. In many cases the vectorized code is also more readable. Vectorization not only speeds up R code, but is also an important concept in other languages such as MATLAB or Julia. 257 Views  View Upvotes
