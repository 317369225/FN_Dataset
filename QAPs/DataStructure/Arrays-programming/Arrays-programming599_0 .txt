Is there a way to use billions of arrays or can I develop a new program that can compute billions of arrays?You seem to be asking for a database. Each row or document (NoSql) could be considered an array. Most can handle billions of rows or documents. It doesn't make sense to try to handle data of this size in code at once. At least, not for typical use cases. Let the software that was designed for handling large sets of data handle that task. You just need to write the code to ask for a subset. If you're trying to perform some sort of task on billions of values, there are algorithms for that. Typically, they will standardize the task of handling a difficult task by breaking it down into parts which can be managed in memory. 87 Views  View Upvotes
