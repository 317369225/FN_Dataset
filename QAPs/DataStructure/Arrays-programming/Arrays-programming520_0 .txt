What does it mean for an array to be 1-sorted?I assume that under an h-sorted array you mean an array that consists of h  h interleaved sorted subsequences, such that each subsequence can be obtained by taking every h  h th entry starting from one of the positions 1…h  1…h (this kind of terminology is indeed used to describe the Shell sorting algorithm, see Sedgewick's website for more details). In other words, an array a  a is h  h -sorted if for all 1≤i≤n−h  1≤i≤n−h , we have a[i]≤a[i+h]  a[i]≤a[i+h] (I use 1  1 -based indexing here). Then, an array is 1  1 -sorted if for all 1≤i≤n−1  1≤i≤n−1 , we have a[i]≤a[i+1]  a[i]≤a[i+1] . Bit this means that a 1  1 -sorted array should be just sorted. 268 Views · View Upvotes
