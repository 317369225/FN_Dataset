Can I get some example programs that are done using Array of structures?Hi , when you are required to store large amount of information you can use array of structures . Basically structures are used to hold different types of data , but when you need to store 100 or say 1000 amount of data you can simply use this. Like to store students information of any university or employee information of any organization. Lets create an array of structure : // we will allocate memories dynamically , because we don't know how big the array will become :) #include<stdio.h> #include<stdlib.h> int main(int argc, char** argv) {  typedef struct{  char* firstName;  char* lastName;  char* dept;  }EMPLOYEE;  int count=3; //take any no to run the loop as per your requirments  int x;  EMPLOYEE* employees = malloc(count * sizeof *employees); //dynamically allocate memory here , so it becomes the array of structure  for (x = 0; x < count; x++){  employees[x].firstName=(char*)malloc(sizeof(char*));  fgets(employees[x].firstName,10,stdin);  // scanf("%s",employees[x].firstName);  employees[x].lastName=(char*)malloc(sizeof(char*));  scanf("%s",employees[x].lastName);  employees[x].dept=(char*)malloc(sizeof(char*));  scanf("%s",employees[x].dept);   }  for (x = 0; x < count; x++)  printf("first name: %s, surname: %s, department : %s \n",employees[x].firstName,employees[x].lastName,employees[x].dept);  return (EXIT_SUCCESS); } 169 Views
