How do I find all the subarrays of an array in increasing order of their lengths?For {1,2,3} i don’t want {1},{1,2},{1,2,3},{2},{2,3},.. and so on. I want {1},{2},{3},{1,2},.. and so on.How about following this by sorting them according to the size of array or lists (Depending on the language you are using.) As I am a coder in python i will answer it in that terms. Just create a function which takes a list as an argument and pass a list of all those sublists. Then sort using the len() function which tells about the length of the list.</p> Hope this works. EDIT 1: See my friend. If you want that subarrays should be ARRANGED in order of sizes, then surely it means that you want them to be sorted. Hence just follow the steps as I have suggested you. Make a function and use len(). During iterations from 1 to size of input array using a for loop print all the lists of size of the iteration variable. Something like this a=[1,2,3] # suppose you are able to get to this point that you obtain input_list input_list=[[1,2][1,2,3][1]] for i in range(len(a)): …..for x in input_list: ……….if len(x)==i: ……….print x or instead of print combine them in form of a list or a tupple and return if it is a function. 68 Views
