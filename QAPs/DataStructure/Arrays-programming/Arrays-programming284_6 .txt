How can I swap two strings within an array of strings (2D array) without using an additional string?You can do it without strange tricks (e.g. xor) and still use O(1) memory. Simply swap the first character, then swap the second character, and so on. The temporary value can be reused in each swap. Note that the question specified that it must be done without an extra string (O(n) space), but my method only uses a temporary character (plus the loop index), which uses O(1) space. Problem specifications must be precise if you didn't want a solution like this. However, this is probably the most efficient method in both time and space. 634 Views
