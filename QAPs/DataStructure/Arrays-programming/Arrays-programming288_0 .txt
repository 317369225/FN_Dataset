Why is my solution for adding two binary arrays not working?Did you try to debug it? Edit: Aha!! Your program works perfectly. It;s a feature, not a bug. Probably the problem is that you didn;t realize how arrays work. Since, your least significant integer is at position 0, what you are doing is 0101 + 1111 , not 1010+1111. 0101+1111 = 10100, not 11001. Since you are printing the least significant integer is being printed first, you are printing 10100 as 00101. Debug through the code and you might see the problem. If you want it to work as you expect, you should reverse your for loop 856 Views  View Upvotes
