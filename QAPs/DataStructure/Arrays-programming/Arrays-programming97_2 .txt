What is the best way to flatten a nested array into one array?I don't know which language you are using. I'll write my approach in pseudo-code. It relies heavily on recursion in order to flatten any level of nested-ness. function flatten(arr){ if arr is a single element: return [arr] newArray = [] for element in arr: tempArray = flatten(element) for otherElementName in tempArray: newArray.push(otherElementName) return newArray Basically, this will take any object arr. If arr is just a single element, we return an array containing only it. Otherwise, we make a new array, and for each element in arr, we flatten the element, and add the contents of the resulting array to our new array. Since we call flatten recursively, it will handle any level of nesting. We end by returning the new array. 191 Views  View Upvotes
