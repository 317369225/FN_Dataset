I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.Let me just give an intro about arrays. Elements in an array are referred using indices/index.The index varies from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of elements in the array. So basically the first element gets stored in 0th index(in a[0]), the second in 1st index (in a[1])..... And the last number in n-1 index(in a[n-1]). For printing the reversed array you must print from last element(a[n-1]) traversing backwards till the first element(a[0]).So your loop will be for(i=n-1;i>=0;i—) This loop traverses the array from last position(a[n-1]) till the first element(a[0]). eg: if n = 5 , loop will begin from n=4 till n=0 decrementing the value of loop variable ‘i’ each time. Just replace the second for loop in your program(line no:15) with the above mentioned for loop and you’ll get the reversed array.. Happy coding :) 147 Views · View Upvotes
