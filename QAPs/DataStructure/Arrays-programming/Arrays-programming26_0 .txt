Is computing the distance between two cells in a 2d array by its row and column a good one?I am trying to implement the A star search. Of course you need to compute the heuristic function. I am wondering if this is a good way.Manhattan Distance (the type of distance measuring technique you referring to) is actually the most simple and efficient A* search heuristic and also is the most used. All A* tutorials I know about first introduce the Manhattan Distance heuristic and then move on. It shouldn't be a problem in most cases, but you might want to look into using at least the Pythagorean Distance heuristic for more pathfinding accuracy if it sometimes fails to give the perfect path (it fails sometimes for my now inactive Vindinium bot). 40 Views  View Upvotes
