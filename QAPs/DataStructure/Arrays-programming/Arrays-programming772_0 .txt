What is the difference between lists and arrays in Python?tl;dr; People often use "array" when they in fact mean "list". There is also an array module that does some really specific stuff which gives better memory performance. I'm assuming for the rest of the answer that we're talking about the array module. The folks over at StackOverflow have (like most things in the universe) both asked and answered questions about the performance of lists and arrays. See: Page on stackoverflow.com A nice link from Guido van Rossum comparing list and array performance is here: Python Patterns - An Optimization Anecdote Interestingly, a lot of time the performance of "array" is worse than that of "list". It seems that "array" is useful for memory efficiency when everything you need in the list has a fixed type, but it isn't usually faster than using a list. Also, for doing large numerical computations, NumPy arrays (which are different from lists and the array module!) are best. 13.6k Views  View Upvotes
