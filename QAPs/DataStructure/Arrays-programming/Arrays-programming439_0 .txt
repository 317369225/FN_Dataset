How do you insert and search array with undefined size in C?Insertion is at the end of current last position (how to use malloc and calloc functions here?). Also, how to search array with undefined size?If I may, I think what you are asking is how to initialize an array who's length is unknown at runtime. The searching part becomes the exact same once you initialize the array. That being said, you are correct malloc and calloc are best for this. You simply need the size of the array in a variable. It looks something like this Vector = malloc(sizeof(DataType)*Size); //Or Vector = calloc(sizeof(DataType),Size); The latter initializes to 0. Now your real issue is getting the size of the array. However you're trying to do that though, is unclear in the question. Cheers 204 Views
