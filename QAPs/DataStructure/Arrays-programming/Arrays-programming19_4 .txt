How can I find the index of an element in an array in C?For example, if I have an array with 1000 elements with all the first 1000 prime numbers but is stored in an unsorted way. Is there any way to find the index of a particular prime number without searching through the whole array for the element?You could probably use a hash function to look up in constant time, or a binary search tree to look up in log2(1000) time. Keep in mind that you will have to build the arrays for these data structures, as although they are not sorted in ascending or descending order, the still are organized in some sort of way, to speed up searching. 103 Views  View Upvotes
