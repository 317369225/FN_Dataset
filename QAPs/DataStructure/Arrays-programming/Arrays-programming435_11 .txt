I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.Your code is absolutely correct bit there are few bugs(thats what a programmer says) in single line no.15 Problems for(i=n;i>=0;i-1) You are initializing I with n where nth place of i dont have any value because you have added value till n-1 in previous loop You are using i-1 which will simply decrease value of I but that will not be stored Solution for(i=n-1;i>=0;i--) Initialize I with n-1 Use decrement operator to decrease value of I and store it in i Thank you for reading this 49 Views
