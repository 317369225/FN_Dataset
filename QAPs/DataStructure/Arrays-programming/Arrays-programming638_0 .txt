What kind of lists should I use in Java? Why not arrays?Arrays are a good fit when you need to hold lot of primitive types like integers or floats. A list would wrap them in Integer or Float objects, bloating the size of the collection and slowing down operations. Outside of this use case, I recommend to always use Lists: they can be extended, they have a standard interface, so you can replace one implementation with another, you can make generic lists ("list of something to be specified later") while you cannot do that with arrays. 96 Views
