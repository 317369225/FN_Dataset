I am calculating the absaloute difference between pair of arrays, do I standardize the values in each array separately or all together?I have array (8.4, 7.6, 6.9, 7.2, 7.3) and (7.4, 7.8, 6.1, 7.9, 8.3). Do I standardize the ints by calculating the mean and std of them combined (8.4, 7.6, 6.9, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.8, 6.1, 7.9, 8.3) and than standardize each value against it. Or should I calc the mean and std of each array separately?make sure the arrays are the same length and then use the absolute funcion on the difference between the same index on the two. Math.abs(Arr1[i]-arr2[i]) 19 Views
