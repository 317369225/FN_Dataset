How is an integer array in c stored?Maarten Bosma is right, there is nothing in between. If we assume that the ints are 32-bit, that means they each occupy 4 bytes of memory, so C knows that if it needs element 3 for example, the offset is the address of the array, plus 3 * 4 bytes, so basically the address of the array plus 12 bytes. No commas, spaces or anything like that. If you want send a C array over HTTP, the short answer is “You can’t”* because it’s not a list/array in the way you imagine it, it’s just a block of memory. The way around this is to serialise it into something that can be interpreted by another program. The most common way to do this would be JSON, so I would suggest you find a JSON library for C and write out the C array as JSON. You could also check out XML or MessagePack if you don’t want to use JSON for some reason. *Well, you could, but it wouldn’t make much sense at the other end, there is no way of looking at a block of memory and deciding if it’s an array, structure, or whatever, it’s just memory, and it only means anything in the context of the program. 1.2k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Matt Bulova
