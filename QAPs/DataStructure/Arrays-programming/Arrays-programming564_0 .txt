How do I check if array is empty or not?The above program, which you have stated in your program will print "not empty" 10 times because the arr[0][0]......arr[10][49] have been declared but not initialised. So, the proper question here is, "What does a variable contains when it is declared but not initialised?" According to wiki, In computing, an uninitialized variable is a variable that is declared but is not set to a definite known value before it is used. It will have some value, but not a predictable one. As such, it is a programming error and a common source of bugs in software. Further, I was curious as to what this unpredictable value be, so I ran the code on my system and printed the values from arr[0]...arr[9] and got the following output: Hope, it helped. 437 Views  View Upvotes
