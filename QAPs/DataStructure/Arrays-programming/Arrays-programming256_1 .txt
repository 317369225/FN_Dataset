How can we implement k stacks in an array?How to efficiently implement k stacks in a single array? - GeeksforGeeks Though the code in the above link looks simple, I am not able to understand how k stacks are being maintained.I haven't gone through the post explained on GFG, but here is how I would approach: 1. Divide the array into logical units of size n/k 2. Maintain a top array which would store top value for each stack. The stacks would [start, end] from [0, n / k - 1], [n / k, 2*n/k - 1] and so on 3. Push, pop, peep operations would look something like: void push(int* stackArr, int item, int stackNum) {  //Push the item in stack numbered stackNum  // Don't forget to check error conditions, stackNum must be in range  //If stack to be operated upon is full, simply return } Similarly pop and peek operations can be written. I would suggest to maintain a structure for Stack: struct MyStack {  int* arr;  int size; //Size of arr  int* top; //Array with slot representing top of a stack. Its size would be k } Now, write create method for creating MyStack DS. 1.5k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Lehar Bhandari
