Does the time needed for sorting an array of integers with Arrays.sort in Java depend on the elements of the array?I was working on a problem in Codeforces recently and encountered this problem. (Already AC after submitting with Java 8) Link: Submission #9080519 - Codeforces Although test case 48 and 51 have the same N, their run time are very different. Any idea why?The performance of every sorting algorithm will depend on the data set. This is a universal fact. For even the best sorting algorithm, we can devise a data set for which its performance will deteriorate and reach its worst case performance. If your sort algorithm is indeed quicksort (as a brief search on the net tells me), then your test case 48 is designed to give a best case performance IF a proper pivot is chosen - preferably "median-of-three" pivot choice. (With a first element or last element pivot, it will give worst case performance!). Test case 51 may have been "designed" for worst case performance of the quicksort algorithm being implemented in Java! Therefore, no surprises there! Happy sorting! 229 Views  View Upvotes
