How do you assign values from structure to array in C?When you declare your array arr, are you just declaring the pointer to the array? Or are you declaring the space for the elements in the array too? (assuming dynamic memory allocation). or are you just declaring a structure with the array in it, and just making the pointer to the array when you declare the structure. Struct a: a->arr = (type*) malloc(sizeof(type) * arrlength): With the declaration above a->arr is a pointer to an array of type with length arrlength. Otherwise when you call a->arr you have a null pointer and it seg faults. Common issue but your snippet above doesn't give enough to correctly debug. So I'm guessing here 203 Views
