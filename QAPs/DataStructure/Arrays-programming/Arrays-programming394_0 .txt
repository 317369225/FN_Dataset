What is a k ordered array?I have not been able to find any useful explaination for what is a k ordered array. A=[1,4,2,6,3,7,5,8] is 1 ordered and A=[1,4,2,5,3,6,8,7,9,10] is 2 ordered .But how?Firstly , I would like t correct the question…. A=[1,4,2,6,3,7,5,8] is a 2 ordered array while A=[1,4,2,5,3,6,8,7,9,10] is also a 2 ordered array… An array is called k-ordered if any one of it’s element is at most k places away from its position in the sorted array… eg. A=[1 4 2 6 3 7 5 8] …A=[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] ………[0 1 2 2 2 2 1 0] is the difference in the positions of respective elements… So it is a 2 ordered array as the max difference is 2…. A=[1 4 2 5 3 6 8 7 9 10] A=[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] …..[0 1 2 2 1 0 1 1 0 0]…. Here also the max difference is 2.. So it is also a 2 ordered array…. While [1 3 2 5 4 7 6 8] is a 1 ordered array… 69 Views · View Upvotes
