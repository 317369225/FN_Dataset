I have an unsorted array in which I want to search an element. What is the best method for searching with a time complexity less than O(n) and I don't want to sort the array?what about two pointer method the worst case will be O(n) when element is not in the list else it always less than o(n) if element is in list. here is the code. correct me if I am wrong.
