How do I find the maximum square sub matrix with all ones in a boolean matrix of size mxn?I was asked this question in an interview. How can this problem be solved using dynamic programming? Is there an intuitive solution to this?Thanks for A2A Here is the algorithm: Step 1: Create an empty table of size mxn, defined as table[i][j] = Size of maximum square sub matrix with all 1s with matrix[i][j] as bottom right element. Step 2: Set values in table based on the conditions a. if i = 0 or j = 0, table[i][j] = matrix[i][j] b. else if matrix[i][j] = 0 then table[i][j] = 0 c. else table[i][j] = min(table[i - 1][j - 1], table[i - 1][j], table[i][j - 1]) + 1; During step 2, maintain largest element added in the table and finally return it.

Hope this helps. 290 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
