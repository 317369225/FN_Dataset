What is the difference between a string and an array?An array is a homogeneous collection of data, which means that an array is a collection of data of the same type like integer, real number, characters, etc. A string as the name suggests stores a string of character elements like 'a','b','c' etc. A string is used to stores a collection of consecutive characters. An example may enhance your understanding. Suppose you want to save the name of a user, say "Animesh", then you may use a = "Animesh". Strings have been represented in different ways in different programming languages. In languages like C, strings were represented by null terminated character arrays. A string in C looks something like this. char str[] = "Bob"; This string is stored in memory as, str [0] = 'B', str [1] = 'o', str [2] = 'b', str [3] = '\0'. The occorunce of the null character '\0' marks the end of the string. In languages like C++, Java, etc. Strings are a immutable types that store sequence of characters. The String type is encapsulated in a class and it may be internally implemented using character arrays or pointers, but the details of the implementation are not known to the programmer. Strings in higher level languages are immutable, which means that you cannot randomly pick a character from a string and change it to something else. Let's go back to our example of string in C. In C, our String str [] = "Bob can be changed to Bib by adding the following statement str [1] = 'i'; . You can't do that with string variables in Modern Languages. In modern languages strings are immutable. 360 Views  View Upvotes
