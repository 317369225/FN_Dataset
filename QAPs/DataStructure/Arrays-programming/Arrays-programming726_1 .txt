How does the tournament method for finding the maximum and minimum element in an array consist of 3n/2 -2 comparisons?What is the procedure to find the number of comparisons required for finding the minimum and maximum element using the tournament method?Consider n=8 elements in an array {1,4,5,8,3,2,7,9} Lets make a tournament bracket for them, where at each stage the winner is the minimum element between the two. As you can see, number of comparisons being done = n-1 = 7 Similarly, to find the maximum element you again will need n-1 comparisons! So total no of comparisons to find min and max=2(n-1) Hmm...there is one optimisation to it !! The last level in the tree is making n/2 comparisons(4 in this case) and these are being repeated while finding the minimum and maximum! So doing the last level comparisons only once, we do n/2 comparisons less Hence 2(n-1) - n/2 = 2n-2-n/2 = 3n/2-2. Thanks to Kunal Kukreja for teaching me this :) 1.6k Views  View Upvotes
