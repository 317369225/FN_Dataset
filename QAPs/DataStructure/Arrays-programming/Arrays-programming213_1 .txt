If I have a string array in a free Pascal card = array [1..52] of string, how can I remove one member of the array so that I have an array of 51 articles?but to remove member that I want to?There are two things you need to take into account here: array capacity and real array length. Array capacity is size of data array can hold at most and real array length is how mush of that data is actually there. You can think of it as a drawer with compartments - total number of compartments is capacity but number of compartments used is array length. Same as with drawer capacity you cannot change array capacity but nothing prevents you from not using several latest elements and keeping a note of that on the side. In Pascal, that means that we need to have additional variable that will keep length of array. Only restriction length must have is length <= capacity. So, keep and extra variable noting array length - when adding new element to array increase length; when removing one (last) element decrease length by one; if you need to remove non-last element swap element you need to remove with last one and then substitute it. 290 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Mihajlo Nestorovic
