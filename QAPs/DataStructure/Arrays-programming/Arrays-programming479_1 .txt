Is it wrong to use arrays in drawing many things?Hello guys, I am trying to make an arkanoid game, I am trying to draw the bricks using arrays, but it seems like this is making the program very slow, and the movement of the paddle gets delayed so much, also the ball is moving step by step, is there a better way to draw them? I'm using Allegro.You probably should let us see the code. If your game runs slow while parsing an array[5][20] the problem is not the array. 8 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
