How do I declare a string array of unknown size to get it from the user without using the alloc function in C?Sorry, unknown size means you would be changing its length dynamically so you cannot do that without dynamic memory allocation. Of course you could read char by char or have a temp buffer of fixed size, in which you input that many characters in one go and keep allocating more memory to put those. But that is as far as one could go. One wild (and pathetic looking) idea would be to read by char, and create a link list (by creating list members on stack and assigning pointers to it. It might work but it sure won't look like a reasonable solution from any view point. In practice, you always have an upper limit - or dynamically reallocate. period 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
