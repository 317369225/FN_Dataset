Why is C++ so annoying when dealing with arrays and vectors?Why is it not built with ease of use like Matlab?Because dealing with computer hardware and memory addressing is complicated, and C++ is the language you use to to deal with those issues in order to produce machine code binaries. Computer hardware is complex. The only way to avoid that complexity is to hide it from the user by making the code check for user mistakes at runtime, which means the code is less efficient. C++ is not "annoying". Computer hardware is "annoying". If you are more concerned about what the source code looks like than you are about what the final binary code looks like, then C++ is not the language for you. That being said, once you take the time to learn it well, C++ makes a lot of sense and is easy to use. Most people bail before reaching that point, however. 1.5k Views  View Upvotes
