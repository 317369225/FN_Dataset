Why don't they (CS book writers and programmers) make arrays that are sequential in memory and linked together?Congratulations, you have just invented the B+ tree! (Go google it to see the details - but its pretty much what you have just described - normally implemented as an array of pointers to arrays, rather than a linked list but the same principal) Its a data structure used when you need to be able to resize an array, but copying is expensive (eg in filing systems where data would have to be copied on disc). Disadvantage is random access takes longer as you have to do multiple memory accesses to find an element. 56 Views  View Upvotes
