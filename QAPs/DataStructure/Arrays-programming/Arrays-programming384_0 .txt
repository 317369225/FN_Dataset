What is the meaning of resizable array in arraylist?In computer science, a dynamic array, growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array, or array list is arandom access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed. It is supplied with standard libraries in many modern mainstream programming languages. A dynamic array is not the same thing as a dynamically allocated array, which is an array whose size is fixed when the array is allocated, although a dynamic array may use such a fixed-size array as a back end. The simplest dynamic array is constructed by allocating a fixed-size array and then dividing it into two parts: the first stores the elements of the dynamic array and the second is reserved, or unused. We can then add or remove elements at the end of the dynamic array in constant time by using the reserved space, until this space is completely consumed. The number of elements used by the dynamic array contents is its logical size or size, while the size of the underlying array is called the dynamic array's capacity or physical size, which is the maximum possible size without relocating data. A dynamic array is simply an array of void ** pointers that is pre-allocated in one shot and that point at the data. In the linked list you had a full struct that stored the void *value pointer, but in a dynamic array there's just a single array with all of them. 252 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Bala Sundaram
