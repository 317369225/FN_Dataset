How can I sort my multidimensional array?Look at how Python does it. A multidimensioned array (numpy.ndarray) in NumPy can be sorted along any one of the axes. For example, for a two-dimensioned array, first axis (axis=0) is the direction of the rows. Second axis (axis-1) is the direction of the columns. If axis=0, array is sorted columnwise (rows of each are in sorted order). If axis=1, array is sorted rowwise (columns of each row are in sorted order). If axis is not specified (axis=None), then the array is flattened to a one-dimensioned array and sorted. To carry out the actual sorting, use one of the well known algorithms for sorting, such as quicksort or bubble sort (or anything better). 169 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Nilay Brahmbhatt
