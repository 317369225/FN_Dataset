How many ways to arranges a arrays of number where none of them present at it's initial positions?You may be familiar with combinations and permutations. What you're asking about is called a "derangement", which means a permutation such that the position of each item is not its original position. n!∑ n k=0 (−1) k k!   n!∑k=0n(−1)kk! http://oeis.org/wiki/Number_of_d... In code, this could be expressed as function derangements(n) { if (!n) return 1; if (n === 1) return 0; if (n === 2) return 1; return (n - 1) * (derangements(n - 1) + derangements(n - 2)); } Count Derangements (Permutation such that no element appears in its original position) - GeeksforGeeks 186 Views · View Upvotes
