How can I find the index of an element in an array in C?For example, if I have an array with 1000 elements with all the first 1000 prime numbers but is stored in an unsorted way. Is there any way to find the index of a particular prime number without searching through the whole array for the element?If you break out of the search loop once you find what you’re looking for, then on average you will only search through half the array. It’s still O(N) though. If you’re allowed to change the order of the items in the array, then you could sort it and then use binary search, which would be O(log(N)) for each index lookup. Assuming the order of the items doesn’t change, you could use a hash table to map each prime number to its index in the array. You’d make one pass through the array at the start to populate the hash table with (item, index) pairs. Then you could look up an item’s index in the hash table in practically O(1) time. (I use the qualifier “practically” because, technically, a hash table lookup is O(N), where N is the number of items stored in the table. But if the hash table array is large enough and the hashing function works well, then in practice a lookup happens in O(1) time.) 80 Views · View Upvotes
