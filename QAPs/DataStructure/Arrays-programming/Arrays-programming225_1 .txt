Which one of the following is efficient? for (int I = 0; I < arr.length; I++) // arr is a array or int limit = arr.length;// arr is a array for (int I = 0; I < limit; I++)I will go with first with prefix ++i . Prefix operator generates less assembly in case of c and c++. Assigning it to limit is ok if arr itself does not change in the for loop, but is a bug if arr itself is changing . Also compiler will also optimize this code is to elide the function calls if arr actually does not change . 117 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Pugazhendhi S.p
