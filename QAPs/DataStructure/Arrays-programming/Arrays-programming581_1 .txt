How do I convert between 1-based and 0-th based index?Suppose I have an array of binary heap with 1-based index. To access a node's parent I need to use index/2. If I want to change this array into 0-based, how do I think about it mathematically ? If possible, please provide a way on generalization for any possible formula like index*4+7The idea is to keep the two indices alongside each other: a one-based index and a different index. The one-based index we'll call i, and the other index we'll call j. Now we know how to get to the parent, left child and right child in the i-index: parent(i)=i/2 leftch(i) = 2i rightch(i) = 2i+1 But the problem is, we now want to switch to our j-index and work out how to get to the parent and the children in terms of j. To do so, we define functions to convert an i-index to a j-index, and vice versa. Given a j, we then first convert to the corresponding i, then we go to the parent or child in the way defined above, and then we convert back to a j. Example. We already decided that i is the 1-based index, now let j be a 0-based index, so j(i)=i-1 and i(j)=j+1. We are indexing a binary heap with j and we want to know the parent and children. We first convert j to i, which is i(j), then go to the parent, parent(i(j)) in the way we know how, and then convert back to a j-index. All together this becomes j(parent(i(j))) = j(parent(j+1)) = j((j+1)/2) = ((j+1)/2)-1 = (j-1)/2. For the children we can do the same thing, for example j(rightch(i(j)) = j(rightch(j+1)) = j(2(j+1)+1) = 2j+2. 144 Views  View Upvotes
