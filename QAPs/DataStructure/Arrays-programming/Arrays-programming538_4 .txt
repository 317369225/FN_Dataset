Can anyone make me clear how to use multidimensional array and how it works?A multidimensional array is simply an array whose elements are also arrays. The simplest example of a bidimensional array is a table: 2 4 6 4 8 12 8 16 24 This data, sometimes referred to as a matrix, is an array of three arrays. In Ruby, you could represent it like this: matrix = [ [2, 4, 6], [4, 8, 12], [8, 16, 24] ] If you check its size: > matrix.size => 3 If you check its first element: > matrix.first => [2, 4, 6] ...which is an... > matrix.first.class => Array You can have N-dimensional arrays. Here's one in four dimensions: hyper = [ [ 'one', 'two', 'three', [4, 5, ['six', 'seven', 'eight'] ] ] ] There we have an array whose first and only element is an array whose fourth element is an array whose third element is an array. Multidimensional structures are incredibly useful in programming. Think, for example, of how you'd represent an image. It's made of pixels, and each pixel has a colour. The colour code can be a value between 0 and, say, 255. Therefore, to represent images, you need a matrix which is an array of pixel rows, each containing pixel colour codes. But if your pixel also has various brightness levels, you need to store, for each pixel, the colour code and the brightness code. That means storing an array of two elements per each element of the rows in the big array. It's not as hard as it seems. If you want to try your hand at some array operations, I recommend my graphical learning tool Foxo, which I've created specifically to help beginners such as yourself. 152 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Prem raj Luintel
