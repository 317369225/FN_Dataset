How do I find all the subarrays of an array in increasing order of their lengths?For {1,2,3} i donâ€™t want {1},{1,2},{1,2,3},{2},{2,3},.. and so on. I want {1},{2},{3},{1,2},.. and so on.Its simple, First gather sub arrays starting form index 0 then index one then till n - 1 For( int start = 0; start < n; start++ ){ For( int end = start; end < n; end++ ){ print elements from A[ start ] to A[ end ]; } } If you want them to print in order of length suppose , First sub arrays of length of 0 then length one and so on there will be a slight change Iterate through All lengths and for each length iterate for all start positions For( int length = 1; length <= n; lenght++ ){ For( int start = 0; start < n; start++ ){ int end = start + length - 1; if( end >= n )break; print elements from A[ start ] to A[ end ]; } } 84 Views  View Upvotes
