How can I write a code with 2 loops for this question?Given that you have integers and I assume that the range of span r << N (total numbers). why don't you tweak count sort method, which runs in linear time and gives you lot more details about the array . Say your number range is r, allocate a boolean array (initialized with false) of size r and now traverse through the elements in original array. If you encouter a number num, then toggle the value at index num in the boolean array. At the end of the iteration only two indices in the boolean array will be true. So, you got your non-repeating numbers. 201 Views  View Upvotes
