How do I learn C programming in Arrays and Strings?I am learning C in my second semester,but cannot understand these 2 concepts,some links,notes or videos would be helpful.In the simplest way I can explain these 2 concepts are: Arrays - think of these as a group/list of homogenous variables. Meaning, think of an array as a collection of integers or characters. Whatever you can do with 1 variable/integer, you can do with an array. Eg: If you have 2 variables 'a' and 'b', both of type int and you add these and store in variable 'c'. Then, you can do c=a+b, but, if i give you 100 variables similar to 'a' and 'b' and ask you to store their sum in 'c' , will you manually add them? If yes, then you will be writing 100 lines of code and committing some mistake or the other, and if no, then you will use some sort of collection to store these values and then add them. This will not only reduce your lines of code, it will also lessen the scope of error. All you will have to do is : for(i=0; i<100; i++) c+=arr[i]. Hence, think of arrays as collection of variables and instead of giving them separate names and calling them by their name, you are giving the entire collection a common name, say 'arr' and then you are referencing each variable using the array name followed by index of the variable like arr[0] for 'a' and arr[1] for 'b' and so on. String - C technically has nothing called a string. Everything is just an array of characters. Treat them that way and it should make things easy for you. Each character of a string can be referenced using 'str[i]' and the entire "string" can be printed using "printf("%s",str);" 83 Views  View Upvotes
