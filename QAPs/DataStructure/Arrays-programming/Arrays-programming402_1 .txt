How do I open files using array in C?First, to get the values of 1 through 5 in your loop variable, you need to start your loop at 1 (not at 0) and continue looping as long as i <= 5. (Your current loop will run the variable from 0 through 4.) Inside the loop, create an array of characters (buffer) to store the path name, and call the sprintf function, specifying your path name buffer as the destination, "C:\\Users\\Desktop\\file%d.txt", and the loop variable i as the third argument. The sprintf function is just like printf, understanding the same formatting sequences, but instead of printing to the output device, it deposits the formatted string into the destination buffer and null-terminates the string for you. Notice that the format string includes the drive letter (assuming C:, in this case), and each of the backslashes must be doubled, so that they are not interpreted as character escape sequences. \\ in a string literally means a single backslash. Once you've done this, you can call fopen, passing in the address of your path name buffer as the first parameter. This approach should let you open the following files in sequence: C:\Users\Desktop\file1.txt C:\Users\Desktop\file2.txt C:\Users\Desktop\file3.txt C:\Users\Desktop\file4.txt C:\Users\Desktop\file5.txt This all assumes that your five files already exist in C:\Users\Desktop, but if this is Windows, there's likely another directory needed in the path, so you would need top change your sprintf format string accordingly. 233 Views  View Upvotes
