How is development multidimensional?Development is Multidimensional •There are biological dimensions. For example, the comfort an upset child receives from her mother's loving embrace, utilizes the biological component of touch, while providing the child with emotional reassurance (cognitive) that all will be okay, and lastly, helps the socioemotional process by creating a stronger emotional bond with the mother. Biological processes are exhibited through the physical changes an individual undergoes through the course of their life. The biological changes include both normal and abnormal growth and development in the body. Going through puberty, for example, is a normal biological process that occurs during the development of an individual. •There are cognitive dimensions. Cognitive processes are exhibited through the changes in an individual's language, thoughts and intelligence. Human naturally grow and develop in their cognitive functioning, learning to rationalize and communicate more effectively as they grow and develop. The ability to make decisions, as well as more accurate judgments, usually increases as an the individual ages. For example, a baby develops their ability to speak around a year or so of age. This ability continues to develop over a span of many years. •There are socioemotional dimensions  Socioemotional Processes are exhibited through the changes to an individual's relationships with others.
