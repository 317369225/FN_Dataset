What is difference between array of character and string?Originally Answered: What is the difference between character array and string? Character array forms a string. Hence it is just sequence of characters followed by a null character. So character is just like a building block to the string as it composes it. It is easier to deal with the strings as most of the inbuilt functions are already available in the library. However, there is no such data type for string in C. 39 Views
