What is the best way to flatten a nested array into one array?Recursively. Initialize the resulting array empty. Process your outer array element by element. If the element is a simple element, and not an array, you can add it directly to the resulting array. That's the base case. If the element is an array, then you will flatten it recursively, and add to the resulting array all the elements in the flattened array. Once you have processed all the elements, you are done and can return the new array. Note that an array with varying levels of nesting is conceptually equivalent to a generic (n-ary) tree. What you have to do is, in essence, an inorder traversal of the tree. 217 Views  View Upvotes
