How can I swap two strings within an array of strings (2D array) without using an additional string?So many half-right answers! Unfortunately half-right is not good enough for a computer. First of all you can't swap two strings that are of different strlen(), unless you also know the true max allocated space for each string, and that you know that the strings are not string constants, neither of which info which C provides as part of the parameter, so you're kinda stuck. So let's assume both strings are in read-write memory, not constants, and are the same length. This sounds like a question from a rather poor textbook, but let's continue on. Perhaps in the previous chapter they showed you the magical properties of XOR, and perhaps you can extend that to the magical transitive property of subtraction. Which is a bit dangerous as characters may be signed or unsigned and you can get in trouble sometimes due to that. But anyway you can use XOR to sort-of store the info of both into the first, then bash the first over the second, and so on. I can't imagine why you would ever want to do that. A *much* better approach, if you think your code is going to be doing a lot of string-swapping, is to *not* ever move any of the strings, that is an expensive operation. Instead keep a separate array of pointers or indices tot he strings, and just swap the indices. That can run thousands of times faster than a string swap as it only involves moving 4 to 8 bytes of pointer or index. 1.7k Views  View Upvotes
