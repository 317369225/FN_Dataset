What is the space complexity of an ArrayList containing references to TreeNodes?It's O(n) memory (and time, for that matter). As n gets bigger, the array gets longer and takes up more and more memory. Each spot in the array contains a pointer to something else. It's the same "something else", yes, but the pointers are all there, doing their thing, taking up space. 10.2k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Rakesh Reddy
