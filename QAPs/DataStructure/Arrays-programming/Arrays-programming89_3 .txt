How do you insert and search array with undefined size in C?Insertion is at the end of current last position (how to use malloc and calloc functions here?). Also, how to search array with undefined size?As a programmer myself, I would say: use realloc, Luke! This system function is supposed to grow or shrink pieces of memory. As to undefined size of an array, there is one common trick. Make the last array element special, so that you know when to stop. Often, this element is 0 pointer, if you have an array of pointers, of, maybe, some number you don't expect to appear among your data. 54 Views
