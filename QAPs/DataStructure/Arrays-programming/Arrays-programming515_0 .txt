In Swift programming; How do I Load different arrays when different buttons are pressed?I have a viewcontroller and a tableviewcontoller. In my viewcontroller I have 6 different buttons which (when pressed on) should load different arrays (in the same) tableview controller. Just need to be pointed in the right direction please!The way I'd do it is as follows Assuming your 6 arrays are called array1, array2, ...array6. And your table view is myTableView. Set the table view controller data source to load from an array. Let's call it var currentArray:[same type as your arrays]?. This basically means the TVC DataSource ALWAYS uses the currentArray. Now you have 7 arrays. Your 6 and the new currentArray. Initially point it to On button tap, set the currentArray pointer to the corresponding array. Reload the table view. Code example func buttonTapped(sender:UIButton) { if(sender == button1) { currentArray = array1 } else if (sender == button2) { currentArray = array2 } // the rest of the buttons. Then at the end reload the table view myTableView.reloadData() } Let me know if you need more info. 190 Views  View Upvotes
