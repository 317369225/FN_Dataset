How do you assign value in arrays?When creatinng: int foo[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; std::array<int, 5> bar = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; std::vector<int> snafu = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // I'll assume std::vector will be acceptable for this question Otherwise: foo[1] = 99; *(foo+2) = 7; *(3+foo) = 1; 4[foo] = 5; bar[1] = 6; bar.at(1) = 99; bar.data()[1] = 42; 1[bar.data()] =7; bar.front() = 1; bar.back() = 1;... snafu[1] = 1; snafu.at(1)=1,snafu.data()[1]=1, 1[snafu.data()]=1; ... and more... many ways, really. (Some of these are only present in c++11 and onwards though). With std::vector you can of course add, remove, emplace and manipulate data in even more ways. 306 Views  View Upvotes
