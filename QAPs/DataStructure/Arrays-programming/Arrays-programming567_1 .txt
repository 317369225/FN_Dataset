How Numpy's array and matrix type are stored in memory?Here is the documentation on Numpy implementation on matrix internals: numpy/numpy And from the detailed description, it is obvious that the data structure is very flexible: it tries to cater for different sizes of matrix, sparsity of matrix, and transpose operation etc. As mentioned within: transposition of matrix does not change the position of data element in memory, but only the metadata information that point to it. Memory usage also does not increase with increase size of matrix - if nos of data in the matrix does not increased. But most important is that the document indicated there are multiple impementations of storing matrices in memory. 102 Views  View Upvotes
