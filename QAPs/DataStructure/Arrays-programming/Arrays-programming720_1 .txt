I have an array of n integers. How many subarrays are contained in my array?For all distinct elements: If order is to be considered then: nP0 + nP1 + nP2 + .. nPn Else nC0 + nC1 + .. nCn For repeating elements, you may need to divide by p1!*p2!*..pk! where k elements repeats. For combination, you need to use following formula: (n+k-1)!C(k-1)! where k elements repeats. Note: Please correct if you find anything wrong. 302 Views  Answer requested by Jacks Kaiwart
