Is it possible to implement linked list using arrays in Java?This is not a homework question. As far I know Java it is not possible to implement LinkedList using arrays in Java. But my friend and me had a bet and he said that he will prove me wrong. I am scared now, also I am curious to know how one could implement that. If it is possible let me know. Thanks.If you can't resize the array, then you will eventually hit a hard limit if it happens to be more than you allocate. And resizing an array is going to be a real performance hit... So, while you can do it, let me be blunt: it would stink. Just make an array of node structures. The node structure has two integers (one for previous node index, one for next node index) and the actual content (the template type, if there is some analogue for templates). 723 Views
