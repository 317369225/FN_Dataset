How do you access each element of an array by using only pointers in C?The statement at Line 6 increments the content at *arr and not the index itself. By precedence, first the expression inside brackets is evaluated and a post-increment operation is performed on the result. So, when you print *arr again in Line 7, you get the value to be 3 [2+1]. If you want to access each element of the array, you will have to move the index first and then perform de-referencing the value. For example, if you wanted value of the second element of the array, would would say this: *(arr+1). Note : If you want to sequentially access all elements of an array using pointers, a loop would be appropriate. Hope this helps! 88 Views
