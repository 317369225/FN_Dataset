When can I use Arrays over Arraylists in Java? And why?Arrays in Java are much the same as arrays in C, and are quite an inflexible structure. Specifically they have their length defined when the array is declared, so they are fixed length.  This often doesn't play well with real problems, as you often don't know how much space you need, and resizing an array is kludgy and slow. In particular, in lots of real life OO programs, the array might refer to one object, or to thousands. Allocating memory for thousands of object when you need only to hold one object is extremely wasteful.  Arraylists give you everything that an array does, and plenty more besides. The only downside is that they can only hold objects (so primitives have to be boxed) and are a tiny, tiny bit slower than C arrays.  So if you know the number of elements your array is going to hold in advance, and you really, really care about speed, regular arrays are fine. In almost all other situations, some inbuilt (or explicitly created) collection class is the easier and better choice. 230 Views  View Upvotes
