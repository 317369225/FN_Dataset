How can I write a code with 2 loops for this question?Most efficient way has a time complexity of O(n). Your solution has O(n^2) time complexity. The solution with O(n) a time complexity is given below. int find2Numbers(int arr[ ], int max) {  int b[ ] =new int[max];  for(int i=0;i<=max;i++)  b[ i ] =0;  for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)  b[arr[ i ] ] ++;  for(int i=0;i<=max;i++)  if(b[ i ] ==1)  System.out.println(i); }Max is the maximum value in the given array. 130 Views  View Upvotes
