How can I print a previous array using C++?For example I printed "22 24 26" and then I printed "22 24 25" hoe can I print "22 24 26" again?The question answer is... "How can I print a previous array using C++?" C++ Doesn't keep a history of arrays. I'm assuming the code modified the array between the first and second printing of the array. (If not, you have another bug!). You will have to either make a copy of the array before you modify it, and then print that copy, or in some other manner, restore the arrays contents. 181 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
