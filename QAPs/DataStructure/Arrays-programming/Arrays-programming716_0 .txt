What's the best way to learn about one dimensional arrays in programming in C? Are there any simplified methods of learning it?I have an exam next week and I am almost at zero. I would have learned it, but I need to figure it out first, which is where the problem is.Arrays in C are pretty simple - they are just a base address (the address of the first element) and a method for calculating offsets. Declare it an int array and arr[10] means "look 40 bytes after the first element" - it's just "base + sizeof(type) * index". There is no bounds checking or safety of any kind, and no way to find the length of an array from the array itself - you have to store it in a separate variable and pass it around together with the pointer, or it's basically unusable. Writing past the end of an array will often not immediately crash your program, it will just corrupt some other variable that happens to be located after your array in memory. You can do fun things like pass an array from the middle - because they're just a pointer, a length and a calculation method, it doesn't really matter which element you pass as the first, all are valid. Arrays cannot be automatically resized, if it turns out you need more space you have to manually allocate a larger array and copy the elements from the old one. P.S. If it wasn't already obvious, arrays should never be used in the real world. They were a good idea when computers were slow and expensive, but they are a source of very hard to find bugs that may silently corrupt data - the output of a program that uses C arrays (or C in general) should be treated with extreme suspicion. 157 Views  View Upvotes
