How do you remove the last element of an array in c++?If your array is dynamically allocated, you could use realloc from <cstdlib> - however, as indicated by the library name, that's a C library. If your array is an array of pointers, you could delete the object pointed to by the last pointer and set the pointer to NULL. In any other scenario, you're out of luck. If you need a structure that can be addressed like an array and allows for elements to be removed, then what you need is <vector> . 140 Views  Answer requested by Richard Shatz
