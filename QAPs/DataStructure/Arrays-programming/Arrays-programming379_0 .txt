How do you Print inversions of an array?Is this possible using bit or we have to do using mergesort?If you want to print all pairs of inversion, as answer by satwant rana suggests the upper bound will be O(n^2) and nothing fancy like Binary Index Tree or Merge Sort is required. However, if you just want to count all inversion pairs and print that count, then, yes Binary Index Tree can be used with an upper bound of O(n*logn) . Here is an old program I wrote for SPOJ using BIT. Solution is rather self explanatory. Ideone.com 169 Views  View Upvotes
