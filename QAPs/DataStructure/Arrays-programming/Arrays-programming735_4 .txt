How can I swap two strings within an array of strings (2D array) without using an additional string?To think on a hardware level, you probably didn't use a variable anyway. First of all, strings are just pointers, so on a stack machine you push them onto the operand stack directly. You do two loads that push the string onto the stack and pop them and store them in reverse order. There is no simple way you can do that without diving into the wild world of bytecode or assembly. But if you are not using garbage, you compiler would have optimized the extra variable out. So you shouldn't be using another string after all. 745 Views  View Upvotes
