How can I swap two strings within an array of strings (2D array) without using an additional string?I'm going to assume an array of constant strings since the questioner did not specify otherwise: char *array[] = { "hello", "world" }; void *tmp = array[0]; array[0]=array[1]; array[1]=tmp; So all you need is one temporary void pointer which would appear to satisfy the question. 874 Views  View Upvotes
