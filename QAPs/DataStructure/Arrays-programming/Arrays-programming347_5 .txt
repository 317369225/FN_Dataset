How can I find the index of an element in an array in C?For example, if I have an array with 1000 elements with all the first 1000 prime numbers but is stored in an unsorted way. Is there any way to find the index of a particular prime number without searching through the whole array for the element?No. If the array contains unsorted primes there’s no way to find the index of a particular prime without searching the array. If you are given a pointer (ptr) to one of the array elements of type (type) and also have access to the array base pointer (base) you can easily find the index by: index = (ptr-base)/sizeof(type)) 207 Views · View Upvotes
