How do I exclude the elements of one array from elements of second array?It is simple, just check each element from first array in second array and if it is in second array remove it from second array. Sample code to do is following in C language. #include<stdio.h> int main(){ int fa[4]={12, 23, 34, 45}, i, j, k; int sa[8]={32, 25, 12, 65, 45, 85, 47, 36};  for(i=0; i<4; i++) for(j=0; j<8; j++) if(fa[i]==sa[j]){ for(k=j; k<7; k++) sa[k]=sa[k+1]; sa[k]=0; }  for(j=0; j<8; j++) printf("%d\n", sa[j]);  return 0; } Here, in this code fa is first-array and sa is second-array. Loop of i is used to access each element in first-array, loop of j is used access elements in second-array. if is used to check element of first-array in second-array. Loop of k is used to remove an element from second array and swap all elements in second array, 1 position reverse to fill place of removed elements. 13 Views  Answer requested by Surya
