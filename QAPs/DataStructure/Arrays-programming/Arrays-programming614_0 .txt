How a 2 decimal array is initialized in c?What do you mean by a 2 decimal array. Is your question, how is a double precision floating point array initialized in C? ( If it is, please change your question) Assuming that it is the question, a double array is initialized the same way any other array is: pass on the values to be passed with an assignment operator, bounded by braces and individual values separated by commas. There are two methods to initialization : Static Allocation : double Array [3] = {34.7222, 24.91007, 37.88812}; Here, you limit the arrays size by specifying the maximum no. of double variables that the array can store; which in this case is 3. So, the individual indices will have the values: Array [0] = 34.7222; Array [1] = 24.91007; Array [2] = 37.88812; In this method, the compiler knows in advance, the size of the array. Another way to initialize the array is to do so dynamically, that is not specifying the size and letting the compiler figure out its size by counting the no. of values assigned. double Array [ ] = {3.14151967, 23.77712256}; Now, this statement printf ("%d",sizeof (Array) / 8); will yield the output 2 Also, if you were wondering as to what values uninitialized arrays carry, that depends on the storage specified. auto & register types store a garbage value, whereas extern & static are initialized to 0.0 i.e. for floating point variables 95 Views
