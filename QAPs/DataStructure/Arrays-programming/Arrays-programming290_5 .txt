Where are the arrays in C stored, in a stack or a heap?int n; scanf("%d",&n); int arr[n]; In the above code in C, when the progThe reason that the above code doesn't give an error is because its perfectly valid code. You are dynamically creating an array with the size given by the user. You can check for the size of the array by the below statement: printf("%lu", sizeof(arr) / sizeof(int); and you can see that its output shall always be same as n. The reason that most of us feel that the above code is wrong is because we are normally used to dynamic allocation in the heap. But in this case, instead of being stored in the heap, the array is stored in stack, since its a local variable. If you try the above code in C++, you may get an error, as its been dropped since C++11. 4.1k Views  View Upvotes
