What searching algorithm would you apply for the following array and why?Given an array of integers: 12,15,5,14,1,8,6,19,21,18. What searching algorithm would you apply for this array and why?I’d use this one because it’s fast and you didn’t expect it! const int [] indices = { -1, 4, -1, -1, -1, 2, 6, -1, 5, -1, -1, -1, 0, -1, 3, 1, -1, -1, 9, 7, -1, 8 };   // return 0-based index of the given key or -1 if it is not found int search_index(int key) { return key<0 || key>21 ? -1 : indices[key]; } 1.3k Views · View Upvotes
