What is the fastest algorithm to find the largest number in an unsorted array?From a computer theory perspective, as Ken Alverson mentioned, the problem is Embarrassingly parallel. Among other things, this means that you can come out with a parallel algorithm to improve the non-parallel O(N) method. In fact, in Wikipedia you can find an O(1) implementation, using a CRCW PRAM machine (visit link below). The implementation is presented in SystemVerilog language, thus it isn't a theoretic only solution, but it requires an impractical number of processors.
