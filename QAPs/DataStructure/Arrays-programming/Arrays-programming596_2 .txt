Why is C++ so annoying when dealing with arrays and vectors?Why is it not built with ease of use like Matlab?Simply put, C++ (well, C) is designed to be fast. You are perfectly free to write your own bounds checking (which is what languages like Matlab do under the hood) but you don't have to. If you know what you are doing and design your algorithms never to be able to access invalid memory, then you don't lose speed over wasted overhead of unnecessary conditionals. So it gives you more control and power, at the expense of safety and learning curve. 7.4k Views  View Upvotes
