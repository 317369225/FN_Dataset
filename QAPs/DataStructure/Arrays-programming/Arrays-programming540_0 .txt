What is the maximum range, a array can be made in C,because when I write the code and defining array size of the order of 10^9, program crashes?THESE ARE COMPLETELY MY ASSUMPTIONS It completely depends on the compiler. Basically normal compiler(if you are using a 64-bit compiler) can access a single instruction of (2^64-1) bits. If you have taken your float data type in your array, there may be data insufficiency. Or another hypothesis are you using any concepts of recursion or if you have done illegal looping in your program. Advice: If you have data of such complexity, I advice you to use Apache Hadoop and process them according to your requirement. Could you provide screenshots of the code and error in your screen. I have faced similar issue, may be I could help you? 152 Views
