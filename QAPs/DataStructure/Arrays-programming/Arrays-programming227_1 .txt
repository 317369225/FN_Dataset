In C language, ten floats are to be stored in the memory. What would you prefer, an array or a structure?It depends on your requirement. If you want a fixed storage, array is always the better option. If you want your data structure to be extensible, you better go with dynamic allocation. Depends on the compiler (32-bit or 64-bit), a structure might occupy more space because of padding for the same number of objects. 150 Views  View Upvotes
