What is the concept behind this Java code with arrays and adding to arrays?Originally Answered: How does one best understand this Java block of code with arrays? First of all, java's arrays have static size. Once you create one you cannot extend it. The class has two private properties, one is the actual array, the other is the number of element you have added. It has two constructor methods, one has no size so it creates a 5 elements array (with 5 as a default size). The other takes a size and creates an array accordingly. When you add an element the class controls if the array is large enough to contain it, if not then it creates a new larger array and copies all the values from the older one. This is pretty straightforward, if you don't understand this you'd better revise your lessons and start from something simpler. 245 Views  Answer requested by Joshua Borland
