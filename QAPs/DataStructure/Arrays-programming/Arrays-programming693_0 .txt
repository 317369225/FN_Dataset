Is it possible to implement linked list using arrays in Java?This is not a homework question. As far I know Java it is not possible to implement LinkedList using arrays in Java. But my friend and me had a bet and he said that he will prove me wrong. I am scared now, also I am curious to know how one could implement that. If it is possible let me know. Thanks.It's definitely possible. Without even knowing how it's done, you can be sure it's possible: remember that Java objects are just bytes allocated in memory and memory is nothing more than a giant array. The most straight-forward way to implement a Linked List using arrays is called the multiple-array implementation. For singlely-linked lists, maintain two arrays, one for the key and another for the "next" pointer, which is just an index. For doublely-linked lists, you have a third array for the "prev" pointer. Here's what it looks like visually: For a rigorous treatment, refer to chapter 10 of CLRS. If you ever find yourself needing to use a linked list and not having access to a random-access array (rare), this representation actually has several advantages over nodes represented as objects. It is both compact and has good locality of reference. For traversing large linked lists, following object references might cause tons of page faults. In the multiple-array representation, all of your nodes are stored in the same segment of memory. 1.4k Views  View Upvotes
