How do I take one argument (the array) and read five values into the array in C programming using a function?Unless your routine will be called readData5(array), and it only reads 5 elements, you can't. When you are passing the address of an array via a pointer, it doesn't know it's size. You can either 1. Add the size as a an argument to readData(array,sizeof(array)/sizeof(int)) I know it's not what you asked for, but this is the standard way to deal with this situation. 2. You could store the value of the array size in the first int. array[0] = 5. Then readData(array), fetches the size from the first value of the array. This is ugly, because after reading the array, you have lost it's size. 3. The more elegant solution to the above, is to preserve that first int, and make an array structure that has one more integers then the number of data pieces in the array. In other words, array[0]=5, but you readData(&array[1]). Which means the size of the array must be 6 in this case. 4. In the case of strings, they zero terminate the string, and you keep processing it until you get to that zero, or exceed the length of the input buffer size, which then once again, you need to pass the size of that buffer somehow. So your right back where you started. The most common solution is you pass the size as an argument. 155 Views  Answer requested by Mat Perry
