What is the difference between String Array and Character Array?A string array is an array of strings , that is it stores address of a string at every index value , but a character array is an array of characters and hence will store a character at every index value . For example : You can store the names of five different people at five different array index locations in a string array of size 5 , but in a character array you will be able to store 5 characters at 5 different array index values. 424 Views
