What is the difference between an array and a variable?C++ question right ? Many guys at school ask this question and tge answer is very simple. See, basically a variable is an empty/variable space defined by its function (char, int, float etc) in which you can store some value. On the other hand, an array is the set of no of variables denoted by a same cgaracter but by different subscript. Still confused ?? Let me explain it with example. Suppose you are writing a program in which somewhere you havi to punch in your school roll number. So you would simply define a variable of integer function. Suppose you defined a variable int roll; Just simple, no problem right. Now, if you have to punch in roll no of whole class then(suppose of 50 students) then its a huge mess . you have to define total 50 variables then write an program to get all those 50 inputs. Instead if that, what you can simply do is define an array like this : int roll[50] ; and start filling in the data. By writing 50 in the square bracket, you have simply created 50 variables :roll[0],roll[1],roll[2],roll[3],.... And so on upto roll[49]. Total combination of 50 variables. I hope this explains your doubt. :) 1.6k Views  View Upvotes
