How would you explain an "array" to a beginner in programming?My computer science teacher has used the metaphor of an apartment to get his students to understand arrays. An array is like an apartment because (at least in the context of Java and other static languages) both are fixed in size. Apartments and arrays can be built and declared, but nothing's actually in them. Indices of an array can be thought of as like the addresses within the apartment. Both an array and an apartment have a unique name that identifies the group as a whole. 574 Views  View Upvotes
