What is a circular array and how does it work?Can someone provide an example of how and why it works and what would determine if an array is circularIt's just a regular, linear array, whose elements are accessed in a slightly roundabout way: We say that A[x]≡A[r],  A[x]≡A[r], Where x≡rmodn,0≤r<n  x≡rmodn,0≤r<n and n  n is the maximum number of elements in the array. You could implement a function that allows you to access an element by its index, or if your language supports operator overloading, then you could make it look cooler. 251 Views · View Upvotes
