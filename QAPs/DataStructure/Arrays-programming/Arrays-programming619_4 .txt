Which one of the following is efficient? for (int I = 0; I < arr.length; I++) // arr is a array or int limit = arr.length;// arr is a array for (int I = 0; I < limit; I++)If you want to have the best of both worlds then use: for ( int i = 0, limit = arr.length ; i < limit ; ++i ) { // code } Tomorrow 'int' can be replaced with some hairy iterator and prefix ++ may make slight difference. Tomorrow length member can be replaced with some sophisticated method and you won't lose efficiency. With int the compiler will more likely cache 'arr.length' so the efficiency could be the same. 64 Views  Answer requested by Pugazhendhi S.p
