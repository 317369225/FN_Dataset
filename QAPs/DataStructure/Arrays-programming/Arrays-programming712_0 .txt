What will be the C code if I want to print all the entered elements in reverse order without using arrays?(No arrays to be used for storing and printing)This is actually quite simple — #include <stdio.h> int main(void) { int n; printf("Enter the numbers in one line: "); scanf("%d",&n); //store the number sequence in variable n printf("Numbers in reverse order: "); while(n!=0){ //loop till n becomes zero printf("%d",n%10); //printing the last digit of the sequence n=n/10; //removing the last digit from sequence } printf("\n"); return 0; } Here's a working demo. EDIT:     The solution to this problem is rather quite simple. I should have understood it the moment recursion was mentioned. Here's the code: #include <stdio.h> int ctr = 0; void accept(){ int n; if(ctr<5){ printf("Enter a number: \n"); scanf("%d",&n); ctr++; accept(); printf("%d\n",n); } } int main() { accept(); return 0; }     The trick is to use the default stack implementation by the system. A stack works on the LIFO (last in first out) principle. The elements entered by the user are pushed at the top of the stack. Hence, when printing, the last pushed element will be popped first, giving a reverse sequence of the inputs given by user.     Here's a working demo.     This question is actually good to test the basics of a student. 220 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
