Is it possible to have a dynamic contiguous array without its size being fixed internally?Link which contains some details about the question: Is it possible to have a dynamic contiguous array without its size being fixed internally?Not sure i totally understand the question. One can make an array that appears contiguous at the app/language level by doing the underlying memoty allocation in chunks, keeping the chunks in a linked list and mapping index to the chunk/offset. Doesnâ€™t require any copying to increase size. Requires another level of indirection - map to chunk, offset in chunk. You really need to hide this in the language or library implemtentation. 159 Views
