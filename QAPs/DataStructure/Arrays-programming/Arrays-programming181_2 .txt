What is the difference between an array and a variable?A variable is a single value while array is a collection of values. Both of them could be primitive types(int,float,double etc) or objects(String,User etc). Examples: Variables : int i=3,String str="hi"; Arrays : int arr[]={1,2,3},String str[]={"hello","world"}; The important thing about array is that it is stored at a contagious location in memory i.e if there are 5 elements in array they will be stored one after another so if you have a pointer to any element and you increment the pointer with the size of element you can move to next element.
