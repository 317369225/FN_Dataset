How is this code negating all the numbers in my array?Basically you need to know What the function transform does and What the negate<> class does .. lets see the negate Class : template <class T> struct negate {  T operator() (const T& x) const {return -x;}  typedef T argument_type;  typedef T result_type; }; As you can see above , The operator () is overloaded And Which take a type of template with Which it was Instantiated , in your case int . So clear till now . Next, Transform function has 2 kind Of API , one which takes unary operator like negate(in your case) and some time Binary operator (like plus<>, because they need 2 operand to add ). Now in your case its first type of API which takes a unary operator . transform (a, a+size, a, negate<int>()); So , it acts on a array a to a+size , and pass each value to negate<int>(a[i)), Get the result from that operator () , and store it in a (third param) Hope its clear . 137 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
