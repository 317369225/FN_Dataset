How do I write a program that count the occurrence of each element in an int array of size 25?For C language!Thanks for the A2A! One of the beauties of programming languages is that you can learn to program while learning to write algorithms at the same time. I propose you write the algorithm yourself, I'll write one myself -- and then we can learn from our code together in the comments section. Otherwise I'm just doing your homework, aren't I? 201 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Ukkasha Salman
