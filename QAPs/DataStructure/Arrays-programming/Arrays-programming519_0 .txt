How do I sort this array in linear time?You are given k = O(1) unsorted integer arrays A1, A2, . . . , Ak. Each array Ai contains n elements s.t. Ai[j] âˆˆ {1 . . . n}. Another array C is defined as the the prod of Ai, i.e. C[j]=prod(A1[j],A2[j],...,Ak[j]). How to sort C in linear time?Find an upper bound on the values in C. Then show that a radix sort can take linear time. 155 Views  View Upvotes
