I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.In the second loop set i=n-1 Because an arrays index always begins with 0 :) Example:- for 5 numbers You have a[0] a[1] a[2] a[3] a[4] And also in the same loop in the last condition(updating) It should be i-=1 or i=i-1 It should work fine now :) 51 Views
