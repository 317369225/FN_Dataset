Can we create array of reference?Hi... C++ Standard 8.3.2/4: There shall be no references to references, no arrays of references, and no pointers to references Also References are not objects. They don't have storage of their own, they just reference existing objects. For this reason it doesn't make sense to have arrays of references. If you want a light-weight object that references another object then you can use a pointer. You will only be able to use a struct with a reference member as objects in arrays if you provide explicit initialization for all the reference members for all struct instances. References cannot be default initalized 125 Views  View Upvotes
