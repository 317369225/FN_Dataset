How do I load various Arrays in the same TableViewController in SWIFT?I want to load a different array into my TableViewController once a certain button is pressed. E.g.: breakfast, dinner, lunch etc... I have no idea how my tableviewcontroller.swift file can recognize a button being pressed...Does anyone have a idea or demo file somewhere for me too look at?The Xcode project on github: SwiftArrayIntoTableViews is a good example of what I think you want. You click on a menu item and you are taken to a detailed view showing the content of the array associated with that menu item: For example, clicking on the Lunch menu which has a corresponding array: let lunch = ["Salmon & Rice", "Chicken & Rice", "Potatoes & Veggies", "Pizza", "Burger & Fries"] will take you to a detailed view controller with each item from your array populated: As of this writing, the project was written and tested in Xcode v7.2.1 (7C1002). The main storyboard has: One Split View Controller Two Navigation Controllers Two View Controllers It serves the purpose of Universal viewing on both iPhones and iPad devices. The SplitView Controller provides a Master and Detail view. The default ViewController (Food Menu) is the master view. When a menu is clicked (e.g. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc...) the associated array will have its content displayed in the detailed view (Table View Controller) via a Storyboard segue. The view controller code is very simple and contains three arrays of type String: import UIKit  class ViewController: UIViewController { let breakfast = ["Pancakes", "Bacon & Eggs", "Grits", "Oatmeal", "Cream of Wheat"] let lunch = ["Salmon & Rice", "Chicken & Rice", "Potatoes & Veggies", "Pizza", "Burger & Fries"] let dinner = ["Salad", "Pasta", "Tea & Crackers", "Milk & Cookies", "Fried Eggs"] override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) { if let ourNavigationController = segue.destinationViewController as? UINavigationController { // destination as? UINavigationController if let advc = ourNavigationController.visibleViewController as? TableViewController { if let identifier = segue.identifier { switch identifier { case "ShowBreakfast": advc.menuTitle = "Breakfast" advc.menuItems = breakfast case "ShowLunch": advc.menuTitle = "Lunch" advc.menuItems = lunch case "ShowDinner": advc.menuTitle = "Dinner" advc.menuItems = dinner case "ShowButton4": advc.menuTitle = "Button 4" default: break } } } } } } that essentially allows for your array content to to appear via a segue in the TableView. The TableViewController, likewise only implements the necessary TableView data source protocols: import UIKit  class TableViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource { // MARK: Member variables var menuTitle: String?...
