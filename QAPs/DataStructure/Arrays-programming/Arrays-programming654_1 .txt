What do I need to add to this C code to show the content of the array using a pointer?You forgot to declare the variable i, the main function is missing a return type (ignoring the fact that the default return type would be int in this case anyway), the #include line is incorrect and the main function returns no value, the for loop will only work for arrays with the size of 5. Coming to your question: That code looks like a homework and I found a very similiar code on the internet after searching for 10 seconds. There are two ways to get the value from the variable, the pointer is assigned to, which will match the 'code style': printf("%d: %d \n", i, (*ip + i)); printf("%d: %d \n", i, ip[i]); // same as above 59 Views  View Upvotes
