What is num [I++] when I=0 where num is an array?If your code is somewhat like this:(Here written in C/C++ for example) int x; int i=0; int num[5]={1,2,3,4,5}; x=num[i++]; Then the value of x is 1 i.e. the zeroth element of num array. What happens here in the fourth line is equivalent to: x=num[i]; i=i+1; Because in i++ , ++ is working as post-increment operator. That's why i is incremented after the execution of x=num[i]. If your code was like: x=num[++i]; Then, i would be incremented at first ,then x=num[i] will execute. Hope that helps! 100 Views  View Upvotes
