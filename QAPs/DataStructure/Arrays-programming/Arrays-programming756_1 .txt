Why is my solution for adding two binary arrays not working?Firstly I dont think Quora is a place to ask your debugging issues to people. There are other places and forums on the web which are made for these things. Now because you have asked, I will reply. Well you are making your code run from left to right to find the sum, whereas in ur maunal calculations, you do it from right to left. Just invert the arrays a and b, and you should get the answer. 753 Views  View Upvotes
