How can we create an array of size 1 million? Or continous memory allocation of 1 million variables?It does not happen like that, In the practical scenario we do never have array of 1 Million Bytes , If requirement is to have Millions entries then we can distribute the Entries Over different machines or within machine. But I tried declaring 1Million Bytes char array and It worked, But it is not surely a good approach. #include <stdio.h> char array[1000000]; // Storing in Data Section int main() {  printf ("%p", array);  return 0; } It can create a problem when requirement is also need to keep whole data in RAM ( Disabling Swapping). Basically data is paged So It may not be necessary to get that stored contiguously from OS point of view. Low Level Aspect : Larger array may not get benefits of underlying Cache Memory (Please Check Spatial and Temporal Locality and Loop Inter change). 270 Views  View Upvotes
