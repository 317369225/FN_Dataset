What is the fastest algorithm to find the largest number in an unsorted array?If one is determined to do this deterministically (as opposed to a probabilistic search), one unfortunately has to touch every number in the array. I don't want to add to the algorithms mentioned above, but rather to a very speedy method of calculating the MAX from a stream: FPGA's. Even a simple Altera FPGA can accommodate very fast streams (see Page on velocidata.com's offerings) , comparing somewhat favourably to disk stream speeds. 4.9k Views  View Upvotes
