How do you empty the contents of an array?Something like 'Array.clear()' in javaIf you are not passing the array to a function, just do: //say you have array arr, and say the array is an int[] arr = new int[0]; Be careful if you are passing the array to the function. Note that the code above actually modifies the reference of arr, so passing it to a function won't modify the array. 216 Views  View Upvotes
