When creating an array, is there shorter way to assign objects to the array?(Javascript)Can you use an assignment operator to create an object when creating an array?When creating an array, is there shorter way to assign objects to the array?(Javascript) “Shorter” is a comparative, meaning it requires you to specify the thing you compare it to… shorter than what?
