Why is there a need of dynamic arrays if we have variable length arrays?int a[v]; //Variable length array int *p=(int *)malloc(v*(sizeof(int)); //Dynamic array Both create the memory based on the value entered by the user, then why is there a need of Dynamic memory allocation of arrays? I am not looking for the answer that in Dynamic array we can do reallocation's.Variable length array is a fixed array structure, that you need to define beforehand in your program. Think while you program is executing then you need to allocate a memory space for which you have already defined a fixed length array. If the size required is more than what you have declared then you will get an error. That is why dynamic array is required. It completely depends on how actually you want your program to behave. 54 Views
