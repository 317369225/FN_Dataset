How do I create 2D array whose number of rows is not known?You could either make a linked list of rows so that new rows can be added as necessary or you could make an array with a fixed number of rows and if you run out of rows (or have to access a row whose index number is currently out of range), copy the array into a new array that has double the number of rows. 40 Views  Answer requested by Sujeet kr.
