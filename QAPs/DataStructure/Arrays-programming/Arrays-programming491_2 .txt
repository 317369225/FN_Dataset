How do you remove the last element of an array in c++?To be precise, you cannot remove the last element, since arrays, either T[] or std::array<T,N> are fixed size and the length cannot be modified.. For a vector X, X.resize(X.size()-1) works for non empty vectors. 1.4k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Richard Shatz
