Are two-dimensional arrays possible in Verilog?I want to store a 2D matrix(float numbers) and do some operations with it like matrix inversion, matrix multiplication etcYes it is possible . Suppose i want a memory of 8 locations, each of 4 bits. so take this module, module array(); reg a,b,c; reg [3:0] MEM [7:0]; endmodule //Now if you want to access each location use any loop for example take for loop. initial begin for(i=0;i<=7;i=i+1) {a,b,c}=MEM[i] [2:0]; end //So here everytime for loop runs ‘i’th memory location will be selected and last 3 bits of that memory location will be assigned to a,b,c. Hopefully it is clear to everyone. 4 Views
