How can I swap two strings within an array of strings (2D array) without using an additional string?I'd go with XOR myself but I do want to point out you said without a string not a variable. If readability is your goal all we need is a char. int swap_samelen_string(char *s1, char *s2) { char c; if(strlen(s1)!=strlen(s2)) return(1); // Error for(;*s1;s1++,s2++) { c=*s1; *s1=*s2; *s2=c; } return(0); } To make it safe it checks the string lengths are equal and if not, returns 1 for error. It will return 0 on success. 1.6k Views  View Upvotes
