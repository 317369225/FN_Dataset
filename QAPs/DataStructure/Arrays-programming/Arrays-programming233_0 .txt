How do I copy an array to another array in C# using copyto() method?Take a look at this documentation about this function on MSDN @Array.CopyTo Method (Array, Int32) maybe this will clear things out for you. But for my part I will just say that it's a simple function that takes two parameters, an array (destination) and an Index which tells the function where to start copying from the source array. for eg. int[] ar1 = {1,2,3,4,5}; int[] ar2 = new int[10]; ar1.copyTo(ar2,0); this will copy all the five elements of the ar1 array to the ar2 array, as the starting index specified is 0. Also note that it will show an exception if the destination array's size is insufficient. Hope, it helps 1.1k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Krishnamurthy Anantharamakrishnan
