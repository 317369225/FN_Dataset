How do you find an array's length or size in C?Originally Answered: C (programming language): How do you find the size of an array in C with the following declaration? // Number of elements in the array size_t array_size = *(&array + 1) - array; Considering the array arr[] : &arr is a pointer to the array. It points at the same memory address as arr. But arr decays to a pointer to first element. Hence &arr + 1 points at the address after the end of the array. Dereferencing to *(&arr + 1) gives the address after the end of the last element (which is again the same address as &arr + 1 with a different type; Similar to arr and &arr as *&arr is equivalent to arr). Finally, we can subtract the pointer to the first element to get the length of the array: *(&arr + 1) - arr. (Remember this is pointer arithmetic; Subtraction gives the total number of objects between them).
