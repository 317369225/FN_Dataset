How does one understand looping through an array of Strings?Length is a property of arrays which states the number of items your array can contain. In arrays elements are numbered starting from 0. So if your array has 10 elements they will be numbered from 0 to 9. The for loop here is wrong since it will check for the index being less than length - 1, hence 5. So once i is equal to 5 it will exit the loop, missing the last name. You can correct the code by removing the - 1 (preferably) or comparing by less than-equal (<=, less preferably) and leaving the -1. 8 Views  Answer requested by Remy Kirsch
