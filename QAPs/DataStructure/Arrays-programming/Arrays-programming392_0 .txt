How is an integer array in c stored?It depends on where it’s declared. If it’s declared as a global or module scope variable, or is static, it goes into a special area of memory that is neither stack nor heap. It is a persistent area of memory that comes into existence the moment the program starts running. If it’s declared inside a function, it’s allocated on the stack. These days I believe integers in C are stored as 32 bits (could be wrong). An array of integers is stored as a contiguous block of 4 bytes x size-of-array. It’s stored in binary. To send it over HTTP, you need to convert it to text (a character array). There are formatting functions in the standard library that will help you do this, such as sprintf(), though producing a coherent string version of an integer array will involve using a loop, and pointer arithmetic into a character array buffer. 352 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Matt Bulova
