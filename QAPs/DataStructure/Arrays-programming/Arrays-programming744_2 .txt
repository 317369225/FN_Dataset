What is the difference between multi-dimensional arrays in Java vs. C?The approach in C is as native as it can be. The memory itself is always one dimensional, unless you've multiple RAM chips and a parallel bus and some arrangement in OS to store 2 dimensional array in these two chips. The Java implementation is an abstraction and you feel it's a two dimensional approach. There's no way you understand how exactly it's implemented (you can directly check, although you can get theoretical knowledge). Hence the memory access remains a bit faster in C, it takes lesser clock ticks to get to the required memory area, which is why C remains the favorite for OS development, driver development etc however Java guarantees better memory management which might make data access slower but the software is sturdy and doesn't crash. 1k Views  View Upvotes
