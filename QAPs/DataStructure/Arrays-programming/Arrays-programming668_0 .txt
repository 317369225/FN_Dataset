What are the advantages of pointer over the array in c or c++?Pointers are more efficient in handling arrays and data tables. They can be used to return multiple values from a function via function arguments. Pointers permit references to functions and thereby facilitating passing of functions as arguments to other functions. The use of po0inter arrays to character strings results in saving of data storage space in memory. pointers allow C to support dynamic memory management. Pointers provide an efficient tool for manipulating dynamic data structures such as structures, linked lists, queues, stacks and trees. Pointers reduce length and complexity of programs. They increases the execution speed and thus reduce the program execution time. in short more flexible than array. 408 Views  View Upvotes
