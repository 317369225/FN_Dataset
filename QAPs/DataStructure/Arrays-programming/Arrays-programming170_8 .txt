What is the fastest algorithm to find the largest number in an unsorted array?If you're storing the numbers in a database for subsequent use then you might want to think about Denormalization. "denormalization is the process of attempting to optimize the read performance of a database by adding redundant data or by grouping data". Every time you store a number, you can check to see if it's the largest one by checking one value - the one you've already abstracted and stored in a denormalized way. So, you always have an abstracted record of the largest number which is determined at the time you write it to the database by comparing it with one number. 2.7k Views  View Upvotes
