I've written several RFCs and implementations of useful JavaScript functions that extend the string, array, and object prototypes. Where can I petition to have them added to the next release of JavaScript?I would suggest releasing a library and getting some usership first. They are pretty slow to add things to the Javascript spec. If they were quick to add things that people find useful, you would expect jQuery to be added to the language itself (considering it's used on 90% of sites now). Maybe you'd be willing to share some of the stuff so we know what it is and why it should be in the core? 1.3k Views  View Upvotes
