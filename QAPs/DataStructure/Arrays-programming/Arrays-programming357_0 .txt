What is the optimized code for counting the occurrences of a particular element and in unsorted array?Well in languages like c++ you have stl support and you can use the container (map). C++ implementation pseudo code: map<int,int> mp;//mp is a container which maps two integer values // It acts in The following manner Key->value; //now run a loop for the element and increment the value part by keeping the key constant. for(int i=0;i<n;i++) { mp[a[i]]++; } //this will store the element in the key place and value i.e the number of occurences in the value place. //for ex. you have ‘11′ 5 times in the array. then mp[11]++ will occur 5 times and value will be 5 and key is 11; For accessing this container you need to create an iterator. map<int,int>::iterator it; Map is an implementation of red-black tree and is sorted in order of its key. C implementation:- take an array of max size. ex. int arr[100005];//array of 10^5+5 for overflow conditions next do the same which was done with map here. for(int i=0;i<n;i++) { arr[a[i]]++; } //this will increment the respective position of the element. //to access any element later you need to know the specific number first.
