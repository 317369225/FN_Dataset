How is array functionally different than other data type?Your question is phrased wrong. An array is not a data type. It is a data structure. A array is a structure which is used to store data elements of the same datatype, which can be accessed using a common name. For example, an array of integers contains a collection of integer values stored in contiguous memory location which can be accessed using a common name. int a[] = {5, 4, 2, 7} ; // Declaring and initializing an array. Each element is indexed (starting from 0) for our reference. To access the element '4', you can simply do a[1] since it is in the second position. 399 Views  View Upvotes
