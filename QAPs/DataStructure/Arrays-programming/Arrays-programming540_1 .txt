What is the maximum range, a array can be made in C,because when I write the code and defining array size of the order of 10^9, program crashes?I hope You are not declaring it on stack ..??!!!!! And again , what kind of data type , the array consisits of ?? is it a int ,,float ,long ?? Anyways if you are declaring it withing any function, that means its in stack ..and remember that in most of the cases stack is limited ..(Normally ~ 2MB) . based on this you can make a calculation of How much data your array consumes .. if its more than 2 MB , then you should declare this globally or allocate dynamically using malloc . 152 Views  Answer requested by Suraj Prakash Sharma
