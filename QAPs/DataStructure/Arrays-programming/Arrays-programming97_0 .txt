What is the best way to flatten a nested array into one array?That's a fun challenge. The key to it is to use JavaScript's Array.isArray method, which goes like this: Array.isArray(yourObject); You can use that to create a conditional like so: if(Array.isArray(yourObject)){ do something; }else{ do something different; } So one solution you might try in Steamroller would be to create a function (which will be an inner function in your solution) that does nothing but determine if something is an array or not. If it's not (ie, it's a number or whatever) then push it into a results array that will eventually be the flattened array that you return. If it IS an array, then this is the fun part: you feed it back to your inner function again, passing the element you're working on as a parameter. This is recursion, basically, but its a simple version of it. It makes for a fairly quick solution, though I'm sure there are code ninjas out there that can do it even faster. My solution was 15 lines of code, not including comments. I could probably tighten it up to 10 if 'lines of code' were that important of a stat. The point is if your answer gets too long you might be on the wrong track. Hope that helps without giving too much away. Feel free to reach out if you need another hint. Congrats on getting so deep into the curriculum! 320 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Darrel Adams
