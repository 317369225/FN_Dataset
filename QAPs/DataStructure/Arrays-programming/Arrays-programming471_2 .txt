How do I scan strings into a pointer array?for instance say I have a pointer array for colours and I initialize it as char *colors[]={"red" , "blue" , "yellow" }; what if I don't want to initialize the pointer array in the code itself? Is there some function of a kind like scanf I can use here?One simple way to do this: char temp[256]; char *strings[3]; for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) { scanf("%s", temp); strings[i] = strdup(temp); } Here I'm declaring the array of characters which is used to store your string temporarily. I declared the array of pointers to hold the address of your input string with every iteration of for loop. In for loop I just ask user to input the string and then strdup returns a pointer to the new string which is duplicate of the input string temp and stores it in strings[i] with each iteration . I hope you understand now! 164 Views  View Upvotes
