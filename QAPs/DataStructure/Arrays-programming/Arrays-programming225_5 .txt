Which one of the following is efficient? for (int I = 0; I < arr.length; I++) // arr is a array or int limit = arr.length;// arr is a array for (int I = 0; I < limit; I++)I agree with Vivek for this case. Though, if you had to call a function to determine the size of the array, #2 is preferred over calling that function on every loop iteration. 84 Views  Answer requested by Pugazhendhi S.p
