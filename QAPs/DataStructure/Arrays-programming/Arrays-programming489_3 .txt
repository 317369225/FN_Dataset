How does one understand looping through an array of Strings?In Java array length represents number of elements in the array. Here 5 elements are provided by you : "Nick", "Josh", "Justin", "Jonathan", "Phil", "Eric". But in computers everything starts from 0(Zero). So Nick is saved at index Zero, Josh at index 1, and so on.. So we have to loop from Zero to Four (total 5 indexes) to print them. names[i] will give what is present at that index to System.out.println and it will print as you know. Ex: names[3] will print Jonathan. I hope i help you understand a bit. Thanks for a2a. 21 Views  Answer requested by Remy Kirsch
