What is the meaning of resizable array in arraylist?You can create a resizable array in Java using ArrayList. "Resizable array" means that the size of the array can dynamically increase or decrease when you are adding or deleting elements to/from the array(in this case ArrayList). As opposed to the primitive arrays, ArrayList don't require you to specify the size of the data structure while creating an ArrayList object i.e. the ArrayList grows/shrink as you start adding/removing elements from the ArrayList. For example int[] a = new int[5]; The above line is an example of primitive array in which you have to specify the size of the array(in this case, 5) which means you can't resize the array.  ArrayList<Integer> a = new ArrayList<Integer>()  The above line is an example of an ArrayList object of type Integer. We haven't defined the size of the ArrayList while creating it, the ArrayList takes care of increasing/decreasing(resizing) the data structure and hence it is an resizable-array implementation. 150 Views  View Upvotes
