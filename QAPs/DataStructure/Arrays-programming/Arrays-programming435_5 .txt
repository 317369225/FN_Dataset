I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.in the line no. 15 of your code you can use for(i=n-1;i>=0,i--) or for(i=n-1;i>=0,i-=1) also your code does not reverses the array, it just prints it in the reverse order 116 Views
