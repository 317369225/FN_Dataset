What is the base address and memory address of the array?Array is a set of consecutive elements i.e., all the elements of array get stored at consecutive memory locations. Lets consider an example of integer array in C. int a[4] ; Let us consider that the starting address of this array in memory is 1000. This value 1000 is nothing but the address of the first element of this array, hence base address. Thus, base address is the address of first element of the array. Let's consider that int is 4 bytes, then Address of a[0] = 1000 Address of a[1] = 1004 Address of a[2] = 1008 Address of a[3] = 1012 From the numbers above, you could very easily work out the formula to calculate memory address of individual element just by knowing base address and width of each element of an array. Hope now you are able to understand the difference between base address and memory address. Thanks for the A2A. 959 Views  View Upvotes
