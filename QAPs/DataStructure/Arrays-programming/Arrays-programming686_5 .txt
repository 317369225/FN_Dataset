How would you explain an "array" to a beginner in programming?A programmer not knowing what an array is, I doubt. Anyway, an array is like a container of similar items, located together, which are ordered by the position of the item within the container. Examples - bookshelves, post office boxes are good examples of arrays in real life. In math - matrix is a very good example. 126 Views  Answer requested by Yogesh Ojha
