What is the reason why NSSet is faster than NSArray?NSArray tests array elements in indexed order, which is not always the most efficient means of finding an element. NSSet uses hash values (unique IDs) to identify set elements, which is quicker in is own right, and will retrieve elements in whatever order it thinks is optimal. I’m not up on the details, but I can see, for instance, how testing whether an object is part of a set would be much faster. Taking a hash of the test object and testing that hash against an ordered list of hashes in the set would be far more efficient than iterating through an array and testing the object itself against all the other objects. 83 Views · View Upvotes
