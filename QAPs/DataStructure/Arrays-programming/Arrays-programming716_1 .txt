What's the best way to learn about one dimensional arrays in programming in C? Are there any simplified methods of learning it?I have an exam next week and I am almost at zero. I would have learned it, but I need to figure it out first, which is where the problem is.If I were you I'd dig up programming exercises about arrays. Do the exercise and do not look at the solution until you've spent several hours on an exercise. There is no better way to learn about anything in programming than just to do it. 167 Views  View Upvotes
