How can I solve problems with two large arrays by avoiding time limit exceeded verdict? For example during comparison of two arrays.Here is an example problem Problem - B - CodeforcesWell, by not using O(nm) O(nm) time, that's how. Sort the first array. Then, for every element bj bj of the second array, do a binary search for it in the first array, to find the first element that is strictly greater. The index you find equals the number of elements less than bj bj in the first array. Not so hard. 2.7k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Atalyk Akash
