Why numeric arrays don't end with a null like strings?Storage of strings poses a very peculiar problem to any language designer and therefore, different languages have adopted different strategies for this. Pascal, FORTRAN, COBOL, LISP, Java - each of them does it differently. The designers of C language (Kernighan and Ritchie) decided to use the strategy of using a null terminator to signify end of string. This eliminates the need to store the size of the string array separately [but leads to other problems!!! :)]. For all other types of arrays in C, we need to store the array size separately. Another reason, the ASCII value of NULL character is 0 which happens to be a valid integer digit. So, we cannot really end an integer array with a null character. 70 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Rohit Khanna
