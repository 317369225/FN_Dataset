How do I get rid of the brackets after splitting an array in Python?There are so many answers to your question but they all depend on what exactly are you trying to do. One possible answer but it will get rid of both brackets and any actual punctuation there is to do it like so: new_list = [str(elem) for elem in art] which is a one liner that is based on some concept in Python called list comprehension. If you are just trying to get rid of the square brackets, you can do it the same way that you have done it, but instead user he following: new_list = [elem.replace("[","").replace("]","") for elem in arr] Which uses the same technique from above but replacing square brackets with nothing. or you can go mad with it and use the regex Python library “re” to remove the brackets from there before splitting the string using the delimiter “,”. 151 Views
