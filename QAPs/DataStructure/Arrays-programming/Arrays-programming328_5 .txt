How can one access specific values within an array?In JS, if every zip code in the US were formatted as: var zipCodes= ([{"ZIP": 10001, "LAT": 40.750633, "LNG": -73.997177 }, etc]) How can one access the LAT or LNG value after the user inputs the ZIP value? Edit: Forgot to state that it’s in javascript. *facepalm*you didn’t specify the language where you will handle this array. if it’s python, then the inner part is a dictionary that can be accessed easily as: a={'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3} a['one']=1 a['three']=3   32 Views · View Upvotes
