How do you remove the last element of an array in c++?Arrays themselves have unchangeable length. This is the usual method for extending or shrinking an array. Copy to a new temporary array with a for-loop or recursive statement, excluding the last element. Delete old array. Create new array with same name as old array. Copy values of temp array into new array. Delete temp array. Linked lists, a data-structure, can be extended or shrunk with greater ease but have their own issues. 101 Views  Answer requested by Richard Shatz
