How do I make all -ve numbers one side and +ve another?Maintain two variables I and J with the former pointing to index 0 and the latter to index last slot. Whenever I points to a positive number and J points to a negative number, swap them. If you have a positive number at both I and j, decrement j until you have a negative number pointed to by J. Similarly for the other half. Finally you would have negative numbers to the left side and positive numbers to the right. 109 Views  View Upvotes
