Are arrays of arrays possible in C?I am aware that multidimensional arrays are possible, but what I need to do is pass a sub-array into another function. For example: if A=[1 2]  [3 4] I need to be able to pass [1 2] or [1 ; 3] (semicolon means new row) as an array into a function.Yes. They are called multidimensional arrays. You can declare an array of size 10 containing array of ints with 20 ints in each array like this: int arr[10][20]; You can access elements in the following way. Suppose you want to access the 5th array's 8th elements: arr [4][7] 65 Views
