Can someone explain data type formatting in arrays?Because in Java there are two integer types (more actually, but let's keep it simple): the primitive int type, and the Integer class. Now, ArrayList and the collection framework in general, works with objects rather than primitive types. Thus, you have to denote the Integer class in the template. Note that thanks to a feature called "auto boxing" you can still [virtually] insert primitive integers to a collection - Java will automatically wrap them in their corresponding class instance. 441 Views  View Upvotes
