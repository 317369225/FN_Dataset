Why don't C++ arrays have an easy way to check their size?Surely someone, somewhere would have thought this was a good idea to have; after all, other languages and other C++ data structures have it -- but why not arrays?I would make a difference between managed data structures (all the STL ones fall in this category) and legacy ones (as arrays, structs and enums). The legacy data structures are by design backward compatible with C, which was designed a long long time ago and aimed at relatively high performance on systems with limited computing power and little memory. Adding size information would have added some overhead, as would have checking bounds (I guess that why one would like to know the size). Conversion between pointers/arrays would also be more complex and so on... That basically means that in C, the software is responsible for bookkeeping size of arrays. Note that C++ mitigates the issue by adding the new [] and delete [] operators. 853 Views  View Upvotes
