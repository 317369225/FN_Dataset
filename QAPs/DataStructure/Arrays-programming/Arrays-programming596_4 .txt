Why is C++ so annoying when dealing with arrays and vectors?Why is it not built with ease of use like Matlab?Arrays in C/C++ are just values laid out one after the other in menory ( a string or sequence of values ). If you think arrays are annoying, you are saying pointers and unrestricted memory access is annoying. You probably want to consider a higher level construct instead such as std::vector which is a wrapper over such a sequence of values but give you all kind of nice features and flexibility. 407 Views  View Upvotes
