I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.when you declare an array of ’n’ items, the maximum index value you can achieve is ‘n-1’ as the index starts from zero. In the second for loop, in which you are printing out the numbers in reverse order, you have tried to print out the value of a[n], which is not initialized by your array, and hence returns a garbage value. Change the for condition in the second loop to this: for(i=(n-1); i>=0;i-1) And keep the rest of code same. I hope this helps. 148 Views · View Upvotes
