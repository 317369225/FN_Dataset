How is this code negating all the numbers in my array?From: transform - C++ Reference template <class InputIterator, class OutputIterator, class UnaryOperation>  OutputIterator transform ( InputIterator first1, InputIterator last1, OutputIterator result, UnaryOperation op ); Above, transform function needs 2 inputs parameters (you gave: a & a+size), 1 output parameter (you gave: a), and a unary operation (you gave: negate<int>()) For you case, transform operation is done on list from 'a' to 'a+size', that is full array. output will stored to back to same array starting at 'a' actual operation performed on input is given as negate - C++ Reference, so it converts your sign to opposite sign (+ve to -ve). So, it converts all 'a' to 'a+size', from +ve to -ve, and store them back to 'a' starting at begin. Hope that helped. Best of luck 105 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
