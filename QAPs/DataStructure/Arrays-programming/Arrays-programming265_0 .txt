What is wrong with this dynamic memory C code?Careful with the & operand together with arrays in line 27! You should write &(firstname[i]) or, another option, firstname+i. Even so, it's still wrong, as you need to give a char* pointer, namely firstname[i] simply like that, without anything else. That's the scanf on line 27. Then, because it overwrites some pointers, you will inevitably access wrong memory. 220 Views  View Upvotes
