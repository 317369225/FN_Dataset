What is wrong with my code C code?As an advice, people won't have time to read through this much of code. You need to be able to replicate the problem in far lesser complexity when asking others to debug for you. Apart from that I see that your methods are not abstracted out properly. Also using pointers for seemingly unnecessary reasons, for instance in case of printing records its unnecessary to pass the_size as a pointer. I would also use a function or macro to print a single record instance of having that knowledge in the function which iterates over the records and prints them. It also seems like you intend to store only 15 records and probably overwrite in case of extra records, if I get this correctly then maybe you should use a circular queue instead. That better captures this idea. Also this knowledge of 15 is captured within a method and not abstracted in a constant somewhere else. This is the problem of magic numbers. You should make a constant or a macro expansion for this. You use comments to explain what you are doing, which is good for reading, however you should try that your code itself documents itself. So when writing, if (the_size == 15) And telling me in comments that this is the maximum number of records you support, if you wrote: if(isMaximumNumberOfRecords(the_size)) This tells me you need to do something when that happens, you don't need to put comments, also it tells me that its not really important what the maximum number of records are. I didn't read the rest of the code - there are too many magic numbers for me. If you still need more help ping me and maybe we can write this together :) 152 Views  View Upvotes
