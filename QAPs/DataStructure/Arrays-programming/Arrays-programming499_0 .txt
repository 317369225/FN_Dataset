What is difference between array of character and string?An array of characters is a collection of character type variables having the same name, but referenced by indices. For example, char arr[]=new char[20]; creates an array of 20 character type variables. String, on the other hand is a sequence of characters either as a literal constant or a variable. The C programming language treats a string as an array of characters terminated by a null character. For example, char arr[]="Quora"; in C, will create an array of characters 'Q', 'u', 'o', 'r', 'a', '\0', where '\0' is the null character. In C++, strings can be represented either as objects of the String class, or as null terminated character arrays. C++ allows mutable strings, which can be changed after creation. On the other hand, languages like Java allow strings to be represented only as objects of String class. In Java, strings are immutable, that is they cannot be changed once they have been created. To create mutable strings, we need to create objects of the StringBuffer class. When represented as object, the individual characters of a string are not stored as individual variables. But when, the string is represented as a character array, each character of the string, including the null character is an independent variable. 263 Views  View Upvotes
