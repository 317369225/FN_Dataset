What is the concept behind this Java code with arrays and adding to arrays?Okay, this is a somewhat contrived pile of code, but after all it is intended to simply demonstrate something, not to provide a model of great coding. A better approach, if you really wanted to grow an array's size, would be to use java.util.Arrays.copyOf(...) to create a bigger array that contained a copy of the first within it. But, as Carlos pointed out, if you intend to change its size then you probably should not be using an array in the first place, (...unless you are making an enhancement to existing code that is not under your control) but should be using an ArrayList or other collection class that can grow/shrink as needed. 205 Views  View Upvotes
