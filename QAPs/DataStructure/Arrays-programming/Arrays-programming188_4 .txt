How do I use count as an array in programming?Edit: First of all increment the array from 0 to 4 not 1 to 5. The array doesnt access the indices A[0][0]. And then it does prints the no. of 1s in every column provided you print them outside these for loops. I will leave the excercise upto you as it may have been given as homework 59 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
