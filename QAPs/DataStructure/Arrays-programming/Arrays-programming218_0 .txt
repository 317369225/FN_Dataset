Algorithms: An array of n elements contains only two distinct values. How many calls to the Partition subroutine are needed to completely sort this array? (Select ONE answer) A. O(l) B. O(log n) C. O(n) D. O(n log n)?One call to partition is enough. Thus O(1) O(1) Even if the array has 3 distinct elements, one call is enough. Read about 3-way partitioning algorithm. 985 Views  View Upvotes
