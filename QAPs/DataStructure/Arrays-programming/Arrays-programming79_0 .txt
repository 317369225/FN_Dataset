How do I get rid of the brackets after splitting an array in Python?print repr(arr) This outputs the string representation of the array (so: [1, 4, ’string’, 92]) you defined in the first line; everything after that can be removed. If you want to print something that looks like an array, but doesn’t have quotes around strings: print "[" + ', '.join(map(str,arr)) + "]" If, alternatively, you want everything in the array to be quoted when printed: arr = map(str,arr) print repr(arr) 556 Views · View Upvotes
