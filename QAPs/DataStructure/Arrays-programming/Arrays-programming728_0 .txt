Can an array size be more than 100000 in C++? If so, how?When you declare a local variable as an array, it is restricted to the size of the stack. To have larger arrays, you need to either declare it as a static variable or in file scope // This array is in file scope int arr[10000000];  int fn(int param) { // Causes stack overflow int arr1[10000000]; // This works fine, same storage everytime this function is called static int arr2[10000000] } Static variables live in what is called the static heap. Ideally you should use new or malloc to allocate memory on the runtime heap, unless you know beforehand how much you need. I have a suspicion you may be asking this because you tried using a large array in Turbo C++ In that case you should know that since Turbo C++ is a legacy compiler built for 16 bit processors, the maximum contiguous array you can have is 64 KB, without using complex tricks involving 8086 segmented memory addressing. 2.4k Views  View Upvotes
