You should've at least specified the language. OOP language's like C# and JAVA and many other's use different data structures to solve this problem, like ArrayList, list , linked list etc. But size need to be specified if you're using an array. Because if you dig deep in what's an array, it's a memory allocated in continuous blocks. So, the size needs to be specified so, the compiler allocates sufficient memory for the array. Though now you can specify a variable size for an array in almost every language, but I used dynamic memory allocation to create a array without giving size. int* a; and when you've known what's the size of an array, you can initialize it by, a =new int[n]; //n being the size So, there you go, array 'a' created without giving the size. same a can't be used to create other array of different sizes. 58 Views  Answer requested by Kandala.vamshidhar Reddy
