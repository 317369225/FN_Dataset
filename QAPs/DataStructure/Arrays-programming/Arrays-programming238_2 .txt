What is the best way to store an array of arrays in a MySQL table?Have you considered storing the array as text using json format. You would have to do convert your array to and from json, but on the other hand you get to store arrays inside arrays inside arrays for as long as your database would allow for one text value. If the first array is fixed in size, you could have a column for each array key each containing a single array inside it. Alternatively, you can store and retrive the values based on their position inside the array structure. You would build a table with a position, and value. For the position you can have the second item in the first array as '[1][2]' use this string as the row primary key that you use to find the corresponding value. 838 Views  View Upvotes
