Why are there no arrays in Python?As the other answerers* have mentioned, "arrays" do in fact exist in python. There are (at least) three main things in Python that someone might be talking about when they talk about arrays: The Python list has many of the behaviors of arrays in other languages, such as C or Java. It does not, however, need to have its memory preallocated, and it comes with many convenient methods. Additionally, it's underlying data structure is typically an array. Keep in mind that a language is just about syntax-- it can be implemented in different ways. The underlying data structure of the Python list in CPython is a C array, and in Jython, is an ArrayList (source: What is the underlying data structure for Python lists?) The Python Array module. This can be found here: 8.6. array - Efficient arrays of numeric values. The array module is used for some rather specific cases which give better memory performance (and not necessarily speed) when you have lots of data of one type. I write about this a bit more in Chris Riederer's answer to What is the difference between lists and arrays in Python? Finally, there's the NumPy array. This is an extremely fast, extremely useful data structure which allows you to quickly do many numerical calculations.
