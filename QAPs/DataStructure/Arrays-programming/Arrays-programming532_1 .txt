How do I find next greater element for every element in an array?The Next greater Element for an element y is the first greater element on the right side of y in array.Simple Approach: The next greater element in the array could be calculated using two loops where the first loop index holds the element whose next greater element is to be calculated and the second loop index is for searching the element just greater than the selected element by the outer loop. //Author :: Ashwani Tiwari Time Complexity :: O(n*n) #include"iostream" #include"string.h" using namespace std; int main() { int n; cin>>n; //no of elements int a[n]; // array to hold elements for(int i=0;i<n;i++) { cin>>a[i]; //input elements } int ans[n]; //array to hold next greater element for element at index i ; memset(ans,-1,sizeof(ans)); for(int i=0;i<n;i++) //selecting element whose next greater element is to be found { for(j=i+1;j<n;j++) //searching the next greater element { if(a[j])>a[i]) { ans[i]=a[j]; break; } } } for(int i=0;i<n;i++) cout<<ans[i]<<" ";//-1 in the answer means element does not have any greater element to its right return 0; } The time complexity of the problem can be modified by support of auxiliary data-structure i.e.Stack.. O(2*n)==O(n) Algorithm:: We will traverse the input array and put the elements in the stack if the stack is empty or element at the top is greater then the incoming element. If incoming element is greater than the element at the top then element at the top has this element as its next greater element.Pop the elements in the stack till this element(incoming) is greater than top.Push this incoming element at last .For all popped element this was the next greater element. Finally once the traversal is finished all the elements in the stack does not have its next greater element.(therefore assign -1) to it. Code for the approach is below :: //Author :: Ashwani Tiwari #include"iostream" #include"string.h" #include"stack" using namespace std; int main() { int n; cin>>n; //no of elements int a[n]; // array to hold elements for(int i=0;i<n;i++) { cin>>a[i]; //input elements } int ans[n]; //array to hold next greater element for element at index i ; memset(ans,-1,sizeof(ans)); stack<int>s; for(int i=0;i<n;) { if(s.empty() || a[s.top()]>a[i]) //push till incoming element is less than value at top s.push(i++); else { ans[s.top()]=a[i]; s.pop(); //pop till incoming element is greater } } for(int i=0;i<n;i++) cout<<ans[i]<<" ";//-1 in the answer means element does not have any greater element to its right return 0; } Hope u understood it !! if not visit to this link Next Greater Element - GeeksforGeeks. 58 Views
