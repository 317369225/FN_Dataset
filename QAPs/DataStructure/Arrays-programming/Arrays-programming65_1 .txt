How do you know when to use .add or .put to add to an array in Java?It looks like you might be confusing your data structures in Java. Java has two types of data structure for storing collections of objects at run-time: Flexible sized collections such as ArrayList, HashMap and so on, which can be used to store instances of objects of the same type, e.g. an ArrayList<String>. Fixed size collections such as arrays. When using arrays, the number of elements, i.e. size, of the array must be given upon creation, e.g. int[] myArray = new int[10]; The methods you have mentioned, i.e. put and add, are used by the flexible sized collections. They have no application to arrays. You cannot add additional elements to an array once it has been created. To access an array element, you would use code such as: int i = myArray[4]; To retrieve the content the fifth element in the array into integer i. Or to set the fifth element of the array to the value eight, you could use code: int i = 8; myArray[4] = 8; One final point is that the flexible collections work with object types only. Arrays can work with object and primitive types. You can find out more about collections and their methods such as add and put at Trail: Collections. 220 Views  View Upvotes
