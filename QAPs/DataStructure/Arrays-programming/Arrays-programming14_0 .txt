What is the significance of the array in C in day-to-day life?It becomes easier for a person to search for similar data all under one label. It saves time, energy and file space. It becomes something more practically comparable to real life. E.g. In a library, rather than having a wooden box (individual data declaration) for each and every one of the thousands of books a library may have, it would be more reasonable to have shelves (arrays) for similar books to be kept together based on some criteria; like, author, genre, age group, etc. Is it reasonable to have books in individual boxes… …all piled up neatly (without any fixed pattern to say “this pile is about so-and-so or such-and-such”)… …or would it be easier if there a common basis on which books in a single shelf an be compared? 135 Views · View Upvotes
