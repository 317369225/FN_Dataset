In the C programming language, array bound checking does not happen and generates a fatal error as output. Why?Because access to array is translated into a single CPU instruction, unless optimized into using a value already in a register. If that doesn't answer all your questions and you still want to know why not to use a couple more instructions to check for out-of-bounds index, then your project should not be done in "C" - no offence. You will do it quicker in something else. 958 Views  View Upvotes
