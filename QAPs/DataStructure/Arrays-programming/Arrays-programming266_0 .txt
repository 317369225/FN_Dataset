What is the maximum size of an array that I can take on an online judge like CodeChef and Codeforces?Maximum size can be 10^8 if you define the array to be global otherwise if it is defined in a local function maximum size can be 10^6 and you can take this size of array in online judges too, be it codechef or codeforces. The above sizes of array is for int datatype.The main reason behind the the limit of size of array is the contigious memory allocation. So as suggested by Nitin in comments, this also depends on datatype.If you use long long then maximum size of array should get halved because long long is double(8 byte) in size that of int(4 byte).So, look accordingly the size of your array considering the datatypes. 391 Views  View Upvotes
