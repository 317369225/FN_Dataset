How do I find a deleted number in an array of random numbers?One way of doing this would be in two steps: Create an empty array of the same length with zeroes for every value. Loop through the original array and change the zeroes to ones for the index at which the number is at. For example, if you have the number 10, change the value at index 10 in the new array to one. Once the new array has been created, loop back through it to find any zeroes. The index at which there is a zero would be one less than your deleted number. Add one to that index and you have the deleted number. 64 Views
