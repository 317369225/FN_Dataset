How do you access each element of an array by using only pointers in C?One can access each element of an array by using only pointers. First of all, one should remember that array name itself is the pointer pointing towards the first element of the array. In this case arr is the pointer having the address of first element i.e arr[0] whose value in above case is 2. Your first printf statement gives the correct output because you have called the value at memory address stored in arr. i.e *arr = value stored at memory address stored in arr. But in second increment statement you use expression (*arr)++ which simply means increase the value of the element stored at memory address arr i.e at arr[0] by 1. Which simply gives the answer 2+1=3 for using it correctly you should use: arr++; //Now arr have memory address of second element i.e arr[1]. printf(“%d”,*arr) ; which will give you your expected output. Output will be at element at the arr[1]. 84 Views
