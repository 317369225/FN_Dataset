How can I print all elements of a matrix in diagonal order?I learned it from IDeserve Algorithm rowCount = number of rows columnCount = number of columns Then, number of diagonals will be = rowCount + columnCount - 1 as depicted in the diagram below. Step 1: Print first rowCount diagonals Print diagonals that start from the first column elements. Step 2: Print next columnCount - 1 diagonals Print diagonals that start from the last row elements. Step 1 details: Print first rowCount diagonals Iterate to print diagonals from row k = 0 to rowCount - 1. 1: Start with row = k and col = 0 2: Print the element matrix[row][col] 3: Decrement row by 1, increment col by 1 till row >= 0 and col < columnCount Step 2 details: Print next columnCount - 1 diagonals Iterate to print diagonals from column k = 1 to columnCount - 1 1: Start with last row, row = rowCount - 1 and col = k 2: Print the element matrix[row][col] 3: Decrement row by 1, increment col by 1 till row >= 0 and col < columnCount Video with animated explanation Credits: Print a Matrix Diagonally I hope I was able to help. 947 Views  View Upvotes
