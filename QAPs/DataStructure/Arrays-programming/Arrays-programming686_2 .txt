How would you explain an "array" to a beginner in programming?Apart from the technical details, arrays are user defined datastructure! You can think it of as a fixed declared size to hold/group similar data based on their types. They have unique address/name to uniquely identify them and are contiguous in nature - consecutive chunks of memory blocks make up an array! So only base address is more than enough to point to an array! The data is accessed using index notation! Accessing an array can be visualized through lift mechanism - you can access only one element node based on its index/position(in lift you can only stop at a particular floor at any instant of time but can move through the array/building initially starting from the ground floor and sequentially moving through the floors) Some variations are: Java/JavaScript: Allows dynamic allocation of memory size. JavaScript/PHP/Perl/Python: Allows different data types to be grouped together in an array. PHP/Perl/Python: Allows accessing of data elements using key-value pairs. Hope it helps!
