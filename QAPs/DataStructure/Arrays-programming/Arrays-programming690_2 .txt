What is the difference between String Array and Character Array?Originally Answered: What is the difference between strings and character arrays? It depends upon the language that involving string and characters. In C language there is no much difference among characters and string, except there comes an additional null character(\0) at the end. A character is considered as a primitive data type. There is no special operations defined for manipulation of character arrays. In Object Oriented Language, we can say String as a class and any String type declaration as an object. Hence as it is an object of String class, it can be operated over with the functions or methods provided by the String class such as substring,length,indexOf,toLowercase etc. In Java Strings are immutable. 1.7k Views  View Upvotes
