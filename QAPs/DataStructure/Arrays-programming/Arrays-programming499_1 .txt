What is difference between array of character and string?An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier. -Arrays - C++ Tutorials An array of characters is an collection/arrangement of characters. char character_array = { ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’}; // No NULL character at the end of an array of characters. A string is a sequence of characters or an ordered arrangement of characters but a string is always terminated by a NULL character whereas it is not necessary for an array of characters to be terminated by a NULL character . Strings are internally represented as an array of characters with a NULL(‘\0’) character at the end to mark the end of the string. char my_string[] = “abc”; //creates an array my_string[] = {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘\0’}   // Methods for creating strings char my_string[] = {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘\0’}; char my_string[] = "abc"; char *my_string = "abc"; Finally note the minute difference, char my_string[] = “abc”; //creates an array my_string[] = {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘\0’}   // An array of characters char character_array = { ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’}; If an array of characters is not NULL terminated, then it is not a string, it is only an array of characters. 141 Views
