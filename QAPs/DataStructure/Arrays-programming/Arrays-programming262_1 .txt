What does an array mean in C?Array is a collection of different members of same datatype. one can save several data into one variable name. Declaration of array: Array can be declared in many ways:  1. int A[10];  2. int A[]={1,3,24}; To change or enter values into an array one may use loops(for or while). e..g: for{int i=0;i<=max;i++}  cin>>A[i]; Hope you got something from it.
