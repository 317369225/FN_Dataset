How does one understand looping through an array of Strings?In programming we call it 0 based indexing. This means arrays cells start storing data at position 0. Now that's out of the way our array of Strings has 6 elements but the computer will not see 1 2 3 4 5 6 instead it see 0 1 2 3 4 5. //we assign i a value of 0 //so the loop will run from 0 until 5 because //every time the loop runs i will be incremented by 1 // so the program would loop from 0 1 2 3 4 5 then end for(int i = 0; i < names.length -1; i++) //print names[i] if we didn't use names.length - 1 the loop would go from 0 - 6 and since I mentioned that all arrays are 0 based indexing this would mean that names would go out of bound since effectively you have 6 items and counting from 0 - 6 would mean you have 7 items. I hope this helps! all the best. 20 Views  Answer requested by Remy Kirsch
