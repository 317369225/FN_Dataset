Why Numpy arrays are not part of Python?Numpy arrays are really fast and friendly on CPU and RAM. Since they're so good, why Python core developers haven't considered to take them into standard library ? Update Iâ€™m not talking about the whole Numby project, but mainly how the achieve such a good performance on arrays.Why should it? Firstly, although very useful, matrix calculations are not useful for every programming task. Remember, Python is a programming language, not just for data scientists. Secondly, if Numpy was integrated into Python core then is there a risk that it becomes more difficult to maintain the code? Having a small library that can be imported when required and easily kept updated due to the smaller codebase seems a very sensible approach to me. 155 Views  View Upvotes
