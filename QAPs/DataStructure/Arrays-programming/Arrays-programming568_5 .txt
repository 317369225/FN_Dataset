I have an array of integers (both positive and negative). How can I find the smallest missing number in the array?Example: A = [5, -3, 2, 1, 0, -2, 4] return -1 EDIT: Thanks for your answers, maybe I had to say that I am not looking for O(nlogn) solution, since it is trivial. What I am looking is O(n) solution in terms of extra storage and run time.Find the smallest number (0 storage, O(n) time). Store the numbers in a hash set (O(n) storage, O(n) time). Start a loop variable at the smallest number and iterate to see whether the current value is in the hash set (O(n) loops with each iteration O(1), total O(n) time). Total time and storage are O(n). 396 Views
