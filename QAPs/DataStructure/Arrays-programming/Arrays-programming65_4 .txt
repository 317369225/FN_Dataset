How do you know when to use .add or .put to add to an array in Java?Ojects are added to a collection by calling add() method.that takes an argument of type E,which means that objects added to a collection must be compatible with the type of data expected by the collection. Generally add() method append the item to the end of the list. Add the elements into list one by one. Print the invoking object. Display the size of list using size() method.Obj.add("A"); Obj.add("B"); System.out.println(Obj); System.out.println(Obj.size()); Obj.add("C"); Obj.add("D"); System.out.println(Obj); By this process we can say that elements are adding in the list. 37 Views
