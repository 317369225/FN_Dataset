What is wrong with this dynamic memory C code?Core dump is because of on Line 27, when taking user input. Line 6: int number_of_records,i,j,ctr=1,row=15,col=20,; remove the comma "," after col=20 int number_of_records,i,j,ctr=1,row=15,col=20; Line 27: scanf("%s %s %f",&firstname[i],&lastname[i],&score[i]); In case of character array ,firstname[i] itself refers to memory location of that index, no need to append "&" operator. change that line to scanf("%s %s %f",firstname[i],lastname[i],&score[i]); 83 Views  View Upvotes
