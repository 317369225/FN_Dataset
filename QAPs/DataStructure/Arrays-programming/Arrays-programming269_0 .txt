How do I put a number in an array such that each digit of a number is saved in one block of the array?I have a 1000 digit number and wish to put the number in an array of size 1000 such that each digit of the number goes into each single field of the array. How to do this using C programming?As Paul Olaru pointed out in the comments, you'll never get a 1000-digit number in any of the standard C data types. Some languages have a data type (e.g., BigInteger in Java) that will store arbitrarily large numbers, and I'm sure you could find a C library to do that as well. If you have a smaller number in an integer data type, the general approach to extract the digits is to repeatedly mod and divide by 10. For example, if your number is 123, you could do something like this: int num = 123; int d = num%10; num /= 10; printf("%d\n", d); printf("%d\n", num); Put code like that inside a loop, and you're all set. 234 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sree Kuppa
