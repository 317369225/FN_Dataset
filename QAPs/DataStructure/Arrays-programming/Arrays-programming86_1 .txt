When creating an array, is there shorter way to assign objects to the array?(Javascript)Can you use an assignment operator to create an object when creating an array?There are lots of variations in javascript to declare the array object and initializing them with the values such as: var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; var cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"); var person = ["John", "Doe", 46]; See: JavaScript Arrays 194 Views
