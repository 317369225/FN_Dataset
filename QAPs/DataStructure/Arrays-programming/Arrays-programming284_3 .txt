How can I swap two strings within an array of strings (2D array) without using an additional string?Let's assume C-strings. Let's do a second assumption that they are the same length (not required if you place a NUL after the end of the shorter string at the same position as that of the longer string, that is, assuming b is the longer string you can do a[strlen(b)]=0; Now let's do stuff for each character. There is an in-place swap using xors. You do a for(i=0;i Good enough? No additional memory, really. 856 Views  View Upvotes
