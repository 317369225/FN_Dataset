How do you access each element of an array by using only pointers in C?Line 6 is essentially incrementing the value stored at arr[0] and not incrementing the ponter itself. Btw please note you you can't write arr++. Arrays cannot change the location in memory they point to. So you need to define an integer pointer. Assign it the memory location of arr, and then increment the pointer variable. int * p = arr; // &arr[0] is also valid printf("%d\n", (*p)); p++; printf("%d\n", (*p)); 272 Views  View Upvotes
