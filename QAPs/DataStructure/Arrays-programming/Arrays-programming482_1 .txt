What is the difference between these two Java arrays initialization methods?The first one will produce a compiler error because there are only 2 elements in the array, but you try to put three items in it. If you make it three elements large, there is no difference. In general, you should use the first method for assigning things since you might be assigning expressions and/or doing things in a loop. 57 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Remy Kirsch
