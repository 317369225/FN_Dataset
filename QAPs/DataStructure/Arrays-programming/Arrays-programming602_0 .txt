How memory is allocated to 1D and 2D array in C?What the standard says (well, a very small part, but it should be sufficient) Memory is contigious, from the sttandard: An array type describes a contiguously allocated nonempty set of objects with a particular member object type, called the element type. Objects, of course, can in turn be Array-of-T objects (which should be contigious) e.g. int a[10][5]; A is an array-of-T1, where T1 is an array-of-T2, where T2 is int. 745 Views  Answer requested by Kandala.vamshidhar Reddy
