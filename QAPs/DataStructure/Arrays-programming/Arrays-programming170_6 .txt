What is the fastest algorithm to find the largest number in an unsorted array?You simply have no other option than to check every element to see if it's the largest, as every answer already says. However, just for the sake of novelty, you could conceivably check multiple elements at the same time, without the overhead of starting threads. Depending on whether your processor of choice has a vector unit like SSE or VIS, then you might be able to compare 2 or 4 numbers at the same time, depending on the size of the numbers and capabilities of the vector unit. 9.7k Views  View Upvotes
