Why Numpy arrays are not part of Python?Numpy arrays are really fast and friendly on CPU and RAM. Since they're so good, why Python core developers haven't considered to take them into standard library ? Update I’m not talking about the whole Numby project, but mainly how the achieve such a good performance on arrays.At some point, there was a discussion as to whether the requests package should be made part of the core language (as urllib is). One of the main reasons they decided to keep it separate was so that requests could evolve and iterate on a faster time scale than the core language. Areas such as math, machine learning, and the web where peoples’ needs change quickly are better served by non-core libraries that can quickly adapt to their needs. To be clear: I don’t know the actual answer to this question, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this were part of the reason. 357 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Alireza Savand
