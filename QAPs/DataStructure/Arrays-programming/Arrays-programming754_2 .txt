How do you empty the contents of an array?Something like 'Array.clear()' in javaIn Java, arrays are just builtin types. They have no methods. If you want to clear an array, the easiest way is to use the Arrays utility class. For example, String ar[] = new String[5]; Arrays.fill(ar, null); This is for an array of objects. For native types like ints, you could just fill with zeros. 235 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Mushabalo Magada
