How do I improve my logics in arrays and strings?What are some sites and practice questions through which I can improve and practice questions in arrays and command over it. (PHP, Javascript, Java)Instead of going all out and solving problems day and night, I suggest you look at ways that you can manipulate an Array or a String, atleast initially. What this does is that it helps you easily visualize a solution when faced with a real life problem. Yes, practice in itself is a boon. So keep on practiticing. And time and again Quiz yourself. Have the craziest of thoughts and try to implement them using the knowledge you have acquired and hopefully will keep on acquiring. Best of Luck. 39 Views
