How do I efficiently count the number of unique IDs in an array?Assuming IDs are all random numeric numbers.. I know algorithm that runs in O(n) running time and O(n) space.. How can we do better than that?I'm gonna omit the proof, but you can NOT do that, faster than O(n) on a unsorted array. Provided that the array is sorted you can easily count the IDs on a similliar fashion than the binary search. Not as fast as O(logn) but certainly not as slow as O(n) 194 Views  View Upvotes
