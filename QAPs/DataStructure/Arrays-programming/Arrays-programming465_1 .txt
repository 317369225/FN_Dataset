How we can edit data in Sorted Array?OK, first you need to define a search algorithm that operates on an array in O(log N). There is no magic here, it is just the binary search. If you are unfamiliar with it, learn it as fast as possible and try to understand why it always runs in O(log N). Using the binary search, you can always find an element, a position for deleting an element, or a position for inserting a new element in O(log N) in a sorted array. After the deletion/insertion you also need to shift all the other elements by 1 to the left/right, which is done in worst case in O(N).
