How do you know when to use .add or .put to add to an array in Java?We use .add(obj) for adding any object to a List and .put(key, value) for adding key value pair to Map List: The List interface extends Collection and declares the behavior of a collection that stores a sequence of elements. There are two general-purpose List implementations â€” ArrayList and LinkedList. Map: The Map interface maps unique keys to values. A key is an object that you use to retrieve a value at a later date. The three general-purpose Map implementations are HashMap, TreeMap and LinkedHashMap. 25 Views
