How can I find the longest sub-array A [I âˆ’ k,.., I] that all of its elements are less or equal A [I] for each index in the array, O(n) using stack?Why would you need a stack, except for local variables? You don't even need recursion. Get the value at A[l], lets call it x; Then: int i; for( i = l-1; i>=0; --i) {  if (a[i] >x)  break; } // Now if i<0 all A[0]..A[l] will do // else you have found the first (= highest) i<l for which this does not hold. 62 Views
