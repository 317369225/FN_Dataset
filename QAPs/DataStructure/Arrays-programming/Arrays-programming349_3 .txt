How do I display top 5 numbers in an array in c++?An array is an ordered collection of homogeneous data i.e. it contains data of similar data types. Each of the data is accessed through its index and the indices are in the range of size of the array-1; so if i declare an array of array[10] of size 10 then: 0 1 2 … (and so on the indices till 10–1 = 9) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Now based on this fact we can print out the values from an array as: #include<iostream.h> int main() { int array [10]; // integer array of size 10 is declared for(int i =0; i<5;i++) { //printing first five elements of the array… and after that going to the next line. cout<<array[i]<<”\n”; } return 0; } The output is processed as : i = 0; array[0] = 1 i = 1; array[] = 2 i = 2; array[] = 3 i = 3; array[] = 4 i =4; array[] = 5 i = 5; array[] = 6 i = 6; array[] = 7 i = 7; array[] = 8 i = 8; array[] = 9 i = 9; array[9] = 10 131 Views
