Let there be n arrays with m members each. Each array is sorted. How can we convert those n arrays into one sorted array of size n*m?This is a standard implementation of k-merge algorithm. A simple solution is to create an output array of size n*k and one by  one copy all arrays to it.  Finally, sort the output array using any  O(nLogn) sorting algorithm.  This approach takes O(nkLognk) time. We can merge arrays in O(nk*Logk) time using Min Heap. Following is detailed algorithm. 1. Create an output array of size n*k. 2. Create a min heap of size k and insert 1st element in all the arrays into a the heap 3. Repeat following steps n*k times.        a) Get minimum element from heap (minimum is always at root) and store it in output array.         b) Replace heap root with next element from the  array from which the element is extracted.  If the array doesn’t have  any more elements, then replace root with infinite.  After replacing the  root, heapify the tree.
