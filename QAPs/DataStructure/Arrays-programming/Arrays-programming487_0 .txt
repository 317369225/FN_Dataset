How can an intersection operation be performed between two integer arrays?Suppose arrays a =[2,1,44] =[2,1,44] and b=[44,333,19] =[44,333,19] . In such a case, the response should be [44] [44] , which is the only element present in both the arrays a and b, an intersection operation.Well, you have to be aware what the CPU will be doing, if you wanted to intersect a and b. There is no way around going through all the cells and comparing them to each other. My solution would be to sort the arrays first, and then compare all elements to each other, one-by-one, in some sort of a 'join' function that you still need to design. Lets try to see how this 'join' operate: a = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} b = {4,8,16,32,64} The comparisons would be: 1==4? ; 2==4? ; 3==4? ; 4==4? ; 5==8? ; and so on You just need to design an algorithm for the 'join' which takes care of many things, such as both array indices, the maximum array length, the index updates, and maybe few more. I leave the implementation to you, or you can use some pre-built intersection function or library for your programming language. 29 Views
