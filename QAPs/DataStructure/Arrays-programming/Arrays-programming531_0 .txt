How do I print the last element of an array in c?Well the way on top of my head is you can do following thing: data_type array_name[][]...;   // the '...' shows that the array can be of any dimension data_type last_element = array_name[(sizeof(array_name) / data_type) -1]; Where 'data_type' is the data—type of the elements of the array, 'array_name' is the name of the array, 'last_element' is the variable to hold the last element of the array which you can print as necessary. Now how the code work is simple. What we're doing is by 'sizeof' we're calculating the size of array, on dividing this size by 'data—type' of each element of the array we get the total count of the elements in the array. Then we subtract one from it to get t he last index as the array indices in C starts from zero.
