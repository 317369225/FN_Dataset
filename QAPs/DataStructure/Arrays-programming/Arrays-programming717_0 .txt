Why are arrays used in C?For performance reason: 1. Provide O(1) access 2. Binary search can be implemented over array, not over linked list. 3. Less overhead than linked list. Imagine if there is no array, then there would no string in C (unless you choose to use linked list for string representation) and many operations would be complicated. For simple program to hold number of records, you need to implement linked list (there is no list provided by C) or lots of variables which will make program static and difficult to maintain and code. 401 Views  View Upvotes
