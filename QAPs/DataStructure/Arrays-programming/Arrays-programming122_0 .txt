How can we modify dynamic array at run time in uvm?If you are just asking about expanding and shrinking a dynamic array on the fly, the following piece of code gives you an example, int dyn_array[]; // this would declare your dynamic array. initial begin  dyn_array = new[3];  dyn_array = {10,20,30};  /*below statement expands the array while the already existing elements are preserved*/  dyn_array = new[10] (dyn_array);  /*statement to shrink array*/  dyn_array = new[2](dyn_array); end 188 Views
