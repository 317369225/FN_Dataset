What is the space complexity of an ArrayList containing references to TreeNodes?Your friend is right. Actually it is O(n) because of ArrayList size and all the elements of ArrayList will point to same reference. If you see ArrayList implementation in JAVA documentation you will get the idea. It works similarly like primitive type array just added functionality is that it will expand automatically and you can declare it as an class type. There is nothing like that it will check whether it has already stored that reference. If you don't want duplicate and want to retain the original sequential insertion LinkedHashSet is there for you. 230 Views
