How do I extract one single row from a multidimensional array, and make that into a new array in c#?You are not really using a multidimensional array, since those don't really exist in c#. EDIT: They do. You are just not using them. Thanks for pointing out. That kind of array is called a jagged array. Let's look a little bit closer at them. A jagged array is an array of arrays. In a 2-dimensional jaggy, your outer array contains the rows, which are more arrays, containing the rowsl elements. You access an element in this fashion: myArray[0][3]; You take the array myArray. You select it's first element using the [0]. That happens to be another, nameless, array. Of that array you take the fourth element using the [3]. So, if you want to take a row of myArray, you just don't select any element of that second array, giving you the entire array. Like this: row = myArray[0]; (if row is of the right type, blablabla) Most of the time, you are thaught that there is a difference between a single dimensional array and a multi dimensional one. There isn't. You just nest arrays. This makes it way easier to think of them properly. 200 Views  View Upvotes
