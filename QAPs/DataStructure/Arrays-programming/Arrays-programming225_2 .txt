Which one of the following is efficient? for (int I = 0; I < arr.length; I++) // arr is a array or int limit = arr.length;// arr is a array for (int I = 0; I < limit; I++)For all practical purposes, this micro-optimization is in no way a good strategy (and definitely not required) for modern compilers. So, Efficient? Both Readable? First (Since you don't want to spend your time finding the value of limit and where is it set in your code) Conclusion: First 139 Views  View Upvotes
