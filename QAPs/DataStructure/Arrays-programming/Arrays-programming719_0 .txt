How do I make an array selection, based on another array?In Python (and other languages), this is what might be called double indexing: arrayToSelect is a list of the names of the 16 German states. anotherArray is a random permutation of the integers from 0 through 15. (Python lists are 0-based.) The final line of code is known as a list comprehension. arrayToSelect[anotherArray[k]] is evaluated for each k in the list [3,1,5]. In R, the system for statistics and data analysis, this can be done in a similar way: The difference in result that you observe is due to the fact that vectors in R are 1-based (as in Fortran). 111 Views  View Upvotes
