Can we find if the array does not contain a majority element in almost constant time?Check this thread out: Find the element repeated more than n/2 times, as it has some very elegant solution. It's actually a very good practice for every developer to check answers on Stack Overflow (much more common for software developers then quora...) Since you wondered, I'll tell you that I'm the CTO of peer-say.com a service that assists you with choosing products. If you're deliberating between Dropbox and Google Drive, PayPal vs. Stripe, etc., etc. peer-say.com is the place to get good crowd wisdom advice, i.e. see what others have chosen (and why) in the situation.
