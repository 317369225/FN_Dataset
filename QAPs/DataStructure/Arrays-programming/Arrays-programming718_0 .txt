How do I visualize multidimensional arrays?Excuse my poor Paint skills, drawing using a laptop's touchpad isn't easy. What is a multidimensional array? It is an array or arrays. For the first example, array[3][6]: It is an array containing three other arrays. The three other arrays have six elements each. Consider three classes with six students each. For the second example, array[3][6][2]: It is an array containing three other arrays. The three other arrays have six arrays each. The six arrays have two elements each. Consider three classes with six students, each having two parents. Similarly you can form an array[12][4][7][24]. This signifies 12 months with 4 weeks each. The four weeks have 7 days each, and each day in turn has 24 hours. 1.9k Views  View Upvotes
