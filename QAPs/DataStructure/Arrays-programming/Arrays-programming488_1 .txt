Why is type of address of an array variable pointer to pointer to first element of array?I understand that array name decays to pointer to first element when it is not operand of '&' and 'sizeof'. While sizeof and & operators treat the array variable as an object of contiguous memories but I don't understand why type of &(name of array variable) is pointer to pointer to first element?It isn't. Taking the address if an array yields a pointer-to-array-of-<number>-<type>, e.g. int arr[5]; // array-of-5-int int (*parr)[5] = &arr; // pointer-to-array-of-5-int int **pparr = &arr; // Incompatible pointers. 35 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sourabh Khandelwal
