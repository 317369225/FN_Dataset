What are the differences between arrays and ranges in computer science?Ok, seriously. What is up with the question? Do you have a clue what an array is? No? Look it up. Do you have a clue what a range is? No? Look it up. Then, you can see what differences they had. You are comparing apples with comets. I don’t know the exact definitions, here’s a shot: (computer science) Array: A group of homogeneous (typically) items, stored in memory contiguously. Range: A view, or representation of a series of items, with a lower and upper bound. I would not say that a range is necessarily contiguous or even that it can be derived from an array. But, you can always derive a range from an array. So, in other words, a ranges may not necessarily come from an array. However, a range may be extracted from an array. 32 Views
