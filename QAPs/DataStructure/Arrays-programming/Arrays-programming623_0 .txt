Is array a data type? If yes, how?Many websites and books call array as a data type but at the same time some people also argue that it is not. I think it is more of a data structure. If it is also a data type( I am not talking about abstract data type), I want to know the reason behind."array" is a category of data types. An example of an array type in C and C++ would be "array of 5 double", and an example of an array type in Java would be "array of double" This question is tagged with three different programming languages: C, C++, and Java, so I'll quote three specifications: C, §6.2.1/20 An array type describes a contiguously allocated nonempty set of objects with a particular member object type, called the element type. The element type shall be complete whenever the array type is specified. Array types are characterized by their element type and by the number of elements in the array. C++, §8.3.4[dcl.array]/1 In a declaration T D where D has the form D1 [ constant-expression(opt) ] [...] then the type of the identifier of D is an array type [...]. T is called the array element type; this type shall not be a reference type, the (possibly cv-qualified) type void, a function type or an abstract class type. [...] If the value of the constant expression is N, the array has N elements numbered 0 to N-1, and the type of the identifier of D is “array of N T”. An object of array type contains a contiguously allocated non-empty set of N subobjects of type T Java SE, §10.1 Array types are used in declarations and in cast expressions. An array type is written as the name of an element type followed by some number of empty pairs of square brackets []. [...] The element type of an array may be any type, whether primitive or reference. An array's length is not part of its type. So the answer to "how?" is "by definition". 577 Views · View Upvotes
