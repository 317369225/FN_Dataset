Implementation of linked list using array?The advantages of linked list would be lost if we implement it using array as no element could be inserted in between without moving other elements , no deletion can take place without leaving gaps in array ( if shifting is not done after deletion of elements ) , etc . But it will require less space than linked list but gaps due to deletion may reduce this advantage . 256 Views
