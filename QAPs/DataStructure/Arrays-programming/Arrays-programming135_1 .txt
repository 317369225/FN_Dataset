How do you write a program to sort an array using a single loop?The best complexity you can achieve with comparison based algorithm is O(nlogn). If you move to other types of algorithms you can achieve O(n). And simple algorithm for this is It's really simple, if n >=2 and numbers are unique: Construct an array of bits (2^31-1 bits => ~256MB). Initialize them to zero. Read the input, for each value you see set the respective bit in the array to 1. Scan the array, for each bit set, output the respective value.Complexity => O(2n) Radix Sort: What is the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit integers? Counting Sort: What is the difference between Radix sort, Bucket sort and Counting sort? Cheers :) 40 Views  View Upvotes
