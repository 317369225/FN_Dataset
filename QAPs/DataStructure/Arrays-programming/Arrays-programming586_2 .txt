How is the map data structure different from an associative array?A map is the same as an associative array; it is also sometimes called a dictionary. It is not a data structure but an abstract data type: a map has to support a number of operations (insert, look up, delete, iteration) but the details of how these operations are implemented are not specified. In fact you can implement a map using many different data structures, such as binary trees, hash tables, linked lists, and arrays. 96 Views  View Upvotes
