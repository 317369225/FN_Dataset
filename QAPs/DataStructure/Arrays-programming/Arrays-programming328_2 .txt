How can one access specific values within an array?In JS, if every zip code in the US were formatted as: var zipCodes= ([{"ZIP": 10001, "LAT": 40.750633, "LNG": -73.997177 }, etc]) How can one access the LAT or LNG value after the user inputs the ZIP value? Edit: Forgot to state that itâ€™s in javascript. *facepalm*Unfortunately because of your data structure, every zip code would involve a sequential scan through the entire array until you found a match. So it would be O(N). A far better data structure would be a dict or hash using the zip as the key which could perform the lookups in constant time, O(1). 174 Views  View Upvotes
