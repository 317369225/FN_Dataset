How can I print all elements of a matrix in diagonal order?Considering, you know a bit about array indexing. Here is a brute force algorithm that can do this. start a variable with Zero and print all the element(in column first order) whose index-sum(add column index and row index) add up to this variable, process this up till that variable reaches to M+N-2 , where M and N is the size of matrix. You can obviously do better than this but this thing should be enough to bring out your desired result. here is the link to the code- Ideone.com 234 Views  View Upvotes
