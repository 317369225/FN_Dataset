Why we use 'new' keyword in Java for creating an array But in C++ we don't use ‘new’ keyword to create an array?I’ve studied C++ as a subject in Class 12th and I’m currently learning Java watching online videos. So pls use simple terms to answer my question as I am new to all this… :)In Java, all arrays are objects and as such, instances of them must be created before you can use them. You don’t have the C/C++ option of simply declaring an array of variables. The advantage of the Java system is that each array object includes a constant .length variable which gives the maximum size of the array. Java arrays also do index range checking and throw an exception if the array index is out of range. 147 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Rohit Soni
