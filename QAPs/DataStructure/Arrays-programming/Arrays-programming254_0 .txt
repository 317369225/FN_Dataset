What does int *(a) [20] mean?When we try to declare a 2D array using pointer in this manner what is actually ignored the number of rows or the number of columns? Thanks in advance.*p[n] always talks about the base address i.e. starting location of array P containing N elements. So it points to P[0]. When you have a 2D array this declaration is buggy and produces error. But C, has precedence to treat row over columns. Hence, *p or *p[M][N], is to be read as pointer to 2D array P, of M rows-N columns, with data read out row-wise in memory layout. 242 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Alabi Mehzabin Anisha
