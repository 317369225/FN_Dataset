How do I randomise different strings of an array in C?Suppose i have 10 different strings in an array. Now i would want to display 5 random strings among 10. How do I do it?The Fisher-Yates algorithm should suit your purpose: FOR i = n-1 DOWNTO 1 j = random(i+1) // selects a random number between 0 and i inclusive t = index[i] index[i] = index[j] index[j] = t NEXT i To print the first 5 of the shuffled strings you could use FOR i = 0 to 4 PRINT stringArray[index[i]] NEXT i 90 Views
