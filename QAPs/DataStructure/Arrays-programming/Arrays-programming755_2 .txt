What is the maximum number of comparisons that a binary search function will make when searching for a value in a 1,000 - element array?Each recursive call, the size of array will be half. Recurrence relation will be T(n) = T(n/2) + c; Total coomparison will be in order of log(n). So in array of length 1000, In worst case it will take log(1000) will be 10. 7.2k Views  View Upvotes
