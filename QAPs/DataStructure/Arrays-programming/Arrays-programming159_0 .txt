What is the code to divide an array into two equal halves?#include<stdio.h> #include<string.h> #define MAX_SIZE 50 int main(void) { int arr[MAX_SIZE], arr1[MAX_SIZE / 2], arr2[MAX_SIZE / 2], num_of_elements; //Input number of elements in 'num_of_elements' and your array in 'arr' here //code to split the array memcpy(arr1, arr, num_of_elements / 2 * sizeof(arr[0])); memcpy(arr2, &arr[num_of_elements / 2], (num_of_elements / 2) * sizeof(arr[0])); //print your two splited here, 'arr1' the first half and 'arr2' the second half } 97 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Vinaya J
