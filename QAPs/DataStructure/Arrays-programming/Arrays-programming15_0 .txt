How do I find the second largest number in an unsorted array using " FOR " loops in turbo c++? Without using arrays.This can be done in many ways. The most efficient solution will be to use Heap Data structure.(Not applicable for someone who is new to programming , which I assume you are.) The brute force approach will also do,where you find the largest element and then exclude the largest element’s index and go on to find the 2nd largest element. You can also sort the given array using any sorting algorithm that you know, in descending order and then return the element at index 1 (Give that there are no duplicate elements in the array and arrays indexing starts at 0). Refer internet to learn about sorting. I told you the way , now write your own code. This will help you in long run. Happy coding. 70 Views · View Upvotes
