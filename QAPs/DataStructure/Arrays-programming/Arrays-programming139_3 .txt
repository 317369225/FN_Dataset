Why do I find multidimensional arrays hard to use?I'm a beginner at programming,I am learning C++, and I find multidimensional arrays really hard to use and extremely confusing, for example I've been trying for about 3 days now to make a connect 4 game with them, and I still can't do it, why is that? Everybody else seems to do just fine with them?I can't tell you why you find something difficult. That's all your experience that going on in your mind, I can't interact with it. I can give you a tip, understanding multi-dimensional arrays is easier if you think of the dimensions as column and row. 417 Views  View Upvotes
