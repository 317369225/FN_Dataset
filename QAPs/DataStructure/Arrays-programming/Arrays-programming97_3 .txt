What is the best way to flatten a nested array into one array?I would probably do something like this. Make a function. Initialize an empty array. Iterate through the list and check to see if the sub element in the array is a list. If it is not simply place the element in the new array. Otherwise, if the element in the nested array is an array, check to see if the sub elements are arrays and if they are, check to see if it sub elements are also an array. Keep iterating until you find an element that is not an array and place it in the new empty list. Continue until you have traversed the entire array. 58 Views
