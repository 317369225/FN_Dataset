Python (programming language): When is numpy.empty() useful?numpy.empty() can return "unitialized garbage" (Python for Data Analysis, Wes McKinney, p. 82). What is a use case when this is desirable or needed?Specifically speaking, it is seldom used in any scripts, As specified, it returns an numpy array object initialized with garbage, you would manually need to set the data in each cell of the matrix. However there is a slight optimization up side of using this method, Since it returns an array of garbage values, therefore it is slightly faster as compared to other initialization of array to zeros or ones Usage: >>> np.empty([2, 2]) >>> array([[ 74499359, 69583040],  [ 13182611, 6959433]]) 479 Views  View Upvotes
