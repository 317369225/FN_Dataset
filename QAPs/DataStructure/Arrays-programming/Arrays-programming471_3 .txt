How do I scan strings into a pointer array?for instance say I have a pointer array for colours and I initialize it as char *colors[]={"red" , "blue" , "yellow" }; what if I don't want to initialize the pointer array in the code itself? Is there some function of a kind like scanf I can use here?You can use it like this char color[4][10]; for (i=0;i<4;i++) scanf("%s", color[i]); 51 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Vamshi Aruru
