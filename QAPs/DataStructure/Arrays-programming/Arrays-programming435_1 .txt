I wrote this program in C to reverse an array of intergers. I get a random number before the reversed array. What's wrong with my code.Two major semantic errors can be identified in this code: First, the code will only print array elements in reverse order; it’ll not actually reverse the array. And the second error lies in line number 15. You begin the loop with the counter set at n, the size of the array. But you have not initialized this element at all (remember that array indexing begins at 0; so in an array of n elements, the indices range from 0 to n-1). Hence the ‘n’th element will contain some garbage value, and this is the random number you see during execution. Hope this helps; if it doesn’t, please feel free to PM me :V Happy hacking! 94 Views · View Upvotes
