In C programming, how do I replace a sequence in an array?I was asked to answer this but I would have to agree with James McIninch below. I'd either use one of the string or memory header files - strncmp or memncmp(I think that's one...it's been several years since I used straight C). Merely pure algorithms, you could do it w/ a loop like this: int iEndIndex, iStartIndex ; for(int iLoop = iStartIndex; iLoop < iEndIndex; iLoop++)  {  char ch = 's'(this could be more robust if a part of a string like "stupid";  pathtoroom[iLoop] = 's'(or whatever the new string is)  } Of course one would be checking for '\0' too because don't want to get caught w/ a null pointer exception. 377 Views
