In what cases are conventional arrays advantages over vectors?I had initially written a program using arrays. Later when I converted it to one using vectors, I saw that the execution time increased. Why is it so? I didn't make any changes in the algorithm used - just this datatype, that's it. What might have been the reason?The main advantage of using conventional arrays over vectors is less execution speed and memory efficiency. Arrays can be initialized at compile time while vectors are always initialized at run time. This causes more execution time if using vector. Arrays don't require parsing extra STL header which is also done at run time. 105 Views  View Upvotes
