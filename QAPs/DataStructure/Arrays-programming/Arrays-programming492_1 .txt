Is it possible to declare a multidimensional array in Java, without knowing the number of dimensions or size of each dimension at compile time?In any language that supports dynamically allocated one-dimensional arrays (more or less all languages), it is possible to simulate the behavior of a multidimensional array with dimensions or sizes that are not known until run-time. I'd recommend you think about this a little bit before reading the next paragraph, as I bet you can figure it out on your own (and it'd be a good thought exercise). Say you determine at run-time that you need to allocate an n-dimensional array where each dimension is of size m (an n by m matrix). Then dynamically allocate an array of size n * m (in Java this would look like int[] data = new int[n * m];). To look up the i-th entry in the j-th array, you would access element i + j * m (again, in Java this would look like data[i + j * m]). In many languages, this is how multidimensional arrays are actually treated "under the hood". Hope this helps. 96 Views  View Upvotes
