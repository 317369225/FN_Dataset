How can I remove item from 1D array and leave the next and so on until I have one item in the array?I am taking up this problem assuming that you know the following concept dynamic memory allocation pointers arrays int number_of_elements,to_delete,i,j; cout << "Enter number of elements: "; cin >> number_of_elements; clrscr();//I like screen clean cout << "Enter elements: "; int *array = new int[number_of_elements]; for( i = 0; i<number_of_elements; ++i){ cin >> array[i]; } clrscr(); cout << "Enter the number you want to delete: "; cin >> to_delete; //Assuming that the number exists in array int *new_array = new int[number_of_elements-1]; for(i = 0, j = 0; i < number_of_elements; ++i){ if(array[i]!=to_delete){ new_array[j] = array[i]; ++j; } } delete array; //Now new_array contains all data of array except deleted one //its your choice if you want to create array again and want to assign //it the values of new_array as shown in code below The code to reassign normal values to array is: int *array = new int[number_of_elements-1]; for(i = 0; i < (number_of_elements-1); ++i){ array[i]=new_array[i]; } delete new_array; I hope that helps you out 57 Views  View Upvotes
