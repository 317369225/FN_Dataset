How do I take a 1d array and convert the array to a 2d array in a c++ function so the array is now 2d in main()?I assume you mean that your 1d array represents a 2d grid of data. Like say we have a 10 x 10 grid of integers. We could store them as: int grid[10*10]; And we could access any member of the grid like so: int &GetIntAt(int x, int y) int GetIntAt(int x, int y) { return grid[y*10 + x]; } As a 2d array, that same grid is: int grid[10][10]; and we access it like this: int GetIntAt(int x, int y) { return grid[y][x]; //or [x][y] if you prefer - you probably don't care which } So how do you convert it? Like this: int grid1d[10*10]; int grid2d[10][10]; int i = 0; for (int x = 0; x < 10; ++x) { for (int y = 0; y < 10; ++y) { grid2d[y][x] = grid1d[i]; ++i; } } Is that what you're asking? 131 Views  View Upvotes
