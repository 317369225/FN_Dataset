What is the sorting algorithm behind a Javascript Array.sort method?usually mergeSort is used as a built in sort method in most languages. II am saying this by my experience as when look at this bug 224128, it appears that MergeSort is being used by Mozilla. In python and java TimSort is used because of best complexity of O(n). Quick sort isnt used because worst case complexity goes upto the order of n^2 if the array is already sorted. Tim sort uses an extra array space of O(n) but is obviously faster! And as for JS, i think merge sort is being used 669 Views  View Upvotes
