Are arrays of arrays possible in C?I am aware that multidimensional arrays are possible, but what I need to do is pass a sub-array into another function. For example: if A=[1 2]  [3 4] I need to be able to pass [1 2] or [1 ; 3] (semicolon means new row) as an array into a function.An element of an array in C can be another array (and the element of that array can be another array). Such arrays of arrays are often called "multidimensional arrays", but they really are arrays of arrays. To use your example, given the declaration int A[2][2]={{1,2},{3,4}}; A is an array of two elements, each of which is an array of two elements, each of which is an int. A[0] is an array of two elements with values 1 and 2 A[1] is an array of two elements with values 3 and 4 So if you need to pass the {1,2} somewhere, just take A[0]. As for "[1;3]", those two ints are not next to each other in memory and so do not form an array. You could write a loop that walks down a column though, or use a matrix library. PS: some of the other answers mention arrays of pointers such as the one pointed to by argv - those can also be used in similar ways, even if they aren't actually arrays of arrays. 1k Views  View Upvotes
