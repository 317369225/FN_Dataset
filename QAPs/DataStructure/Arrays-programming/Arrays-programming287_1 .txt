What is the maximum number of comparisons that a binary search function will make when searching for a value in a 1,000 - element array?Write the code and see.  But if you want to think about the answer, look at how a binary search works. You'll have an array a with 1000 elements (elements 0 - 999). You're looking for value.  Let's say the element is always to the left of where we look, because the numbers are easy.  First, we'll say "Is the element in the middle (a[499]) equal to the value we're looking for?" (no), then "Is the element in the middle greater than the value we're looking for?" (no). The element is between 0 and 498.  a[249] == value ? a[249] > value ?  Repeat for 124, 62, 31, 15, 7, 3, 1, 0 at a cost of 2 comparisons apiece. 8.8k Views  View Upvotes
