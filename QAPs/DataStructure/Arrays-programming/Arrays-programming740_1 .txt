How do I find the max value of an array after several updates?Depends on how many updates you have. If you have A LOT of them then you might want to do something like this: have an array of current values and mark the events. For instance if you have an event (3,7, 17) then at position 3 you would add an event +17 and at position 8 you would add event -17 and so on for all events. At the end you would just traverse the array with a variable that would tell you how much is added at this position, add that to the value at this position and check if it is greater than the current max. You can do it in O(N) if you have for each position 2 values, how much you have to add and how much you have to subtract. 440 Views
