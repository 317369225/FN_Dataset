I have an unsorted array in which I want to search an element. What is the best method for searching with a time complexity less than O(n) and I don't want to sort the array?If the array is unsorted then you cannot do better than O(n) because in the worst case you have to look at all the elements to decide whether an item exists in the array or not. However with some preprocessing you can bring down the time complexity for answering multiple queries. 1. Balanced BST - O(nlogn) to make, O(logn) to search. 2. Hashing - O(n) to make, O(1) to answer (standard hashing assumptions apply) . NOTE: Balanced BST approach is similar to sorting the array but updates(insertion,deletions) in a BST are cheap(logn) whereas for a sorted array is potentially O(n). 2.3k Views  View Upvotes
