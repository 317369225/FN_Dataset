Java (programming language): Why are the list of files/directories returned by File.list() sorted randomly in a Linux machine?The list is sorted alphabetically on the windows machine.The method returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname. The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns null if this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, or if an I/O error occurs. There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular, guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order. Reference : File (Java Platform SE 7 ) PS: In your case the reason behind it might be that you have your files sorted alphabetically in your windows machine, and in some other order in your Linux machine, when you run the code. 153 Views
