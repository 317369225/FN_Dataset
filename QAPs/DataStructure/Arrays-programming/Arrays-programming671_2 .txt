Can we find if the array does not contain a majority element in almost constant time?You need at least linear time to even check half+1 elements in the best case (or all elements in the worst case). And I guess that the lower limit is actually higher than simply linear (single pass) if you don't use a lot of extra memory [depending on your data type] for a vector of frequencies. 72 Views
