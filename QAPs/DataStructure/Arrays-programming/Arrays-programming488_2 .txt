Why is type of address of an array variable pointer to pointer to first element of array?I understand that array name decays to pointer to first element when it is not operand of '&' and 'sizeof'. While sizeof and & operators treat the array variable as an object of contiguous memories but I don't understand why type of &(name of array variable) is pointer to pointer to first element?Well it is not pointer to pointer to first element see this char a[10]; // Let suppose array begins at address 100 printf("%d",a); // Will print 100 printf("%d",a+1); // will print 101  printf("%d",&a); // Will print 100 printf("%d",&a+1); // Will print 110  So that means &(array name) is the pointer to whole array that is why when we increment it we get last address of the array. 70 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sourabh Khandelwal
