What is the difference between an array and a variable?See if i ask you to store 5 in any mug then this mug is called variable and to identify Give this mug a name say 'a'....Now i ask you to store 1 then you can do it in either two ways....Either you can store it in the old mug a or you may use new mug (or now mug can be called as Variable) 'b'..... Now again I ask you to store 3,2,6,7,8......upto 100 more values then you will curse me and will say wrong words in your heart ..Why?? Because first of all you have to individually declare Single Single Variable and then giving them unique name is little bit difficult...Now Suppose you have done this Now i ask you to do some calculation now it is very difficult for you to remember what name was given to what value....Now To solve this problem of declaring these names and then remembering We have An Array.... which can contain similar type of data under one head (or name). Definition of Variable:- Variable is a temporary memory location which can be used to store some value. Why I said temporary bcz this a called later be changed to store 1 ore 2 or 3 etc. Definition of Array :- An array is a collection of homogeneous data type . int a[]={5,1,3,4,5,6,7........} see now you don't need to store 5 1 3 4 using different value,Only Index(or reference can do it).Now Suppose you want to call 5 then you can call it by a[0] and 6 then you can do it by calling a[6]. Note the index start from 0 this you have to remember. Hope i m clear :) All the best:) Enjoy Coding:) 533 Views  Answer requested by Rita Sharma
