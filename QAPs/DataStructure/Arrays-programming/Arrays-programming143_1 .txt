Why do array variables not have an address?Array variable store the address of first element of the array, so in a way the array variable behaves as a pointer, if so, they must have an address but when you print the address of the array variable you get the address of first elements itself. Why so?"Array variable store the address of first element of the array" NO NO NO NO!! This is not the case at all. Array variables, including the first (zeroeth?) element store the type of data of the array. What you seem to be confused by is the shorthand notation in the C programming language that allows you to use the name of the array as the address of the first element of the array. Array elements each have an individual address, just as scalar variables do. You can compute the address of array elements relative to other elements in an array. No element of an array contains an address of the array (although you could potentially create an array of pointers to pointers, and populate the the array with each element of the array being a pointer to itself, but that is a digression). The idea is that when you need to use a refernece to an array (as in an argument to a function), you can simply use the name of the array, rather than explicitly taking the address of the first element of the array. It is all just syntactic sugar. When you understand this, it is a beautiful shorthand that makes code easier to write and read. In the meantime, it does add confusion and is another slightly non-intuitive thing to learn. 1k Views  View Upvotes
