What are the uses of empty array in JavaScript?This is one of the fastest and easiest ways of emptying an array. Of course there are may other ways, but those usually include creation of a new array. This way you reuse the same array. Emptying an array is a common JavaScript task but too often I see the task performed in the incorrect way. Many times developers will create a new array: myArray = []; That isn't the optimal way to get a fresh array; to truncate an array, and thus empty it, you should set the length property to zero: myArray.length = 0; 61 Views  View Upvotes
