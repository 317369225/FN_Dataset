In what cases are conventional arrays advantages over vectors?I had initially written a program using arrays. Later when I converted it to one using vectors, I saw that the execution time increased. Why is it so? I didn't make any changes in the algorithm used - just this datatype, that's it. What might have been the reason?By conventional array I mean array created on stack, not heap (using New operator). Conventional Arrays has advantage when you know array size is fixed, its not going to change during execution of program, like game of tic tac toe which require conventional array of 3*3 integer or game of chess where you can have conventional array of 8*8 integer. If your array going to grow during execution, vector is useful. 36 Views  View Upvotes
