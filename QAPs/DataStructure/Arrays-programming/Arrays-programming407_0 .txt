Why Array Names are equivalent to Pointers in C?If that exists in C Programming, then both can be use interchangeablyâ€¦?I don't know whether I am answering it right or not.....but from what I understood,you want to know how can array names represt the property of a pointer Answer to this is that in c or c++ we use the Syntex :" (datatype) array name[size] " to define an array. Now suppose we have defined an integer array which has a size 10. This means that it can store 10 integer variables. Now there are two methods to access the array elements. 1. Either we can use the array name[I] (I= 0,1,2.......) To access each element stored in the array. 2. Or we can simply write the name of the array.this will automatically call the first element of the array that is the array variable stored at position zero = array name[0]. Comparing this with the pointers we know that pointers point towards the address of the type where the values are stored. This is very similar to calling an array with the base name as it will automatically access the address. Hope I am clear to you. Apologies if I interpreted it wrong. Happy coding :) 26 Views  View Upvotes
