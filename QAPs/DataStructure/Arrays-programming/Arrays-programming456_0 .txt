How do I save all the values of nY vector for the 7 iterations?Here is your solution. My added lines of code have comments that are starred. This code saves all the iterations of the "nY" vector into a cell array (that you can load in whenever you need). This code also saves a separate text file such that you can view each iteration of the "nY" vector in a clear manner. These files will be saved to your current directory. Run the code and play around with it if you want! Enjoy! clear all; close all; clc; AA = [96 94 68 81 86 103 105 102] BB = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] store_nY = cell(1,7); % *Pre-allocate cell array* % TCC = zeros(8,25) % TLL= zeros(1,100) for i=1:7 X=[AA(1,i) AA(1,i+1)] Y=[BB(1,i) BB(1,i+1)] nX=X(1,1):-1:X(1,2) x1 = (Y(1,2)-Y(1,1))/(length(nX)-1) nY = zeros(1,length(nX)) for ii=1:length(nX) yy = Y(1,1)+(ii-1)*x1; nY(ii) = yy end store_nY{i} = nY % *Store nY vector into cell array each iteration end save('nY', 'store_nY'); % *Saves matrix variable (cell array) to a .mat file to be loaded in later if you want* % *Alternatively, this next piece of code writes the iterations to a text file in your current directory* save_file = fopen('nY.txt','wt'); for i=1:7 nY_save = store_nY{i} fprintf(save_file, ['nY Iteration ' int2str(i) ': \n']) fprintf(save_file, '%6.2f', nY_save); fprintf(save_file, '\n\n\n'); end fclose(save_file); 345 Views  View Upvotes
