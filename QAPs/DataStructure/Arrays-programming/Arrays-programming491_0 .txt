How do you remove the last element of an array in c++?In genuine C++11 (or C++14) code, you won't in that case use raw arrays, but some container. You probably would use some std::vector (but perhaps you might use some other container, e.g. std::list ...). So if you use a vector, you'll simply call a method like pop_back (or something else like erase, etc...) So, learn more about C++ standard containers and use them. 363 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Richard Shatz
