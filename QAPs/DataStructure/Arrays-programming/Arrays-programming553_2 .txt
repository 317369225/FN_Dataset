How can I print all elements of a matrix in diagonal order?Solutions would be much easier if we break it down into 2 sub problems: 1. Figure out the start of each diagonal 2. Given the starting indices of a diagonal, print the diagonal public void printMatrixDiagonals(int[][] matrix) { int c = 0; int count = matrix.length + matrix[0].length -1; int i = 0, j = 0; //There can be at most m + n -1 diagonals to be printed while (c < count) { //Start printing diagonals from i and j printDiagonal(i, j, matrix); if (i < matrix.length -1) { //We increment row index until we reach the max number of rows i++; } else if (j < matrix[0].length - 1) { //We are at maximum index of row; so its time to increment col index //We increment column index until we reach the max number of columns j++; } c++; } } Print Diagonal: Notice that every time we start printing each diagonal, index of row should decrement and index of column should incremented: So given starting indices of each diagonal, we can print the diagonal as follows private void printDiagonal(int i, int j, int[][] m) { while (i >=0 && j< m[0].length ) { System.out.print(m[i][j] + " "); i--; j++; } System.out.println(""); } 196 Views  View Upvotes
