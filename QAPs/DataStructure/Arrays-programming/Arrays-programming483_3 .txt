How do I find sum of all subsets of a range in an array?Given an array A of N elements and Q queries of type [ l, r ]. Print the sum of each subset in the range { A[l], A[r] }. For example: A[]= { 1, 2, 3, 4 } and [ l,r ]= [ 1, 3 ] then print sum( 1 ), sum ( 2 ), sum( 3 ), sum( 1,2 ), sum( 1,3 ), sum( 2,3 ), sum( 1,2,3 )I think we can solve the above question using Bit manipulation in O(N^2) method Below is rough code i did not test it. I know there is many Errors in the below code , Please find the faults or error in below code i will try to correct them and update this answer. Ps: I am not computer science engineer , i am hardware engineer so there might be lot of errors in below code. Try at your own risk. void Sum_sets ( char A[], int N, int l, int r) { int sum = 0; for(int i = 0;i < (1 << N); ++i) { sum = 0; for(int j = 0;j < N;++j) { if(i & (1 << j)) { if ( A[j] >l && a[j]< r) { sum += A[j]; } } } printf ("Sum of %d subset is %d",i,sum); } } 360 Views
