How can I send a one dimensional array to a function and have that same array (position in memory) converted into a two dimensional array in C++?In C++, an array is just a pointer to memory, and a two dimensional array is just an array of arrays. Thus, you just need to make an array (size numRows) to store the outer dimension. Set each element of the outer array to the memory location of oneDimensionalArray[currentRow*numColumns]. Then you can access it via twoDimensionalArray[row][column]. You'll need to manage storage of twoDimensionalArray separately. It should only be numRows long, though. You could access oneDimensionalArray in a two dimensional manner by doing the math on every access and then you don't need the extra array, but that's not exactly what you asked. 147 Views  View Upvotes
