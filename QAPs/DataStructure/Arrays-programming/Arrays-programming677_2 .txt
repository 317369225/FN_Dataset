What does an array mean in C?Array is a data structure in C language that provides a contiguous memory allocation. Let me help you visualize it: I assume that you are aware about variables in C language which can be used to store certain values in memory. So let us try an anology. If u can visualize a variable as a office file where u can store your papers, then an array will be like a file cabinet where u can store multiple files in a same place. Advantages of using an arrray: just as file cabinet helps u organize files better so does your array help you in organizing your code better. Instead of using 20 names for different variables of same datatype u can use a single name. It allows you to use loops like for and while which are kinda bread and butter for a coder. It goes easy on memory and processing, if u are interested in deeper details. Limitations: Arrays can only be of a single datatype. Using efficient sort algorithms like merge sort etc becomes little tricky on array. 65 Views  View Upvotes
