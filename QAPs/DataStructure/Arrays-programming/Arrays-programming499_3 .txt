What is difference between array of character and string?Array of characters: #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> // -----------------------   char char_array1[6] = {‘H’, ‘E’,’L’,’L’, ‘O’, ‘\0’}; // above, '\0' is null character, it is required   // ----------------------- char char_array2[] = {‘H’, ‘E’,’L’,’L’, ‘O’, ‘\0’}; // above, '\0' is null character, it is required // you can skip the 6, write [] instead of [6] // the program counts for you. // this is better way to write I think // ----------------------- String: // ----------------------- #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h>   char string1[] = "Hello"; // above, "Hello" is a string of characters // there is no null character // there is no mention on [6], it is just [] // this is the best way to write, in C language, I think   // -----------------------   #include <iostream> #include <string> using namespace std;   string string2 = "Hello" // above, "Hello" is a string of characters // there is no null character // there is no mention on [6] // there is no mention of [] // data type is 'string' (not the char and []), and includes are different // this is the best way to write, in C++ language, I think // ----------------------- Hope that helped.
