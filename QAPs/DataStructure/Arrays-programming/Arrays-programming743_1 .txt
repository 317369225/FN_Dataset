Should I store data in an array in PHP or put it in the DB?One of the biggest differences between those two approaches is speed. In general, a database call is going to be much slower than accessing an element in an array. A reason you would want to choose a database or file route is if users entered information one day, and retrieved it another day. Databases (and files) are good for holding data over long periods of time. It sounds like this does not apply in this case. Another reason to consider database or file as opposed to an array in memory is the size of the data. In general, larger amounts of data are stored on disk in a database or file. (Lots of exceptions to this, but it's a good first approximation for someone starting out.) If speed is not an issue for this application, then either way works. -------- Edit: Wild guess on the difference in speed between accessing an array in memory vs. a database on disk: accessing memory is 10 times faster. But you would really have to test your system. You may find no significant difference at all, especially if you have a small amount of data. Or the information on disk may be cached in memory. It gets very complicated. In general, don't optimize for speed prematurely. Once you see something is running too slowly, find the bottleneck and speed up that part of that process. 1k Views
