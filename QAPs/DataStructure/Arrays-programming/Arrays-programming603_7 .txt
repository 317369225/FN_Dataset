Why don't C++ arrays have an easy way to check their size?Surely someone, somewhere would have thought this was a good idea to have; after all, other languages and other C++ data structures have it -- but why not arrays?The question is incorrect. C++ arrays do have a way to check their size. Since you mentioned data structures of other languages, you should mention that C++ has one too, called std::vector. This array type has a method size() that returns the number of contained elements. 849 Views  View Upvotes
