Why do I find multidimensional arrays hard to use?I'm a beginner at programming,I am learning C++, and I find multidimensional arrays really hard to use and extremely confusing, for example I've been trying for about 3 days now to make a connect 4 game with them, and I still can't do it, why is that? Everybody else seems to do just fine with them?It can take a little while to get the hang of it, but you need to get comfortable with the idea of a 2-d array as a grid of rows and columns, where each cell contains a particular data type, or perhaps null, in the case where it's a grid of objects and any given cell might be empty. This is usually the easiest way to visualize the overall structure. Either index can serve as rows or columns, as long as you are always consistent as to which is which when writing your code. Also make sure that you're comfortable with zero-based indexing, as that trips people up when first dealing with arrays as well. Then make sure you understand how to iterate across columns in a given row, rows in a given column, or perhaps even diagonally, without exceeding the bounds of the array. Feel free to post specific examples of where things aren't working out for you and perhaps we can try to offer more concrete suggestions. 57 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
