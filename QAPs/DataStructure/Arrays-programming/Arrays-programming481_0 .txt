How can I append a number into a java array?In python, you just use ".append" to append a number to a list, is there such method in java. Also, you declare the number of elements in the array. When you add a number, it will show an error.In Java, you would have to create a new array with a larger size and copy the elements over (adding the new element to the end). May I suggest using an ArrayList [1]instead? Effectively, it does the same thing, but it has and add() method that can append a new object to the back of the ArrayList without you having to manually reallocate the whole array and copy every element over (it does that for you and has some optimizations so that you can specify an expected length of the array to decrease the number of reallocations, etc). ArrayList (Java Platform SE 7 ) Look into whether this is suitable for your efforts. Good luck! Footnotes [1] ArrayList (Java Platform SE 7 ) 346 Views
