How do we efficiently sort a large array with a distributed algorithm?A slight variation of the traditional quick sort algorithm will do. The way quick sort works is: 1. Choose a "pivot" value from the array. This could be arbitrarily chosen (i.e. the last element of the array), or choose a median value after scanning the whole array. 2. Scan the array and partition the array into two parts: the part in which every element is smaller than the pivot value; the other part in which every element is equal or large than the pivot value. 3. Run quick sort recursively on these two parts. Step 3 can be distributed, which means partitioned sub arrays can be sent to distributed computing nodes and sorted independently. 547 Views
