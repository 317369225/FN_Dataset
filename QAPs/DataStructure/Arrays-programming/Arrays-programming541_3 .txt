How do I take one argument (the array) and read five values into the array in C programming using a function?Depends. Do you want to prompt, read one value, store it, repeat 5 times? Do you want to read all 5 values on a single line? Space separated? Comma separated? you could use scanf(, scan and convert formatted input, e.g: scanf("%d", array+1); to scan for one integer, and set the second (index 1) to the value. Or do all values at a single go (space separated): scanf("%d %d %d %d %d", array, array + 1, aray + 2, ... array + 4); Scanf() is a function that is a bit unsafe, and can cause some headache though, so be careful. Another way might be to read an entire line (wether to get all 5 values, or just a single) using, for instance, freead() on stdin, then (if one value) convert the string to integer using atoi() or read all 5 values, do your own tokenizing, and then converting each number one by one using the same mechanism. There's more ways, but these should be the simplest ones I think. 137 Views  Answer requested by Mat Perry
