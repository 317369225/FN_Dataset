Which part of an array is the "top" and which part of the array is the "bottom"?It depends how you choose to look at it… so for example, typically if you are looking at a regular array e.g. var x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], then you could say that the “top” of the array is going to be be at index id 0, which is the value 1, which would be the top, making the value 9, at index value 8, the bottom. Using that same idea, we can then start to talk about stacks and queues. In a stack, due to the First In Last Out nature of the array, if we were to use the same var x example, the first value to be pushed onto the stack is 1, then the second value to be pushed onto the stack is 2, which sits above 1, and so on so forth. As a result, this now effectively makes the bottom of the stack 1, and the top of the stack , 9! which is totally opposite to my original example. Looking at it from a queue point of view, which implements a FIFO implementation (first in first out), then whatever is entered first, will be at the front (the head / top of the array), and then 2 -9 will be below 1, forming the tail of the array, with 9 being at the very bottom of the queue. So when you are talking about what is the top and bottom, it really depends how you choose to look at the actual array and what you are trying to achieve with the array itself. 186 Views · View Upvotes
