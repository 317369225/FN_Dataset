How do I find the LCM of given arrays of numbers?LCM(a,b)=(a*b)/GCD(a,b) This relation can be extended for more than two numbers. So, in this problem, you can iterate from i=1 to i<n. In the ith iteration, you will be calculating LCM(a[0],a[1],a[2],...a[i]) and you already have the value of LCM(a[0],a[1]...a[i-1]) which you must have calculated in the (i-1)th iteration,let this value be k (the initial value of this k is a[0]). So in each iteration,you just need to calculate LCM(k,a[i]) (which can be done by the formula I mentioned ) and store this in k. At the end, k will have the answer. And as for the %(10^9+7) part, that shouldn't be a problem as a[i]<=10^5 and n<=10^5 so the product of all the elements is <=10^10. Just use long long int (64 bit) and at the end print k%(10^9+7). 1.3k Views  View Upvotes
