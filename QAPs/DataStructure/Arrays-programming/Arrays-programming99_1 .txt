What is an array in Java? And what is an example of its use?An array in Java is like an array in any other language - it is a group of variables that all have the same name. Each element in the array is distinguished by an index number. eg a[5], a[7]. Array elements can be of any data type or object but every element in a specific array must be of the same type. One of the powerful features of arrays is that you can perform a calculation to get an index number and, in the case of an array of integers, that calculation may include an array element itself. eg a[2*n-3*a[i]] One of the unique features of arrays in Java is that an array is an object and an instance of an array variable must be created using the new command. eg int a[] = new int[100]; 64 Views  Answer requested by Jack Lippman
