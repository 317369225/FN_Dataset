How do I get better at handling arrays in programming?Any special tips!!I shall talk about arrays with respect to languages like C. A common mistake that I have seen when it comes to arrays is the dreaded segmentation fault. The reason is that C does not perform any bound checking. Its upto the programmer to perform such checks. Consider an array of size 10. What happens if you try to access arr[10]? Obviously its out of your array, and hence unsafe. You can either get a garbage value (if its within the segment that you can access) or segmentation fault (if you cant access that segment). So make sure that you perform bound checking when it come to arrays. Another one is the relationship between arrays and pointers. Many consider them to be synonyms, which is confusing. When you send an array to a function, the C Compiler internally delegates the array to a pointer that points to the first element and pointer is then sent. It doesn't mean that the array is a pointer. Suppose you want to create a 2D array, but each individual array should have different size. What shall you do? Just create an array of pointers. int arr[10]; int *p[3]; p[0] = arr; // 2 elements p[1] = arr + 2; // 3 elements p[2] = arr + 5; // 5 elements Consider another example. int* arr[10]; int (*arr)[10]; int *(arr[10]); int *(arr[10])[10]; The first one is obviously an array of 10 integer pointers. The second one is a pointer to an array of 10 integers. The third one is a pointer to an array of 10 integers. And the fourth one is an array of 10 integer pointers, each pointing to an array of 10 integers. Try reading through K&R. 370 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
