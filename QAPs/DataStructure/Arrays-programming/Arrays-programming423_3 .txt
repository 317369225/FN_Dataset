Why is the first element in an array referenced as 0?In languages like C and all its dialects (Java, C++ etc) an array index represents an offset which is added to the base address of the array to get the address of the element in question. An index of zero returns the base address of the array which is its first element. Thus it is logical for indexing to start at zero. However, it is not necessary that index numbers start at zero. In many early BASICs, the index numbers started at 1 and in Pascal, the programmer can define an array whose first index number can be any valid integer. In those cases, the interpreter/compiler just has to do a little more work to determine the address of an array element. 228 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Anudeep Bulla
