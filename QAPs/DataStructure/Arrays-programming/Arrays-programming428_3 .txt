How do I get rid of the brackets after splitting an array in Python?Your code also produces extra white space. Applying the str function to the whole array is a poor way of going about this. One better way is to use a loop like so: arr = [1,4,"string",92] for i in range(len(arr)): arr[i] = str(arr[i]) In this case it is clear to see that you are applying the str function to each element in the list. For a more pythonic solution you could also use list comprehension: arr = [1,4,"string",92] arr = [str(elm) for elm in arr] This method is essentially the same as the one above but is more concise. The most concise method is to use the map function. This function takes another function and an array as its input and outputs an array with the function applied to each element of the array. arr = [1,4,"string",92] arr = map(str, arr) This is more of a functional programming approach. 207 Views
