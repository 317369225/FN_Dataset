Are arrays of arrays possible in C?I am aware that multidimensional arrays are possible, but what I need to do is pass a sub-array into another function. For example: if A=[1 2]  [3 4] I need to be able to pass [1 2] or [1 ; 3] (semicolon means new row) as an array into a function.Yes, you can create arrays of arrays. An array-of-T1 can have T1 as an Array-of-T2, T2 canbe an Array-of-T3 and so on. Python-esque array slicing is not as straightforward though. C arrays are essentially just a contigious block of storage to hold a certain amount of elements. Array subscripting is basically just reading whatever is in memory at a certain offset from the start of the array. You’d have to roll your own functions to properly handle this. 41 Views · Answer requested by Denny Chen
