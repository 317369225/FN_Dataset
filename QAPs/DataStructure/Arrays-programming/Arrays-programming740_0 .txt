How do I find the max value of an array after several updates?You can use segment tree with lazy propagation. As far as I can recall, It requires O(lg N) to update and O(1) to query. In each node, you should save the maximum value in that range. Here is a tutorial for segment tree: Algorithm Tutorials After you get the idea of normal segment tree, here is the idea of lazy propagation: Suppose you have an array of range 1 to 8. and you want to update range 1 - 4. The tree should look like this:  [1 8]  / \  [1 4] [5 8]  / \ / \  [1 2] [3 4] [5 6] [7 8]  / \ / \ / \ / \  [1][2] [3][4] [5][6] [7][8] when you step on the [1 4] range, you just updae the node value of [1 4] range, and put lazyValue += value at this node. And you will not process further node beyond [1 4]. When an update query with range [1 3], what will you do? 1. You are at [1 8] 2. You move to [1 4] 3. You see a lazy value at this node. pass this lazy value to the two child of this node, and update them. 4. move to [1 2] and [3 4] 5. update [1 2] node value, and lazyValue. 6. move [3] 7. update [3] and it's lazyValue. 8.
