Why is C++ so annoying when dealing with arrays and vectors?Why is it not built with ease of use like Matlab?Because you are not aware of std::valarray? In C++, arrays and vectors are not mathematical vector, and should not be used like that. On the other hand, valarray in C++ is designed to be a mathematical vector, just like arrays in matlab. You can add two of them, you can sqrt every element, and so on, like in matlab. Although you will miss some slicing features. 4.6k Views  View Upvotes
