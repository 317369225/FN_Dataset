What is the maximum range, a array can be made in C,because when I write the code and defining array size of the order of 10^9, program crashes?The maximum range depends on the data type of the array that you are using as well as the memory available. It also depends whether you are allocating the array on the stack or on the heap, it again depends on the OS and how it allocates memory for a process and finally it depends on the available RAM. 48 Views  Answer requested by Suraj Prakash Sharma
