Arrays in C: Do they know their own size? If not why do I get an incompatible pointer type warning when assigning int (*) [3] to int **No they don't and Since a C array doesn't know its size, there can be no array assignment.(which is also one of the reasons to use container class) and arrays are not pointers. When you pass a array to a function, it decays as the pointer to its first element.(In case of two dimensional array the first element is an array of single dimension itself and so you need a pointer to an array and not a double pointer.) 146 Views  View Upvotes
