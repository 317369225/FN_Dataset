How do I convert between 1-based and 0-th based index?Suppose I have an array of binary heap with 1-based index. To access a node's parent I need to use index/2. If I want to change this array into 0-based, how do I think about it mathematically ? If possible, please provide a way on generalization for any possible formula like index*4+7In a binary tree/heap array representation, if we use 1-based index, we have for node i left_child i =2i  left_childi=2i right_child i =2i+1  right_childi=2i+1 parent i =⌊i2 ⌋  parenti=⌊i2⌋ In 0-based indices, we have a mapping that node i corresponds to node i+1 in 1-based index. So, we get left_child i =(2i)+1=2i+1  left_childi=(2i)+1=2i+1 right_child i =(2i+1)+1=2i+2  right_childi=(2i+1)+1=2i+2 parent i =⌊i−12 ⌋  parenti=⌊i−12⌋ Note that while using 0-based indices saves 1 memory slot, it makes the implementation a bit more complex. In 1-based indices, the parent of 1 is 0 and we know that 0 is not a valid node. In 0-based indices the parent of 0 is 0, so we need to treat it as a special case. 548 Views · View Upvotes
