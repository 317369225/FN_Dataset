How can I send a one dimensional array to a function and have that same array (position in memory) converted into a two dimensional array in C++?An array is just a pointer to memory, and so is a 2D array. A 2D array is not an array of pointers. It's just a pointer to the data. The dimensions aren't stored with the variable at all, they are merely used by the compiler for the math needed to access the elements. You can just point to the data with a different type. Like so: #include <stdio.h>  typedef int Array1D[5]; typedef int Array2D[5][6];  int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[]) { int testArray1D[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 20, }; Array2D* array2D = (Array2D*)&testArray1D; for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j) { printf("%d, ", (*array2D)[j][i]); } printf("\n"); } return 0; } 46 Views  View Upvotes
