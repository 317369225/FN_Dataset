How would you explain an "array" to a beginner in programming?I faced same problem sometime back. I'm assuming when you are trying to explain array, guy already knows about use of variables and some basic input/output functions like printf(), scanf() etc. This is what i did. First i asked him to read maths marks of 3 students from keyboard and process them (something like calculating average or sum of marks, trivial ones). He did it easily using 3 variables. Then i asked him to do same thing for 10 students. He hesitated a bit for declaring 10 variables but did it anyway. Now i increased the number of students to 100 and asked him to code for it. His response was, "No, we can't declare 100 variables for it. We need something else". Bamn !! This is what i was waiting for. Then i told him, 'something else' we need is called an Array and explained the array syntax to him. You can also use some real life analogy but i like this way better, explanation of a programming construct, to a programmer, in a programmer's way. Hope it helps :) 316 Views  View Upvotes
