How do I randomise different strings of an array in C?Suppose i have 10 different strings in an array. Now i would want to display 5 random strings among 10. How do I do it?Is duplicates allowed? If yes, then just randomize 5 numbers, use these to select strings. Otherwise, you need to check each randomized number to see if it has already been “drawn” so to speak, and re-rando9mize until you have 5 numbers. Then select your strings with these numbers. When you say you have different strings in an array, I presume you either have an array of array of chars (e.g. char strings[SZ_1][SZ_2] = { “abc”, “def”, …, “xyz”};) or array-of-pointers to chars (e.g. char *strings[] = { “abc”, “def”, … , “xyz” };). Then you just need to ensure your random numbers are valid indices ([0;9] in your example with 10 strings, and then just use them as index, e.g char *picked = strings[ my_spiffy_random_index_generator() ]; where my_spiffy_random_index_generator is your randomizer function, wether it ensure unique numbers generated or not. 176 Views · Answer requested by Gitam Gadtaula
