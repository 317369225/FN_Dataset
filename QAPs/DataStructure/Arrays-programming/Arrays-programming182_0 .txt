What are the different types of PA systems and which are suitable for small/large venues? And what are different speaker arrays?There are 4 types of PA systems, in terms of configuration. They are - speakers on stands(usually used in small venues), stage stack(where it is either impractical or impossible to fly speakers up in the air), cluster arrays and or any flown or ceiling mounted speakers. such as in a church or theater, and finally, the flown line array system(which hangs vertically in a straight line). Recently, Mini Line array systems have come on the market. which can either be flown(such as on Genie Lifts), or, can be stacked on either a pole coming out of a Sub woofer sitting on or to the side of a stage or other performance area, or can be mounted on stands. Small venues, such as bars, restaurants or clubs, veterans halls or outdoors setting, such as street fairs, usually only require speakers on stands ......... Large venues, such as amphitheaters, arenas or stadiums usually require flown line array systems, with multiple hangs in addition to the main left and right hangs, such as side fills and rear fills.
