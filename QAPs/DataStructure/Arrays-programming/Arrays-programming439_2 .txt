How do you insert and search array with undefined size in C?Insertion is at the end of current last position (how to use malloc and calloc functions here?). Also, how to search array with undefined size?There are several ways to resolve this question but a simple method to resolve this is using realloc, as you can see some examples here at http://www.cplusplus.com/referen... Another simple way to perform some searching in this array would be setting a delimiter to your array, like is done in the C null termined strings (array of chars). For example, if your array supports a range of value, for example just positive numbers, you can stablish that the end of your array could be -1, so you can do something like below: int array[] = { 0, 1, 2, 100, 5000, -1}; for( int count = 0; array[count] != -1; count++) printf( "%d\n", array[count]); But don't forget to set -1 value to the last item in the reallocated array (if you are using realloc). If you're using a C++ compiler, consider using the STL vector, it is safer. []'s PopolonY2k 64 Views
