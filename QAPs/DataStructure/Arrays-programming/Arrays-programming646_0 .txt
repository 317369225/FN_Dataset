How can I compare two arrays which are in two different controllers?Looks like you are trying to access data of one controller from another. This can be done in multiple ways // using common services function controllerOne(comparisonService) { // call methods of comparisonService } function controllerTwo(comparisonService) { // refers to the same instance of the service } // using events function controllerOne($scope) { $scope.$on('compareEvent', function(event, args) {}); // other controller } function controllerTwo($scope) { $scope.$emit('compareEvent', args); } references - AngularJS Good Luck!!! 109 Views
