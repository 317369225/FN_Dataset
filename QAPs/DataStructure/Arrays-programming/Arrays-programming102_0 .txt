How can I find which number appears the maximum time in an array?Given size of array n, find the number p which appears the maximum time in an array. eg. n = 5 a[n] = {2,3,2,3,2} p = 2If you are not worried about space and time complexity, hereâ€™s the code: int biggest, count; biggest = count = 0; for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { int tempCount = 0; for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) { if (array[i] == array[j]) { tempCount++; } } if (tempCount > count) { biggest = array[i]; count = tempCount; } } print("p = " + biggest); 25 Views
