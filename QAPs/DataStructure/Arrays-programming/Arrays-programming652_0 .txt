I have 2 arrays of unequal size. How can I combine them to get a matrix?r = [0.01 0.02 0.03] n = [5 4 3 2 1] How could i get an output of matrix with (1+r)^n?This should be correct: (1+r(:)).^n Edit: if it doesn't work, it might be because you have an old version which doesn't automatically do the broadcasting operation. For older versions, the bsxfun function can be used: bsxfun(@power,1+r(:),n) 185 Views  View Upvotes
