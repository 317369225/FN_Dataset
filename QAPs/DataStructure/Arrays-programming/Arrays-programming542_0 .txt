What would be the most efficient way to search a sorted array for an index such that A[i] = i?The array may contain duplicates (The case where the array doesn't have duplicates can be solved in log(n) )Even if this is an array of integers, if duplicates are allowed, there is no correct deterministic algorithm that is better than linear in the worst case. Consider the inputs where for almost all i you have A[i]=i+1, except for one x such that A[x]=x. 2.7k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Piyush Maheshwari
