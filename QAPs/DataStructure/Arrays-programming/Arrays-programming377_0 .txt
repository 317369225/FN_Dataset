Given an array of size n, how do you find all the possible subsets of the array of size k in c language?Don’t know the most commonly used method, but I use the following. I am not very skilled and have studied only upto class 12 CBSE( just passed) curriculum of C++. Use binary addition. 0+1=1 1+1=10 10+1=11 11+1=100 This is how to use it:- Create an array(let binary[n]) of size n and initialise it to have all elements as ‘0’. From the last element i.e. binary[n-1], start adding 1. So what you can do is:- binary[n-1]+=1 for(i=n-1; i>0; i—) { if(binary[i]==2) { binary[i]=0;binary[i-1]+=1;} } This will result in some elements having value 1 and others 0. Yyou can now go back to your array(let arr[n]) and compare it with this.So, in your loop:- if(binary[i]==1) and then include the i th element of your arr in the subset. Using this you can also check the size of the subset. Just check the number of 1’s in your binary array. PS:- This may not be what is taught as I figured it out myself. But this seems to work to make combinations. 76 Views · View Upvotes
