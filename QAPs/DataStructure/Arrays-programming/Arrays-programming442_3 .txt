Why we use 'new' keyword in Java for creating an array But in C++ we don't use ‘new’ keyword to create an array?I’ve studied C++ as a subject in Class 12th and I’m currently learning Java watching online videos. So pls use simple terms to answer my question as I am new to all this… :)Arrays are objects in Java. Since ‘new’ key is used it create an object in Java, so we have do it that way. Hope that helped. Best of luck. 63 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Rohit Soni
