How will you store an unstructured sparse matrix in an array?The most common way of storing an unstructured sparse matrix is in Compressed Row Storage (or occasionally the fully equivalent compressed columns storage). This uses three arrays: one for the nonzero element values, one (of equal length) of their column indices, and one for the pointers indicating where in the first two the rows start. I have already described this clearly enough in Data Structures so I suggest you start reading there. 282 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Priyanka Ranganathan
