Why do I find multidimensional arrays hard to use?I'm a beginner at programming,I am learning C++, and I find multidimensional arrays really hard to use and extremely confusing, for example I've been trying for about 3 days now to make a connect 4 game with them, and I still can't do it, why is that? Everybody else seems to do just fine with them?When you learn to program it's not necessary that you understand everything at once or may find everything easy. I found linked list(I think you will learn later) but now after tons of practice, I prefer using linked list rather than any fundamental datatype. Its all about practice. Now let's come to multi-dimension arrays, I agree it is a difficult topic. I personally think that you should first practice some easy single task programs like Find sum of diagonal of arrays of two dimensions whose dimensions are equal Make a program to find product of two matrices, and order of matrix be given by user. Note: Order<=10 After this you should plan out properly, then see the error and try to debug your code accordingly. In starting, devote sometime to, use pen-paper to make an algorithm or strategy to solve any question. ALL THE BEST 74 Views  View Upvotes
