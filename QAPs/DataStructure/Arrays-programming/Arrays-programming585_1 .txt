How can I get Array sort index?Thanks for A2A, Dan Stw The problem can be simplified to sorting 1 to n ( or 0 to n-1) with key for sorting as given array. Thus you need to sort the tuple where each element is of the form (array[i], i) with the key element as first. If 'Array' is the given array and 'index' is the required array, then C++ code should look like this: std::vector<int> Array; ... ... std::vector< std::pair<int, int> > temp(Array.size()); for(int i=0; i<Array.size(); i++) temp[i]={Array[i], i}; //If you want answer in the range 1 to n, then put temp[i]={Array[i], i+1};  std::sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());  std::vector<int> index(Array.size()); for(int i=0; i<temp.size(); i++) index[i]=temp[i].second; And you are done by this. 62 Views  Answer requested by Dan Stw
