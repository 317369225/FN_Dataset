Why don't C++ arrays have an easy way to check their size?Surely someone, somewhere would have thought this was a good idea to have; after all, other languages and other C++ data structures have it -- but why not arrays?C++ has array with size embedded: std::vector. You can check the size of a vector, keep pushing new element in it and the vector will automatically allocate more memory when needed. Thus, it has two sizes: the memory capacity ( function capacity() ) and the number of elements ( function size() ). If you know the size of the array you want before hand and don't want to pay the price of frequent memory allocation, you can use boost::array [1]. Note that, the new C++ standard will include array in its standard libraries. [1] http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_... 1.2k Views  View Upvotes
