How do I load various Arrays in the same TableViewController in SWIFT?I want to load a different array into my TableViewController once a certain button is pressed. E.g.: breakfast, dinner, lunch etc... I have no idea how my tableviewcontroller.swift file can recognize a button being pressed...Does anyone have a idea or demo file somewhere for me too look at?Someone please? What Peter suggests is that I create a button action outlet for all four buttons and let my tableview file know which button is pressed.... I've been dealing with this problem for too long and it seems i'll never get it.. maybe someone can send me a demo file? just to look into --> keor010@gmail.com 73 Views
