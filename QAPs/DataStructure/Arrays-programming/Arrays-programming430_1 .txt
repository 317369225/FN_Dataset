How can I avoid writing all the possibilities of the two-dimensional array?The memset example is okay when you simply wish to populate an array with data whose values are derived from a known pattern. That is a great way to populate an array that will be used for testing purposes. However, if you have arbitrary or independent values, then you would necessarily need first place the data in one array, and then use a nested FOR LOOP or FOR EACH block to first retrieve those values and iteratively insert them into the two-dimensional array. 34 Views
