Can a hash table be implemented using an array?Yes they are in fact. The main part is to find the correct index for a key in the top level array (of Entry objects) using a hash function . If two objects get the same slot in this high level array, then the already placed key points to a linked list of Entry objects. The linked list is traversed now. Each node is checked for equality of key. If it matches (using equals() method) with the [k, v] to be placed, then the v replaces the old value associated with the key. Otherwise, it keeps on traversing and an Entry node (with [k, v]) is added at the end of the linked list. 189 Views  View Upvotes
