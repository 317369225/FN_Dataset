How can a 4-dimensional array be visualised? I.e. a 2-dimensional array can be visualised as a sequence of matrix.First of all, sequence of matrix is a three dimensional array. Sequence is a one dimensional array, so you could say that the 3 dimensional array could be visualized by one dimensional array which value is matrix (2 dimensional array). Going from there you could generalize that 4 dimensional array is a matrix which value is a matrix 57 Views
