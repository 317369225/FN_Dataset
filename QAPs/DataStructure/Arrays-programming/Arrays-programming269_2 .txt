How do I put a number in an array such that each digit of a number is saved in one block of the array?I have a 1000 digit number and wish to put the number in an array of size 1000 such that each digit of the number goes into each single field of the array. How to do this using C programming?Wow, these from Michael Joergensen and Duncan Smith are elegant! Such a smart solution! Get the last digit, put in on its place in array, delete the last digit. Just put it in the loop, or call it recursively while there are any digits remaining. The catch is that you can't work with such long integer, so this solution will not work. The best you can do, regarding integer range, is long long int type, and it stores 19 digit number plus sign. By far and away not enough. You have to declare initial 1000-digit number as string. So, you can't use any algebra operator. But, Robin Joshi is spot on. I think that's the only way. Thanks for a2a. 133 Views  Answer requested by Sree Kuppa
