Can we sort an array by multiplying each element of the array with some special number?Only one number? Then no. Because if two different permutations of the input do not produce the same output, it's not a sorting algorithm. But if they do produce the same output, then we can reverse the sort by dividing everything by the magic number, and we can only get one of the two permutations back. In general, a reversible operation cannot be a sorting algorithm. 440 Views  View Upvotes
