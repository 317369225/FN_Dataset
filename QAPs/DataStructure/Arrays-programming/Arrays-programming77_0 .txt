How do I convert a regular array as in to an associative array?My goal here is I want to access my array in a descriptive way as $this->models[‘loginadmin’] than $this->array[0]. But the thing is that I already declared and filled-in a non associative array. For example. $this->models[] = new $models[$i]().Why not use a “for” loop to iterate through non-associative array and upon each iteration, assign the value of the element as the initialization value of each consecutive element of the associative array? 36 Views
