How can I print a previous array using C++?For example I printed "22 24 26" and then I printed "22 24 25" hoe can I print "22 24 26" again?By having an array of arrays, a queue of arrays, a stack of arrays, or something similar. You will have to maintain the copies of previous arrays yourself. Which of the above constructs to use will be determined by the requirements of how you need to access the arrays. 83 Views  View Upvotes
