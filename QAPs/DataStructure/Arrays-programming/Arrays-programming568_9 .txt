I have an array of integers (both positive and negative). How can I find the smallest missing number in the array?Example: A = [5, -3, 2, 1, 0, -2, 4] return -1 EDIT: Thanks for your answers, maybe I had to say that I am not looking for O(nlogn) solution, since it is trivial. What I am looking is O(n) solution in terms of extra storage and run time.Well one way would be to find the greatest number, pop it into another array while the first isn't empty. If the source array gets emptied then the number will be the last element -1. Otherwise there will be some irregular jump between two elements that can help you find out what the Missing number is (assuming that it isn't necessarily just one greater/less than the closest number). 237 Views
