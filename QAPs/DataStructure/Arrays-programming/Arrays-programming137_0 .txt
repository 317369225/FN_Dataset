How can I reverse an array?If you are in an object oriented language you can extend the array class and just use reverse indices by overwriting the get / getitem method. If performance is critical you could just reverse the loops over the array (from n to 0 instead of from 0 to n). If you really want to reverse the items in the array you can iterate over half the length of the array (adjusted downward) store the i-th element in a temp variable, copy the i-th element from the back to the i-th element and then overwrite it with the temp variable. 120 Views  View Upvotes
