How do I scan strings into a pointer array?for instance say I have a pointer array for colours and I initialize it as char *colors[]={"red" , "blue" , "yellow" }; what if I don't want to initialize the pointer array in the code itself? Is there some function of a kind like scanf I can use here?You have an array of pointers to strings - when you initialize it in the code, the memory for the strings is part of the static heap of the program when compiled. There is no need to allocate or deallocate memory in this case. If you want to do this at runtime, you need to allocate space for the colors array first, and then allocate memory for each string individually. #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h>  int main() { const int N = 5; char **colors = (char**)malloc(N * sizeof(char*)); char buf[512]; for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) { printf ("Enter string:"); scanf("%511s",buf); colors[i] = malloc(strlen(buf+1)); strcpy(colors[i], buf); }  printf("Values:\n"); for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) { printf("%d: %s\n", i, colors[i]); } } 339 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Vamshi Aruru
