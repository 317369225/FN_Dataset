How can I append a number into a java array?In python, you just use ".append" to append a number to a list, is there such method in java. Also, you declare the number of elements in the array. When you add a number, it will show an error.When I studied Python, I noticed its incredible convenient way of handling 'Lists'. You can pack anything inside this wonderful construct, and the compiler/interpreter would take care of everything else. In strongly typed languages, such as Java, you need to define everything to its final bits. In C you would even need to manually allocate the memory to store the objects in your array. Hence, you have much more freedom to hack your way through, but, oh boy, all the typing! That is why people invented ArrayLists to make life simpler. Thus, in conventional Arrays (int[], String[], etc.), there is no way to extend the size. Use Lists, Sets, ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Queues, Deques, etc. to meet your design goal instead.
