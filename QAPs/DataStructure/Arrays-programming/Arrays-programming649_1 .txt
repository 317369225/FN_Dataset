Can someone give me a good example of using an array?Basically it's a list that's easy for a computer to go through and use automatically. If you were just to save all of your informations in separate variables, like dogname1 and dogname2 and so on, the computer wouldn't have an easy way to do things with all of the names. You could call them by hand, but you couldn't really do much with the whole batch automatically (I'm not counting an eval function). So let's take the dog names example. Let's say that I want to pick a random dog name. I could create an array of strings and store the names in that array. Here's a Java example: String[] dognames = {"Fido", "Rover", "Teddy"}; Now I could get one at random doing something like this: Random rand = new Random(); int randomIndex = rand.nextInt(dognames.length); String randomDogName = dognames[randomIndex]; I just generated a random index from 0 to 2 (the number of items in our array), and then set it to a variable (which I could print or what not). This is a very simple example that just scrapes the surface of what you can do with arrays (not to mention ArrayLists), but you can see how it requires less code than having to work with say individual variables. Something else you could do is loop through them to perform an operation or print each one with just a few lines of code. Obviously you can store them in different types. It doesn't have to be text, you can make integer or double arrays, and even arrays of objects that you create, and then manipulate them very rapidly with comparatively little code. 183 Views
