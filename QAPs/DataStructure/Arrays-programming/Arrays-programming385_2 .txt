How can I sort just a single sub-array in a multidimensional array?If you have the knowledge of basic for loop or while loop the loop variable let's say "i" should be taken such that the variable represents the desired row or a column (if at all you want any row or a column to be sorted). Ex: for(i =0; i<n; i++){ // Logic of comparisonArray[6][5][i][6] which includes the comparison and decision making// } Hope this helps you! 16 Views
