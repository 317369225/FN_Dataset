What is the most efficient algorithm to rotate an array by 'k' elements?Problem Description : Solve Left Rotation I thought of 2 solutions: Erasing & Inserting elements simultaneously till ‘k’ iterations. Code @ 4wgrq - Ghostbin Getting all the elements and printing the (i+k)%n th element. Code @ 7ucy9 - Ghostbin (didn’t actually perform rotation operation - is this ok) ?#include<iostream> using namespace std; int main() { int a[100001],n,i,k,tests,count=0; cin>>n>>k; for(i=0;i<n;i++) cin>>a[i]; k=k%n; //not really necessary if k is always less than n for(i=k,count=0;count<n;count++) cout<<a[(i+count)%n]<<" "; return 0; } I have just submitted the solution in hackerrank and got the full score. I have seen your code and slightly modified it…We aren’t applying any logic here just scanning and printing…If u find another algo better than ours (i just modified urs :P) please let me know 62 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Akshay S Danthi
