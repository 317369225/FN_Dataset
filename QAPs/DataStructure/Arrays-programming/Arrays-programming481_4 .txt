How can I append a number into a java array?In python, you just use ".append" to append a number to a list, is there such method in java. Also, you declare the number of elements in the array. When you add a number, it will show an error.I would suggest using ArrayList (I always use them for simplicity) with them you simply do the following: 1. ArrayList anArray = new ArrayList(); 2. anArray.add(1); anArray.add(46); 3. int aNum = 173; 4. 5. anArray.add(aNum); //This is the appended num 6. 7. for (int i = 0; i < anArray.size(); i++){ 8. System.out.println((int) anArray.get(i)) 9. } When Run: 1 46 173 The way to remove an entry is: 1. ArrayListName.remove(index); The downside is you can't have a multi-dimensional ArrayList. But you can have a multi-dimensional array. E.g. String[ ][ ] val = new String[3] [5] (Thanks to Connor Kuhn for pointing this out) 110 Views  View Upvotes
