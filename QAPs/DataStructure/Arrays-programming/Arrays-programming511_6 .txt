Why do array variables not have an address?Array variable store the address of first element of the array, so in a way the array variable behaves as a pointer, if so, they must have an address but when you print the address of the array variable you get the address of first elements itself. Why so?They have its just no pointer is pointing at them( you can make pointer point to them) They are sequential memory blocks and array variable hold the address of first item. You can get address of subsequent items from that variable for example #include <stdio.h>  int main(void) { // your code goes here int a[4] = {5,6,7,8}; int l = 0; /* printing using array var*/ for(l=0;l<4;l++){ printf("%d ",&a[l]); } printf("\n"); int *p = a; /*printing using pointer*/ for(l=0;l<4;l++){ printf("%d ",p++); } return 0; } try it Ideone.com 166 Views
