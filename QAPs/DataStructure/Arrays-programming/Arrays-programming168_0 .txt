How do I take a 1d array and convert the array to a 2d array in a c++ function so the array is now 2d in main()?What do you mean by converting an array into a matrix? You have an array which is a (1 x n) vector: [0, 1, 2, ... , n]. You want to convert to a (m x n) matrix: [00, 01, 02, ... , 0n] [10, 11, 12, ... , 1n] ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... [m0, m1, m2, ... , mn] You can see that you array is only 1 row of a matrix. If your goal is to create a (1 x n) matrix you can just create a new matrix and put in the array's values. #include <iostream> using namespace std;  int main() { const int SIZE = 5; int array[SIZE] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Your array int matrix[1][SIZE];  // Iterate through the array assigning his values to matrix for(int i=0; i < SIZE; i++) { matrix[0][i] = array[i]; }  // You now have a 1xSIZE matrix containing the array's values } 219 Views  View Upvotes
