How do I open files using array in C?Why not create an array of file pointers instead? You could try something like this: #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h>  #define TOTAL_FILES 5  #define FILE_NAME_BUF_SIZE 255  int main() { FILE *files[TOTAL_FILES]; int i;  for(i = 0; i < TOTAL_FILES; i++) { char current_filename[FILE_NAME_BUF_SIZE];  int namelength = sprintf(current_filename, "file%d.txt", i + 1);  // It's always a good idea to be defensive and catch errors if (namelength < 0) { printf("An error occured creating the filename for file file%d.txt\n", i + 1);  // End program return 1; }  files[i] = fopen(current_filename, "r");  // Now double check to make sure a pointer to a file was created. // Very bad bugs are made if a file pointer is set to NULL and we // don't catch it! if (files[i] == NULL) { printf("An error occured creating a file pointer for file%d.txt", i + 1);  return 1; } }  // As an example, you can print out the contents of any file you wish int c;  printf("Here are the contents of file1.txt\n");  // Need the extra brackets around (c = fgetc) so that c doesn't take the // the value of (files[0] != EOF) which is 1 or 0 while((c = fgetc(files[0])) != EOF) { printf("%c", c); }  printf("\n");  printf("Here are the contents of file4.txt\n"); while((c = getc(files[3])) != EOF) { printf("%c", c); }  printf("\n");  // When you're done, be sure to close your files. for (i = 0; i < TOTAL_FILES; i++) { fclose(files[i]); }  return 0; } 334 Views  View Upvotes
