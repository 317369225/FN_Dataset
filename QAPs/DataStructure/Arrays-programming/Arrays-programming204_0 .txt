If the array (sorted array) is having 100 elements, what is the maximum number of comparisons in binary search tree?I believe log(n) to the base 2. where n is the number of elements. F(n) is said to be O(G(n)) for all n>=some n if F(n)<=kG(n) where F(n) and G(n) are functions , and k is constant, (some n) is the minimum value of n, as per the time complexity in terms of big O notation, which gives the upper limit. In case of BST, k=1, G(n) = log(n) to the base 2 , Basic Operation in this case being comparison, Long story short, log(n) to the base 2 is what you need , where n=100 488 Views
