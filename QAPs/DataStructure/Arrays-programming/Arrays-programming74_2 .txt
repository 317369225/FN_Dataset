Why is the first element in an array referenced as 0?I donâ€™t know a definitive answer, but here are two plausible guesses: If computer languages made the arbitrary, but logical decision that arrays should be indexed by non-negative integers, then zero is the first non-negative integer in the range of integers, so it seems a fitting place to start. If you imagine the elements in an array having indices that are whole number increments from the first element, then the first element is 0 increments away from itself, the second element is 1 increment from the first, the third element is 2 increments from the first, and so on. Do either of those appeal to you? 111 Views
