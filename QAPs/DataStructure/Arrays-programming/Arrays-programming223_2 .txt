Can I get some example programs that are done using Array of structures?I see a lot of good C examples of this in other answers. Here are a couple more abstract examples at opposite ends of the spectrum. Relational databases, and graphics. SQL is basically an array of structures. There are many ways that it internally creates tables in order to index the data faster, but conceptually at the end of the day, for a given table the columns are the structure, and the rows are the elements in the array. Another vocabulary term used to talk about array's of structures is a list. Not a linked list, but just a list. A list is another term for an array. A list of vertices, is an array of structures that could contain position, color, normal, and perhaps a bi-normal. The color, normals, and positions can also be structs. A whole array of these may describe the 3d shape of an object. 177 Views  Answer requested by Tauhid Suman
