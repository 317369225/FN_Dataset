How do you insert and search array with undefined size in C?Insertion is at the end of current last position (how to use malloc and calloc functions here?). Also, how to search array with undefined size?1st thing, in memory management of classical C (C89), there can be nothing that is of undefined size. Everything has to be of defined size when you compile the code. Now if you want to search though anything whose end and size is unknown then you have only one option (which I am aware of), you put a predefined, unique character towards the end of the array and then traverse. It does not matter how you traverse, by simply moving one element ahead or by hopping across ( as in binary search). To insert a array at the end , you can use malloc and insert it in a linked list. Array1= malloc(size_of_one_element * number_of_element); Array1 = calloc(number_of_element,size_of_one_element); 80 Views
