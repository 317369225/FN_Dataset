Why can't we use long type as index of an array in java?Is it because of continuous allocation of memory blocks to an array?Wow ! Great Question , But very simple answer. Java vendors has provided the implementation of array in a way that its having a length variable associated with every array object,and its about sense of humour of vendors that they have declared this length variable as int type,and every practical programmer should be int. By defining length variable as int type they have allowed us to create array of size 2147483648 ,so we can store 2147483648 values,and i think we people won't be ever in need to create array of more size. When we are concerned with Programming,most critical resources are memory and execution time,so by declaring int instead of long,obviously we are somehow saving 4 byte memory. And it is not because of continuous allocation of memory blocks to an array,but its because of above mentioned reason i:e memory saving. 814 Views  View Upvotes
