What is an array in GW Basic?An array is written like DIM A(100) and is a group of values referenced by the same name (in the example above ‘A’) Each element in the array is referenced using an index 1..n (max n is 32767). An element can be read and written to using the index number A(3) = 42 The index number for arrays starts by default at 0 but can be changed by using the command OPTION BASE e.g. OPTION BASE 1 You can multiple dimensions as well e.g. DIM M(10,10) Max is 255 dimensions 69 Views
