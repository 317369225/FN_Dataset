Is Linear search the only option for an unsorted array?How unsorted are we talking? If we know anything about how the data came in, we can contrive some manner of taking advantage of that information—most likely by using that information to choose a sorting algorithm. I'll assume we're talking about random data though. I'll also assume that we are unwilling to simply sort the data. In this case we still have options. I can envision a veritable host of convoluted search strategies! Unfortunately, the best of them are no better than linear search. Think of it this way: search strategies are designed to take advantage of information known about our data: how it is sorted, or some other pattern it adheres to. If we know nothing about the data (e.g.: random data), then we have no basis for choosing a search strategy. In such dire circumstances the best option (assuming sorting is off the table) is to choose the simplest O(n) search possible—linear search, or some equivalent. 39 Views · View Upvotes
