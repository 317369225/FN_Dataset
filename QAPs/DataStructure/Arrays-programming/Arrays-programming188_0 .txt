How do I use count as an array in programming?If you want to count the no. of 1's in each column seperately , you'd rather be using an array instead of a single variable. following pseudo-code might help initialize each element of count array to 0; for(i=0 to (n-1)) //n is the no. of columns { for(j=0 to (m-1)) //m is the no. of rows { if(matrix[j][i]==1) count[i]++ ; } } After this, the value in the element count[x] would be the no. of 1's in the x-th column of the matrix. PS: While talking of computers , the indexing as well as counting starts at 0 and not 1 (specially in programming languages) 105 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
