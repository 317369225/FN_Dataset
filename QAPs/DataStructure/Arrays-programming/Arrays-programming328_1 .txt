How can one access specific values within an array?In JS, if every zip code in the US were formatted as: var zipCodes= ([{"ZIP": 10001, "LAT": 40.750633, "LNG": -73.997177 }, etc]) How can one access the LAT or LNG value after the user inputs the ZIP value? Edit: Forgot to state that itâ€™s in javascript. *facepalm*You have an array of objects. If you want to grab only the LAT and LNG values for a matching ZIP (as the key), you can easily use the for loop: var zipCodes = [{"ZIP": 30001, "LAT": 30.750633, "LNG": -63.997177}, {"ZIP": 10001, "LAT": 40.750633, "LNG": -73.997177 }, {"ZIP": 20001, "LAT": 50.750633, "LNG": -83.997177 }];  var key = 20001; //the zip code you want to search var lng, lat;  for(var i=0; i < zipCodes.length; i++){ if(zipCodes[i].ZIP == key){ lat = zipCodes[i].LAT; lng = zipCodes[i].LNG; break; } } However, if you just want to loop through the entire array and print them out, you could use the object.forEach() method: zipCodes.forEach(function(item,index){ lat = item.LAT; lng = item.LNG; }); You can try running the codes here: Edit fiddle - JSFiddle Hope this helps.
