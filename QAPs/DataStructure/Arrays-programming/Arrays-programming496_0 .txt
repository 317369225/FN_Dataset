How do I learn C programming in Arrays and Strings?I am learning C in my second semester,but cannot understand these 2 concepts,some links,notes or videos would be helpful.How do you learn how to make a table or Cook chicken curry or Carve a sculpture? By doing it. You want to build a table, work with wood, saws, hammers, nails. You want to learn to cook chicken, Buy chicken, follow the recipe and cook it on a flame. So, if you want to learn Strings and Arrays, pick up a book, go through the concepts and solve the programming questions. Having done that, go online and solve more problems until you can say that you are comfortable with these problems. You learn programming only by doing. 84 Views
