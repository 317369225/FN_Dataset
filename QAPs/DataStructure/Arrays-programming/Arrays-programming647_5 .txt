Why do array indexes start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?The confusion comes from how you think about indexing into an array. As many have said, it depends on the programming language, but I'll assume that you're using a language that starts from zero. The confusion comes from thinking of the index as an ordinal number. E.G. the "first" element is at a[1]. When you should be thinking of the index as an offset from the beginning. E.G. the "first" element is a distance of zero from the beginning, a[0]. So for languages that start indexing at zero, think in terms of offsets, not ordinal numbers. 8.7k Views  View Upvotes
