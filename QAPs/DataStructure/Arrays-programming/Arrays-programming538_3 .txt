Can anyone make me clear how to use multidimensional array and how it works?Have you ever used a spreadsheet? Well, that's a 2 dimensional array, 3D if you include multiple tabs in one file. The index is defined by the column & the row (and the tab), each unique set of such indexes refer to a unique place in that file. So that's exactly what a multi-dimensional array is: a "grid" of data values addressable by the intersection of indexes. They're usually stored in RAM as a set of normal arrays following one another, and each dimensional index simply refers to an ever narrowing group inside these. Note, you get a multidimensional array and then you get a jagged array (2 or more dimensional). The first means that for any of the indexes the count of that portion of the array is the same as any other. The later is an array of arrays ... of arrays ... continued to the number of dimensions - in which case each can be a different length. 21 Views  Answer requested by Prem raj Luintel
