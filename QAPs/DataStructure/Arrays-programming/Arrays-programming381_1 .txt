Which part of an array is the "top" and which part of the array is the "bottom"?It’s not very common to refer to the extents of an array as the top or bottom. Those terms are more frequently used in conjunction with the stack data type, where top has a logical meaning, not a physical one. When a stack is implemented as an array, it’s efficient to put items on top of the stack by adding them to the end of the array (which is generally allocated with unused space), so if pressed, I would call the end of the array the top. That said, when a stack is implemented as a singly linked list, it is efficient to add items to the beginning, so it’s not a perfect analogy. 70 Views · View Upvotes
