How can I dynamically declare an array in Fortran 77?Fortran 77 does not support dynamic memory allocation. But many Fortran 77 compilers support a non-standard extension known as "Cray pointers". With these you can interact with C and use malloc or mmap. Fortran 90 supports dynamic allocation in the language. But it is very limited compared to what you can do in C. All dynamic allocations must go through the ALLOCATE statement, and you cannot memory map or use custom allocators. You have no control over the mechanism by which the ALLOCATE statement allocates memory, and no means to control or even check the alignment. For this reason many Fortran 90 compilers also provide Cray pointers. Fortran 2003 has ISO C bindings which gives Fortran almost the same dynamic allocation capabilities as C. Dynamic allocation of arrays of derived data types must still go through the ALLOCATE statement. Simple data types and C structs can be allocated the same way you would do in C. (The difference between C structs and derived Fortran data types is e.g. that the latter can have Fortran pointers or allocatable arrays as members.) 950 Views  View Upvotes
