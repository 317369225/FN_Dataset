How do I Print reverse of an array in java ?Just change the for loop to. for(int i = array.length ; i > -1 ; i— ) Oh sorry I didn't see your description. There is array reverse method. Also in Java you have for-each for loop. Specially made to loop through array. But you can't loop in reverse using that. array.reverse(); for(int i:array) sout(i); Why don't you Google? :P 33 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
