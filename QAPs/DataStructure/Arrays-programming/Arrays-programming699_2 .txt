What is an array?If you are a beginner than you can understand the concept of array this way. While making some program in C++, Java,...you might have declared the variables like int a , int s, String str, double x , etc. Now Taking an Example:  Suppose you are asked to find the average of the three int values entered by User. Then u will simply declare int a,b,c and double average . And write a some simple code. Right!! Now in practical cases, suppose you are asked to find the average marks of some subject of some class having strength 100. Now, if u are going to declare variables like int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,..... upto 100 variables , Then it's not a good way, consuming lot of time and doesn't make any sense. Here comes the concept of array , Using which we can define any no. of variables having same datatype in a single line syntax.  i.e int [] array = new int [100]; (in java ) variable names as array[0],array[1],array[2],..... So u need not to write your variables every time as u can use for loop. like  for(int i=0;i<100;i++)  { array[i]=in.nextInt(); } That's the Use of Array. 143 Views  View Upvotes
