Let there be n arrays with m members each. Each array is sorted. How can we convert those n arrays into one sorted array of size n*m?You can do the following 1. In each pass of the sorted arrays merge adjacent two sorted array into one and repeat the process till only one array is left. This will be O(nmlog(n))  O(nmlog⁡(n)) . 2. Create heap from the using the first element from the n sorted arrays. Then in a loop each time access the root element and put it into the final sorted array and replace it with the element from array from which the root element was initially drawn. This too will take O(nmlog(n))  O(nmlog⁡(n)) . 386 Views · View Upvotes
