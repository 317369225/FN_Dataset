I have an array of n integers. How many subarrays are contained in my array?For an array with distinct elements, it would be same as the number of ways of choosing two indices i,j such that the following conditions are met 1. i <= j, 2. i,j >= 0 (assumption indices run from 0 to n-1) 3. i,j < n When i = 0, j can run from 0 to n-1 i.e. n choices When i =1, j can run from 1 to n-1 . . When i =n-1 j can be only n-1 Summing the terms up gives us n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 =n(n+1)/2 However for repeated elements the answer will vary with the contents of the array. I will try to find some generalized equation for the same, but I doubt there is one. 2.1k Views  View Upvotes
