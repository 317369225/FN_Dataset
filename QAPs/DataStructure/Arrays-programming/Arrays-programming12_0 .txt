How do I save words from a string intro a struct array? CYou are mixing up strings and numbers. What strtok() returns is a pointer to the start of a string of characters, yet you are assigning it directly into an element of an array of ints. After obtaining the (presumed) number in character form you next need to convert it to a number…say via atoi(). You are then free to place that value into your numeric array. 252 Views · View Upvotes
