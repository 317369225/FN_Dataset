How do I find second smalles number out of 3 input without using array?The following code might be useful. I am just going to write the main program. int n1,n2,n3,s; n1,n2,n3 ---Input if(n1>n2 && n1>n3) { if(n2>n3) s=n3; else s=n2; } //It is clear in this code that s stores the second largest number if n1 is greatest. Now two more if statements can be used to complete the program.// Voila . It works. P.S :- I have assumed that the 3 numbers are not equal. 46 Views  View Upvotes
