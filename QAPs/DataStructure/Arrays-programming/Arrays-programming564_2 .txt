How do I check if array is empty or not?Well I haven't used C in a while but I don't think arrays are empty by nature they do have some random value in them, if I remember correctly. You could initialize your array elements to contain X char and then form a check if it is empty or not. Edited: Here is some code on how i would do it char arr[2][5]; int i,x; for(i = 0; i< 2;i++ ){ for (x =0; x<5;x++){ arr[i][x]=' '; } } for(i = 0; i< 2;i++ ){ for (x =0; x<5;x++){ printf("Character in position is: %c\n",arr[i][x] ); } } 261 Views
