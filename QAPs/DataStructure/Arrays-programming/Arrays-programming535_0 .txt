How do arrays and functions mesh in Javascript?If I have an array, call a function that creates a new array in the function, and return that function, what happens to it? I know in Java, the array would be a null pointer upon being returned as it is sent to garbage. Is this the same case with Javascript?No, the array lives on until nothing references it. There is no way you will ever get a null pointer because of garbage collection in JavaScript or really any way to get a null pointer exception. The best you could do is access something that was never defined. The whole idea of pointers doesn't really exist in JavaScript. There is a related idea of closures that defines your variable scope and is somewhat unique to JavaScript. You should have a through understanding of if you want to write sophisticated JavaScript.
