Given an array of random numbers, how can one find the longest consecutive sequence?At the expense of a little bit of time (log n factor), we can improve the space complexity (make it constant): Sort the array in-place. O(n log n) time and O(1) space. Initialize a few registers: longest = 1 and position = 0, and current_streak = 1. O(1) space and O(1) time. Run through the sorted array. When x[i] != x[i-1] + 1, reset current_streak = 1. Otherwise, increment current_streak. If current_streak > longest, then longest = current_streak and position = i. O(1) space and O(n) time. Return the slice of the array x between position - longest - 1 to position. If you do this correctly, e.g. without copying, this is O(1) space and O(1) time. Overall, this costs O(1) space and O(n log n) time. 5.1k Views  View Upvotes
