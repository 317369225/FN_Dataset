What is the fastest algorithm for shuffling an array with a seed so that I could deshufle it later?I know you wanted a seed, but unless you "mark" the cards--thus enabling a computer player to cheat--you can't really use a seed per se. Done off the top of my head without testing/debugging, I know the idea works since I've used similar tactics with success. This version is 100% untested. It is O(n). For shuffling, the method is impossible to improve, as you might miss a "card." for i=0 to decksize-1 j=random between i+1 and deck size swap deck[i],deck[j] Use the standard sort to deshuffle, a move that depends on input size to some degree. However, for small ones, Quicksort is a waste of time. 123 Views  View Upvotes
