What are the differences between arrays and linked lists?Arrays: The size of the array is fixed. Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive, because room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to shifted. Random access is possible. Stored in contiguous Memory Locations. Memory Should be allocated at Compile-Time. Linked List: Dynamic size Ease of insertion/deletion Random access is not allowed. Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list. Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance. In Linked list memory is allocated at Run-Time. 768 Views  View Upvotes
