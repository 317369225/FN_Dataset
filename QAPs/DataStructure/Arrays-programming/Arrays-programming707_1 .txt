I have a bunch of NSArrays storing strings. Where is the best place to put them?Typically you want to store NSArray or NSDictionary into Apple's plist (property list) format. There is a writeToFile method on NSArray that you can use to do this. To read the data back in, you can do something like: NSArray* array = [NSArray arrayWithContentsOfFile: "location here"] 107 Views  Answer requested by Mike Rally
