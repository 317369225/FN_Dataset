Can I get some example programs that are done using Array of structures?This would be anything that needs a list of objects. This could be anything really. It could be an operating system performing a task on a list of users. It could be a game engine rendering a bunch of objects to the screen. It could be a social media website gathering details about a list of people for display to the browser. Just take what you know about structures, then take what you know about arrays, then do a sort of "cross product" between the two concepts and that'll give you an idea of what you can do with arrays of structures. 156 Views  Answer requested by Tauhid Suman
