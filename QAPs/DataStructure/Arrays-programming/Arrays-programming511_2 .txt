Why do array variables not have an address?Array variable store the address of first element of the array, so in a way the array variable behaves as a pointer, if so, they must have an address but when you print the address of the array variable you get the address of first elements itself. Why so?Arrays stores the array contents, no more, no less. I would he reason you get the address to the first element is due to pointer decay, and when an array decay it decays to a pointer to the first element. So, when you do: int foo[10], foo names an object with a size of 10 ints with a given storage duration and so on. It does not refer to an address (that would be a pointer) When you print foo, foo decays from array-of-10-ints to a pointer-to-int (there's a few instances when tis decay does not take place) to the first element. 177 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sourabh Khandelwal
