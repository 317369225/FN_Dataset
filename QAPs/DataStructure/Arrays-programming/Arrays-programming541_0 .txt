How do I take one argument (the array) and read five values into the array in C programming using a function?The array name can be used as a pointer to the memory location allocated to the array. Hence, in the function, you can just use this pointer to store the data. In order to read 5 values, you can use a cycle (e.g. for) and scanf to read from the standard input. This boils down to void readData(int* array) { for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) { scanf("%d", &array[i]); } } 409 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Mat Perry
