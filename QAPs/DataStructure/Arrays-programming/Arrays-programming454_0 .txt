Explain this question. Why am I asked to return an array of 10 elements?int * count(const string &s) function counts how many times a digit appears in the string return value is an array of ten elements, each of which holds the count for a digit. For ex, after executing int counts[] = count("12203AB3"), counts[0] is 1, counts[1] is 1, counts[2] is 2, counts[3] is 2.Because there are ten digits in the decimal numbering system, namely '0', '1', '2', ..., '9'. They are asking you to count the occurrences of each of them. Your output array "count" will contain at index 0 the count of digit "0", at index 1 the count of digit "1", and so on. 64 Views  View Upvotes
