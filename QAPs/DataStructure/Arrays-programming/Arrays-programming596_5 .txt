Why is C++ so annoying when dealing with arrays and vectors?Why is it not built with ease of use like Matlab?Matlab is a language built for scientific computing for scientists that have just enough time to learn a programming language to perform comlpex mathematical operation on data and generate plots to visualize computational results. C++ is built for computer programmers and engineers to write highly optimized code and also want it to be readable and scalable along with being manageable. You cannot do that without having some knowledge of the platform that you are targeting. Arrays in particular represent contiguous memory on a computer. If you create an array, you're asking the compiler to give you a contiguous block of memory as the underlying machine code representation. This will vary based on whether you are on a bare-metal platform or have an OS that does memory management for you. MATLAB is easy to use because it hides a lot of the minute details of creating and manipulating arrays. Same with Python. But guess what ? One of the most widely used python interpreters is written in C which makes it very fast and efficient. Very high level languages exist in order to make computation easier for other streams of science that are not focused on CS but need heavy duty computing and number crunching to develop algorithms and numerical approximations or just to make sense of data. The people in such areas dont care to spend the time to debug C code just to arrive at some signal processing or image processing algorithm. Likewise, when you're doing machine learning algorithm development, you can care less about some stray pointer that makes your program crash. 774 Views  View Upvotes
