If I can't add any thing to a list declared as ArrayList<? extends Number> then what is the use of this declaration?I was reading and found that we cannot add anything in a collection defined with a question mark in it as this means an unknown type. If this is the case then what is the purpose of such a declaration in java collectionsYou are right. You cannot add anything to an unknown type list, since its "unknown type". You typically use such construct when you get the data filled list from an external source and want to process it. Then you refer to the unknown type and read it as objects and process it. Makes sense? Feel free to comment if you require further clarifications. See this for more reference.
