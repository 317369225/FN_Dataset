What is difference between array of character and string?Originally Answered: What is the difference between character array and string? In terms of what they can store they are same. char is just a datatype. String is a class and has many standard and useful function which could even be overridden to suit ur needs. If you are a noobie and didn't get what I said just understand that you have more freedom and functionality with Strings than in char. If it's Java ur learning I recommend bucky roberts aka thenewboston. 42 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Mehul Jain
