Is it possible to have a dynamic contiguous array without its size being fixed internally?Link which contains some details about the question: Is it possible to have a dynamic contiguous array without its size being fixed internally?It depends on the language and the system you use but it may be possible to add contiguous amounts to the array if the array is at the top of the heap. However, this is pretty system dependent and in most cases, the address of the new memory allocation is not guaranteed. Ordinarily, you would have two options: Create a new array and copy the elements of the old array to the new array. This takes O(n) time to do. Use a linked-list. Of course, you lose the advantage of being able to locate an element in O(1) time given its index number. 33 Views  Answer requested by Muaz Al-Jarhi
