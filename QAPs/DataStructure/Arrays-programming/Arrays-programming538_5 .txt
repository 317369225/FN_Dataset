Can anyone make me clear how to use multidimensional array and how it works?The other answer is great - here is another way to think about it conceptually. Imagine a city with 100 identical buildings- each building having 20 identical rooms - each room has 10 aisles - each aisle has 30 filing cabinets -each cabinet has 3 drawers and each drawer has 100 folders and each folder has 10 papers. Each thing I just mentioned has a number on it from 0 to (x-1) where x is the number in that collection - (for example room would be from 0-19) What you have conceptually is a 7 dimension array - if I gave you the 7 numbers in order (building,room,aisle,cabinet,drawer,folder,paper) - you could find any paper in the entire city without any problem. (0,0,0,0,0,0,0) would be the 'first' paper, ( 99,19,9,29,2,99,9) would be the 'last' 25 Views
