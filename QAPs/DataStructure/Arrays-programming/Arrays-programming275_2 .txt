Is it possible to implement linked list using arrays in Java?This is not a homework question. As far I know Java it is not possible to implement LinkedList using arrays in Java. But my friend and me had a bet and he said that he will prove me wrong. I am scared now, also I am curious to know how one could implement that. If it is possible let me know. Thanks.You do it essentially by reinventing the notion of a pointer (which is what you use to implement the links). Imagine a Java class that contains two fields, one is an int, the other is arbitrary (and will be used to hold the data in your list, whatever that data might be). Next, you declare an array of that class. The elements of the array will be the elements in your linked list. Within each element, the int field is the array index of the next element of the list. 705 Views  View Upvotes
