If arrays are objects in Java, from which class do they belong to?Arrays are of the type you want them to be. If you create them of type String, then you get String arrays, if you make int, you get int arrays. Now, int gets autoboxed to Integer. So, implicitly they become of type Object. Java collections contain some improved implementations of arrays like ArrayList, etc. They use array functionality to do better work by just calling their own methods. 140 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
