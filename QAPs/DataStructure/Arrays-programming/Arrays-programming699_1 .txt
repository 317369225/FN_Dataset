What is an array?Originally Answered: What is an array?Arrays as implemented in programming languages have the following properties: Arrays are homogeneous, all elements are of the same data type Memory allocated to the elements of an array is contiguous in memory Arrays have dimension. One dimensioned arrays have one dimension, two dimensioned arrays have two dimensions and so on. For some of them we have special names, vectors, matrices etc Each dimension of an array has a size Size along a particular dimension is constant. For example, a matrix has rows and columns. Size of each row, that is number of columns, is the same for all rows, it cannot vary from row to row An element in an array can be addressed by its indices, position along each dimension Some languages start indexing from 0 (C/C++, Java, Python, PHP), some from 1 (Fortran, MATLAB, Scilab, GNU Octave) and some allow the programmer to chose the start index (Fortran) 241 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
