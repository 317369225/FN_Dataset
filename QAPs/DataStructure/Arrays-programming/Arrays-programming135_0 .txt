How do you write a program to sort an array using a single loop?Use counting sort for this Counting Sort - GeeksforGeeks Note that it is not exactly a single loop but 3 loops Time Complexity: O(n+k) where n is the number of elements in input array and k is the range of input. Auxiliary Space: O(n+k) The above gives the complexity which is better than nlogn if n and k are small. I find it useful when k is small and n is really large, for n = 10000000, nlogn = 10000000log(10000000) = 70000000 where as assuming it is a sort of 100 digits, you get O(n+k) = 10000000 + 100, this can be used in scenarios like sorting temperature from a very large dataset of temperatures. 74 Views  View Upvotes
