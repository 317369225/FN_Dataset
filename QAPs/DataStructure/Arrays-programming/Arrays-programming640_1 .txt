"An array/vector of size n n has exactly n(n+1)2 n(n+1)2 total number of subarrays / sub-sequences" - Is this theory valid for all n?If you observe, how do we create a sub array? Suppose of m elements, Eg- {n1,n2,n3....nm} Remove no element,we get one sub array. {n1,n2...,nm} Remove 1 element from the above array,either from start or end, we get sub array. {n1,n2....,n(m-1)} {n2,n3,....n(m)} 2 arrays Remove 1 element from the above arrays n1,n2..n(m-2) n2,n3...n(m-1) n2,n3,...n(m-1) n3,n4...n(m) As you can see 2 are common.. So in total 3 arrays. And so on, so total we will have 1+2+....n = n(n+1)/2 For those who wonder how n(n+1)/2 came, Let s = 1+2+3....+n  s = n+n-1+...1 Adding both 2s = (n+1)n s = n(n+1)/2 151 Views  View Upvotes
