I have trouble viewing algorithms from a broad perspective, and instead get caught up in details. How can I change this?As a simple example, if I'm sorting an array, I find myself getting stuck on how I would sort individual elements of the array, rather than how to get the overall array sorted. I find myself thinking too iteratively. I'm taking my first algorithms class right now, and would appreciate any advice.You should try to think more abstractly. Instead of thinking about particular kinds of objects, assume the objects can be sorted and worry about the actual algorithm. I guess the strategy in general is to assume what you need to assume in order to make understanding the steps of the procedure as simple as possible. Once you are comfortable with the algorithm on a high level, go back and consider "implementation details." Adding details back once you have some good context to put them in will lead to a better overall understanding. 165 Views
