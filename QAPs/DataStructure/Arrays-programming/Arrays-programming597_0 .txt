How does one remove an element from an array in Java?int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5}; if i want to remove index of 1 how to do thisAn array has a static size, you can't remove an item and make the array smaller. You'd need to create a new array, one item smaller, and then you can use System.arrayCopy to copy the left and then the right items to the new array. This call is a native memcopy and much faster that copying items one by one. If you want to dynamically remove and insert items into lists, you should use a List. The List is the interface. For sporadic delete/insert operations, or small lists, the ArrayList implementation is enough. For a lot of operations and values, use the LinkedList. The disadvantage is that lists requires objects, hence Integers and not ints. List<Integer> l = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5)); l.remove(1); (Arrays.asList(Object ... args) returns an immutable list, hence the double list creation) 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
