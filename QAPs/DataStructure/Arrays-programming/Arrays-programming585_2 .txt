How can I get Array sort index?I will answer your question using Python: This is the code:- aList = [5,4,9,1] >>> sorted(aList) [1, 4, 5, 9] >>> sorted(range(len(aList)), key=aList.__getitem__) [3, 1, 0, 2] I have defined a list aList,which is like an array. sorted() is a function which returns the sorted list. The next line sorted(range(len(aList)) , key = aList.__getitem__) can be broken down as : sorted() takes two inputs a. numbers to be sorted ; b. key on which has to be sorted. By default, the key sorts the number in ascending order Now , let's dive deeper into the code: len(aList) = no. of elements in the list --> 4 range(n) takes no. from 0 to n-1 i.e. 0,1,2,3 aList.__getitem__ This will fetch values i.e. 5,4,9,1 After this line is executed, the list is sorted out and the corresponding index of the value is printed [3,1,0,2] Hope this suffice your query :) 31 Views  Answer requested by Dan Stw
