How do I find the subset of an array in c?Subset of the array in c can be find manually coding the code.Their is no inbuilt function in c like the functions we use for strings and all. Subset of an array can be found by considering different types of combination of elements of array that we can have. For example : for the array having n elements there will be (2 n −1)  (2n−1) subsets. This is because: (2 n −1)=(n1)+(n2)+(n3)+(n4)+(n5)............(nn)  (2n−1)=(n1)+(n2)+(n3)+(n4)+(n5)............(nn) 47 Views
