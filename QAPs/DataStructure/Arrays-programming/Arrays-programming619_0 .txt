Which one of the following is efficient? for (int I = 0; I < arr.length; I++) // arr is a array or int limit = arr.length;// arr is a array for (int I = 0; I < limit; I++)It is equally efficient if length property of arr is update internally at the time of addition or deletion of an item to/from arr. But 1st statement loop is not efficient if arr.length is calculated internally every time on execution. It is also depend on programming language you use. A variable and a property of any object is equally in context of addressing in C and C++, but in other higher languages like Java, C#.Net, VB. Net property of object takes one extra step of processing to address actual value of property because in these languages you use reference of object not actual object like c++. 86 Views
