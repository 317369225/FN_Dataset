Why we use 'new' keyword in Java for creating an array But in C++ we don't use ‘new’ keyword to create an array?I’ve studied C++ as a subject in Class 12th and I’m currently learning Java watching online videos. So pls use simple terms to answer my question as I am new to all this… :)Array is derived data type and In c++ we can allocate memory to derived data type on stack and heap also. But, In case of java we should have to use new keyword to allocate the memory for all derived types. There is a class for every array in java. There is a class for int[] there is a class for float[], We access the class of int[] by invoking int[].class and parent of this int[].class is super class Object. So we cant allocate memory to array like a preemtive data types in java. 53 Views  View Upvotes
