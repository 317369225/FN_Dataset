Which one of the following is efficient? for (int I = 0; I < arr.length; I++) // arr is a array or int limit = arr.length;// arr is a array for (int I = 0; I < limit; I++)The second one for sure. To obtain the value of object varibale takes time and in each check of for loop statement, the same is done.But this is thing that compiler itself optimizes. Technically second is faster but the asm code or the byte code for both is same and corresponds to the latter one :) 68 Views  Answer requested by Pugazhendhi S.p
