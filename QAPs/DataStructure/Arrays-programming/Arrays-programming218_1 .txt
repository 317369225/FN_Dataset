Algorithms: An array of n elements contains only two distinct values. How many calls to the Partition subroutine are needed to completely sort this array? (Select ONE answer) A. O(l) B. O(log n) C. O(n) D. O(n log n)?its C: O(n) ---> PARTITION(A, p, r )       x ← A[r ]       i ← p − 1       for j ← p to r − 1             do if A[ j ] ≤ x                   then i ← i + 1                   exchange A[i ] ↔ A[ j ]       exchange A[i + 1] ↔ A[r ]       return i + 1 QUICKSORT(A, p, r )       if p < r             then q ←PARTITION(A, p, r )                   QUICKSORT(A, p, q − 1)                   QUICKSORT(A, q + 1, r ) Initial call is QUICKSORT(A, 1, n).      ::from Cormen suppose initially elements are arranged in following way- A=[2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]  After 8 successive  call to partition() A would remain as it is.  Its 9th call  to partition() that would process first '1' from right .   => after 9th call to partition, A would finally get sorted. => O(n) 228 Views
