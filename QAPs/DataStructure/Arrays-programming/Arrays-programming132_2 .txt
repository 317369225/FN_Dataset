How can I print a previous array using C++?For example I printed "22 24 26" and then I printed "22 24 25" hoe can I print "22 24 26" again?It is very important that you need to share your code here. For example are these arrays different, or the same one that you updated lately. I assume they are the same one, so that you are having a problem to print the older one. Anyway, you can store your array's data to another one, or to a vector (which is suggestable from me). Otherwise, C++ is not keeping the old datas, so you need to handle the situation with a basic logic of yours. 46 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
