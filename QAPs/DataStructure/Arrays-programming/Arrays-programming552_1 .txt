Suppose we had an algorithm that took in an array of strings, sorted each string, and then sorted the full array. What would the runtime be?K - max length of string n - number of elements in the array Time complexity - O((k+n) * k) Idea : 1 ) Loop through max characters of the string. 2)For each iteration run another loop to find the smallest or largest character in the string itself and replace it with the current character. 3)Run a loop through all the strings in that array and sort each character(bucket sort) 4)Final solution contains list of strings in which each string is sorted and also the list is sorted. Time complexity for step 1 O(k),step 2 o(k),step 3 o(n) Total time = (step 2 + step 3)*(step 1) hence O((k+n)*k).  111 Views
