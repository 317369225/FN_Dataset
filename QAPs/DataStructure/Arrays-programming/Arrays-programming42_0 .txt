What are the differences between structures and arrays?Array datatype is ordered list of items (in almost all language all items are of same data type) Example where to use array : List of students, list of subjects, marks list etc. String students[] = (“bob”,”alice”,”ram”) Sturcture datatype is to have a single name for related values under one name. Example to use structure: you can have a single struct Address with different related values, like struct Address { Int street_no, String area, String city, } /* very basic example :) */ 106 Views
