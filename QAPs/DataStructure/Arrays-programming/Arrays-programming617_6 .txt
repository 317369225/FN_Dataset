Can I get some example programs that are done using Array of structures?Yeah ... Arrays of structures can be used in many places .... Suppose you are required to store the information of each and every member of any organisation then one can store information about the members using arrays of structures ... In any type of organisation there are many posts to be filled.. suppose if we take an example of any college then.... In any college there are teachers,workers,Directors,administration etc. So you can utilize there arrays of structures... Every member of the array will be a structure .. 1. First member of the arrays of structures will store information about Teachers 2.Second member of the arrays of the structures will store information about the workers.... and so on... So arrays of structures can be used in the wide range to store the information in the large scale.... but i would rather suggest you to learn about the classes in C++.. Life would be more easy... 135 Views  View Upvotes
