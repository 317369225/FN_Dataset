From where should I do questions of arrays to get 100 in computer science CBSE on March?Solve previous years' questions. Buy S.L. Arora's question bank for C++ (if possible). Solve questions from l OOP like inheritance. Linked list, inheritance, boolean algebra, SQL, stack queues and DFH are the most important topics. The topic classes is also very easy. Good luck for your exams. P.S. my brother is also preparing ffor CBSE computer exam. 46 Views
