How do I search element from one array is present in another in optimized way?So you’re basically asking whether there’s at least one element which is common in both arrays. Here’s the strategy that I would follow: Let a (length n) and b (length m) be the two arrays given. sort(a,a+n); sort(b,b+n); int i = 0, j = 0; while(i < n && j < m){ if(a[i] < b[j]){ i++; }else if(a[i] > b[j]){ j++; }else{ cout << a[i] << " is common among the two elements!" << endl; break; } } Let N be the length of bigger array, then the time complexity in big Oh notation would be: O(NlogN) 99 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Vivek Kale
