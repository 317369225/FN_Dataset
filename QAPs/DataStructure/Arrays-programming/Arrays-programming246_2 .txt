How can we understand which array is smaller, before starting to code, if we have 2 arrays?In C/C++ an array is just a pointer to a chunk of memory. Say you have an array of 5 elements that starts at memory position 100. SomeElement[5] var; SomeElement* temp; temp = var; Basically, var[0] = 100, var[1] = 101 up to var[4] = 104; Temp[0] = 100...temp[4] = 104; Please note that the = here is the memory position, not the element inside it. 192 Views  View Upvotes
