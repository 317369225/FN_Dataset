When should hash maps be used compared to arrays and array lists?Lists and maps are different data structures. Maps are used when you want to associate a key with a value and When you add items to HashMap you are not guaranteed to retrieve the items in the same order you put them in. Arrays and array list are good when you have a lot of random accesses and you do not have a key-value pair relation. HashMap also provide random accesses but they tend to suffer with collisions, which then depends on how efficient the hash function is. Lists can also be used to store a key Value pair where the key happens to be the position. So in conclusion use a HashMap when you need random accesses to elements, you do need to maintain an order and you have a key-value pair relation. 127 Views  View Upvotes
