How can you write a function of a two Dimensional array in C++ to swap the first column elements with the last column and the second column with the second last column and so on?(The middle column remains unchanged)This sounds like a homework question. So here is some advice. First just write something that reverses the order of a single dimensional array. This is essentially swapping the first element with the last. And if you have an even number of elements, there is no middle column. Once you have done that, then just repeat for all the remaining rows. 271 Views
