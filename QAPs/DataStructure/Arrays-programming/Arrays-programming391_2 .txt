How can I store and process large 2d array?I have to store and process the relations (correlations) between a large number of objects. And I'm looking for a right concept for this problem. The array can be dynamically resized by adding new objects. I'm going to present the relation values as a float number (like in the image).As tends to be the case in this type of problems, our old friend “Time vs Space” comes into play. Do you want faster processing? Well, you’re gonna need quite some RAM. Use a double array (as crude as the language allows you to), then break it down into pieces and compute those in parallel. Do you want to use less RAM and would be willing to have a slower processing time? Then break down the array into various parts (depending on how much you want to sacrifice) and write them down in files (if you use SSDs) or in a DB (if you have a fast enough connection to it) and load those arrays one by one and compute them the same way as above. As is always the case in big data processing, Divide and Conquer is your friend. Grab up some SSD, a couple of GB of RAM (maybe 8 GB) and a good processor, and fire away! Another thing you might do is create clusters (either via VM or directly using other servers), but that’s quite a task, and I’m not quite sure it would help you out here. 209 Views · View Upvotes
