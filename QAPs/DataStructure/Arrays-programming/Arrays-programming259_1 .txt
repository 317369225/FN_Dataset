How do you do an array in Python?Arrays in basic Python are actually lists that can contain mixed datatypes. However, the numarray module contains support for true arrays, including multi-dimensional arrays, as well as IDL-style array operations and the where function. To use arrays, you must import numarray or from numarray import *. Unfortunately, numarray generally only suports numeric arrays. Lists must be used for strings or objects. By importing numarray.strings and numarray.objects, you can convert string and object lists to arrays and use some of the numarray features, but only numeric lists are fully supported by numarray. Creating lists: A list can be created by defining it with []. A numbered list can also be created with the range function which takes start and stop values and an increment. list = [2, 4, 7, 9] list2 = [3, "test", True, 7.4] a = range(5) #a = [0,1,2,3,4] a = range(10,0,-2) #a = [10,8,6,4,2] An empty list can be initialized with [] and then the append command can be used to append data to the end of the list: a=[] a.append("test") a.append(5) print a -> ['test', 5] Finally, if you want a list to have a predetermined size, you can create a list and fill it with None's: a=[None]*length a[5] = "Fifth" a[3] = 6 print len(a) -> 10A quick google search will give you more information.
