How do I find the difference between two multi-dimensional arrays in PHP?I don't know PHP but tried to find it out. Here is one which you can try <?php function arrayRecursiveDiff($aArray1, $aArray2) { $aReturn = array(); foreach ($aArray1 as $mKey => $mValue) { if (array_key_exists($mKey, $aArray2)) { if (is_array($mValue)) { $aRecursiveDiff = arrayRecursiveDiff($mValue, $aArray2[$mKey]); if (count($aRecursiveDiff)) { $aReturn[$mKey] = $aRecursiveDiff; } } else { if ($mValue != $aArray2[$mKey]) { $aReturn[$mKey] = $mValue; } } } else { $aReturn[$mKey] = $mValue; } } return $aReturn; } ?> 283 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
