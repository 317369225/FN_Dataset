Given an array of random numbers, how can one find the longest consecutive sequence?I thought of modelling this as a graph problem, as follows: Create a set from the given multiset, so you know which unique numbers are there. Iterate through this set, and for each number X, create a node and connect it to nodes (X+1) and (X-1) if (X+1) and (X-1) exist in the set (you can look them up in amortized O(1) time if you’ve stored the numbers in a hashmap). Now you have a forest. Find the diameters of all trees in the forest like this [1]. Take the max of all the diameters, and that should be your answer. Footnotes [1] Algorithm to find diameter of a tree using BFS/DFS. Why does it work? 857 Views · View Upvotes
