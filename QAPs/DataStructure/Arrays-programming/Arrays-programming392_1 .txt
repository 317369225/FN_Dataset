How is an integer array in c stored?It’s just a block of memory. Getting to elements is a question of knowing how big they are (from the comments, and contrary to the example in the description, 8 bits each), and multiplying that by which one you want (if you want the 0-th one, 0 * 8, offset 0 - if you want the 2-nd, 2 * 8, offset 16). About getting this to JS, there are two options - like Garry Taylor said in his answer, by serialization, or directly as binary data and JS typed arrays (Sending and Receiving Binary Data). If we’re talking about lots of data (millions of array elements), the first solution (serializing to JSON or similar) might be impractical (it’s very inefficient, it transfers everything as text, and each letter takes up as much space as an entire element of yours - never mind that there will be a lot of processing happening, on both sides). 447 Views · View Upvotes
