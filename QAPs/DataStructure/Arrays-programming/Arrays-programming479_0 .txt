Is it wrong to use arrays in drawing many things?Hello guys, I am trying to make an arkanoid game, I am trying to draw the bricks using arrays, but it seems like this is making the program very slow, and the movement of the paddle gets delayed so much, also the ball is moving step by step, is there a better way to draw them? I'm using Allegro.Think of every step you do in programming as an old style punched card where each individual step is a single card. Then go back to your program and count how many punched cards you go through. If you come up with an extrordinary large figure you may all of a sudden feel for what your poor innocent processor has to burn through for no good reason. So you are drawing a brick in memory? Doodle it up once in a memory block and just allocate to the screen! You don't have to manually draw up every single block! Repetitive instructions may be a computers strong point but they are not a programmers especially if you are doing games. The idea with a game is to give the appearance of multiple redraws on the screen while doing the barest minimum to render it. There is also the magic of optimization to get you doing things right. Since I started off on databases funneling stuff down a 9600 modem I learnt quickly. But it never hurts to learn how to get the maximum throughput in minimum code. 138 Views
