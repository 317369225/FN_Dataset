How do I use count as an array in programming?Well I guess you must have done your side of efforts. So I am humbly suggesting you a complete c code for your problem. (Well I love cheat codes.) // Suppose your matrix size is m*n i.e. m rows and n columns int matrix [5][5]; enum size {row_size = 5, column_size =5};  int row,col;  // Initializing count array for row and column int count_zero[column_size],count_one[column_size];  //you need to traverse matrix column wise  for(col = 0; col<column_size; ++col) { // reset count variable for each column; count_zero[col]=0; count_one[col]=0;  //now for every column you need to traverse a row //Thus, changing rows keeping column same for(row=0; row<row_size;++row) { if(matrix[row][col] == 1) { count_one[col]++; } else { count_zero[col]++; } } } // Now each index of count_one will have number of 1's in each column // same goes for count_zero. // Program can be optimzed though 68 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
