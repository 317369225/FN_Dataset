How can I swap two strings within an array of strings (2D array) without using an additional string?So an old trick to swap variables without a temp variable is to do a series of XOR operations. X := X XOR Y Y := X XOR Y X := X XOR Y However, there may be some nuances with strings since they are not guaranteed to have the same amount of bits. Perhaps iterating through the characters one by one doing using the XOR method. I can already see a lot of cases of language dependent issues where this probably wouldn't work except for goldilocks type conditions such as the strings are the same length 681 Views  View Upvotes
