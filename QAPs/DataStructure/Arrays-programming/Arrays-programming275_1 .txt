Is it possible to implement linked list using arrays in Java?This is not a homework question. As far I know Java it is not possible to implement LinkedList using arrays in Java. But my friend and me had a bet and he said that he will prove me wrong. I am scared now, also I am curious to know how one could implement that. If it is possible let me know. Thanks.Sure you can. You'd basically just be providing a wrapper around ArrayList (which is backed by an array) with a few convenience methods thrown in. For example, linkedList.removeLast() would delegate to arrayList.remove(arrayList.size() - 1) and so on. The biggest drawback to this approach will be the cost of inserting and removing elements towards the head. With a LinkedList implemented by pointers, deleting the head element is as simple as a pointer swap. Using an ArrayList, removing the first element will result in every other element being shifted down one index. 958 Views  View Upvotes
