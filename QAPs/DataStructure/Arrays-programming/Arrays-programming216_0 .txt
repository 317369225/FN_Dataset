What is the difference between an array and an array list?Array is a fixed size data structure where as in Arraylist we can modify length by appending elements afterwards. For array we have to mention size earlier because fixed memory has to be allocated before but in Arraylist mentioning size is not fixed. One more difference is that Arraylist cannot hold primitive datatypes as it can hold only objects referring to datatype. 462 Views  View Upvotes
