What is wrong with this dynamic memory C code?Why are you complicating things so much? If you want to store records of 'n' students then just use a structure buddy. struct record {  char firstname[20];  char lastname[20];  double score; }; int main(void) {  int size, i;  printf("\nEnter the no. of records to be created: ");  scanf("%d",&size);  struct records *s=(struct records*)malloc(size*sizeof(struct records));  puts("\nEnter the records:");  for(i=0; i < size; i++) {  scanf("%s %s",s[i].firstname,s[i].lastname);  scanf("%lf",&s[i].score);  } /* the i th record is for i th student like you have taken 'ctr'. You can also define int id; in the struct records to have an unique id for each record. */  return 0; } 55 Views
