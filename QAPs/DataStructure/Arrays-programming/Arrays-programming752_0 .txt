How do I create arrays implicitly?if n=3 how to create 3 arrays implicitly in c programming language?I don't really get the 'implicit' part of your question. Based on your other programming questions, I would guess you mean something more like 'dynamic', so I will answer that question. Let me know if you meant something different and I will adjust my answer accordingly. Suppose you have a function that takes an integer parameter which represents the number of arrays to be created. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that each array entry will be a C string (char array terminated with a zero hex value) with at most 100 chars. The function will return a pointer to the array of strings. Function signature: // fun returns a pointer to an array of strings char** fun (int arraySize); Function definition: char** fun(int arraySize) { // ptr to an array which will hold the strings char** arrayOfStrings = malloc(sizeof(void*)*arraySize); int i; for (i = 0; i < arraySize; ++i) { // this is one of the strings char *cPtr = malloc(sizeof(char)*101); sprintf(cPtr, "This is string number %d", i); // put it into the array arrayOfStrings[i] = cPtr; } return arrayOfStrings; } Invoking the function from main(): int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int arraySize = 3; char **arrayOfStrings = fun(arraySize); int i; for (i = 0; i < arraySize; ++i) { printf("%s\n", arrayOfStrings[i]); } return 0; } Expected output: This is string number 0 This is string number 1 This is string number 2 231 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Naresh Reddy
