I have trouble viewing algorithms from a broad perspective, and instead get caught up in details. How can I change this?As a simple example, if I'm sorting an array, I find myself getting stuck on how I would sort individual elements of the array, rather than how to get the overall array sorted. I find myself thinking too iteratively. I'm taking my first algorithms class right now, and would appreciate any advice.An algorithm is simply a set of instructions. The algorithms you will study will all solve some kind of problem. It may help you to focus on the problem being solved. So if the problem is sorting then the comparison doesn't really matter as long as two values can be compared and the comparison returns equal, greater than or less than. What also may help is truth tables and stepping through the algorithm so you get a feel for what the algorithm does. So basically you pick some arbitrary input for the algorithm, maintain a table with the values of variables used by the algorithm and you just execute each step and update your truth table as required. You can also maybe benefit from looking at the evolution of algorithms. So look at inefficient algorithms like bubble sort and understand why it is inefficient. Then look at quick sort and understand why it is more efficient than bubble sort. 124 Views
