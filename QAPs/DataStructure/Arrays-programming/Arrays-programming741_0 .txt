How can I set a character array to null in Java? Or empty it?Well to set a Java array to null is easy. Consider: char[] cArray = new char[5];  cArray[0] = 'a'; cArray[1] = 'b'; cArray[2] = 'c'; cArray[3] = 'd'; cArray[4] = 'e';  //Now to set it to null cArray = null; When you say "empty", one thinks of a java.util.Collection like a List, Set, or Map. Ordinarily you can't change the size of an Array but you can redefine it to a size of 0(zero) as such: cArray = new char[0]; or cArray = null; There are more complex ways, like utilization of the java.util.Arrays, Collections and probably many others in the Apache libraries of which I'm not thinking at the moment but the above really gives enough with which to work. 4.1k Views  View Upvotes
