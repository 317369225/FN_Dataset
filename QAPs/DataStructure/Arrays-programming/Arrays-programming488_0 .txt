Why is type of address of an array variable pointer to pointer to first element of array?I understand that array name decays to pointer to first element when it is not operand of '&' and 'sizeof'. While sizeof and & operators treat the array variable as an object of contiguous memories but I don't understand why type of &(name of array variable) is pointer to pointer to first element?don't understand why type of &(name of array variable) is pointer to pointer to first element? The type of &(name of array variable) is *not* pointer to pointer to first element. The type is "pointer to array". int a[5]; // array int (*p1)[5] = &a; // pointer to array int *p2 = &a[0]; // pointer to first element int **p3 = &p2; // pointer to pointer to first element 732 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sourabh Khandelwal
