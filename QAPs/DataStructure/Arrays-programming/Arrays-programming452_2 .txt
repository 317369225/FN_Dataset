How can I find which number appears the maximum time in an array?Given size of array n, find the number p which appears the maximum time in an array. eg. n = 5 a[n] = {2,3,2,3,2} p = 2What you can do is sort the array and compare each element with the remaining elements! Add a condition that if the current element is equal to the any of the remaining elements, then increase the counter by 1. This is commonly known as binary searching. You can also use the hashmap structure which would reduce the length of your code but this method is much more complex as compared to binary search method! Cheers and happy coding! xD 73 Views
