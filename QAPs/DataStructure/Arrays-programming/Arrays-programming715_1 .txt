How do I efficiently count the number of unique IDs in an array?Assuming IDs are all random numeric numbers.. I know algorithm that runs in O(n) running time and O(n) space.. How can we do better than that?If we can assume a truly random generator of numbers between a and b, then taking a couple sample spaces should give you a statistically correct answer. This can be done in constant time. 64 Views
