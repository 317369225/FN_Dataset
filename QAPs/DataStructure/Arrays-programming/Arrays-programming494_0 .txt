How can a 4-dimensional array be visualised? I.e. a 2-dimensional array can be visualised as a sequence of matrix.I will give my own concept here. I understand you already are capable to visualize 2-D array. It should be like a table, Now, how do you visualize 3-D array? It looks something like below Can you see some similarity? You can say that a 3-D array is an "Array of 2-D Array". This is a recursive definition, and you can use use to it define as well as visualize array of any dimension, provided you use proper visualization scheme. Now, how does a 4-D array looks? It should look like an array of 3-D array. Something like below I derived this concept long ago, when no-one could answer me this question. Later, I found out that this is a good layman's solution to this problem. Hope this helps. Note: Images are taken from google, and are not my creation. 148 Views  View Upvotes
