Given an array consisting of 0's and 1's which is rotated array of "11111000000.." or “000001111…” how can we find positions of 1's?for eg array can be like this [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,..,1,1,1] or [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,..0,0,0] ie atmost two transitions from [0 –>1], or [1->0]. I’m expecting this in logarithmic time.Only possible solution to this problem is linear traversal of the array. Consider a sub-problem where you have a string like ‘…0000000100000…’. In this case the answer you want can be calculated by finding the position of ‘1’, but the only way to find it, is traversing the array. No binary or ternary search will work as the behavior of the array does not give any idea about the position of that ‘1’. Although I think that there might be a faster solution to this problem provided there is a relation between count of zeros and ones. 130 Views · View Upvotes
