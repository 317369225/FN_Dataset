Are arrays of arrays possible in C?I am aware that multidimensional arrays are possible, but what I need to do is pass a sub-array into another function. For example: if A=[1 2]  [3 4] I need to be able to pass [1 2] or [1 ; 3] (semicolon means new row) as an array into a function.Not just possible, they are mandatory! Every C program contains: int main(int argc, char **argv); // or: char *argv[] argv is an array of arrays of chars - in other words, an array of strings. Every C program is passed this array of arrays of chars so that the program can inspect its command line arguments. 190 Views  View Upvotes
