How is an integer array in c stored?It is stored in C as a sequential set of words in memory. If the integers were int8 (byte per number). Your first number is the byte at address X. The next one is at X+1, and so on. There is no other structure before, after our during the array. Using larger integers requires adding the number of bytes used in memory is all. 2 for int16 and 4 for int32. JavaScript can work with binary like this, but it sounds like that may be hard for you to work with currently. Until you are more comfortable with dealing with binary data you should stick with the string representations. 202 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Matt Bulova
