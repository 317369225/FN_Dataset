How do I convert uppercase strings into lowercase strings in Java by using arrays?The brute force method, that comes straight in my mind is using ASCII values. Start with an iterative loop which goes to each character of the string. Now, the uppercase and lowercase letters have a difference of 32 in ASCII value. So, replace every character in the loop by the lowercase letter. 504 Views  View Upvotes
