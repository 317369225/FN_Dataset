How would you explain an "array" to a beginner in programming?Arrays are similar to set in Maths. when you want to store multiple elements of the same type (data type) and want to process them in same manner, arrays are helpful. If you declare multiple variables instead of an array, it will be difficult for you to remember and recognize all the variables while coding and modifying your code because all variables represent same kind of data (ex- marks). Arrays are collection of elements having homogeneous data type. They are stored contiguously in memory, so access is faster. And as you will be processing all elements in same manner, you can use simple loops to process them. This is the way, I explain to my students and yeah, they geyt it. :) 214 Views  View Upvotes
