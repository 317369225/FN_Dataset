What is the fastest algorithm to find the largest number in an unsorted array?The other answers are correct, the problem as stated is O(N). However, consider that the problem is Embarrassingly parallel. You could easily assign four threads to look at one quarter of the array, each, and return the largest number they find. After they all complete, you can select the largest of the four and that is the final answer. If you have terabytes of data, instead of dividing the problem into multiple threads, you could divide it into multiple computers (which could further subdivide into threads). There are inefficiencies in this approach, of course. If the data is local to a machine, processing it there (with such a simple operation as this) will be faster than transferring it across the network for others to do some of the work...you are I/O bound. Even on a single machine, you won't actually get 4x speed from four threads as they fight for memory bandwidth. But you should get some speedup. 35.3k Views  View Upvotes
