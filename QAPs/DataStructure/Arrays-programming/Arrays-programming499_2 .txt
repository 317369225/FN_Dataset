What is difference between array of character and string?Originally Answered: What is the difference between character array and string? That’s a paradox question, it takes time. Well I will simplify it, this way. char ar[]=”123456”; In character you don’t need to specifically keep the null character at the ending. It automatically detects the length of string and adds the null character. char ar[]=”123456\0” (in run time) But, It is a condition you should always define the char array, with some value. In string char ar[6]=”12345\0”; This is how a normal string is declared. But when you want to end the string, for three characters, it is must that you should always end the last value with ‘\0’, otherwise it would obviously print garbage values. And another suggestion, when you are copying a character pointer, it is a great practice to use strncpy. Which avoids the concept of Garbage value. 208 Views · View Upvotes
