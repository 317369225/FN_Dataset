How can I sort just a single sub-array in a multidimensional array?If you are sorting a single row of an array then you would need to sort the entire column corresponding to each element in the row if you wish the elements to correspond with each other. Part of any sorting algorithm involves exchanging two elements of the array. Assuming you are exchanging the mth and nth elements of the ith row, you would have to exchange the mth and nth element of every row to keep the column aligned. for j = 0 to column length-1 t = A[j,m] A[j,m] = A[j.n] A[j,n] = t next j 67 Views
