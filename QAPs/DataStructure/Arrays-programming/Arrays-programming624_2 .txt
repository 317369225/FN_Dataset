Why numeric arrays don't end with a null like strings?May depend on the language/implementation of it, but in general fixed length arrays of fixed lenght elemenents are not delimited by their content, but by their definition. A 10 elements (4-byte) integer array occupies 10x4 bytes, the Nth element is at the position (N-1)x4, and can have any value from -maxint to maxint, (including 0 that is 4 times the null character, and values smaller than 256 having 3 times the null character, and so on). So, is not the idea of arrays to end in a random place where a special value is found, and most of the values that are in numeric strings may end being in fact the null character. Variable lenght numerical arrays may have a linked list of where are the values, or a number that say what is the actual lenght, or the position of the last value, or maybe other ways to implement it, but in no case should have a valid integer value as a possible termination marker. Even if you represent the numbers as strings (i.e. to have arbitrary numeric precision, and the language/library lying to you saying that that is a numeric array), you probably will have the null character to end the individual strings, not the whole array. 68 Views
