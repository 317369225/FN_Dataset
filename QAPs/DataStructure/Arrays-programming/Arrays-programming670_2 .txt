How do you find an array's length or size in C?Originally Answered: C (programming language): How do you find the size of an array in C with the following declaration?You can't really, in any useful context. If the array is statically declared, you can do it with: sizeof( array ) / sizeof( array[0] ), but there's not much need to find the size of a predeclared static single array. You usually know the size. If array is a parameter, you can't, easily, as parameters are always passed as short values, for arrays they pass the base address of the array and nothing more. You can play some games with macros, define: #define PassArray(A) (A), ( sizeof(A) / sizeof( A[0] ) #define AcceptArray(A,S) A, int S then you can call somefunc( PassArray( TheArray )) and accept it as: void somefunc( AcceptArray( A, ASize ) ) dirty, but it works, for middling amount of "work". In C it NEVER passes the type or the size or the element size of an array, so you always have to play some trick to pass the extra information. 1.5k Views  View Upvotes
