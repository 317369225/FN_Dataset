Why in phylogenetic trees the common ancestors always branch into only two species? Why can't more species evolve from one?
It is often a matter of the resolution available in the data itself. Suppose species A splits into three successors (that is, it goes extinct after the speciation) B, C, and D. Now it is unlikely that these new species evolve at the exact same moment in geological history (speciation usually takes time; exceptions being polyploid speciation, where chromosomes duplicate, forming fully fledged new species; this happens a lot in some plant families). So, for our purposes, it serves to identify the new species as dichotomous splits. We usually base this on things like genetic divergence, degree... (more)
