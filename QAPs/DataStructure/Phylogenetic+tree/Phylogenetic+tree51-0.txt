Are there industrial job opportunities for a person whose PhD focuses on making phylogenetic trees of fungal genomes?
Doing just that work?   Probably not.  The most direct application would be into microbial/fungal biotechnology (food science and agricultural biologics come to mind). But those skills should be transferable to the broader biotechnology/genetics sector in any system (plants, microbial, human/medical). 137 Views · 1 Upvote
