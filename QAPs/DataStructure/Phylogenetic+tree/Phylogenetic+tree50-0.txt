What does it mean when a group in a phylogenetic tree is recovered? What is a simple explanation of this, and of the maximum likelihood of this happening?
Say I have five organisms {A,B,C,D,E}. I can divide these organisms into “groups” so that {A,B,C} is one group and maybe {D,E} is another group. This division can be meaningful (reptiles vs. mammals, plants vs. animals, red vs. blue) or it can be totally arbitrary. Now, if I run a phylogenetic analysis, and I find that A,B and C form a monophyletic group (“clade”), then we say that the group {A,B,C} is “recovered” by the phylogenetic analysis. 168 Views · 2 Upvotes
