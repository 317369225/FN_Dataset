Why in phylogenetic trees the common ancestors always branch into only two species? Why can't more species evolve from one?
the nodes represent the order in which we think that species branch from a common ancestor based on various features (genetic and physical) and species can and do split and split over and over again. The reason we never see three is because these nodes are largely just approximations based on interrelationships - in principle you could have an event that split one species into three (i.e. a river forms with a fork in it, splitting one species into three groups which all travel their merry way) but it would be very hard from the evidence, thousands or millions of years later, to determine an...
