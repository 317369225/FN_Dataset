What algorithms are used to construct phylogenetic trees?
There are several algorithms used to infer phylogenetic trees, but the most widely-used algorithms fall into three main categories: Distance algorithms use a relevant metric of distance (Hamming distance, 1 - sequence identity, expression level, etc.) to construct a matrix showing the pairwise distance between all organisms/genes in a dataset. This matrix is then used to construct a tree, with organisms/genes appearing on the terminal nodes (tips), such that the distance between tips in the tree is equal to (or at least close to) the distance between organisms/genes in the matrix.
