How do I identify gene duplication events from a phylogenetic tree?
You cannot identify duplications by looking at a tree (cladogram, dendrogram)... you have to look at the sequences of the genes/proteins OR the characters the tree is based on.  For genes/proteins, we have computer programs and tools for quickly aligning and ranking the "best" alignments"  For physical characters, we have the hard work of paleontologists, anatomists, and naturalists of many biological disciplines. Gene duplications have often led to "pseudogenes" whose functions were either silenced or indeterminate... but then after many generations, mutations in the pseudogenes led to active genes which we look back today as being part of a "multi-gene family."  You have to do some dedicated work to find those instances, you can't look at a tree of a multi-gene family and assume that's how it happened. 523 Views · 1 Upvote
