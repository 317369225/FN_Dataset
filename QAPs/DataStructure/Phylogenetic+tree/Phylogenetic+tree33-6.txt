Why in phylogenetic trees the common ancestors always branch into only two species? Why can't more species evolve from one?
I guess it could. But it would be very difficult. Lets take birds who are notorious for following some feathery crest. Bitds that hop along the ground and eat grubs. If a high place gave way, water might spill out dividing the land into two. Then they would most likely diverge. Unless it dried up in enough time and they merged. But what would cause two simultaneous divergence from a central point? Still many animals are very vague enough that we are just making guesses. This is why for example panda’s were bears. Then there were with the racoons and now they are back to bears. But they aren’... (more)
