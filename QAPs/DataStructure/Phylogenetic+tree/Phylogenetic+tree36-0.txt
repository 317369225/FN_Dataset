If we construct phylogenetic trees of specific proteins (such as cold-resistant proteins), could we find possible markers for abrupt climate change?
My short answer is no, you can't do that.  My (very) long answer is below: I don't want to burst your bubble or anything, but I think that simply tracing bottlenecks is a whole different game from what you're talking about (and the results of such analyses are far easier to defend).  Particularly, using a protein-coding gene to detect pre-Cambrian selection pressure is basically impossible. The problem (for geneticists) with many protein-coding genes is that they aren't very phylogenetically informative over long time frames.  This is because, in a given reading frame (the "gene" that end...
