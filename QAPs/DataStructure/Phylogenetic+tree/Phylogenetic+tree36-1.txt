If we construct phylogenetic trees of specific proteins (such as cold-resistant proteins), could we find possible markers for abrupt climate change?
You may be interested in software such as PAML or HYPHY, which try to infer rates of selection at phylogenetic nodes -- which is, I think, what you're trying to get at with this question. 236 Views · 5 Upvotes · Not for Reproduction
