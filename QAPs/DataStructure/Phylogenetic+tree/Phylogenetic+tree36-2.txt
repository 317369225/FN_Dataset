If we construct phylogenetic trees of specific proteins (such as cold-resistant proteins), could we find possible markers for abrupt climate change?
Theoretically, yes. What you can do is construct a phylogenetic tree of your protein of interest (using the DNA sequence) and then use a dating method to come up with a data for the "event" (for example a bottleneck) that you've observed. If the date of the "event" and the environmental event that you are interested in coincide then what you can do is infer a correlation between the environmental event and the observed changes in the DNA sequence of the protein. 2.4k Views Â· 1 Upvote
