What does a bootstrapping value of 100 mean on a phylogenetic tree node?
The bootstrapping value doesn't say anything direct about evolutionary conservation: it says how well this node is supported in the model you're using to generate a phylogenetic tree. Bootstrapping is a procedure where you take a random subset of the data and re-run the phylogenetic analysis, and the reported value is the percentage of bootstrap replicates in which the node showed up. Thus, 100 means that the node is well-supported: it showed up in all bootstrap replicates. What other taxa are in your phylogenetic tree? That would help interpret the 100% bootstrap value. For example, if yo... (more)
