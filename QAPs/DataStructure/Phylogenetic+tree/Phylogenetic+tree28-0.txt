How should one interpret values at phylogenetic tree nodes for gene sequences aligned from different species?
You can force just about any collection of sequences to form a phylogenetic tree, despite the fact that they would be meaningless in most cases. The "meaningless" trees or even nodes can result from relatively short regions of similarity between the sequences you're considering. Bootstrapping is the process by which phylogenetic alignment algorithms test the robustness of each of the assigned nodes. Essentially, the algorithm will pick columns of aligned characters to ignore at random and rerun the node assignment algorithm. If nodes represent robust similarity, removing subsets of charac...
