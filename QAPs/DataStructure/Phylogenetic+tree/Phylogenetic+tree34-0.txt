What are some of the most spectacular redrawings of the phylogenetic tree of life when genomics replaced morphologic classifications? Have there been many corrections and what are the most important ones?
The most spectacular example I can think of is the panda bear being finally classified as a bear (Ursidae family) and not a member of the raccoon family (Procyonidae family), based first on molecular and chromosomal data presented in a Nature paper from 1995 (http://www.nature.com/nature/jou...), then by sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA and a few nuclear genes in 2004 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pu...) and reinforced by the genome sequence in 2010 (http://www.nature.com/nature/jou...). In contrast, the red panda remained a member of the raccoon family. From: Campbell's Biology The p... (more)
