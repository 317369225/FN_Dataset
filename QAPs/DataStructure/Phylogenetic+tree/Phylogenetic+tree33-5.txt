Why in phylogenetic trees the common ancestors always branch into only two species? Why can't more species evolve from one?
Just to add to what has already been said: Changes in the environment will often spur the development of many different species simultaneously, however it often occurs that only one or two at most will be sustained while the others will possess some weakness that will diminish its tolerance level as compared to the others. this is the general mechanism of natural selection … the few that are ‘selected’ from the many, contingent on the local environment vs the tolerance level of the species. 26 Views · Answer requested by Joona Auvinen
