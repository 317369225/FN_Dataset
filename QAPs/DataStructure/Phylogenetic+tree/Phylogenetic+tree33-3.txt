Why in phylogenetic trees the common ancestors always branch into only two species? Why can't more species evolve from one?
They can and they do split into more than two, but the probablity is simply lower unless there was adaptive radiation. Fossilization is a rare occurrence, and most fossils are probably still hidden in the earth or they were destroyed from mining, quarrying, erosion, building, construction, development, etc. The oldest parts of the bottom of the ocean are only up to c. 200 million years old because of tectonic plate movement, so all fossils located in the ocean before 200 million years are gone forever. Thatâ€™s why fossils of ocean life more than c. 200 million years old are only found on land. ... (more)
