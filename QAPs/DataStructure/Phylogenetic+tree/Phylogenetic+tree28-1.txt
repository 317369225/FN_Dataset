How should one interpret values at phylogenetic tree nodes for gene sequences aligned from different species?
It's been a while, so someone might correct me if I'm wrong: It depends on the settings, but usually this is the results of the bootstrapping, and means that the program assigned that node either 100% if the time or in 100 out of the 500 reps (probably 100%). Note that the tree is not rooted, and thus you could draw the second node anywhere outside the mouse/human branch, that's why you don't get a number. You might be tempted to interpret this as chickens and Xenopus are in one clade, mammals in another, but this tree could be drawn in other orientations that are equivalent. 173 Views Â· 1 Upvote
