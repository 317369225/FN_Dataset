Do RNA viruses mutate so rapidly that there eventually becomes a point of "saturation" where it's impossible to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree out of them?
You can reconstruct the phylogenetic trees reasonably well, but inferring times (e.g. TMRCA) can be difficult as you hit saturation mutation levels fairly quickly.  There are a number of techniques that are proposed to try to deal with this but I don't think any are broadly accepted.  Nevertheless, TMCRA has been inferred as far back as a thousand years for influenza viruses, and further for some other RNA viruses, though there are broad error bars around those estimates. Edit to add even though RNA viruses can mutate incredibly fast, this is less of a concern for phylogeny than you might think because much of their genomes can't tolerate mutations.  There are always conserved chunks of genomes that are under strong negative selection, that can be used to build phylogenetic trees for long-term inferences.  Conversely, of course, there are often regions of the genome that are either allowed to drift (neutral), or that are actively driven to undergo change (positive selection) and these regions so change rapidly and are useful for short-term tracking, but not for long-term. 532 Views · 14 Upvotes · Not for Reproduction
