Is the phylogenetic tree of life an accurate model? I'm looking to have a version of it tattooed on my back (see link for an example) but want to be sure that its a proven theory.
Accurate? Sure. It is directionally accurate. Is it etched in stone (or make "written in permanent ink" is the better metaphor here)? No, there are going to be tweaks to elements of the tree for a long time to come. There are some branches that can be established with a high degree of confidence (close to 100%), but there are others that are shaky. Incidentally, I think you forgot to include a link to the tree you're thinking of using. 277 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
