What is a good phylogenetic tree of human population groups?
I have previously posted this tree of modern peoples in Quora. It is based on genetic data and is taken from here: Worldwide Human Relationships Inferred from Genome-Wide Patterns of Variation. In this diagram, the more to the left a split occurred, the father back in time it was. If you want to know how we got to that composition, there are many Out of Africa diagrams on the internet. These depict our origin in Africa and how our ancestors may have migrated to other parts of the world. 282 Views Â· 10 Upvotes
