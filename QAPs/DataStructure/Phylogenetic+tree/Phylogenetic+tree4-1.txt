What algorithms are used to construct phylogenetic trees?
In general, phylogenetic trees are not formed using computational methods; however, this has been changing. Currently, the 3 major algorithmic concepts involved are Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian Inference. Parsimony is essentially just picking the tree that involves the lowest node and clade complexity ( shortest distance) Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference use an input tree combined with other data ( alignments, morphology etc) to create a posterior distribution (a set of probabilities of different phylogenetic trees being correct) Another thing to look into is how...
