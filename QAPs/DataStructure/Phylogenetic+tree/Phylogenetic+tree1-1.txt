What is the difference between cladogram and phylogenetic tree?
A cladogram is a type of phylogenetic tree that only shows tree topology—the shape indicating relatedness. It shows that, say, humans are more closely related to chimpanzees than to gorillas, but not the time or genetic distance between the species. I rather like this one[1]because humans are shown as the outgroup, which is commonly but erroneously interpreted to be “less evolved” A phylogram, on the other hand, has branch distance proportional to evolutionary distance, whether based on genetics or characteristics. This[2] is one of my favorites, showing the relationships among squamates (liza... (more)
