Are humans more empathetic towards organisms closer to humans in the phylogenetic tree than those farther away?
You are probably right but I think it is more complex. Other parameters should be taken into account : -Utility is an important factor as well : people will care more about a rabbit than a badger… -Morality is influenced by cultural and religious matters. For exemple a Jain or a vegan will never kill an animal but in the other hand the bible will tell you the snakes are evil (so they have to be killed). -Not every human thinks the same way. For example, I have more empathy for crows than most people do. 17 Views · 1 Upvote
