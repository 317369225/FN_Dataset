Does phylogenetic tree estimate the age of living things?
Originally Answered: Does phylogenetic tree estimate the age of living things? A phylogenetic tree uses traits (or lack of) in order to group the organisms. Branching occurs when a trait is modified/appears/disappears and is no long shared with all descendents. While we can estimate how long ago a certain trait was modified (by checking the length of the branches) this gives us an estimate for that trait only. Not the organism itself. If you know which set of characteristics each organism has, then you know that that specific organism cannot be older than the presence of the youngest trait.
