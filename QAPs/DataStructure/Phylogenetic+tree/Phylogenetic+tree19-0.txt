Bioinformatics: Why is multiple sequence alignment needed for phylogenetic tree construction?
Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is generally the alignment of three or more biological sequences (protein or nucleic acid) of similar length. From the output, homology can be inferred and the evolutionary relationships between the sequences studied. Most multiple sequence alignment methods try to minimize the number of insertions/deletions (gaps) and, as a consequence, produce compact alignments. This causes several problems if the sequences to be aligned contain non-homologous regions, if gaps are informative in a phylogeny analysis. These problems are common in newly produced sequences t...
