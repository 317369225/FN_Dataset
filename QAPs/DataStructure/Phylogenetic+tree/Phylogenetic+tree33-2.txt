Why in phylogenetic trees the common ancestors always branch into only two species? Why can't more species evolve from one?
You are correct in intuiting that many species can emerge from a single species simultaneously. Most evolution occurs through cladogenesis, not anagenesis. Animals that are closely related but in different parts of the world can evolve simultaneously, so more than two species emerge ‘at the same time’. However, the key point here is that they were in ‘different parts of the world’. So if one wanted to arrange the animals in a cladogram, every node could represent a position is space as well as time. Because the vertical axis of a phylogenetic tree does not designate time alone. Both the verti... (more)
