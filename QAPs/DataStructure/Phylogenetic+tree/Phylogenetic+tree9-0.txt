Does phylogenetic tree estimate the age of living things?
Not by themselves. The most detailed phylogenetic trees also provide the degree of genetic difference between the end branches. That, combined with knowing the average mutation fixation rate for the regions of DNA used to generate the phylogenetic tree, plus calibration against the fossil record, provides an estimated divergence time from a common ancestor for any two lineages in that tree. Which in turn provides the “age” of the lineage. The ages thus provided are testable hypotheses. Their accuracy depends on a number of assumptions (for example, that the mutation fixation rate for neutral mu... (more)
