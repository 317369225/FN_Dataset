What is the best protein to research evolutionary process and create a phylogenetic tree?
I would say that there is no one "best protein" for tree-building.  The problem is that different proteins have different genealogies.   For example, because it was easy to sequence (being small and common) some of the first trees used Cytochrome c as their basis.   But that is a mitochondrial protein, and it can give different results from a cytoplasmic protein or a nuclear protein.   I would say the best basis for tree-drawing would be comparing whole genomes, and today after several years of genome sequencing we have enough information for many species to be able to do that. I suppose it ... (more)
