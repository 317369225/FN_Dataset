How did rabbits evolve? What are their closest relatives? Where could I find a phylogenetic tree of their evolution?
Contrary to popular belief, rabbits are not rodents, but lagomorphs. The closest relatives of the rabbits/hares are the pikas (a documentary fragment by David Attenborough is linked below). After that, their closest relatives are the rodents, then the primates, treeshrews, and colugos. The Tree of Life will show you how lagomorphs fit relative to other mammals. For a phylogenetic tree of the lagomorphs, you can see a recent paper by Kriegs JO et al. (Molecular Biology and Evolution, 2010), but even this tree gives very low resolution of the major genuses. In case you can't view the file, it... (more)
