Cladograms are concerned with the way organisms are related to common ancestors through shared characteristics. Phylogenetic trees compare organisms over evolutionary time and the amount of change that has occurred over time to figure out the relationships. Both cladograms and phylogenetic trees are drawn using lines to show relationships. The difference is that the length of the lines in a phylogenetic tree represents time while the lines in cladograms are th... (more)
