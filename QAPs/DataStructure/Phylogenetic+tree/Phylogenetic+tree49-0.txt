What is the theoretical reason behind a highly diverse 16s rRNA phylogenetic tree? What can I infer about that microbial group's actual diversity?
I don't quite get what you mean when you call a 16S tree "diverse". The 16S subunit was chosen as a basis for constructing bacterial and archaeal phylogenies precisely because it is conserved (it has other convenient properties, but its low mutation rate, especially near the ends, is the most important factor). There is absolutely no phenotypic diversity in small RNA subunits. They all look identical and do the same thing. They only vary in their sequence. You ask what that variation allows you to infer about microbial diversity. Not much. The actual (phenotypic) diversity does not need to be inferred: it is easily observed. What you do infer from 16S similarity is relationships between different organisms: you can tell with some certainty which ones are more closely related and which ones are more distant. A weak but sometimes useful inference that can be made based on homology is that organisms with very similar 16S genes are likely to be phenotypically similar. The opposite is also true. If you observe a 1% dissimilarity between the 16S genes (which is a lot, in rRNA terms), you can make a reasonable guess that the corresponding phenotypes are not likely to be similar.
