Where do I find "complete" phylogenetic trees of adult human cell types, especially visualized?
Ae you sure you have understood the term “phylogenetic”, in any case you are using it in an odd sense. Species are usually ordered in a phylogenetic tree based on their relatedness. This was in the older days judged by physical traits, for example all mammals are grouped together for their possession of the mammary gland (and some other traits). Nowadays the evolutionary distance is measured in the similarity of genes. So as cells of an individual (with a few notable exceptions, like some immune cells) have the same genes, there can be no modern “phylogenetic tree” of cells. If physical similarities could be helpful? I don’t think this has been done other than the old descriptive work by Cajal and Golgi. I have found this paper, which attempts to classify different cells based on epigenetic patterns, which should reflect the expression patterns of the cells: Study of cell differentiation by phylogenetic analysis using histone modification data However, this work obviously cannot deliver the entire list of neurons in a human body, and how they are related to each other.
