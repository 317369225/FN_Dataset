How did rabbits evolve? What are their closest relatives? Where could I find a phylogenetic tree of their evolution?
Here's a quick-and-dirty simplified phylogenetic tree (doesn't include fossil and tiny groups): So, rabbits are sister to the pikas, forming the Lagomorpha, which is the sister to the rodent grouping, forming the Glires. See Reflections on higher mammalian phylogenetics for an older review. The Leporidae and Ochotonidae split ~30 million years ago in Asia; we have fossil leporids from the Eocene. The features you mention seem to have been present since their early evolution: rabbit and hare morphology seems to be relatively conserved, if the fossil record is anything to go by: ... (more)
