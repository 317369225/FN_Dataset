All Phyla are clearly represented in the Cambrian fossils. Why is the phylogenetic tree that supposedly produced them largely absent?
Firstly, not ALL the animal phyla are “clearly represented” in the Cambrian fossils. Several modern phyla have no clear representations in the fossil record at all, some modern phyla have suspected representatives in the Cambrian which aren’t completely “clear”, and at least one modern phyla, the Bryozoa, does not have any known representative appear until after the Cambrian, in the Ordovician. The phylogenetic tree that produced them is similarly not largely absent. If you refer to “phylogenetic tree” as the tree of cladistic relationship generated from any and all sources of data, molecula... (more)
