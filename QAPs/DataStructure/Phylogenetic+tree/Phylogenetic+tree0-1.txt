What are phylogenetic trees used for?
In bioinformatics phylogenetic trees of proteins and DNA are useful, very useful and they serve many purposes. Multiple sequence Alignment, structure conservation and motif detection are some of the direct applications for phylogenetic trees. So in short, homology detection, divergence, convergence, paralogous attributes for sequences are visualizable through trees. The simple motivation being that what's conserved at the primary sequence level is perhaps a reflection of a critical biological function. For noncoding RNAs on the other hand deducing such trees can follow another approach, yet... (more)
