Why have no competing phylogenetic 'trees of life' emerged during the course of earth's history?
We have not found any evidence but there could easily have been several occurrences of first life, but we would never know since first life was simple single celled and probably very delicate. In the oceans this life would not fossilise, so there would be no traces. Earth's tectonics would efficiently destroy the slight traces even if there was any. At some point, either there was a bottleneck that meant only one survived, a major ice age for example or one variety of the new life became so efficient that it out competed the others totally. 159 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
