What is the history behind phylogenetic trees?
Darwin realized that life had a common beginning and that different species then diverged from that common ancestry, and this kept happening. The one figure in Origin of Species is a kind of tree diagram, and so was one that he drew in his notes. Jean Lamarck had a somewhat similar idea but his idea didn’t have extinction of branches as Darwin’s did. I don’t know whether Linnaeus had any tree-like pattern of relationships (not evolutionary, but at least related to similarity). I also don’t know if Aristotle or other Greeks, or the Arabs like Ibn Khaldun in their heyday had such ideas. But Khaldun, I think it was, had life coming out from a watery origin and diverging thereafter. 22 Views · 1 Upvote
