Why don't phylogenetic trees usually include common ancestors?
Common ancestors are often excluded from phylogenetic trees for two main reasons: 1)We do not know what the common ancestors were. Typically, we can only label the terminal nodes (leaves/tips) of a phylogenetic tree because we know what those organisms are, and our observations of those organisms (traits, gene sequences, etc.) constitute the input dataset that helps us infer the phylogenetic tree. The tree then helps us determine how those organisms are related (e.g., we might see that Asian elephants are more closely related to African elephants than they are to humans), but the internal nod...
