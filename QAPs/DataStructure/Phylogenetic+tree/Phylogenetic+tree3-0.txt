How do you interpret ancestry in phylogenetic trees?
You are correct to question this, but let me try and explain what (I believe) your teacher is saying. The phylogeny, as depicted in your figure, suggests that Moeritherium shares a common ancestor with modern elephants, but that Moeritherium itself is not an ancestor of modern elephants. Ancestors of taxa in a phylogeny are always "internal," meaning they do not form branch tips in the tree; rather, they are represented by internal nodes or specific points within a branch of the tree. In the tree you have shown, ancestors to modern elephants could be found anywhere along the red (see below).... (more)
