What are phylogenetic trees used for?
The most direct use is to find out the evolutionary history of your taxa and how they're related to each other. This is the most basic knowledge, but can lead to other uses, both practical and pure. For example, in conservation biology (and ecology in general), we can measure phylogenetic diversity using phylogenetic trees. The branches on the evolutionary tree aren't drawn at random lengths, they're calculated to that length. Phylogenetic diversity takes those lengths to give you an idea of how evolutionarily diverse the fauna in your ecosystem is and to give conservation people prioritie... (more)
