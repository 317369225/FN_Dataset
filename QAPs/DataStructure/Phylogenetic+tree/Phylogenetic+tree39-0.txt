Is the traditional 2-dimensional phylogenetic tree shown in many texts and media inaccurate for describing how evolution proceeds in nature?
To be n-dimensional, a tree (or other representation) needs to have multiple axes, which can be labeled and measured independently. The phylogenetic tree of evolution has only one axis: time. And even that is fraught with misunderstandings as people assume that Evolution has a will, a direction and/or a goal (it has none of these things). The reasons for the splits are that a single 'parent species' has multiple (two or more) 'child species', they are all on the same level and if you draw time vertically, then the horizontal distance between them is meaningless, and is usually chosen for p...
