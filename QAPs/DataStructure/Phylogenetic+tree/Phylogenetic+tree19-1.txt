Bioinformatics: Why is multiple sequence alignment needed for phylogenetic tree construction?
In short, MSA’s are used for phylogenetic reconstruction because it is very difficult to compare sequences without aligning them. Let’s say I have two sequences: ATGAAAGTG ATGAAGTC If I want to compare these two sequences, I can measure their “raw genetic distance” (the number of differences between the two sequences divided by the sequence length). But how do I decide what a “difference” is, and how “long” are these two sequences? If I were to start from the beginning of each sequence, and tally the number of mismatches I found, we can see that, of the nine possible sites (in the larger sequen... (more)
