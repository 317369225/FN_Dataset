How do you interpret ancestry in phylogenetic trees?
Moeritherium is not the ancestor of modern elephants, at least as depicted in the tree you are showing us.  The branches indicate common ancestry, not a direct lineage.  You are related to your parents by direct descent.  You are related to your uncle by common ancestry.  Similarly, Mammoths is a relative but there was a split in the lineage such that two species resulted. 53 Views · 2 Upvotes
