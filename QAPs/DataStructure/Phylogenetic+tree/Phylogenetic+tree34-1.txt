What are some of the most spectacular redrawings of the phylogenetic tree of life when genomics replaced morphologic classifications? Have there been many corrections and what are the most important ones?
Fungi used to be classified mainly by descriptions of their sexual stage, and most trees were based on this prior to DNA classification. There are tons of species for which a sexual stage has never been observed (now we've inferred occasional sex in most species, but that's another story: Clonal reproduction in fungi), so they were all put into the phylum Deuteromycota. As molecular identification techniques became more and more common, we discovered that basically all of these "Fungi imperfecti" were just anamorphic (asexual) stages with teleomorphs (sexual stages) already assigned in phyl...
