Is the traditional 2-dimensional phylogenetic tree shown in many texts and media inaccurate for describing how evolution proceeds in nature?
Two dimensions suffice to depict event of speciation and two resulting branches radiating from the last common ancestor (and subsequent speciation events on those branches etc). The challenge in graphical representation is density of branches, so every illustration is by necessity vastly simplified. 94 Views Â· 1 Upvote
