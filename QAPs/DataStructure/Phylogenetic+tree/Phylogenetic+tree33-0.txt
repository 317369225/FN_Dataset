Why in phylogenetic trees the common ancestors always branch into only two species? Why can't more species evolve from one?
they definitely can but if you assume that one is often a bit earlier than another you will always have branches in two. Actually itâ€™s all about how we define the time at which a species can be considered a new species. Most of the time it is humans who choose to represent the evolutionary tree in a certain style or model. often it is dichotomous(always splitting in two) but it doesnt have represent reality in that way. Dated evolutionary trees (where the length of a node between branches represents time are more fit for that. In those models when the time of splitting is not certain or is v... (more)
