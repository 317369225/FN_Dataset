Do red coders and targets read the full question in a SRM?Most of the times the first paragraph of the question are mere stories. I find world class coders solve problems in codeforces and topcoder in one minute or two minutes. I take more than that time just to read the question itself. SoÂ  how do they do . Do they skip first paragraph. or do they have a superfast reading speed alongside superfast thinking skills.
