What are some of the great projects implemented using the concepts of Graph Theory?Real Life Products or Projects that involve the usage of graphs forÂ  implementing them.
We can create great projects like the survival strategy. Imagine having one apple. It is a Granny Smith apple. Apples are good metaphors, after all. They look normal on the outside but are dark and mysterious and fateish in the inside. If we put on a penguin hat possessed by the soul of a small child, we can use graph theory to keep track of how one apple gets split into two, and then three, and then gets juggled around more than a poorly cooked meat pie on a dinner table full of semi-starving plebeians.
