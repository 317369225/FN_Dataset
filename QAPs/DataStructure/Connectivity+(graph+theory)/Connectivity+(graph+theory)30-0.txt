What are some direct & indirect applications of graph theory in the real world?
Graph theory is widely used in the real world: The best way of drawing subway maps can be easily solved using graph theory. Most widely used chemical models are graph models. Facebook (and almost all other social networks) model the users and their connections with their friends in a graph structure. And, they use this graph model to do their business by applying graph theory ideas, including how to populate your timeline, what advertisements to show, etc. Your favorite search engine, Google, uses a graph representation to store/retreive the semantic relationship between different entities, which they call it, Knowledge Graph, as well as providing you with the top relevant webpages for your query, using PageRank algorithm, which is a graph theorethic algorithm. Last but not least, almost every recommendation system, including the ones used by Amazon for recommending you the relevant books to buy, or Netflix for recommending you what to watch use graph theoretic algorithms.
