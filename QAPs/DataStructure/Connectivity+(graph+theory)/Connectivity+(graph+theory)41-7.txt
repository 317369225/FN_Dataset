Are there any mathematics studies higher than calculus? If so, which ones?
Calculus is at the top of the high school pyramid (unfortunately in my view; I think the top class should be linear algebra), but there's way more past it. I'm just someone who applies math but have a substantial use for a substantial part of the undergraduate and, oh, masters level mathematics curriculum, at least to be able to understand the research literature.
