Are there any mathematics studies higher than calculus? If so, which ones?
In some senses, calculus is just the beginning of math. But a lot of what you see in math after a basic course on calculus is getting down to the roots of what you think you actually know, but really don't. In abstract algebra, my professor constructed the rational numbers from the integers and said "now we understand 3rd grade." A lot of stuff we learn is about actually understanding the things we "learned" before. This means that there may not be too much math after calculus, but we have to know how we know it. Of course, this is an oversimplification of what higher math is, but I think it is somewhat enlightening. It is also worth noting that the above "now we understand 3rd grade" is different from the "you may remember from middle school" quip that is often said by math professors from outside of the United States to bewildered students who were educated in the United States.
