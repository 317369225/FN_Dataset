Theoretical Computer Science: When it comes to real world computing is Theoretical Computer Science essentially useless?
No. Consider for example the field of software verification and model checking. It is entirely based on Theoretical Computer Science and is growing every year. In this field you use formal logic and abstract models of computer programs to verify the correctness of your program and find potential errors. Another example would be regular expressions. Every programmer knows and uses them but probably few realise that they are the product of a treatise on finite state machines. Even if we consider only concepts with no direct application in industryÂ  like decidability and the halting problem we see that they are not at all useless. If it weren't for Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem, there would still be many people trying to find an algorithm to solve it since such an algorithm would be among the most useful algorithms in history. By showing that something cannot be accomplished, Theoretical Computer Science helps us save a lot of money that would be wasted on efforts to accomplish it.
