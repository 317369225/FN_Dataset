What kind of mathematics does one need to know to better understand neuroscience?
I can't improve on what others have already said, but since I was asked to answer... Statistics is #1, for sure. All of neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology research is heavily dependent on statistics. Linear algebra is a close #2. Linear algebra is the core foundation of the advanced statistics required for analyzing large complex data sets. It also, perhaps not coincidentally, is the emerging core framework for understanding how the brain works internally. Why is that? Because the brain appears to be a giant multidimensional statistical analysis engine, and linear algebra is the math for understanding how that works. For advanced theoretical neuroscience, one could add statistical machine learning, which is really a combination of #1 and #2, applied to problem solving, pattern detection, prediction, and computation. Also useful and related: graph theory, bayesian statistics, multivariate calculus, signal detection theory, information theory, physics (electricity & magnetism), maybe differential geometry, chaos theory.
