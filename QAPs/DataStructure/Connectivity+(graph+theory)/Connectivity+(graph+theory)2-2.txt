Graph Theory: What is the name of the algorithm for identifying important people (best connected to others) in a social network?I don't remember the algorithm or its name, but I know there's a way to identify the important people in a social network. Basically  the idea is to identify people with the best connection to the graph. Thanks.
You're looking for some notion of centrality.  The linked article gives definitions and algorithms for four standard measures.
