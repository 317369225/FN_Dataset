Is a polymath even relevant in today's world of super-specialized disciplines?
Problems (or questions) can be classified into two types. Questions with "depth", like the question "What is the best algorithm to sort a list?" It takes knowledge but only in the field of computer science.  And then there are questions with "breadth" like the question "How can poverty be alleviated in Africa?". This requires the knowledge of wide range of subjects like economics, finance, social structure, health, population control, resource allocation, African politics, foreign affairs and so on. Polymaths are needed to answer the questions with "breadth". Questions which requires knowledge of too many fields. Nobody can be an expert in all of them.  Polymath is a general term which means a person with considerable knowledge of a wide range of subjects. There are a lot of subjects and it is not humanly possible to have significant knowledge of all of them. Polymaths also have a limit to how many subjects they know. You need a polymath with a knowledge of the right subjects which are relevant to the problem at hand. Getting the right combination of subject knowledge that fits a problem is not easy. And some questions require deep knowledge of so many fields that nobody can answer them. They remain unsolved.
