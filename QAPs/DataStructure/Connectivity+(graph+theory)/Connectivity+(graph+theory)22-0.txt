How is graph theory used in systems biology?
Look at the following 2013 paper as an example, it uses graph theory, actually develops a graph theoretic method to learn something about biology: Nature Biotechnology. To be more general, biology is full of networks. All networks are graphs, so graph theory is a very nice (and available) tool to study these. Systems biology is usually operating in the precise level of abstraction that is suitable for graph theory to be applied.Â  A lot of times you model proteins as entities ( without lower details) and attempt to create a network of connections based on what the proteins do. This is a graph ready to be analyzed.
