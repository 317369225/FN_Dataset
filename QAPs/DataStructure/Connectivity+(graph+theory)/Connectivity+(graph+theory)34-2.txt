What are some must-know topics in discrete math and probability for competitive programming?I am currently doing topcoder and learning newer algorithms. But I want to know the specific topics in Discrete math and probability which will help me get a better understanding of algorithms.
An excellent answer you already have here; I'll just add that you can go through TopCoder tutorials (Algorithm Tutorials) and Cookbook forums (TopCoder Forums) to see a lot of the topics you'll need explained in application to TopCoder problems.
