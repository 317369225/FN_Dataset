Are there any mathematics studies higher than calculus? If so, which ones?
Goodness yes!!!!   There is logic,  advanced algebraic structures,  advanced geometry and the theory of manifolds,  category theory, advanced combinatorics,   the theory of computable functions   and  many others.  Calculus is just the first step in the world of advanced mathematics..
