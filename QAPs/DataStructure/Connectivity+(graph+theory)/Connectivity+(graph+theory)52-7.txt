What are some of the great projects implemented using the concepts of Graph Theory?Real Life Products or Projects that involve the usage of graphs forÂ  implementing them.
Scheduling the tasks involved in a project is done using the critical path method (CPM). Tasks are represented as arcs in a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) with arc weight equal to the task duration, with nodes representing coordination points where some tasks need to be completed before others begin. CPM finds a longest path in the resulting DAG, which is a critical path along which no delays can be accommodated without delaying project completion. Arcs along other paths have some slack, and the amount of delay that can be accommodated on each arc can be computed. Microsoft Project and similar programs use this method to work out project critical schedules.
