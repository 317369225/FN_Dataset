What is the relationship between music and math?Convergence of infinite harmonic series and the musical octaves as manifested in the piano keys.
I think I should share this here: Vi Hart does recreational mathematics. Check out the video for "symmetries" in the music. Update: Found this supremely mind-blowing video just now. Musicians will be struck dumb (I was atleast). Others will also see how "patterns" affect music! Updated 20 Aug 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
