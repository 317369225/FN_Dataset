What is the relationship between music and math?Convergence of infinite harmonic series and the musical octaves as manifested in the piano keys.
Originally Answered: Are mathematicians and musicians particularly closely related?You bet.  Music is based in mathematics, not just in an aesthetic symmetry-in-beauty way, but as the subject of real, hard mathematical study full of interesting research and academic activity. One of the best places to see this in action is at an ISMIR (music information retrieval - http://www.ismir.net/) conference, the proceedings of which have publications with titles like: A Unified System for Chord Extraction and Key Transcription Using Hidden Markov Models Audio Identification Using Sinusoidal Modeling and Application to Jingle DetectionA fantastic, philosophical treatment of the relationship between music and math can be found in Douglas Hofstadter's Gödel Escher Bach, in which Hofstadter tells some great stories about the special mathematical significance of pieces like Bach's The Musical Offering.
