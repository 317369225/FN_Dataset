What kind of mathematics does one need to know to better understand neuroscience?
Short Answer: important to understand the different parts of neuroscience research to understand where might the tools of mathematics be applied. It's a myth to think one will eventually "understand" the brain if only one knows enough math. Neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary study that requires the knowledge of many tools. But... graph theory is hot right now and becoming more and more popular especially in systems neuroscience, so take a graph theory class (or discrete math). The brain is made up of billions of connected units that are just begging to be neatly placed in a graph. Statistics is important as it is of course needed to prove the results from one's data did not arrive by chance.  I would take a class from a professor who teaches using the statistical language called R with a nice IDE such as RStudio - Home . Statisticians will tell you that there is nothing that beats R (and it's 1) free compared to Matlab, 2) plots publication ready figures and 3) can do everything Matlab can do but feels less clunky). Linear Algebra is important as almost everything can be represented as an array or matrix. Numerical Analysis and Differential Equations are important too for computational modelers. image from: Efficient network reconstruction from dynam...
