Is everyone on Facebook connected to each other? For any 2 users on Facebook, is there some sequence of users that connect them? If not, what is the maximum diameter of a connected group at the moment?
Welcome to graph theory! First, it's trivial to show that not everyone is connected. Go set up a new account. It has zero connections. For your second question, if there is a sequence of users that connect them, then we call that the distance between them. It is possible that there is no sequence of connections between them. Each user is part of a connected subgraph. If the two users are part of two separate connected subgraphs, then there is not sequence of users between them. For your second question, the maximum sequence of users between any two users in a connected subgraph is called the 'diameter'.
