Graph Theory: What is the name of the algorithm for identifying important people (best connected to others) in a social network?I don't remember the algorithm or its name, but I know there's a way to identify the important people in a social network. BasicallyÂ  the idea is to identify people with the best connection to the graph. Thanks.
It depends on how you define important. A very simple measure is just "degree": the number of people you are connected to. However, if you have a group where everyone knows everyone, they will all have similar degrees. For that reason, more refined concepts like centrality exist; see Justin Rising's answer to Graph Theory: What is the name of the algorithm for identifying important people (best connected to others) in a social network?
