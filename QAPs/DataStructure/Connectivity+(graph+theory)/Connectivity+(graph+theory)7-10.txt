What is your favourite graph theory problem?
Originally Answered: What are your favorite graph theory problems?My favorite graph problem is What is the Big-O running time of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm when using the "path compression" version of the disjoint-set data structure that the algorithm requires? It turns out to be O( E * inverse-Ackerman-function( V ) ) which means it is essentially linear in time but technically not linear. It's funny to see such a strange function pop up in an algorithm that is extremely intuitive. Another problem I like is Give a linear time algorithm for finding the longest path in a tree with positive edge weights. ... the answer actually has a natural physical analog if the tree is physically constructed with buttons and twine.
