Theoretical Computer Science: When it comes to real world computing is Theoretical Computer Science essentially useless?
If your definition of theoretical computer science is "P vs NP", then yes, it's not terribly useful. However, there are things like asymptotic algorithm analysis which to me qualify as theory, and which are definitely useful. For instance I teach students that you can distribute a dense matrix in two ways (one-dimensional vs two-dimensional) and that a simple asymptotic argument shows that the first one will drown you in communication cost. High performance linear algebra And the effects of this argument can already be felt at the current scales of supercomputers, so it's definitely useful.
