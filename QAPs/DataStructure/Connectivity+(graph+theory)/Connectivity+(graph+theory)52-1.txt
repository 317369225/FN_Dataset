What are some of the great projects implemented using the concepts of Graph Theory?Real Life Products or Projects that involve the usage of graphs for  implementing them.
All of them. Every non-trivial program is a graph. Calls to functions, variable access and scoping, objects, all of that is graph theory. If you want something more explicit, every memory management method. The simplest mark-and-sweep involves creating a spanning tree of a digraph.  Using reference counting effectively requires awareness of cyclic and acyclic graphs. Want something more specific? Adventure games. Maybe each isn't great, but there are hundreds or thousands of them. Locations are vertices and motion between them requires edge traversal. Auto help requires finding paths between them. Making objects go away when used up involves simple dynamic theorem proving. The internet is pretty great. It's a graph. The whole point of the internet is dynamic healing and rerouting, requiring distributed graph theory. DNS.
