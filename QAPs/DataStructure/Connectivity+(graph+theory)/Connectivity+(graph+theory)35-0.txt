What are some common applications of graph theory in statistical mechanics?
Phase transitions demonstrate common properties determined by only a few major variables, like dimensionality, and these properties are independent of the system. Because of the existence of these universality classes, we want to solve as many simple phase transition models as we can, since we can then map them onto more complicated problems. The models we can solve take place on lattice, or graphs if you will. There are mappings between magnetic spins on a crystalline lattice, and tileings of a graph. Kastelyn theory computes the number of tileings of a bipartite planar graph. This is basically the same as computing a partition function, and bipartite planar graphs map to the magnetic spins Ising model. Connectivity is also a big issue when dealing with magnetic systems on a lattice. The more other sites a particular spin is connected to, the larger the preference for order over disorder. For example, Ising spins in 1d show no phase transition, but when you move to 2d, you up the connectivity and get a phase transition. Connectivity is a graph idea. Basically, we can solve phase transitions on lattices, which if you get around to working with them in more mathematical rigor, are graphs.
