Do electrical engineers study graph theory?
The topic appears under various guises and depends on subject. Those doing VLSI would encounter it daily as binary trees, look-up tables, sparse matrices, hierarchical layout topologies and so on. As said before, circuit layout can be expressed as a graph, and in fact this is how SPICE-based simulators treat their circuit nodes. It's less apparent for microwave and optical engineers, because they already need to deal with complicated physical concepts, but an understanding of graph theory can enhance the understanding of transmission line theory, waveguides, and the consequences of periodicity in solid state matter. Telecommunications engineers may sometimes work with algorithms that are often described best as graphs. One such trivial example would be the Viterbi algorithm. Many computing problems you may encounter can also be simplified as graphs. A typical didactic example is the travelling salesman problem, which appears in everything from power-conserving algorithms, sophisticated PID loops, to ubiquitous technologies like satnavs. Electrical engineers designing drives will often find themselves designing slices of a drive, which then gets converted into a mesh, which is nothing more than a graph with spatial coordinates attached to it. Routing the E-M fields throughout the mesh is less computationally intensive than applying Maxwell's equations on a complex surface with minimum loss of fidelity. So depending on what you do, you may not need to become an expert in graph theory, but having a passing awareness will definitely help you pick up concepts faster, plus you will know where to look if you need to deepen your understanding.
