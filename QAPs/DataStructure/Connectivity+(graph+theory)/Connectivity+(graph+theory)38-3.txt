What is the most intriguing mathematical concept you have ever encountered?
The Weierstrass Function which is continuous everywhere but nowhere does it have a finite derivative. Amazingly, the value of can be computed exactly for rational numbers as If I am ever stopped for speeding, I may use the argument that my speed was a Weierstrass Function and hence my speed was unknowable.  A mathematically inclined prosecutor might argue that half the time it exceeded the speed limit.  At that point my defense might need to resort to special relativity and insist that since the higher speeds were limited to c, the average ...
