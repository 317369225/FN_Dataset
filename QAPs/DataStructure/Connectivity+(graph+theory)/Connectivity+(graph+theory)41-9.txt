Are there any mathematics studies higher than calculus? If so, which ones?
Yes. There is a kind of league table for those who are masochists. 1. Non-Euclidean Geometry. Trying to explain things that don't exist in terms no one understands. 2. Abstract Algebra. Like Algebra but with more symbols. I think you get failed for mentioning numbers. 3 Inference. It's about proving how uncertain you are about being uncertain. 4 Infinite-dimensional Vector Spaces and Manifolds. Why confine yourself to being bemused is just 3 dimensions? Invent a few more to get to get really confused. 5 Advanced Analysis. Calculus comes under elementary analysis, after that it becomes Intermediate analysis, followed by advanced analysis, after that its Psycho-analysis. Calculus is only a basic tool you have to master before the fun stuff starts. Updated 25 Feb â€¢ View Upvotes
