What is the relationship between music and math?Convergence of infinite harmonic series and the musical octaves as manifested in the piano keys.
An understanding of rhythms certainly requires an implicit knowledge of fractions, and perhaps repeated study of rhythms (e.g. sight-reading music), strengthens one's understanding of fractions. A recent article [1] suggests that studying music helps develop multi-tasking abilities, which incidentally helps with learning math: "Studies have shown that assiduous instrument training from an early age can help the brain to process sounds better, making it easier to stay focused when absorbing other subjects, from literature to tensor calculus. The musically adept are better able to concentrate on a biology lesson despite the racket in the classroom or, a few years later, to finish a call with a client when a colleague in the next cubicle starts screaming at an underling. They can attend to several things at once in the mental scratch pad called working memory, an essential skill in thisÂ  era of multitasking." [1] http://www.scientificamerican.co...
