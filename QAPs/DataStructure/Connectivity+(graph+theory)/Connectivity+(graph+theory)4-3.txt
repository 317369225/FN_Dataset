What do eigenvectors represent in real life?
Some intuitive examples can be given when talking about mappings in space. Imagine standing in front of a mirror. Your position determines the mirror image's position through a linear mapping. If you take one step to the left, your mirror image takes a step in the same direction. This means that stepping left would move you along an eigenvector, in this case with an eigenvalue of one. Same goes if you jump up/down. If you move towards the mirror, your mirror image will move in the opposite direction. This on the other hand means that the direction toward the mirror is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue of minus one. As the mapping is in three dimensions to three dimensions we'd expect three eigenvalues and a three dimensional basis of eigenvectors. This is exactly what we get. Two eigenvalues with the value one, corresponding to eigenvectors in the plane parallell to the mirror plane and one eigenvector with the value minus one corresponding to the eigenvector perpendicular to the mirror plane. Take some other transformations in space, such as scalings or projections, and reason which eigenvectors they should have and the concept will get more intuitive quickly.
