What is the most intriguing mathematical concept you have ever encountered?
There are so many to choose from, but Stein's Paradox in statistics is high up on the list. If X 1 ,…,X k   are independent random variables, with X j   having a Normal distribution with unknown mean μ j   and variance 1, then it is extremely natural to estimate the means (μ 1 ,…,μ k )  using the corresponding observations (X 1 ,…,X k )  . Aside from being the obvious choice (since the problems are independent), it's the maximum likelihood estimate and has various other nice properties. But for k≥3  , Stein showed that this estimate is inadmissible with the respect to the most widely-used loss function, the total of the squared errors. This means that there is another estimator whose expected loss is always at least as good, and sometimes strictly better. In fact, the James-Stein estimator has strictly lower expected loss for all possible values of the unknown means! This estimator looks deeply counterintuitive at first, since it uses all of X 1 ,…,X k     in the estimate for each X j   , even though the problems are independent. More amazingly still, this kind of estimator, known as a shrinkage estimator, turns out to be very useful in applied problems, not just a theoretical peculiarity. See the Efron-Morris Scientific American paper "Stein's Paradox in Statistics" at Page on Stanford for a fairly non-technical introduction to this area. Updated 17 Dec 2014 • View Upvotes
