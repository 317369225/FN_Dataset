Graph Theory: What does connected data denote?as it is mentioned here (Neo4j, the Graph Database) graph databases are for connnected data, but what sorts of data are to be considered connected ?
We may say that data are usually connected. For instance, the fact that I write a paper connects me to my coauthors, to the papers I cite in the paper and to the people who publish in the same venue. In a sense, there is a low probability that I have connections with people who write on sociology, for instance, because I publish in Computer Science. However, I may be connected to authors in that area through third party authors. So, connections in the research world may be weak or strong, but exist. At the same time, these people are connected through their friends (imagine thir connections with friends and family in Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) to other people who are not in the research area, and through the groups they participate in to their topics of interest. This is connected data!! There are strong connections and weak connections, connections that evolve along time and connections that are static and do not evolve (very seldom). There are many papers and books on these issues: weak, strong connections, where the connections apear, how connections evolve along time... I recommend to start reading the book by A. Barabasi, Linked. It is very enlightening and clearly written. For papers on the characteristics of linked data you may read very interesting cases in Physical Review E and in the International World Wide Web Conference, and many others. There are projects dealing with this like Sciencea - Science Analysis, and in the european context, like Creating Knowledge out of Interlinked Data.
