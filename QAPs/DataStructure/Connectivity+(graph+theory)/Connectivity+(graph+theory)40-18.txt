What is the relationship between music and math?Convergence of infinite harmonic series and the musical octaves as manifested in the piano keys.
Originally Answered: How is music math?I simply believe that music and math fall into completely separate and, frankly, opposite catergories. Music, on the one hand, seems to be a compilation of simple sounds into an coherent, individualistic song/composition/whatever. These individualistic expressions, however, lack any hard formulaic backbone. Meanwhile, on the other hand, math is completely the opposite in that it is solely formulaic and lacks any and all forms of individualism, but rather has universal principles.   One could maybe simplify the relationship between music and math as the relationship between opinion and fact: One is subjective;one is objective.   However, as music and the sound waves that compile it follow rules of physics and nature(i.e. principles of math), some (and that's a stretch) connection must lie between music and math, however tenuous that link may be.
