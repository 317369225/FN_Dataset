What are some unsolved problems in mathematics?
Originally Answered: Which easy to understand mathematical problems are still unsolved and why?The Twin Prime Conjecture is pretty to understand, but it remains unsolved. A twin prime is a prime that differs from another prime by 2. For example, (3, 5) is a twin prime pair. As are (5, 7), (11, 13), (15, 17). The Twin Prime Conjecture postulates that an infinitude of such primes exist. And it has remained unsolved for ages! If I recall correctly, Euclid (who was one of the first to prove that there are an infinitude of primes) knew about twin primes, and also conjectured that there might be an infinitude of such primes.
