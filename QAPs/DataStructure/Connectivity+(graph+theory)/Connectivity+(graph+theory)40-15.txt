What is the relationship between music and math?Convergence of infinite harmonic series and the musical octaves as manifested in the piano keys.
Originally Answered: Interdisciplinary Topics: How closely related are music and math?The above answers are all correct and the breadth and detail of the authors explanations are a real testament to what makes quora so special.  My short elaboration is two-fold:  Firstly that music is math in the sense that the organizing principles of sound which make what we perceive to be musical are essentially less chaotic (might not be the technical correct term here) than surrounding ambient noise and therefore describable by relationships which are mathematical.  And secondly that as far as the amount of math involved with the actual creation of music, in the thousands of hours l have spent with major artists in the studio there is not much math at all.  Engineers use a small amount of arithmetic to optimize delay times and pitch effects, and getting digital audio to work in sync sometimes one must calculate ratios, but until one deals with audio equipment on a technical level there is not any real math.  As for musicians there is even less math.  Music theory is something incorporated on a very un-thinking and fundamental level by most accomplished studio musicians and is expressed only in the sense that it provides a structure for expression.  Many great artists operate on a solely "gut" level and can not even really tell you what key they are in unless they stop to figure it out.  Music is the expression of emotion and emotional archetypes and I have found that most heavy analysis and theoretical understanding is pursued by those seeking dissect what has gone before rather than to open the door to what may become.
