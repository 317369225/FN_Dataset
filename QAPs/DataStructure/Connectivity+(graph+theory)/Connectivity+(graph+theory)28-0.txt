What is the difference between a cyclic and an acyclic graph in graph theory?
Cyclic as the name suggests contains cycles, and the opposite for an acyclic graph.. also graphs can be classified into directed and un-directed.. in a directed graph if 2 nodes (say A and B) are connected in the following way... A---->B then one can traverse from A to B only and not from B to A using this edge and in an undirected graph bidirectional traversing is possible... Examples: 1) Directed Cyclic Graph ..here u can see that a cycle B->C->E->D->B exists!!! 2) Un-Directed Cyclic Graph 3) Directed Acyclic Graph 4) Undirected Acyclic Graph (Tree) Further graphs can also be classified into weighted and unweighted graphs depending on whether the edges have a cost (or value) or they do not. Hope this helps...:)
