What do eigenvectors represent in real life?
A multidimensional  instance could be face recognance software. You define a face like a blue print  full of distances and come up with a matrix whose eigenvectors is a represdntation of a particular face. The 5th component of the eigenvector could be the ratio length over width for the nose. If you see a 0.8 in the 5th you cannot help to say "WHAT A SNUB NOSE". And stuff like that. Identifying a face is just to substract both eigenvectors, calculate the module, and set a criterion like "if module < 2" or more complicated component versus component.  Then Test it with hundreds pictures and thats it.
