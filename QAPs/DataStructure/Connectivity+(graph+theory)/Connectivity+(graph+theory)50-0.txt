What are edges in graph theory?
Graphs consist of a set of vertices V and a set of edges E. Each edge connects a vertex to another vertex in the graph (or itself, in the case of a Loopâ€”see Melissa Dalis' answer to What is a loop in graph theory?) Edges can be either directed or undirected. A directed edge points from one vertex to another, and an undirected has no direction. An example of this distinction would be in the Facebook and Twitter social graphs. For Facebook, consider each user to be a vertex and a friendship would be an edge. If person A is friends with person B, then person B is also friends with person A, so there is no direction associated with this edge. On the other hand, for Twitter if A follows B, B does not necessarily follow A, so this would be represented with directed edges. If there's a directed edge from A to B, and a directed edge from B to A, this would essentially be equivalent to an undirected edge connecting A and B.
