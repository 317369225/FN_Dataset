What are some active areas of research within combinatorics?
I will mention some active areas that are close to my work and area of expertise. Finite Geometry Here's a recent survey in this area: Current Research Topics in Galois Geometry. And here's the list of talks from a 2014 conference on finite geometries: Irsee2014. You should also check out this recent book to see some of the connections between finite geometry, extremal combinatorics and coding theory: Finite Geometry and Combinatorial Applications. Polynomial Methods This survey by Terence Tao is probably a good place to start: the polynomial method in arithmetic combinatorics, incidence combinatorics, and number theory. But you should remember that every researcher has his own biases. There are some topics in the so-called polynomial method that are not touched in that paper, for example polynomials in finite geometries. It's still a pretty good survey. Also check out some answers here: How to recognise that the polynomial method might work and these posts on my blog polynomials | Anurag's Math Blog. Network Coding Theory See this big European project on this topic: Random Network Coding and Designs over GF(q). This is very much related to the combinatorics of finite vector spaces, and hence finite geometry. q-analogs of classical combinatorial results also play a significant role here. See [1305.6126] Problems on q-Analogs in Coding Theory. Spectral Graph Theory This is a huge area of combinatorics with lots of research going on. One of the biggest breakthrough recently was the work of Adam Marcus, Daniel Spielman, and Nikhil Srivastava: Interlacing families I: Bipartite Ramanujan graphs of all degrees, Interlacing families II: Mixed characteristic polynomials and the Kadison-Singer problem. Also see the web page of this upcoming workshop at Banff: Algebraic and Spectral Graph Theory. A good reference for this topic is the book by Brouwer and Haemers: Spectra of Graphs.
