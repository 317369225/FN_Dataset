Are there any mathematics studies higher than calculus? If so, which ones?
Of course there is lots and lots of math after Calculus.... More importantly, there is a lot of mathematics "lower" than Calculus that is skipped, skimmed, and unexplored.  Consider for example, Pick's theorem and its various proofs.  Page on uga.edu Mathematics is more like exploring a large national park. You can walk along the paved path, or you can explore the connections and details that are  not spelled out for you.
