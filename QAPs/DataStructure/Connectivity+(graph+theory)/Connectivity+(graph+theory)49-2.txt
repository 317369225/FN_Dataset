Is a polymath even relevant in today's world of super-specialized disciplines?
The creative tools in our time, computers being the most glorified, are by their design for multiple needs. There will be a resurface of polymaths in our time I believe because of how we use computers. There are many arguments against this, from today’s extensive amount of knowledge and heavy specialization would not allow it, to an individual’s time would not support it. I agree that the specialization is deep, but the internet is bridging this gap by making most information free. As for an individual’s potential, we see that a tier one engineer such as Nikola Tesla can speak twelve languages, read all the books he can get his hands on, thus is familiar with literature. In order to create things, to perform advanced research, or to build new theories, one needs to construct his or her own mental knowledge base. I have always thought that a hacker should fear that he or she perfects only the craft, but learns nothing of the computing theory. While a writer should always fear that he or she is hollow within, thus has nothing to write. On the issue of choosing to focus on one or several areas. I would try to propose for running several subjects at the same time.
