What do eigenvectors represent in real life?
In dynamics of structures in the field of mechanic, each structure have several frequencies referred as the eigenfrequencies (eigenvalues), the lowest frequencies being more important than the highest ones. This frequencies will be considered as "weak" functionning points: let's take for example a turbine. Suppose it have one fundamental frequency of rotating. The life-length of this turbine will decrease as its fundamental frequency of rotation is closer to its first (lowest) eigenfrequencies, since making it work in this range of frequencies releases too much energy on it. Eigenvectors (eigenmodes) are the shape of the deformation of the structure when it is working (rotating!) in exactly one of those eigenfrequencies. Below is an example of oscillation a cable for several of its eigenfrequencies. [Fundamental frequency] Wish i helped.
