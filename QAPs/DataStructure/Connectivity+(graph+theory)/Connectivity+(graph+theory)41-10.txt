Are there any mathematics studies higher than calculus? If so, which ones?
I still remember the day my math prof told me, when I was struggling with the linear algebra final... "Linear is math-speak for easy, when you gonna be done?" I took three semesters of calculus and that linear algebra class was pretty hard for me. Real algebra almost killed me. Serious. It affected my health. So yeah, there's stuff a lot more difficult than calculus. (Calc is often made more difficult than it needs to be though - I learned my calc a lot better in physics than I ever did in the math department.)
