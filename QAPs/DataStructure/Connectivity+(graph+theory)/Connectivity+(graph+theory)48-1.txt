Do I need to know about graph algorithms before learning dynamic programming?
Following is the quote from Dynamic programming (Wikipedia): In mathematics, computer science, economics, and bioinformatics, dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When applicable, the method takes far less time than other methods that don't take advantage of the subproblem overlap. As you can see dynamic programming is the method of solving problems having a specific structure. On the other hand graph algorithms are the algorithms applied to graph (study of graph theory). Some of them need the Dynamic programming approach, others don't. So to learn some specific set of graph algorithm you may need to understand DP. But to learn DP, you don't need graph algorithms.
