What do mathematicians feel towards mathematics?Do they have a warm, cozy feeling when manipulating equations, like you do when playing with a friendly dog or hugging a long yearned person? Do they feel cold and mechanical? Serenity? Elation? Frustration? Sternness? Awe like when you look at a giant marble architecture towering above you?
(Not technically a mathematician yet) I take it as a good escape from reality which keeps my mind busy and satisfied. Manipulating equations is usually the most mundane and mechanical part. I derive more joy from figuring out the connections between seemingly unrelated things like Graph theory, Group theory and Incidence geometry. Also, I agree with Justin Rising that I have gone through most of those feelings while pursuing mathematics.
