What are the most ingenious theorems/deductions in graph theory?
My personal favorite is the Robertson-Seymour Theorem [1], also known as the graph minor theorem. The paper by Lovasz [2] gives a great overview of the proof and its applications for amateur graph theorists. [3] The object of the proof is a generalization of Kuratowski's Theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to the complete graph K 5   or the complete bipartite graph K 3,3   . The Robertson-Seymour theorem proves that for certain classes of graph properties, there is always a set of graphs (called excluded minors) that completely characterize the class in the same way that K 5   and K 3,3   do for planar graphs. The theorem also implies that if you have the set of excluded minors for a class, you can determine whether or not any given graph belongs to that class in polynomial time. Since it proves that the excluded minors must exist, but doesn't give any way of determining what they are, the theorem is a non-constructive existence proof of a polynomial time algorithm, which isn't the sort of thing you come across every day.
