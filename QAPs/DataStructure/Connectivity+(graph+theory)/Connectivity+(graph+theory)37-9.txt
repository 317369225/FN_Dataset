What are some unsolved problems in mathematics?
There are plenty of them, some of them being very important.  In ordinary differential equations, there are issues in nonlinear differential equations.  Currently there is the existence theorem, which gives conditions upon which a solution to the nonlinear differential equation cannot exist, but no conditions upon which it is guaranteed to exist.  Some of them there is no real way to find out whether or not a solution exists except in the cases which have been solved. Linear partial differential equations are an entirely different beast than linear ordinary differential equations.  There are simple rules for determining whether or not a solution exists given boundary conditions on any linear ordinary differential equation, but there are no guaranteed rules on a linear partial differential equation.  Partial differential equations have been studied for a long time now because they describe such interesting things, but much of the theory behind them remains a mystery.
