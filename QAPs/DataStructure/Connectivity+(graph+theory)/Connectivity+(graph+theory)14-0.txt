What are some good books on applying combinatorics to problems in other fields?
There are many applications of combinatorics in experimental design. For example, they are connected through the idea of Latin square, which is both a famous topic in combinatorics and a widely used strategy in experimental design. One of many books that discuss this connection is Amazon.com: Design of Comparative Experiments (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics) (9780521683579): R. A. Bailey: Books Note the Latin square on the cover: Some other combinatorics concepts, such as Hasse diagram, also appear in this book. Two useful books with various applications of combinatorics are Applied Combinatorics: Alan Tucker: 9780470458389: Amazon.com: Books and Applied Combinatorics, Second Edition: Fred Roberts, Barry Tesman: 9781420099829: Amazon.com: Books. Another area where combinatorics is applied to other fields is through graph theory. A well-written basic introduction is Introductory Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics): Gary Chartrand: 9780486247755: Amazon.com: Books One major source of applications of graph theory ideas is in network analysis, as discussed in books such as Networks: An Introduction: Mark Newman: 9780199206650: Amazon.com: Books and Social and Economic Networks: Matthew O. Jackson: 9780691148205: Amazon.com: Books.
