What are the biggest problems in mathematics that remain to be solved?Aside from the millennium problems.
Here's a few: P versus NP problem Hodge conjecture Riemann hypothesis Yang–Mills existence and mass gap Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture Solve any one of these and you will be awarded $1 million. EDIT: The asker decided to add the statement "Aside from the millennium problem" after I posted. Please refer to Amanda Urquiza's answer to What are the biggest problems in mathematics that remain to be solved? for a very detailed list.
