What kind of graph theory is used in automatic garbage collection? How is it used?
Surprisingly little graph theory appears in the CS literature on garbage collection. As David says, depth-first and breadth-first searches are used to traverse reachable objects starting from the global roots. Two memorable examples are Connectivity Based Garbage Collection and A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection: Page on purdue.edu and Page on virginia.edu. I suppose you could regard incremental garbage collection algorithms as kinds of dynamic graph algorithm. One discrepancy between garbage collection and graph theory algorithms is accuracy. No garbage collectors can recycle objects at the earliest possible point in the program in the general case. They all leave so-called floating garbage around. This is perhaps a significant discrepancy between garbage collection and (most of) graph theory.
