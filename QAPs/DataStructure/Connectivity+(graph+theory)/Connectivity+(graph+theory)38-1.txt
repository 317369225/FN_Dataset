What is the most intriguing mathematical concept you have ever encountered?
I like the paradoxes a lot. The Banach-Tarski Paradox is pretty cool. It says you can take a ball (not a real one of course) and cut it finitely many times. Then the pieces can be arranged into two balls the size of the original. The paradox exploits self similarity (fractals). Note how S(a^-1) is exactly the same as aS(a^-1) sans the fact that it appears smaller in the image. Russel's paradox concerns the set of all sets that don't contain themselves (or the set of all normal sets). Essentially, if we suppose that a set of every normal set can exist, then it must be a member of itself, but also not. The repercussions of this were tremendous as naive set theory was proved inconsistent. And finally piggy tailing off the last Gödel's incompleteness theorems. A while back this got posted on /r/math Google Drive Viewer That's only the second. The first one says that axioms in any system can only get us so far. There are things that are true, but can't be proved. Updated 8 Apr 2013 • View Upvotes
