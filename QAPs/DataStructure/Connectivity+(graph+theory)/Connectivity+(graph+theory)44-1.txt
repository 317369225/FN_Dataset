What do mathematicians feel towards mathematics?Do they have a warm, cozy feeling when manipulating equations, like you do when playing with a friendly dog or hugging a long yearned person? Do they feel cold and mechanical? Serenity? Elation? Frustration? Sternness? Awe like when you look at a giant marble architecture towering above you?
I'm sure most of us have felt most of those feelings at some point.
