Are there any mathematics studies higher than calculus? If so, which ones?
If you are a math major in college, you quite likely covered a good bit of calculus in high school and certainly will cover it in the first couple semesters of college. There's 3 more years of college, plus grad school. So... @http://www.math.nyu.edu/courses/...  is from NYUs graduate math department.  Not surprisingly, Wikipedia has an article on branches of mathematics Areas of mathematics .  Most of each of those branches is usually studied after calculus.
