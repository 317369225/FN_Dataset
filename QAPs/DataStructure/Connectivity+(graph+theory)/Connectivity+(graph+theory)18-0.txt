What is the difference between a graph and tree in data structures and algorithms?
From Wikipedia Tree (graph theory) A tree is an undirected simple graph G that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: G is connected and has no cycles. G has no cycles, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G. G is connected, but is not connected if any single edge is removed from G. G is connected and the 3-vertex complete graph is not a minor of G. Any two vertices in G can be connected by a unique simple path. Simply put it is connected Graph but has no cycle. Except this tree
