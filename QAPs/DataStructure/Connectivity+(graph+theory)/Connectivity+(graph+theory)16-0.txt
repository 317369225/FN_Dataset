How is Graph Theory applied in Data Mining?
Most of the data we deal with in data science can be modeled into graphs. These graphs can be mined using famous techniques and algorithms in graph theory. Eg: Social Networks are the most easiest thing to comprehend among numerous things in data science related to graph theory. In social networks taking the people/web pages are nodes and their connections as edges can be modeled as a graph. Over this various mining operations can be performed better by using graph theory related algorithms. Erdos-Renyi Random Graphs are one such thing from graph theory which can simulate the evolution of social networks. I end it up here saying that graphs are underlying in most of the data we deal. So graph theory is mostly used in mining information from such kind of data. Updated 14 Dec 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
