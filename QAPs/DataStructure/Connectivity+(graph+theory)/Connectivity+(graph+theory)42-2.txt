What kind of mathematics does one need to know to better understand neuroscience?
It really depends on what are of neuroscience you are working in.  Neuroscience is a big field and some areas are much more math centric than others. That being said I think two things that almost all labs use are statistics and matrices/vectors. Statistics: this of course is used for making sure your data is significant.  You need to know all the basics like the t-Test, z-Test, and ANOVA's.  Fourier transforms also come in very handy in my area. Matrices and vectors: one of the main programs used to do analysis in neuroscience is MatLab and it is based on matrices and vectors.  While you don't have to have an expansive knowledge of these to be able to use MatLab it certainly wouldn't be a bad thing to understand them well.
