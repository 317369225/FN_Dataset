Is a polymath even relevant in today's world of super-specialized disciplines?
The generalist synthesizes the knowledge of one or more fields and draws connections that a specialist might miss. Advances are still made in this way.  For example, in computer science we have graph theory, the study of algorithms related to graphs of nodes and the edges that connect them.  In sociology we have networks, which are the connections between people and organizations, how they relate and associate.  Bring them together, cross-discipline and you have Social Network Analysis, using graph theory to efficiently process large social networks, with applications from Facebook to counterterrorism.  People who understand both fields are in high demand.
