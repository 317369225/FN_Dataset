What are some active areas of research within combinatorics?
Thanks for A2A, Anurag. I was never interested in research in pure combinatorics, so you  shouldn't expect a good answer from me. Nonetheless,  there are many connections between combinatorics and the rest of the mathematics, in particular, geometry/topology. It is quite typical  that combinatorial problems are sometimes simpler than their geometrical counterparts and vice versa.  This relation is often quite fascinating, since combinatorial problems are more concrete and tangible but arbitrarily hard in contrast to the more abstract geometrical problems  requiring a solid background to understand them.    Examples are: Tropical algebraic geometry, and enumerative geometry in general. The interested reader can find a good introduction on mathematik.uni-kl.de Tropical geometry is a subject of the newest research. Many geometrical problems that can be reduced  to study of Coxeter groups and Coxeter systems which allow a purely combinatorial description.  For example, study of Weyl groups of Lie algebras and algebraic groups.  See e.g. Coxeter Groups I for an introduction.  One should probably mention Bruhat–Tits buildings as  an area of the modern research. Toric varieties.  They aren't probably not that important from  research perspective because they have been studied well, but allow purely combinatorial description as well. Topology.  All underlying structures, i.e. simplicial complexes, or more    generally,  CW complexes are actually combinatorial objects.I apologize because I'm not able to give examples of modern  pure combinatorial Ramsey-type theories,  but I don't think that there is a clear boundary between combinatorics and non-combinatorics.
