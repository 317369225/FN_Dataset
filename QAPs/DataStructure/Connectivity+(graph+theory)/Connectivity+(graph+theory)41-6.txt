Are there any mathematics studies higher than calculus? If so, which ones?
Mathematics, like any subject with depth, has an essentially endless sequence of "the more you know the more you discover how little you know". The end of my academic career in maths (only a masters degree) was festooned with text books entitled "An Introduction to ..."! As mentioned, I think this is true for any interesting subject of study from Philosophy to Wine Tasting to Bridge and back via Poetry and Gardening. Calculus is built on simpler mathematical foundations, but is a mere brick in the foundational wall for whatever comes next: possibly Topology, Complex Analysis, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra, or a host of specialisations built on those things. As someone, possibly John of Salisbury in 1169, said: If I see further than others it is only because I stand on the shoulders of giants.
