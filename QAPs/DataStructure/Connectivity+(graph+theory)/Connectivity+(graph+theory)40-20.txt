What is the relationship between music and math?Convergence of infinite harmonic series and the musical octaves as manifested in the piano keys.
Originally Answered: Are mathematicians and musicians particularly closely related?Of course not, unless a mathematician has a particular gift and talent in music. I keep reading that maths helps someway being a musician or something similar. Maths may help at the very beginning for reading and understanding music theory. That's all. Composing music and/or playing an instrument is a total different field. Of course you can apply mathematic rules in composing, but this is nothing but a mere excercise, it's not real composing. So please someone explain me why should be mathematicians and musicians particularly closed. Are painters and chemists particularly closed?
