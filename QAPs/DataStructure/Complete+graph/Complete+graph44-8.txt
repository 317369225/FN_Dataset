What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
The most esoteric that I've tried is LOLCODE. It was fun coding in LOLCODE. I learnt about it when it was introduced to us as our project in one of my computer science courses. We made an interpreter that will run and interpret codes written in LOLCODE. It was fun, really. I enjoyed developing the interpreter in C#, as well as creating small programs using LOLCODE But the most esoteric one that I've encountered is Brainfuck. I never tried programming using the language though. Updated 9 Jun 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
