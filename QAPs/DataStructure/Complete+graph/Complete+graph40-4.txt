What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
Theorem: The sum of exterior angles of any simple polygon is 360º: Proof: Visualize an arbitrary convex polygon in your mind. Good—now slowly zoom out until the polygon is reduced to a tiny point on the plane. Note that as you zoom out, all angles on the polygon remain constant. Now take each side of the polygon and extend it into a ray such that all rays face the same direction (either clockwise or counterclockwise). As the polygon contracts into a single point, these rays will also converge onto a single point. If you visualize these rays as all originating from a single point, the angles formed between the rays clearly add up to 360º. Since the angles between the rays correspond to the exterior angles of the polygon, the sum of exterior angles is also 360º. QED. Updated 5 Dec 2013 • View Upvotes
