What is the proof of Graph Isomorphism problem not belonging to P nor NP-Complete provided P! =NP?Can you suggest any reading for the proof?
As Mark already pointed out, we have not proved that GI is not NP-complete, but merely that it is in the low hierarchy of NP, which does not equal NP unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level. The latter fact, along with the definitions of the low and high hierarchies, appears in this paper http://www.researchgate.net/prof... The relationships to several other theorems, such as Karp-Lipton and the fact that P/poly containing NP (e.g.Â  randomization adds power to polynomial time algorithms) or SAT having polynomial size circuits would imply a similar collapse, are striking.
