Is there a complete hierarchical graph of Scala and Java collection framework?
That would be two separate plots. Here is a page with diagrams for the Scala collections. Mutable and Immutable Collections Since there is no inheritance relationship between Java collections and Scala ones the Java would be completely independent. There is a diagram in an answer from StackOverflow here. What is the difference between Collection and List in Java? Note that it is from 2010 and that Java 8 is going to add on to this, but hopefully this gives you the general idea of the structure of those libraries.
