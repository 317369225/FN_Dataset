What is the difference between a complete graph and a dense graph?
Consider a simple graph on n  vertices. If there exists a constant k  such that the number of edges in the graph is more than kn 2   , then the graph is said to be a dense graph. Not many care for them and they are most certainly not desirable objects. You are better off with sparse graphs, computation wise. A complete graph can be defined as the king of dense graphs, in the sense that no other (dense) simple graph, can have more edges than it on n  vertices. People respect him because he is the king and also because he is rich. Every now and then, when graph theorists fail to accomplish something meaningful, they conduct tournaments all based on his orientation.
