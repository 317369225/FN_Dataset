Can the category (referring to category theory) be completely represented by a graph (directed or undirected)?Just going through the concepts of category theory, so thought that may be any category can be represented by a graph. Is it right to say that one is a generalization of another or just a different form of representation?
A category is a directed multigraph ("multi" meaning there may be more than one edge between the same nodes) with some extra structure. The extra structure is an equivalence relation on paths such that A) equivalent paths start and end at the same places, B) composition of paths respects equivalence, and C) each path is equivalent to a unique single-edge path. [Condition C) is technical; if one commits oneself to never mentioning edges, only paths-up-to-equivalence, it is not needed (since its only effect is to ensure that there is no distinction between the two)] So, if you like, you can think of categories as just graphs with extra information as to which paths are to be considered equivalent.
