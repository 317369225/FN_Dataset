What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
I would say that HASKELL is one of these languages. It has many constructs based on lamba calculus. It is completely functional with features such as currying and monads. The language is often used in industry. The following is an example of haskell code implementing the Quick Sort algorithm: quickSort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] quickSort [] = [] quickSort (x:xs) = quickSort [a | a <- xs, a < x] ++ -- Sort the left part of the list [x] ++ -- Insert pivot between two sorted parts quickSort [b | b <- xs, b >= x] -- Sort the right part of the list [/code]
