What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
The proof by Graham and Rothschild, to this problem "Connect each pair of geometric vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube to obtain a complete graph on 2^n vertices. Colour each of the edges of this graph either red or blue. What is the smallest value of n for which every such colouring contains at least one single-coloured complete subgraph on four coplanar vertices?" The solution given was In 1971, Graham and Rothschild proved that this problem has a solution N*, giving as a bound 6 ≤ N* ≤ N, with N being a large but explicitly defined number , where in Knuth's up-arrow notation. It is ridiculously difficult to understand the magnitude of the upper bound given by them, let alone using it seriously in a mathematical proof. The wikipedia article describes beautifully as to how big a number the Grahm's number is. READ THIS WIKI ARTICLE TO UNDERSTAND THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF THE NUMBER. Graham's number It took a loong time just to understand the magnitude of the number mathematically.
