What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
Probably my favorite was Sorted! (p-nand-q.com), which separates all of the language components into separate statements.Â  The Unlambda Programming Language was also fairly interesting, being functional without any of the core features of functional programming. I released a couple, myself, but I never thought of them as "weird" so much as "proving a point."
