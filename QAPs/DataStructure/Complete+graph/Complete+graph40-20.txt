What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
The proof to the Four Color Theorem classifies as ridiculous because it is infeasible to prove by hand. This was the first major theorem to be proved with the aid of a computer. The theorem states that no more than 4 colors are needed to color any map (a plane separated into contiguous regions) such that no adjacent regions share a color. The proof relies on a set of 1,936 maps which cannot be part of a smallest counterexample yet must be included in a counterexample. This contradiction proves the theorem. Appel and Haken first proved the theorem in this way in 1976 using a computer program to prove each of a billion cases [1]. Initially there was skepticism and backlash since it would be a daunting task to verify this proof by hand. Their proof was simplified by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas in 1995, again using computer software, to about 4 times fewer cases. Not only were these proofs not practically verifiable by hand, they relied on computer programs which were themselves unproven in the mathematical sense. In 2005, Gonthier was able to create a formally verified proof of the Four Color Theorem [1, 2] using the Coq Proof Assistant [3].
