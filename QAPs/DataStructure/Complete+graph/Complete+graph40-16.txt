What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
"If I tell you this you will at once point out to me the lunatic asylum as my goal. " (Ramanujan in a letter to Hardy) Claim. 1+2+3+4+5+6+…=−112   Proof. c=1+2+3+4+5+6+…  4c=4+8+12+…  −3c=1−2+3−4+5−6+…  −3c=1−2+3−4+=1(1+1) 2  =14   c=−112     QED. [The proof is not strictly correct, it's ridiculous (as Ramanujan thought) and anyhow you obtain the same by zeta function regularization and a bunch of other formal methods; see Is it true that the sum of all natural numbers is -1/12? and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯] Updated 14 Mar • View Upvotes
