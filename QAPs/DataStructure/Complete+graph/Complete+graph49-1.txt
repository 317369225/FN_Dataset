What is the significance of Kuratowski's theorem?
The first point is that any graph can be embedded in R^3. But not any graph can be embedded in R^2. So it's a natural question: can you characterize those that can, and those that can not? Pleasantly, this question has a nice answer, Kuratowski's theorem: a graph is planar iff it does not contain any K_5 or K_{3,3} minors. Some difficult graph theory problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, can admit easier or more efficient solutions if you restrict to the subclass of planar graphs. Kuratowski gives you a simple way to check whether any particular graph fits into this category.
