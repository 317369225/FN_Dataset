What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
It obviously depends on the meaning of the word 'esoteric'.  I will use the definition of 'esoteric' as a programming language having a strange internal model leading to difficult to understand code. Given that definition, I have a couple to add: Postscript - Forth-like, but in the hands of an expert one could do some powerful stuff.  However, reading Postscript written by someone else was challenging to say the least.  One of my very first jobs was to write some Postscript to drive a new-fangled device called a laser printer (it was over 30 years ago). Javascript's class mechanism must count as esoteric.  I know no other language that implements classes in the same way.  Perhaps because I learnt OO using languages such as C++, Java and lately Ruby, I still struggle to get my head around Javascript's mechanism. I wrote a complex data import system using Perl some 17 years ago.  I hope its improved since then.  In those days, Perl was very much programming by side effect.  So you would execute a statement which in turn loaded various internal variables.  To keep your code efficient you would rely on the internal variables still holding several lines further down.  I wasted hours trying to understand why my code had stopped working only to find that I had relied on one of the these internal persisting.  I had added a further instruction which I didn't realise overrode the internal variables - or I had forgotten that I was still using the variable.
