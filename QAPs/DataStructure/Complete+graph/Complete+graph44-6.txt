What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
The most esoteric language I've used is a language called Q. It's a functional programming language that has various overloaded operators that act differently depending on the structure of the data the operator is used on. A sample function in Q: sample:{ t:("DSF"; enlist ",") 0: `:c:/q/data/px.csv; tmpx:select mpx:max Price by Date,Sym from t; h:hopen `:aerowing:5042; rtmpx:h "select mpx:max Price by Date,Sym from tpx"; hclose h; .[`:c:/q/data/tpx.dat; (); ,; rtmpx,tmpx] }
