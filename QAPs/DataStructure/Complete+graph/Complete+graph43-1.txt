Why is facebook's search called graph search? Does it use a kind of graph data structure or is it because of a completely different reason?
One of the biggest assets Facebook owns is its "people graph". In this case, graph indeed refers to the graph data structure that represents the connections between Facebook users. The idea is so central to Facebook that their API product is called "Graph API". So, their search is called "Graph Search" because of the tight integration of the people graph in it. It's not a plain vanilla search engine, it's an search engine over the Facebook *people graph*. Updated 18 May 2013
