Is the Google knowledge graph completely automated? How are mistakes rectified?
No, the Google Knowledge Graph is not completely automated.  Naturally, Google tries to leverage computers as much as possible, but there is a human component. One way mistakes are rectified is the little "Feedback" like at the bottom of every Knowledge Panel (that appears to the right of search results when Google thinks it knows the entity that you're interested in).  If you click that, you can click on things that you think are wrong and they get sent for human review. In the context of Freebase, you can click on two topics that you think are the same and should be merged or that you think should be deleted and the flagged topics get sent to a queue for people to vote on.  It's reasonable to think that Google has similar internal mechanisms for pieces of the Knowledge Graph which are not part of Freebase. Much of Freebase (and therefore the Google Knowledge Graph) comes from external sources and gets updated on a regular basis as those sources (e.g. Wikipedia, MusicBrainz, etc) are updated.
