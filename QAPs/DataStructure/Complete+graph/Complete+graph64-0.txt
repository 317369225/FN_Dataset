How do you prove that if all the edges and diagonals of a 17-gon are each coloured red, green, or blue, then you can find a single-colour triangle?
This is one of the few known exact results of Ramsey's theorem Suppose that you have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3  colours, red, yellow and green. Suppose further that the edge colouring  has no monochromatic triangles. Select a vertex v. Consider the set of vertices that have a green edge to the vertex v. This is called the green neighborhood of v. The green neighborhood of v cannot contain any green edges, since otherwise there would be a green  triangle consisting of the two endpoints of that green edge and the  vertex v. Thus, the induced edge colouring on the green neighborhood of v has edges coloured with only two colours, namely yellow and red. Since R(3,3) = 6, the green neighborhood of v can contain at most 5 vertices. Similarly, the red and yellow neighborhoods of v can contain at most 5 vertices each. Since every vertex, except for v itself, is in one of the green, red or yellow neighborhoods of v, the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16 vertices. Thus, we have R(3,3,3) ≤ 17.
