Malebolge: @Malbolge Here is Hello World is Malbolge: ('&%:9]!~}|z2Vxwv-,POqponl$Hjig%eB@@>}=<M:9wv6WsU2T|nm-,jcL(I&%$#" `CB]V?Tx<uVtT`Rpo3NlF.Jh++FdbCBA@?]!~|4XzyTT43Qsqq(Lnmkj"Fhg${z@> Some notes from the Wikipedia page: Malbolge is machine language for a ternary virtual machine, the Malbolge interpreter. The standard interpreter and the official specification do not match perfectly. This is a simplified explanation of the interpreter source code: it omits useless encryption and subtraction steps and introduces an assembly language.[original research?] Malbolge has three registers, a, c, and d. When a program starts, the value of all three registers is zero. c is special: it points to the current instruction. Malbolge has eight instructions. Malbolge figures out which instruction to execute by taking the value at [c], adding the value of c to it, and taking the remainder when this is divided by 94. The final result tells the interpreter what to do After each instruction is executed, the guilty instruction gets encrypted (see below) so that it won't do the same thing next time, unless a jump just happened. Right after a jump, Malbolge will encrypt the innocent instruction just prior to the one it jumped to instead. Then, the values of both c and d are increased by one and the next instruction is executed. And so on. It's rather Hellish :-)
