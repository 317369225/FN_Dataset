What is an edge-weighted complete graph with 6 or less vertices but exactly 7 minimum spanning trees?
For the constraints mentioned, no solution seems to exist. This is because, in the minimum spanning tree, you would need n-1= 5 edges. The edges are chosen among groups of equal weighted edges. Total number of minimum spanning trees, X, cannot hit 7 as the factors of X can only be 2,3,4 or 5.
