What are some interesting properties number 6 has?Please avoid the "it's a perfect number". Thank you :)
6 is the smallest positive integer with two factors, neither of which divides the other. (Also, 6 is the only finite K such that the groupoid of K-element sets has a nontrivial invertible endofunctor, if you're into that sort of thing...)
