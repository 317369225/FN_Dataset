Graph Theory: Is there any algorithm to determine how much we need to increase graph degree, that graph would be complete?How do I move from a random graph to a complete graph and how many degrees do I need to add to each node.
Yes, that is easy; a complete graph has degree n - 1 for each node. If you have less, you need to increase it.   So, if you currently have i degrees, you need to increase it by n - i - 1 degrees. As for the actual degrees--to add--just iterate through the nodes, adding any edges that are missing
