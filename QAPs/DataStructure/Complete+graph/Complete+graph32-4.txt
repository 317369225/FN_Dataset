Which are the most magical numbers?I will take any kind of magic. I was thinking of "especially cool" but any magical attribute or system is welcome.
I have an interesting number here. Consider the following problem in graph theory: Consider an n  -dimensional hypercube, and connect each pair of vertices to obtain a complete graph on 2 n   vertices. Then colour each of the edges of this graph either red or blue. What is the smallest value of n  for which every such colouring contains at least one single-coloured complete subgraph on 4 coplanar vertices? The answer is a positive integer, which has been proven by mathematicians that it is between 13 and Graham's number. What is Graham's number actually? According to Stephen Fry from QI, it is a number so big that all the materials in the universe will not be able to write the number. All we know that it ends with... 7 (no, not really.) According to some, Graham's number is the biggest number ever written on a mathematical paper. If you want to appreciate how big Graham's number is, you can try to look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gra... Updated 23 Sep 2012 • View Upvotes
