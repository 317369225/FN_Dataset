What is the size of the largest complete graph on Facebook?
The size of the largest complete subgraph in the Facebook friend graph is probably unknown, as the maximal clique problem is NP-complete. (See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cli...) If the answer to this question is known, either someone at Facebook has made quite an algorithmic breakthrough or the company has an impossibly large amount of spare computing power. (As an estimation, I'd be surprised if there weren't complete subgraphs of at least 20 people. I'd imagine the largest subgraph has somewhere between 20 and 200 people.) The largest connected component is likely to include almost all (upwards of 99.9%) of Facebook users. This tends to be the case in large social networks. Updated 12 Mar 2012 â€¢ View Upvotes
