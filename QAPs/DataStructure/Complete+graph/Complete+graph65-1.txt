Do you remember notes better when they are typed or hand written?
Yes - a great question.  I use both.  For brief, contemporaneous notes (eg, during a telephone conversation, or while listening to a presentation or lecture) I take handwritten notes.  I scribble, rather than write neatly, which tends to create 'visual patterns' on the page that I find aids my recall. That's to say I can flick through the notes weeks or even months later and know what 'pattern' I am looking for to locate a specific point (say, a particular quotation or reference). For a more complex undertaking - say, a report or proposal, or for a lecture or presentation I'm to give myself -  I prefer to work with typed notes. The flexibility of being able to cut, paste and edit quickly helps me to shape what I want to say.  The physical act of doing any of those actions also helps me to remember the points I'm applying them to.  Again, there's a visual element involved; the experience of seeing the bullet points or paragraphs come together is an important part of the process. If I'm scoping out an idea, I use mind-mapping (although I'm not as strong an adherent to the technique as some).  I use a commercial programme (Mindjet's MindManager - see http://info.mindjet.com/MindMana...) that I got used to in an earlier employment before I worked for myself.  Once more, the visual element involved in creating and manipulating each map is an integral part of my overall thinking about a given project and helps clarify the key elements I want to be able to recall most readily.
