What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
I wrote my senior CS paper on SNOBOL ... it's a bit esoteric. It's primarily a string manipulation language. You can do pretty much anything with a string quick and easy. One of the odd things about it is that a space is an operator. It was kind of fun to play with just to see what it could do. Another bit of trivia learned while researching: It was probably the first language to come with a cross-platform installer (Mid-60's mainframes). Why SNOBOL? Because I had an evil CS teacher that assigned an esoteric language to everyone in the class: Euler, Smalltalk, Forth, SNOBOL, ADA, PL/1, APL, etc etc. I also actually wrote test code in Adobe Postscript language when I worked for a printer manufacturer. That was fun to play with -- and you can still do it with any PS printer ... you just have to get a little program to tell the printer to execute the script instead of print it.
