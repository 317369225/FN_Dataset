How can we tell if a graph is more complex than any other graph?E.g. if a neural network in the brain of one type of insect is more complex than a neural network of some other type.
You've essentially answered your own question in the comments: simply take the adjacency matrix of the graph, serialize it as a bit string, and then take the Kolmogorov complexity. Of course, this tells you how irregular the connections in the graph are.  Whether this is biologically meaningful is a different question entirely.  For instance, a complete graph on a million points (i.e., a brain with a million brain cells, each connected to all the others) would be much simpler than an arbitrary graph on fifteen points.
