Suppose G is a simple graph on 10 vertices that is not connected. Prove that G has at most 36 edges. Can equality occur?Hint in comments.
(Yes, this is clearly a homework problem. I don't care.) If G is not connected, we can split it into two disjoint graphs, with xx and yy many vertices respectively, such that x+y=10x+y=10 and x,y≥1x,y≥1 . The xyxy many potential edges between the two disjoint graphs cannot occur, but every other pair of vertices could be given an edge, leading to a maximum of \mathchoice((((102\mathchoice))))−xy=45−xy many possible edges. Thus, we just need to minimize xy , subject to our constraints. Basic algebra* reveals that xy is at least 9, achieved when one of the disjoint subgraphs has 1 vertex and the other has 9. Thus, G has at most 36 edges, achieved when G consists of the disjoint union of the complete graphs on 1 and 9 vertices. [*: Specifically, xy=((x+y)2−(x−y)2)/4 . Given that x+y=10 , this reduces to 25−(x−y)2/4 , which is minimized when |x−y| is maximized. And |x−y| is at most 9−1=8 (given that x,y≥1 ), yielding 25−82/4=9 .] ---- The above is the straightforward calculation from the hint. But here's a faster, cleaner way to see it: Suppose G is disconnected, with no path from A to B. Take all the edges into A, and redirect them into B instead; this makes a new graph with the same number of vertices and edges as G, but in which A is a completely isolated point. Thus, without loss of generality, we can restrict attention to graphs with an isolated point. Specifically, putting as many edges as possible into the remainder of the graph, we end up with the complete graph on (10 - 1) vertices, plus a single isolated point. And this has, of course, \mathchoice((((10−12\mathchoice))))=36 edges.
