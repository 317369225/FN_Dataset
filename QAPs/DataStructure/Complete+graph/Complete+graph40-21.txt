What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
Inspired by Nathan Pflueger's answer: There is no natural number strictly between 1  and 2  . Proof: Note that A  is strictly between B  and C  just in case A−B  and A−C  have opposite, nonzero signs. That is, just in case (A−B)(A−C)<0  . Our goal, then, is to show that (A−1)(A−2)<0  has no natural number solutions; i.e., that (A−1)(A−2)≥0  for naturals. Expanding out, this is A 2 −3A+2≥0  ; dividing by 2  and then adding A  to both sides, our goal is to show that (A2)+1≥A  . This amounts to showing that any set with more than (A2)  elements has at least A  elements. At this point, finish off by using Nathan's proof.
