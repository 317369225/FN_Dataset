How can I draw a complete graph of six vertices with the least amount of crossings and how do I prove it is the least?
Let's see if we got the terms: completed graph as in every vertex connected to another. We want to minimize the connections such that the complete graph doesn't break. In psuedo, we could let each natural number map to a vertex. Then ascend the naturals, and for each relate that number to the number in the sequence of remaining naturals til ending natural number. For each relation, connect those corresponding vertices. That should work right?
