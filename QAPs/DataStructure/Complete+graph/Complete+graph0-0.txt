What is the size of the largest complete graph on Facebook?
Originally Answered: What is the size of the largest known clique (complete graph) within Facebook?TL;DR -- there isn't a definitive answer, but extrapolation from available data indicates the largest cliques in the Facebook social graph have at least 200-250 people in them. One of the most publicized academic studies of the Facebook social graph seems to be: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.4503.pdf That paper was featured in a Facebook blog post: Anatomy of Facebook Graph 4a of that paper is relevant to clique size: Specifically, the 95th percentile dotted line in that graph for the Degree range between 1000 and 5000 is quite illustrative.  That line tells us: 95% of Facebook users who have 1000 friends have ego-graphs with clustering coefficients of under 0.20 -- meaning, of 1000 friends, 200 are all friends with each other.   That data point represents the 95th percentile of users with 1000 friends, so that implies Ugander, Karrer, Backstrom and Marlow found that 5% of those users had even higher ego-graph clustering coefficients (i.e., cliques even larger than 200 among their 1000 friends).  Similarly, for the 95th percentile of users with 5000 friends, their ego-graph clustering coefficients seem to be under 0.05 -- implying around 250 friends who are all friends with each other.  Again, that data point is a 95th percentile score, so the researchers clearly found at least 5% of users with 5000 friends had cliques of even larger than 250 people among their many friends. This degree of clustering is quite remarkable in online social networks, as reported by the authors of the study. Updated 7 Nov 2013 • View Upvotes
