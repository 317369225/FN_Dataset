How many Hamiltonian cycles are in a complete graph with N vertices?
I was asked this as a small part of one of my interviews for admission to Oxford. The question led to these cycles being considered, and I was asked, "how many such [cycles] are there?" I almost immediately jumped at the N! answer. It seemed to me pretty obvious that this was an ordering of the vertices, since you have choose which vertex to visit first (N choices) then second (N-1 choices), and so on, right the way down until you're forced to pick the last remaining vertex, and then connect back to the start. The interviewers -- mathematicians with no time for sloppiness -- replied, "consider three points." I had made a mistake somewhere. This was at the end of a frankly brutal half hour of fairly difficult and open-ended mathematics in front of two experienced professors, and my brain was done thinking. I was sure there was a fix; I knew I was close. When N=3, the answer is 1 (a triangle), I thought to myself. "(N-2)!", I replied. I must have seemed like the stupidest person alive to those professors. This answer, although it was indeed a quick fix for the case they gave, it made a complete mockery of my thought process for N!, and just clearly didn't hold. I couldn't tell this at the time; I just knew from their faces that my answer was wrong. I tried N!/6 and N!-5 against their facial expressions, which were met with similar mixtures of pain and contempt as before, and I knew I had to wearily take a step back and see how to answer the question properly. The reasoning for N! is correct, but the paths are (very significantly) over-counted. First, each of the paths is counted N times -- once for each possible starting point. So we have to divide by N to get N!/N, or (N-1)!. Then we have still over-counted, because each path has been counted in both directions (think clockwise and counter-clockwise), so we have to divide by 2, eventually arriving at (N-1)!/2.
