How do programming contest problem setters make test cases ?
Originally Answered: Competitive Programming: How are the test cases for problems developed on CodeChef, Topoders, Codeforces, HackerRank, and HackerEarth?Those test cases are produced using File Handling features of different languages by writing custom test case generation programs for each question. Separate programs are written for generating input and output test files. Different logic can be used to generate different kinds of test input/output cases based on the requirements. Mostly the test cases are generated at random like in the example below and 1 or 2 specific test cases are often entered manually into the input file. And random generation generally generates several boundary cases so this is how everything is done. For ex. Consider the question Invite Friends on HackerEarth, it requires the generation of input files with strings upto 10000 characters long and each line could allow only a specific set of characters different from the previous one. So, being the author of the question I can tell you that the input files for it are generated using the following Java code: import java.util.Scanner; import java.io.*; class file { public static void main(String args[]) throws FileNotFoundException { PrintWriter writer=new PrintWriter("input.txt"); Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in); String a[]={"0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z"}; int no=sc.nextInt(); writer.println(no); for(int i=0;i<no;i++) {   int len=(int)(Math.random()*9+1),base=(int)(Math.random()*34+2); String s=""; for(int j=0;j<len;j++) { int index=(int)(Math.random()*(base)); s+=a[index]; } writer.println(base+" "+s); } writer.close(); } } Similar code with the solving logic is written to generate the output files using an output stream connected to a file on the harddrive.
