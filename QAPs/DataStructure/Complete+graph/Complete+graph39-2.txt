What are some interesting properties number 6 has?Please avoid the "it's a perfect number". Thank you :)
6 is the largest integer n for which cos(2 pi/ n) is rational (the proof of this comes from field theory, and uses the fact that 6 is the largest integer for which phi(n) <= 2).  Since cosines show up in dot products, we conclude that for n > 6, a regular n-gon cannot be embedded in Euclidean space with all coordinates rational (no matter what dimension the space). Meanwhile, we can construct a regular hexagon with rational coordinates in 3-space.  Start with a cube with rational coordinates, and take a plane that goes through the center of the cube and orthogonal to one of the space diagonals.  This plane will intersect 6 sides of the cube, at their midpoints.  These 6 intersection points form a regular hexagon.
