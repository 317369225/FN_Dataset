What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
Theorem: 5!/2 is even. Proof: 5!/2 is the order of the group A5. It is known that A5 is a non-abelian simple group. Therefore A5 is not solvable. But the Feit-Thompson Theorem asserts that every finite group with odd cardinal is solvable, so 5!/2 must be an even number. Source- Para rir ou para chorar - Parte 13
