What are some of the best mathematical games or puzzles you invented?I asked a similar question over here: Which mathematical game or puzzle did you invent? , but I didn't get any responses. I was wondering whether you invented a mathematical game or puzzle, but never published for some reason.
Long time ago at university I invented the game "Prime-in-a-Row", which is a variant of tic-tac-toe. Its (alike tic-tac-toe) played on a 3x3 board; turn by turn both players put a positive (integer) number in one of the squares. The winner is the one that fills a row or column such that the sum is a prime number. Only two rules apply: You cannot start in the center square. If a number has an already adjacent square filled with a number (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) is must be +1 or -1 of (one of the) neighbouring values.It can be played with or without help of a computer. Looking back, it also might require a few math guys and some alcohol to be fun, but nevertheless, its worth mentioning. Even though we were with a bunch of very smart game theory students, we never found a winning strategy.
