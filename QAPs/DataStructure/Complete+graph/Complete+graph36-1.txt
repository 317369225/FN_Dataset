How much abstract algebra background is needed before delving into algebraic combinatorics?
Algebraic Combinatorics is one of those fields that mean different things to different persons. Let's review: The side of association schemes, graph theory is well represented by the book Distance-Regular Graphs: Andries E. Brouwer, Arjeh M. Cohen, Arnold Neumaier. It is also well represented by Anurag Bishnoi reply. The side of representation theory, tableau, etc. can be considered by the book The Symmetric Group: Representations, Combinatorial Algorithms, and Symmetric Functions: Bruce Sagan or by Young Tableaux: With Applications to Representation Theory and Geometry: William Fulton. The aspect of Coxeter groups can be considered via Combinatorics of Coxeter Groups: Anders Bjorner, Francesco Brenti. The aspect of lattice structures, rings, and so on can be considered via Enumerative Combinatorics: Volume 1: Richard P. Stanley. You get the idea, there is no single road to algebraic combinatorics. For further subject you can see the Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics which maintains a quite balanced view on the subject.
