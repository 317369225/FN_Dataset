What is the size of the largest complete graph on Facebook?
Given Facebook structure, the largest subgraph would have to be a recognizable group of famous people, close to TED, Davos and other similar large conferences. Many members of that community have upwards of a thousand friends on Facebook, and there are at least a thousand of them—although not all of them know each other, I’d expect to find a group of 500, all well known figures in politics, some from tech, or fashion. Algorithmically, the sure thing might be complex, a good enough estimate doesn’t have to be very consuming if you include simple, intuitive constraints: seed the algorithm with known ‘hubs’ (VCs, Usual Fortune 500 board members, party leaders, editors) and try to find a window of the size before finding the actual cluster. You might not be able to prove there is no larger group, but you can always show that no group marginally close to it would be better, which sounds good enough for me if said group includes 300 household names.
