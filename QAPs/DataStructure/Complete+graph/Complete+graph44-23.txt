What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
Mine was APL on an IBM 5100 microcomputer. With all my other languages I could look at code today and understand it but not APL. This piece of code (x[⍋x←6?40]) generates 6 pseudo-random numbers from 1 to 40 and outputs them sorted in ascending order (thanks to Wikipedia because I never would have remembered this). At the time I was still in school but was working for a consulting company that did rate design work for large utility companies. The algorithms were extremely complex and APL was actually the most compact language that could handle the calculations (we also used FORTRAN). It was the only time I ever used it but it saved me from doing a lot of code writing.
