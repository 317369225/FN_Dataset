What is the difference between a complete graph and a connected graph?
A complete graph has an edge between every pair of vertices.  For a given number of vertices, there's a unique complete graph, which is often written as K n   , where n is the number of vertices. A connected graph is any graph where there's a path between every pair of vertices in the graph. Note that every complete graph is necessarily connected (one path between any pair of vertices is just to follow the edge between those vertices), but connected graphs are not necessarily complete (for instance, every tree is a connected graph, but K n   can't be a tree for n≥3  , since it must contain a cycle). For example, this is the complete graph on 7 vertices, K 7   .  It's also a connected graph: ​ This is a connected graph: ​ Images from wikipedia: [1] http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Complete_graph_K7.svg/200px-Complete_graph_K7.svg.png [2] http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Tree_graph.svg/180px-Tree_graph.svg.png Updated 18 Apr • View Upvotes
