What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
Prove that plurality voting with a uniform distribution of voter utilities satisfies the fictitious-play property. Proof: If there are three candidates, the utility space is a triangle.  Take the isogonal conjugate of the pivotal point, and use Ceva's Theorem and Law of Sines to show that the equilibrium cannot be reached unless we start on the angle bisector.  For more than three candidates, integrate over all triangles pwns the problem.
