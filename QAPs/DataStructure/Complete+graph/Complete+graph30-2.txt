How do programming contest problem setters make test cases ?
It really depends on the problem, but generating good test data requires thinking about the problem very carefully and seeing what sorts of pitfalls are present. Good test data should, at the very minimum, have the following: Some simple example cases so people can sanity check their programs (these are always the sample cases that are given with the problem statement). Really big cases to test the time/space complexity of the program. Test cases with some special structure (for graphs, you might have a complete graph, a clique, many disconnected SCCs, etc) Very specialized edge cases (minimum value of bounds, maximum value of bounds. Random test cases of different sizes. Updated 11 Apr 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
