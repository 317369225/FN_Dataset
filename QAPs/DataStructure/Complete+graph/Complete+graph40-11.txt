What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
Someone posted this on a Facebook group: Prove that there does not exist an ordered pair of positive integers (a,b)  that satisfy the equation 3 a −7 b −1=0  The intended solution was to note that for all positive integers a  and b  , 3 a −7 b −1  was odd and therefore could not be equal to zero. But someone had something else in mind. 3 a −7 b −1=0  implies 3 a =7 b +1 b   . First note that the equation can not hold if b=1  . Then we prove that b  is not a power of 2  . If b  were a power of 2  , we'd have m 2 +1=3 a   for some integer m  , which is not possible since any number of the form m 2 +1  is either divisible by 2  or has a prime factor of the form 4k+1  . Now the Zsigmondy Theorem tells us that 7 b +1 b   has a prime factor that does not divide 7 d +1 d   where d  is a proper factor of b  with bd   odd. In other words, 7 b +1 b   has at least two different prime factors. But 3 a   has only one prime factor, namely 3  . So, 7 b +1 b   can not be equal to 3 a   and our proof is complete. EDIT: Just for fun, here's another proof. First note that the equation can not hold if any one of a  or b  is equal to 1  . Now Catalan's conjecture (proved in 2002) says that if x  and y  are positive integers greater than 1  , then the only solution for x a −y b =1  (a,b>1)  is (x,y,a,b)=(3,2,2,3)  . So, 3 a −7 b =1  can not be true.
