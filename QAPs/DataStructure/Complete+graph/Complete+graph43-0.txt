Why is facebook's search called graph search? Does it use a kind of graph data structure or is it because of a completely different reason?
It is called 'Graph search' because the search looks at and models the people of Facebook as a giant graph. A graph is nothing but a collection of points and the connections between them. To put it simply, you will be directly connected to someone whom you're friends with. You'd either be indirectly connected to someone whom you're not friends with but have mutual friends. You'll not be connected with someone whom you're neither friends with nor have mutual friends. More in detail here: What is Facebook Graph Search in a nutshell?
