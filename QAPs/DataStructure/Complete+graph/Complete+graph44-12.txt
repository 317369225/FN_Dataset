I would have to add Binary to this list. In the early 70's we learned on punch cards and a few of us took to learning the binary IPL "Initial Program Load" where the entire program had to fit on one card. Students would spend all day punching out their Fortran program on a stack of cards, then they would pickup the standard IPL card to put on top and stack them into the feeder. As a prank we would change out the standard card with our special program that would instruct the computer to read all following cards and punch every memory location. Unsuspecting students would listen in terror as their work was turned into confetti.
