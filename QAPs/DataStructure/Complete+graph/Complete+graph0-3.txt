What is the size of the largest complete graph on Facebook?
I  guess the number would be greater than 230, the usually accepted upper limit to Dunbar's Number (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun... ). In the case of Dunbar's Number, each person knows the social status between any two people, and maintains consistent social contact with them.  However, for Facebook friends, the regular contact would have ceased in most cases, let alone knowing how 2 of your friends know each other. In my case, I am friends with Zach Weiner (creator of SMBC), although I've never met him. Sent him an invitation, and he accepted! Well, publicising oneself would also lead to increase of the clique umber. Updated 25 Dec 2012
