What are some of the best mathematical games or puzzles you invented?I asked a similar question over here: Which mathematical game or puzzle did you invent? , but I didn't get any responses. I was wondering whether you invented a mathematical game or puzzle, but never published for some reason.
I did not invent it, but I made a computer game out of it. It is called Landau's license plate game, and my version is called Dau. Definition taken from M. I. Kaganov: "The point of the game is to make an equality out of any four-digit license plate number (Soviet license plate numbers are of the form "AB-CD" - for example, "12-34".) Here are the rules: you can use only the arithmetic, algebraic, and trigonometric operations learned in school, you're not allowed to rearrange the numbers, and you have to work out the solution in your head. In other words, you have to turn "-" into "=" by inserting signs known to any high school student [plus, minus, times, divides, square root, logarithm, sine, cosine, and so on] between the numbers." Examples: 75-31 (7-5=3-1), 75-33 (7-5)=3!/3. Of course, there can be other solutions, as you can easily see.
