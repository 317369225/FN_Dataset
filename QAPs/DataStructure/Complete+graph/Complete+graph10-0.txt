What is the expected number of steps needed for an entity with no memory to traverse a 4 node complete graph?You have a rabbit (dark grey) with no memory on one node of a four node graph. The rabbit can take any path (with equal probability) but once at the new node doesn't remember the path he took to get there. What is the number of expected steps (paths taken) before the rabbit has visited every node.
Formalizing Sridhar's answer and generalizing it to N  cliques. Define f(N)  as the number of steps required to visit all nodes of an N  clique.  We're interested in finding E[f(N)]  . Define g(k)  as the number of steps taken between visiting k  and k+1  distinct nodes.  It is easy to see that : f(N)  = g(1)+g(2)...+g(N−1)  Note that this doesn't have g(0)  because the rabbit has to start on some node. From linearity of expctation: E[f(N)]  = E[g(1)]+E[g(2)]...+E[g(N−1)]  Now let's try to solve for E[g(k)]  . When we've visited k  nodes already, we'd revist some already visited node with probability (k−1)/(N−1)  in which case we'd again have visited exactly k  distinct nodes and the expected number of remaining steps would still be E[g(k)]  . Had we gone to an unvisited node, which happens with the probablity 1−(k−1)/(N−1)  , we'd have visited k+1  distinct vertices and the expected number of remaining steps  would be 0  .  So: E[g(k)]=    1+(k−1)/(N−1)∗E[g(k)]    which gives: E[g(k)]=(N−1)/(N−k)  Plugging it in the equation we derived for E[f(N)]  , we get: E[f(N)]=  (N−1)/(N−1)+(N−1)/(N−2)    +...+(N−1)/1  Solving it for N=4  , we get 3/3+3/2+3/1=5.5
