Do you remember notes better when they are typed or hand written?
Glad you found Course Hero's infographic helpful, Sarah! Personally, I need both methods to make sure I remember my notes later. Like John, I prefer handwritten quick notes for contemporaneous recording. I use a lot of short hand, and my personal abbreviations often help to trigger my memory when I revisit those notes later. However, if I want to be able to recall the content on the fly (without referencing my notes), it helps me to retype those quick notes later to engrain that content in my memory. I like to turn my handwritten shorthand into long form type. This forces me to remember the full experience and fill in the gaps in what I initially jotted down. This reprocessing step also helps me make connections and come up with new ideas that I may have missed when I was just focused on capturing the information during the initial note taking session. This two-step process reinforces the content in my mind not only because it forces me to review and engage with my initial notes, but also because writing and typing stimulate different parts of the brain. Challenging myself to record the same information in a variety of ways (eg quick hand written notes first, then typing them up later) ultimately helps me to better synthesize, understand and retain the material in the long run.
