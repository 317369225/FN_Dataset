Is there such a triangle whose vertices are on the regular hexagon (the point with label nearby) that all its edges are in the same colour?
The graph isn't a hexagon, it's the complete graph on 16 vertices whose edges have been colored in three colors. The coloring probably follows some logic that is not specified in the diagram, so verifying that no monochromatic triangle exists is a really tedious manual effort: we need to scan all 560 possible triangles. However, we can make an informed guess. Any such coloring of the complete graph on 17 vertices does contain a monochromatic triangle, while for 16 there do exist edge colorings that avoid a monochromatic triangle. Those two facts together are subsumed by the statement R(3,3,3)=17  where R(a,b,…)  is a Ramsey number. The statement about 17 is a pretty straightforward exercise, although it was an IMO problem in 1964.   Presumably the coloring depicted in the question is one of the many colorings of the edges of K 16   that avoids monochromatic triangles. However, again, without some efficient description of how the coloring was achieved, it's really hard to tell.
