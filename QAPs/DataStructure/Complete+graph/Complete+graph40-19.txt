What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
We will prove that n!≥2 n−1   for all n≥1  . We say that a permutation of the set {1,2,…,n}  is exciting if each entry is the highest number so far, or the lowest number so far. For example, the permutation (2,1,3) is exciting because 2 is a new high, 1 is a new low, and 3 is a new high. However, the permutation (1,3,2) is not exciting because 2 is neither a new high nor a new low. How many permutations of the set {1,2,…,n}  are exciting? Well, the last entry of an exciting permutation has to be 1 or n. In the former case, the remaining numbers must form an exciting permutation of {2,3,…,n}  , and in the latter case, the remaining numbers must form an exciting permutation of {1,2,…,n−1}  . This gives the following recurrence relation. Let E n   denote the number of exciting permutations of {1,2,…,n}  . Then E n =2E n−1   and E 1 =1  . It follows that there are 2 n−1   exciting permutations of {1,2,…,n}  . So the number of permutations that are not exciting is n!−2 n−1   . Since this is a non-negative integer, it follows that n!≥2 n−1   for all n≥1  . This is the long proof. The short proof is left as an exercise for the reader. Updated 13 Mar • View Upvotes
