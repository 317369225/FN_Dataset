What are some of the best mathematical games or puzzles you invented?I asked a similar question over here: Which mathematical game or puzzle did you invent? , but I didn't get any responses. I was wondering whether you invented a mathematical game or puzzle, but never published for some reason.
Mathematical Puzzle: Let ABC be a right angled triangle with hypotenuse BC, and AB not equal to AC. Points X and Y are located on sides AB and AC respectively such that AX = AY, and BX:XA = AY: YC. The intersection of lines XY and BC is point D. Is it possible for AB, AC, and AD to all have integer lengths, and if so, what is the smallest value that AD can have? Diviso is a mathematical deduction puzzle I'm working on. The puzzle is a sudoku variant, much like Ripple Effect, Tatami, etc. It takes place on an NxN latin square that you must complete given a few (perhaps no) numbers, and 'areas'. The areas, however, are usually of irregular shapes and sizes and sometimes may even be disjoint. The rules are: Every row and column contains the numbers 1-N once each. In each area, the smallest number present must divide the largest number present. It seems like a rather limiting concept but some interesting puzzles can be created, even in a 3x3 area. 4x4 is the most limiting size, but from 6x6 upwards very interesting possibilities for logical deductions are possible. Try this: AAB ABA CBC (note: each letter represents one area).
