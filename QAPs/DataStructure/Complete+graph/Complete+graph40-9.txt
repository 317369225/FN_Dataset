What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
ISTR an instance of well known mathematician, Frank Nelson Cole whose presentation to a conference consisted of going to the blackboard and writing two quite long numbers on the blackboard, then a third.  After he added an x and an =, the audience applauded.  The third number (stretching my memory a bit) was a well known  Mersenne Number which he was first to factor.
