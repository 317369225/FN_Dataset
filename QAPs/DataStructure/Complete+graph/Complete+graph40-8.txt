What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
Q: If three circles having the same radius pass through a point, the circle through their other three points of intersection also has the same radius. A: In the original picture the center points are missing. Let denote them K, L, M. Now it also might be important to indicate what distances are equal. For this is our data: the three circles all have the same radius. The nine equal segments appear to form a well known shape. It's a projection of a parallelepiped on a plane. Normally we would draw such a projection with three more edges that were hidden above. Now we have 12 equal segments. The newly drawn edges meet at a previously hidden vertex E which is equidistant from points A, B, and C. Credits: Three equal circles
