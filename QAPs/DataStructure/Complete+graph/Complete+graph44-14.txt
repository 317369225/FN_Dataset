What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
In 1990, as an employee of a U.S. company on a U.S. government agency contract, I was issued a workstation programmed from the kernel to the user level in Ada '83.  Since I came from a FORTRAN, C, and C++; and UNIX environment, I faced a steep learning curve. If you're familiar with the C-shell, imagine having an Ada-shell instead of a C-shell as your only available command-line shell.  Fortunately, two things happened: the agency eventually turned to C and C++, and I moved on to a different contract.  I gained some experience with Ada to enter commands on the command line and build a few sample programs.  That was it. I can't remember the name of the manufacturer of that workstation.  I couldn't  find anything on it, no matter how creative my internet searches were. Maybe it was just a nightmare!
