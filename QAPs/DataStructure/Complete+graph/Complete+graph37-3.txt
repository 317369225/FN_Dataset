Is it theoretically possible to construct a pathological graph that makes PageRank convergence very difficult, or even impossible?PageRank is an iterative algorithm, and it's generally terminated at some threshold when it's converged. But is it possible to construct a special or pathological graph that doesn't converge, perhaps because somehow the results can oscillate continuously?
