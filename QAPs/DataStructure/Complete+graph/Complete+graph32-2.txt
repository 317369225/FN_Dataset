Which are the most magical numbers?I will take any kind of magic. I was thinking of "especially cool" but any magical attribute or system is welcome.
3435 is the only number in base 10 that can be written as the sum of its digits raised to the power of its coefficient. ⇒3 3 +4 4 +3 3 +5 5 =3435  Edit: As Frank Helie rightly pointed out in the comments, 3435 is not a narcissistic number, but a Münchhausen number. Here's the difference: A narcissistic number is an n-digit number that can be represented as the sum of it's individual digits, each raised to the power of n. For example: 153=1 3 +5 3 +3 3   370=3 3 +7 3 +0 3   9474=9 4 +4 4 +7 4 +4 4   These numbers are different from Münchhausen Numbers which are equal to the sum of their digits raised to each digit's power. 3435 is one example. In fact, if we take 0 0   as undefined, the only two Münchhausen numbers are 1 and 3435.
