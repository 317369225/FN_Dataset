Do you remember notes better when they are typed or hand written?
I often times have this same problem of trying to remember what I just read. For me, writing them down opposed to just listening works best for me - I choose to type them because I can type faster. To remember information on certain subjects, I feel that the more I read on the subject, that eventually some of it will stick - which does work (just not nearly as much as I would like it to). I always take notes of this information but most of the time, I never go back and review these notes. To fix this problem (or to help it as much as I can) I use a website called Remember Note. It allows me to type in my favorite notes and motivational quotes, and then once a day it will randomly pick one of these notes and email it to me so I can remember it forever. I will usually have it open as a tab and as I read online articles, a book, or hear a motivational quote I want to remember, I will enter (or copy and paste) it into Remember Note along with the link of where I got the information. Yes --> I created this website but I really do believe it is a great solution to this problem and has already helped me remember and live by certain motivational quotes and remember information from inspiring talks.
