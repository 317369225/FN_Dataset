What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
The Lucid Dataflow language is my candidate for most esoteric: Lucid (programming language) In this language every variable is a stream of values. The equation for a variable can be defined using values later in the stream. From the wiki page: running_avg where sum = first(input) fby sum + next(input); n = 1 fby n + 1; running_avg = sum / n; end; In this running_avg program, the first value in the 'sum' variable stream is defined as the first value of 'input'. The k+1-st value of 'sum' is defined as theÂ  kth value of 'sum' + then k+1-st value of 'input' (I think). Clearly, I always found the manipulation of values in the variable streams very confusing.
