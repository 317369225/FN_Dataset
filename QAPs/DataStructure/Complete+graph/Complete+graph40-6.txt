What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
Consider the Farey sequence, which is all fractions between 0 and 1 with denominator ≤n  . For example, for n=5: 01 ,15 ,14 ,13 ,25 ,12 ,35 ,23 ,34 ,45 ,11   Theorem. For any two consecutive fractions a/b and c/d of the Farey sequence, bc-ad=1. For example, 1/2 and 3/5 are consecutive, and 2⋅3−1⋅5=1  . This has the interesting consequence that if we take the differences of consecutive elements of the Farey sequence, all the numerators will be 1: 15 ,120 ,112 ,115 ,110 ,110 ,115 ,112 ,120 ,15   Proof. Draw the triangle with coordinates (0,0), (a,b), and (c,d). The area of this triangle is 12 (bc−ad)  by taking the cross product. By Pick's theorem, the area of the triangle is 1/2, since it has no interior points. (Such a point (e,f) would come between a/b < e/f < c/d.) Hence bc-ad=1.
