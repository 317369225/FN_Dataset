Im planing to make a metro route app which will display the shortest path between two given stations. So should i use tree and dijkstra's shortest path algorithm ? Is there any easier way?
Since, you are dealing with distances only and they will only be positive, Dijkstra will work. Since, its a metro route app, and I hope the distances between the stations are not changing, you can pre-compute all the pair wise shortest path lengths and store it in memory and whenever a query is asked, you can return the answer. You can do the pre-computation as follows: For all the vertices (metro stations) in the map one by one, run Dijkstra's Algorithm, don't terminate the algorithm unless you have computed the shortest distance for all other stations from this station. This way, running Dijkstra N(the number of stations) times, you can compute the shortest distance matrix.
