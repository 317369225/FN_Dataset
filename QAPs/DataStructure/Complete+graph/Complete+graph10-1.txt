What is the expected number of steps needed for an entity with no memory to traverse a 4 node complete graph?You have a rabbit (dark grey) with no memory on one node of a four node graph. The rabbit can take any path (with equal probability) but once at the new node doesn't remember the path he took to get there. What is the number of expected steps (paths taken) before the rabbit has visited every node.
I assume you mean that the rabbit traverses a single edge with each step, with a uniform distribution over all of the nodes the rabbit is not currently on? At any moment, if there are M nodes left unseen, out of N nodes the rabbit might jump to, there is a probability M/N of seeing a new node on the next step. From this, we find that the average number of steps until first seeing a new node will be N/M (by the same reasoning as in What is the mean number of times a person can play Russian roulette before dying?). Thus, the average number of steps till the rabbit has seen all 3 nodes other than the starting node will be 3/3 + 3/2 + 3/1 = 5.5.
