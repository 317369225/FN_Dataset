How can I draw a complete graph of six vertices with the least amount of crossings and how do I prove it is the least?
I would not know how to prove it, but according to The Crossing Number of the Complete Graph the graph K6 can be drawn with 3 crossings (the link has a conjecture which is shown to hold for n<11). To draw K6 with 3 crossings, draw K5 with one, and then add a vertex inside the remaining triangle
