What are some unsolved problems in math which seem easy at first glance?An example of this would be the collatz conjecture.
Originally Answered: What are some open math questions/problems that look simple but have not yet been proven?A favorite of mine is the Collatz conjecture (sometimes called the hailstone problem). Define f(n)  to be n/2  if n  is even, or 3n+1  if n  is odd. If you begin with any positive integer n  and replace it repeatedly with f(n)  , will you eventually reach 1  ? I like this problem because it is great for many levels of students. I've asked this question to a classroom of seven-year olds, who were immediately hooked by how fun it was to generate examples (and amazed that they couldn't find a counterexample). And there are lots of small theorems and partial results, so even children can sink their teeth into it and discover interesting things (for example: how many times in a row can the sequence go up-and-then-down?). At the other end, it has inspired quite a lot of interesting research mathematics.
