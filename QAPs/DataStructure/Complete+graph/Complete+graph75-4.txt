What are the most ingenious theorems/deductions in graph theory?
One of the most fundamental and ingenious results in graph theory and infact all of discrete mathematics is the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma[1]. It was originally advanced as an auxiliary result to prove a long standing conjecture of Erdős and Turán from 1936 (on the Ramsey properties of arithmetic progressions), which stated that sequences of integers with postive upper density must ALWAYS contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions (now called as Szemeredi's theorem (1978) [2]). Now the regularity lemma by itself is considered as one of the most important tools in graph theory.   Statement: Very roughly the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma states that: Every graph can be approximated by random graphs. This is in the sense that every graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of equal parts such that: 1. Most edges run BETWEEN different parts 2. And that these edges behave as if generated at random. The fundamental nature of the Regularity Lemma as a tool in Graph Theory (and beyond) could be understood by the fact that two recent Fields Medals (Timothy Gowers, 1998 and Terence Tao, 2006) were awarded atleast in part for achieving breakthrough results on the regularity lemma and using those to prove fundamental results on arithmetic progressions (Such as the Green-Tao Theorem[3]). Expanding upon the the rough statement above, basically the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma asserts the following: If we have a graph, then there exists a partition of its vertex set into k  disjoint classes. These k classes could be thought of as  k C 2   pairs (bipartite graphs). Such that the edges between these bipartite graphs behave at random in all but ϵk 2   pairs. (where \epsilon is a small number. A typical value is 1/16). To roughly sketch how the regularity lemma works we introduce some definitions first: Definition 1: If G=(V,E)  is a graph and A,B  are disjoint subsets of V  . Then, we denote the number of edges with one endpoint in A  and another in B  by e(A,B)  . When A  and B  are non-empty we define the density of edges between A  and B  as d(A,B)=e(A,B)|A||B|   . This just defines the edge density in a bipartite graph. Definition 2: The bipartite graph G=(A,B,E)  is called ϵ  -regular if for every X⊂A  and Y⊂B  satisfying |X|>ϵ|A|,|Y|>ϵ|B|  we would have: |d(X,Y)−d(A,B)|<ϵ  This means that a bipartite graph is epsilon regular IF we take any random subets (X and Y) of A and B and even then edge density between these subsets is almost the same as the edge density in the original bipartite graph. In effect this implies that if a bipartite graph is epsilon regular then all the edges between the the two disjoint sets are distributed uniformly.   Definition 3: An equitable partition of the vertex set V  of a graph G=(V,E)  is a partition of V  such that all the partitions C 0 ,C 1 ,…,C k   are pairwise disjoint. And that all C i   with 1≤i≤k  have the same cardinality. C 0   is called the exceptional set and is only present for technical reasons (to ensure that all the partitions have the same cardinality). Defnition 4: For every equitable partition P  of the vertex set V  of G=(V,E)  into classes C 0 ,C 1 ,…,C k   , we associate a measure called the index of the partition (also called as potential) of P  defined as: ind(P)=1k 2  ∑ 1≤r<s≤k d(C r ,C s ) 2   This just defines a measure of how close the the entire set of partitions is close to being epsilon regular. Starting from an initial random partition of the vertex set we iteratively refine the partitions in such a way that the potential increases significantly until we reach a partition which is epsilon regular (a partition (note that we don't define this for a bipartite graph, but for an entire partition) is said to be epsilon regular if all but ϵk 2   pairs of classes are ϵ  - regular). One problem is that in each iteration the number of subsets (or classes) increases exponentially and we eventually end with a partition such that the number of classes is a tetration. For a long time it was thought that maybe the tower function is not necessary. But in a remarkable paper Timothy Gowers constructed graphs[4] in which a tower function was indeed found to be necessary. The original result by Szemeredi was an existential predicate. It did not give a method to obtain a regular partition of a graph but only asserted that one should exist. Two constructive versions were proposed much later by Alon et al.
