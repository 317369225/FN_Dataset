Do you remember notes better when they are typed or hand written?
Ooh, good one. I suspect it varies with the individual; for me, it depends. As a general rule, when I'm jotting down notes to remind myself of something it's better when I handwrite them. I'm not sure why; I think it has to do with the fact that forming letters with a pen means my fingers are performing a subtly different task with each word I write, and it helps those words stick in my head better. It's a more mnemonic process than typing. However when I'm making notes as part of working out / working through something it's better when I type. It feels as though typing is better for organising ideas, but writing is better for remembering ideas. Case in point: I'm working on a novel right now (early stages), and have a notebook on hand for the eureka moments - key characters, plot twists, major themes, names, etc. Somehow if I first record those ideas by typing them they sort of disappear out of my head and never get developed, even if I read the typed notes over. Today, though, I've been working through how it all will actually fit together in the story (this sojourn on Quora is a quick brain-break), and I find that has to be typed ... I tried using the notebook for the detailed notes on character development, story arc, narrative etc. and it just didn't work for me. I felt I was putting effort into the recording at the expense of the thinking.
