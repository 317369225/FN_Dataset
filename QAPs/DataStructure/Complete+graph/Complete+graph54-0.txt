What are some simply stated problems in graph theory or  combinatorics for undergraduates?By simply stated I mean the problem statement is (almost) understandable using undergraduate curricula level knowledge and a bit of Google. Simple words and problems which can be easily understood will be appreciated.
The easiest problem, in terms of question statement is the ramsey theory problem, although the solution(s) to Ramsey theory questions can actually be quite complex, the question is very simple.  Say you are at a party; a collection of people that either know each other or don't know each other( a binary situation). Now having a yes or no situation, how many people are required, so that n number of people are guaranteed to either know or not know each other( in this example).Using a complete graph, a graph in which every vertex is adjacent(connected) to every other vertex in the graph(these are the graphs used in Ramsey theory situations), let's start with n = 3. Ramsey numbers aren't described as the lowest number where it is possible for the condition to become true, because this would be the complete graph K_3, and we'd be done. So we expand the graph to K_4(the complete graph on 4 vertices). Checking, yes it is possible, to create a graph on 4 vertices where three of the people don't know each other, but it is not guaranteed that this condition will be met, so we increase the size to 5 vertices. We apply the same concept as with 4 and reach the same conclusion, it is not possible to create a complete graph on 5 vertices where 3 people will either know or not know each other. Finally, we move to 6 vertices. We start at one person denoted {1},and draw a connection between them and one other{2}, say they know each other. Now, we go from {1} to another person{3}, they also know each other. Finally, we go from {1} to one other person, {4}. We are trying to avoid three people knowing any other three people, so {2} cannot know {3}, similarly, {3} cannot know {4}. Also, {2} cannot know {4} because otherwise 3 people, would know each other. In doing this though, we've shown that three people don't know each other, thus the Ramsey number of 3 is 6, or in standard notation, R(3,3) = 6 The proof on Wikipedia is satisfactory and is probably easier to follow as i've made a few changes to the language in order to make this proof more accessible. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram... This is just my experience and was the first problem presented to me by my undergraduate research advisor. If anyone has another idea or if this is not what you wanted, just let me know and i'll do my best to make adjustments or add another answer entireley until you're satisfied.
