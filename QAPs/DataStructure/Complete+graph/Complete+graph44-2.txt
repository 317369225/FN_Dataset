What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
APL was sometimes said to be the only language where randomly pressing characters on the keyboard would produce a meaningful program. The language contained a large number of unconventional symbols that modern keyboards lack, each symbol poduced a complex action that in a normal languuage would require many line of code. An example would be +/A which sums all the elements in the array A (*/A multiplies all the elements in A). You could combine multiple actions on a single line. I once wrote a procedure to convert an array to ranks (adjusting for ties) using just a few consecutive symbols. The university I was at used to hold contests to see who could create the most sophisticated program in a single line. I recall seeing a complete graphing procedure (ASCII text graph) in a single line.  Of course, such procedures were unreadable. You could write conventional procedures in APL if you wished. The syntax resembled BASIC, complete with line numbers. There were no data types; everything was effectively a variant.  APL was pushed by IBM in the 1970's. Programmers worked from a teletype machine. No monitors, just an endless roll of paper.  Every teletype machine was connected via a telephone handset to a single mainframe.
