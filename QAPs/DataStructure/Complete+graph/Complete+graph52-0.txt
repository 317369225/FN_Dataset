Given a random sequence of the nine digits 1 to 9, what is the probability that no two adjacent numbers will differ by 1?Assume that 1 and 9 differ by 1.
I don't have a complete answer, but here's a reduction to a problem that's likely solved elsewhere.  Take the complete graph on 9 vertices and delete all the edges of the form (i,(i+1) mod 9)  .  Now the number of sequences with the properties you want is equal to the number of simple Hamiltonian paths in this graph.
