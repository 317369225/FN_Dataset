What is the most esoteric programming language that you have tried?How did you learn about that programming language? What made you try programming using that language? Did you like programming using that language? Describe your experience.
AMDASM.  It's a micro-assembler, or meta-assembler, used to specify microcode that will directly operate the control points inside a CPU, thereby implementing its instruction set or other behaviors.  Advanced Micro Devices provided it so you could make a CPU out of their 2900 family bit-slice CPU parts, but you could use it to create any pattern of bits you wanted.  The assembler ran from a floppy disk on an 8-bit CP/M machine.  I've implemented a "CISC" instruction set CPU and a real-time machine controller in AMDASM.  Not sure what I'd use today for the same job.
