What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?Especially for easier concepts.
The following comes from the section "jokes" of András Gyárfás's notes for a combinatorics course in Budapest; I'm not sure of the original source. Theorem: If A and B are two finite sets such that |B|  is larger than (|A|2)  , then there exists a one-to-one (i.e. injective) function from A to B. Proof: For each element of a∈A  , choose a random element f(a)∈B  . There are |B| |A|   functions you could obtain this way, and each one is equally likely. Given any two elements a 1 ,a 2 ∈A  , the probability that f(a 1 )=f(a 2 )  is 1/|B|  . There are (|A|2)  such pairs, so the probability that at least one pair is mapped to a single value is at most (|A|2)/|B|  . This is less than 1, so there is a nonzero probability that the function is one-to-one. □  The notes then go one to point out that one can apply the Lovász Local Lemma to obtain an even stronger result: even |B|≥8|A|  is sufficient!
