What is the difference between a complete graph and a dense graph?
Graph density is a spectrum from completely unconnected, ie no edges, to completely connected, ie all edges that can exist do exist. A complete graph is therefore the most dense graph and is not a subjective evaluation, whereas a dense graph in one context can be sparse in another depending on the perspective of the observer.
