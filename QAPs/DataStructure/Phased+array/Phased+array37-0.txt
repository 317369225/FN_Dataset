What's the future of space tourism?
Well until we can overcome some fundamental physical limits (see http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S... and http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T... ), it is always going to be massively expensive to lift any reasonable payload into space. With the shuttle we could lift payloads the size of a school bus, not the size of even a small airliner. And of course that is now long gone. This means that building a place in orbit for humans to live and work or relax is going to be an effort of many years and many trillions of dollars. A group of countries collaborated to build the ISS and while it is bigger than a football field in area, the living quarters are pretty slim.  It is dedicated to scientific exploration, not tourism.  The hard bitten few ultra-rich individuals who have paid their way probably had a fantastic time, but that's all it will be for the foreseeable future. If you're imagining a Hilton Resort in space like in the movies, forget it. You can see 1:1 size mockups of all the ISS modules for yourself at the JSC in Houston. I highly recommend taking the tour  if you ever get the opportunity. It's the closest any of us plebs will get to it.
