What's the future of space tourism?
External Propulsion: Escape Dynamics. Chemical Rockets will forever be limited to about 3% payload mass fraction, leaving them dangerous and expensive. Companies like Space X are doing ROCKINGLY well! And will bring the costs down from recently $50,000 per kilo, to $5,000 per kilo, Perhaps a bit lower even. But external propulsion is finally coming to reality. My wife's company Escape Dynamics, is taking (renewable) grid electricity, storing it in batteries, discharging that power rapidly into High Power Microwave Gyrotrons, Microwave Energy is safely beamed via a phased array of side lobe suppressing radomes, to a heat exchanger on the belly of a modest space plane. That heat expand (no combustion) a gas (hydrogen) that flows through the heat exchanger and out an aerospike nossel. This gives high enough ISP for Single Stage to Orbit, and drops the price per kilo down to below $250 at high flight rates. So... don't give up hope! That calculates to only about $15k per person to orbit or any far spot on earth through space.
