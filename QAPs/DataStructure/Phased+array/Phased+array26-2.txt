How can gravity be simulated in deep space?
Generating artificial gravity has always been a concern for extended space travel involving humans. As Paul Robert commented, the usual way (as if there is a usual way, since it has never been done) is to spin something. Then centripetal force will tend to accelerate everything near the outer edge, thus simulating gravity. But it's not that simple... For one, generally you will need some part of your spacecraft that is not spinning. This is needed for a few reasons, but most especially for communications. Deep space requires directional antennas in order to communicate over long distances. If the entire spacecraft is rotating, where would you mount the antenna? Also, if the entire spacecraft is spinning, propulsion becomes a problem. What if you decide that you need to adjust course teen degrees to the left? You would have to stop the rotation, align your engines, and then make the course correction. Then, if you have rotating and non-rotating parts, you have to have an airtight bearing between them that is designed to last X number of years without failure. Another problem is that unless the spinning module is very large, there will be a distinct gravity gradient. The gravity will be stronger at the outer edge, and zero at the middle. If the module is, say, three meters radius, and you are standing at the outer edge, your feet will feel the full effect, while your head will be almost weightless, which might be rather disconcerting. In any case, while is is possible to create artificial gravity, there's still a lot of kinks to work out.
