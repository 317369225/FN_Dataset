Do engineers need to know Fourier analysis?
My brother-in-law was discussing a mutual friend. He said "He's so good with his hands; he would have been a great engineer." My brother-in-law had entirely missed the intellectual side of this little hobby that we call engineering. We enlarge upon our intuitive sense of a particular field with our ability to manage the theoretical stuff which usually includes analytical (largely mathematical) work. Fourier analysis is a tremendous help for dealing with dynamic processes. Beyond fourier analysis lie fourier transforms and digital signal processing - the tools to enter a magical world of analysis and design with applications to all kinds of things. Are there branches of engineering for which this isn't needed? Of course. A civil engineer who spends his.her professional time doing surveys, for example, might never need the fruits of Fourier's genius - not after the last final exam. The debate about what constitutes a fully educated engineer isn't dissimilar to the debate about what constitutes a fully educated professional in any other area. Should a lawyer know latin? Should a doctor - one who will specialize in hand surgery - know languages? The current consensus in education is that professionals need to be "well rounded" and need some kinds of knowledge that may not be directly applicable in day to day work. As I participate in the back and forth of a question about engineering on Quora, I ask myself if I would be able to participate effectively had my education been restricted to that which was merely necessary to function at the lowest level for my profession. I doubt it. MISTER SciencAintsoBad http://scienceaintsobad.com Updated 26w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
