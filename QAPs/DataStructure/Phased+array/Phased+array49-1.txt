What are some rocking facts about India's INS Kolkata?
INS Kolkota is a sitting duck. It has no LR-SAM. (Barak 8 is still under development and will not be available for 2 years). It has no Towed Sonar.Â  (There are 10 year old warships more advanced than INS kolkota). It has a Smaller gun than even the Delhi class destroyer. It's Turbines are from Ukraine and spares will soon be in short supply. It has less SAM cells than the older gen destroyers or even Frigates. It has a 16 cell VLS(vertical launch system) for Brahmos. To compare, a US Aegis class has a 96 cell VLS. So, when the PM says no one will dare challenge Indian Navy, simply dismiss it as chest beating propoganda. This ship will not be combat ready for another 3 years!
