When isn't radar safe?
Oops! Hit wrong button. I'm not nor have I taken the health physics class on this, but basically when you stand near a fairly high powered beam. Such an antenna will generally have a posted sign when operating. I think the other posters have given fine answers. I think small simple radars on police speed guns and autonomous cars are pretty low powered.
