Can a phased array evoke a standing wave at a focal point that has a much higher frequency that the constituent emitted frequencies?
Put simply - the only way I understand, a phased array works by adjusting the phase of the signal to each aerial so that the output is in phase in an intended direction. By varying the phase angle of each aerial with regard to a reference you can effectively sweep the beam across the sky at very high speeds. This enables you with one dish to sweep the sky and then focus on possible targets to get a detailed analysis of the world about you. If you adjust the phase angle of some of the aerials so that they are no longer in phase (but still at the same frequency) in the desired direction you may get a beam in another direction or nothing. I think you may have omitted the point that the phase angle of each element in a phased array is effectively separately controlled, so your question is actually somewhat similar to what goes on anyway. If there are any higher frequencies they are too small to be measured and unwanted.
