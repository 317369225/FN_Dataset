Is it possible to use some sort of phased-array antenna to beam signals to the t-coil in a hearing aid with the same results if the signal was put through a typical hearing loop?
Don't think you need anything so fancy as a phased array. The t-coil is a magnetic device, and the 'loop' sets up a magnetic field which varies with the audio signal. Big coil would work provided it was driven by the audio source, perhaps through an amplifier to drive the coil. The problem of course is that the audio quality may not be such that the hard of hearing person would be able to 'hear' the audio correctly. Better would be a bluetooth or 802.11 type device pair which connects the audio to the hearing aid, via radio, at cheaper prices that what is available typically from the hearing aid manufacturer.
