What's the future of space tourism?
I just don't see it happening in any large scale way unless we come up with a real breakthrough in launch technologies. It's an expensive and dangerous business to get things to space. There will still be people who will do it, and probably enough to keep one or two outfits going. Look at people who'll pay 100 grand (or something like that)Â  and face a 1-in-5 fatality rate for the chance to climb Annapurna I. Taking a sub-orbital hop or going to orbit will cost a lot more and be less taxing and less dangerous than that. It'll be a long time before we see the same kind of thing as hopping a plane to Paradise for week's vacation. I'm not sure it'll ever be that way.
