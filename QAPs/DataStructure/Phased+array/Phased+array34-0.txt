What do average people think about their extremely intelligent friends?
I am impressed by their intelligence and surprised by its constraints. All the super-smart people are able to apply their gifts in some areas but not others. I'm not sure why this surprises me, since I'm the same way. I'm not super-intelligent, but what smarts I have serve me way better in some spheres than others.
