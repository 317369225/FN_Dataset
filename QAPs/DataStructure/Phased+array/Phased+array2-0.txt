What components are needed to build an active phased array (bill of materials)?
(Firstly, I've never built one so I can't confirm but I have studied them and worked extensively with complex RF systems) Phased arrays depend on two or more elements been combined so that the constructive interference effects can be exploited. Each receive element might have an LNA to negate later noise effects. You then need to adjust the phase of the signal for each element, so you need n-1 phase shifters. After the phase shift you then need to combine the n-signals together using multiple combiner ICs. The phase shifters need to be controlled accurately enough to set the angle of discrimination, this is the biggest challenge. When combined together and each antenna element calibrated it should create an active phased array. The phase of the signal path and the overall system noise needs to be carefully designed.
