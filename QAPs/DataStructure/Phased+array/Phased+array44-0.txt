Satcom:Â Is it possible for a civilian to utilize government satellites to communicate with a server from a homemade device?
Military satellites generally use exotic frequencies but getting the equipment isn't impossible. It is more about the information, knowing the positions, frequencies and specifications. Additionally if you did use someone else's satellite without permission they might get quite upset, I prefer not to upset the military! As for Tony Stark, he is a billionaire military contractor, perhaps he has his own network of satellites? But otherwise he could easily use other satellites relatively easily. The problem is bandwidth, Jarvis needs quite a bit of bandwidth for sensor data. Having that requirement probably means a decent size antenna and it would probably have to be a phased array (very expensive but that is no problem). The phased array would perhaps impact the armour integrity and/or be vulnerable to damage in combat. With commercial phone satellites you can get 1Mbit/sec over most land masses and 19.2kbps everywhere else. Add in Ka-Band and you get huge amounts of bandwidth but only over certain landmasses. Even the military doesn't concentrate high bandwidth over unimportant areas like oceans.
