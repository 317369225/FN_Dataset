How is radio astronomy related to electrical and electronics engineering?
Let's start with what a radio telescope is. Radio telescope has the following main elements, Antenna Receiver Signal processing Output recorders Antenna is the huge dish we see in radio telescope photos. Even Dipole antennas are used to collect the radio waves. This is where Mechanical Engineering is required. Receiver is also called as feedhorn. That is the thing which is hanging at the focus of the parabolic reflector dish. Receivers have a lot of complex electronic circuits to make them work effectively. Basically, they contain different filters and amplifiers. Electronic Engineers are required here. Signal Processing blocks contain the heart of a radio telescope system. They may consist of correlation circuits, amplifiers and data converters. Even here Electronic Engineers are required. Output Recorders consist of the systems that record and save the data. These could be huge data servers. This is where we need Computer Engineers. Physicists are just the small amount of people who tell the operator, most probably an engineer, to point the dish towards a source.
