Military Strategy: How useful is a Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea?
Good question.  If the US or some other allied country had access to air bases in Vietnam or Luzon, than a carrier group probably does not add much value. The US could hit targets in the PRC or sink any Chinese ships in the SCS from these ground bases. If the US decided to remain neutral, than a carrier group could be helpful to a nation trying to block a Chinese invasion.  A US carrier air wing typically includes airborne early warning aircraft that can detect and track aircraft at a range of over 300 miles.  A neutral US could use these aircraft to track Chinese ships and planes, and share this information with an ally at war with China.  A carrier group also has several ships with powerful phased array radars.  These radars could be used to jam key Chinese radio frequencies.  A US carrier battle group stationed 20 miles off the south coast of Hainan Island would create real problems for a Chinese military operation in the SCS.  The US would detect the attack as soon as the first aircraft took off.  Without the element of surprise, the Chinese would take heavy losses.  At 20 miles, China could easily sink the US carrier, but doing so would risk war with a nuclear armed country and major trading partner.
