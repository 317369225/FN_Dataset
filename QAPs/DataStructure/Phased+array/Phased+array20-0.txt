Why is anti-aircraft artillery used? Aren't machine guns better? Is the artillery (flak) used when the machine guns are out of range? In general, the larger the shell, the further it will go. The German 88 mm Flugzeugabwehrkanone from which "flak" is derived had an effective range of 25,000 ft altitude. American 5" (127mm) naval cannon were used extensively in the Pacific War for antiaircraft defense (effective to 37,000 ft altitude). When fitted with proximity fuzes, they were particularly lethal. In WW2, ships had a layered defense which started with the 5" guns, closer in the 40 mm guns were used and very close in, 20 mm, 0.50 cal, and 0.30 cal weapons were used. As the caliber of the weapon decreased, its effective range compared to larger caliber decreased as well. Subsequent to World War 2, terminally homing guided missiles stood a better chance of shooting down a fast flying jet at longer ranges. The Flak 88 could only reach to 25,000 ft. Terminally homing radar guided missiles can shoot down aircraft at 70,000 ft (or higher). Still, for close in defense, radar directed 20 and 40 mm fast firing "flak" guns with proximity fuzed shells are still used and still deadly. They can put up a lot of steel that explodes in the general area of the jet. It is even more deadly for helicopters. A good example of this type of weapon is the Russian ZSU23.
