What is the significance of BARAK 8 missile?
It is the Indian Navy's first long -range SAM It will have the ability to intercept any flying object from drones to fighter jets to supersonic cruise missiles up to a range of 90 km It has an active-radar seeker which means that the ship-borne MF-STAR radar has to just tell the missile where to go and the missile will go and engage the target. That means there is no need for the radar on the ship to guide the missile till it hits the target. This missile has a minimum range of 500 m and can destroy targets close to the ship as well. Other long range SAMs have a minimum range of 3-4 km Barak-8 will be the standard fit on new Indian Navy destroyers, frigates and carriers Israel will use it on their Sa'ar 5 and SA'ar 6 class corvettes. Here is a pic of the recent test It is extremely accurate and can destroy it's target by direct impact instead of exploding near it The IAF will also procure a variant of this missile to protect our airspace
