How can gravity be simulated in deep space?
There are two main ways. Constantly accelerate or decelerate. If you have a powerful enough engine, or are happy with weak gravity. This was used in the comic Tintin Destination Moon. But chemical rockets could do this for no more than an hour before fuel was exhausted. Spin the spacecraft. For non battle star galactica models, the most practical way to do this is to tether the spacecraft to a twin or an expended booster and let it turn. Provided the spin axis points at the earth, the coms dish doesn't have to move. Failing that, a synthetic high gain antenna using a phased array is possible. Course corrections are not impossible, but require low thrust and careful timing. The Apollo space craft turned to even out solar heating without suffering any off these problems. Untethered EVA, especially on the underside, would be risky if not impossible.
