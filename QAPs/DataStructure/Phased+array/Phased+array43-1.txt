Can you construct a spherical wave as a sum of plane waves?
Can you construct a spherical wave as a sum of plane waves? In addition to Nikita Butakov's excellent answer, I would point out that humanity has gotten very good at making the kinds of wave manipulations you are describing. Examples of wavefront manipulation include phased array radars, where the sum of thousands of tiny emitters are aligned in phase to create a plane wave or a spherical wave. Synthetic aperture radar does the same thing and uses the airplanes motion to provide sharper definition. Adaptive optics are used in terrestrial telescopes to measure the distortion in light from a star due to the atmosphere. A compensating wavefront is then calculated and applied in real time to a mirror, which restores the plane wave nature of the star's light. None of this would have been possible 40 years ago. It depends upon cheap and powerful computers to perform the magic.
