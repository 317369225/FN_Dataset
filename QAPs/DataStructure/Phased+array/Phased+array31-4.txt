What technological advancements came out of the Soviet military?
The Soviets were ahead of NATO in their appreciation of the damaging effects of the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) produced by air-burst nuclear weapons.Â  They produced EMP-hardened electronics based on micro-diode technology rather than EMP vulnerable silicon. This technology was discovered in the west only when a Soviet Air Force pilot defected (to Japan I think) with his aeroplane.
