I was thinking, what if interstellar space exploration was being tackled wrong. What if we used tiny satellites (the size of a coin) and accelerated them to half the speed of light around the Sun's gravitational pull? Is it possible?
It is true what Gabriel says that a interstellar space probe of the size of a coin would be useless. However matters will be different for a probe of the weight of a coin but a large surface, composed out of, say 40nm-thickness membranes and filaments. Also the problem of communicating with such a probe from and to earth is not as hopeless, since one could start a probe, say, every year, establishing a chain. Accelerating anything macroscopic to 50% c is a task that is not even remotely possible with any existing technology. However, again, small objects with a large surface have an advantage here: they are much easier to cool by thermal radiation. A main obstacle to accelerating a probe to such speeds is the waste heat produced by the drive in connection with the fact that the probe will only be able to cool itself by thermal radiation. (Any other cooling would result in an inacceptable mass loss rate). Even with an excellent efficiency of 90%, the drive mechanism will heat up the probe to an unacceptable temperature. The heating problem is hard. The basic rocket equation tells us that in order to reach a velocity, we have to push out a particle stream with roughly that velocity. This requires an enormous energy. It passive (external) acceleration has its own problems. Nuclear energy sources, which we have to rely on because of their high energy density are particularly inefficient.  The suggestion is a good one, because small high-surface probes will be less affected by the the heating problem, which is really, really scary, and the problems to ensure the probe's function and abilty to communicate appear almost achievable in comparison.   I stop short of saying: if it is possible at all, a fleet of small probes is the way forward.
