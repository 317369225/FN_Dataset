What operating system is considered the most secure?
The  most secure operating system I know of today, which is commercially  available is called INTEGRITY®-178B RTOS by a company called Greenhills  Software. It is CC rated at EAL6+ which is the highest rated OS I'm aware of. It is this type of operating system that I would trust to run a passenger jet that I'm willing to board. http://www.ghs.com/products/safe... Green Hills software is used on board some of the following: The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Airbus A380 US Navy Phased Array Radar systems Bombardier High Speed Trains Japanese JAXA Launch Vehicles (rockets)
