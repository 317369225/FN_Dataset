Is it possible to use some sort of phased-array antenna to beam signals to the t-coil in a hearing aid with the same results if the signal was put through a typical hearing loop?
T-coils operate at audio frequencies. At 20 Khz, the wavelength for RF is 15 km, lower frequencies will have longer wavelengths. This puts the math very much in the "near field". Wikipedia's description of near and far field This just means that you will want to model your phased array of coils as a very complex transformer, rather than as a phased array antenna. The math is somewhat different. Phased arrays of coils are certainly possible. It will take a huge array to get much of a "beam".
