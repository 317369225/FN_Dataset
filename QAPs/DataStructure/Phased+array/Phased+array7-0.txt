What is photonic radar technology? Specifically, radio optical phased array antenna aka ROFAR?
Photonic radar is in its rudimentary stages of development. They use laser pulses for detection instead of conventional EM waves. This helps in better tracking of objects especially with the speed calculation of moving objects. The problems associated with these type of radar systems are range that could be covered (is lesser than conventional radar) and phase noise. But usage of laser pulses results in ultra high bandwidth (hence huge amount of information) and reduction in the size of the antennas. Now radio optical phases arrays are such small antennas placed periodically on a lattice. The magnitude and phase of the current fed to these antennas are varied to scan the beam in different directions. These antennas are basically photonic emitters that emit lasers instead of EM waves.
