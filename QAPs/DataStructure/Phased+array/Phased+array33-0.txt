What is HAARP?
I think their own web page puts it pretty clearly: The High frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) is a program focused on the study of upper atmospheric and solar-terrestrial physics and Radio Science. The HAARP program operates a major Arctic ionosphere research facility on an Air Force owned site near Gakona, Alaska. Principal instruments installed at the HAARP Research Station include a high power, high-frequency (HF) phased array radio transmitter (known as the Ionosphere Research Instrument (IRI), used to stimulate small, well-defined volumes of ionosphere, and a large and diversified suite of modern geophysical research instruments including an HF ionosonde, ELF and VLF receivers, magnetometers, riometers, a UHF diagnostic radar and optical and infrared spectrometers and cameras which are used to observe the complex natural variations of Alaska's ionosphere as well as to detect artificial effects produced by the IRI. Future plans include completion of the UHF radar to allow measurement of electron densities, electron and ion temperatures, and Doppler velocities in the stimulated region and in the natural ionosphere using incoherent scatter techniques. http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haar... In other words: they pump a lot of energy into the sky ("a lot" in human terms, not in nature's terms) to explore the ionosphere, a layer of ionized atoms in the atmosphere that starts around 85 km up.  This layer is useful, because it reflects radio waves, allowing radio transmissions to be transferred further than line-of-sight.  It also helps protect the earth from charged cosmic rays. The communications aspect is the reason HAARP is funded, because of the military applications of being able to use the ionosphere to communicate.  The combination of "high energy" and "military" and "science" serves to inspire much paranoia.
