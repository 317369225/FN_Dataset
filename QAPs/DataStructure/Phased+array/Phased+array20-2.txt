Why is anti-aircraft artillery used? Aren't machine guns better? Is the artillery (flak) used when the machine guns are out of range?
Both anti-aircraft artillery and machine guns have become obsolete since aircraft became jet-propelled. They fly too fast and too high for bullets and shells. Modern air defense is all about missiles. Flak guns were indeed used when machine guns were out of range.
