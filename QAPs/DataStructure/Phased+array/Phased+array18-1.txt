What are the risks of solar satellites beaming energy to Earth? How beneficial can they be? Is there a programme going on to prepare to deploy them?
It's a really silly idea, mainly promoted by the aerospace industry. If you do a simple economic and efficiency analysis, you find that it's about 100 times cheaper to set up the solar panels on the ground.    And more reliable.   And much less risk of failure.  And much less dangerous.  As a baseline, lofting up a square meter panel that weighs a pound is going to cost about $5,000.  From that you get about 200 watts DC peak, 50 watts average.  Convert that to microwaves and beam it down and you might get 5 watts DC.   5 watts over a year is 40 kilowatt-hours, about $4.  There is no way to pay back the $5,000 lifting cost, plus the cost of all the surrounding infrastructure, at a rate of $4 a year payback.  It's a factor of 100 too expensive, and not likely to change much.
