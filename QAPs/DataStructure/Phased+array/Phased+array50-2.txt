How is it possible to identify the location of an RF transmitter?
You need to know how far and in what direction the transmitter is. If you take a directional antenna and adjust its position until you get maximum signal you can triangulate the position of the transmitter (by checking the angle from two known measurement positions). Alternatively if you don't want to use a directional antenna you can instead use a system called a phased array. Two antennas separated by some distance, one has a device which introduces a small phase delay into the signal then the two signals are combined. The phase is then adjusted until the signal is at maximum. This then tells you the angle of the target receiver. Using three or four of these antennas in a small array allows you to specifically target the receiver without much mechanical movement. When using software phase analysis instead of just a simple delay you can get very sophisticated analysis including if the transmitter is moving and at what speed.
