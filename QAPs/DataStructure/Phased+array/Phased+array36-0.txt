What is the mesh grid above the bridge of the Royal Navy type 45 destroyer?
Great question; I'm embarrassed to say that I hadn't even noticed it before, despite serving in the RN for just a few years... Anyway, I asked a colleague who specialises in maritime radar and has worked with the radars on Type 45s and, as Jim Gordon here speculates, it is radar absorbing material. However, it's not to reduce the Type 45's radar cross section or signature.  If you notice where the mesh is, it's immediately adjacent to the white navigation radar to the right of the picture of the mast.  The purpose of the radar absorbent material is to prevent the radar emmisions from the wave guide (rotating part) bouncing back into the sensor from only a few feet away.  If the energy was reflected straight back into the wave guide it would have two effects.  Firstly it would obliterate the picture being received by the radar (through the side lobes, if you're interested) and, more importantly, damage it by receivng far too much energy. Hope this helps!
