Is the offshore wind industry in the UK dying with the cancellation of both the Atlantic Array and the 2nd phase of the London Array?
Mark Harrison is absolutely right, so up vote his answer. Around the world in every single field of endeavour there are three to ten times more proposals than completed projects. Often proposals linger on the books long past the time when they should have been put to bed because people have invested personal credibility and money in trying to get them off the ground and see the potential for large revenues and profits if they do come to fruition. This is true for mining, drilling, factory locations, food processing plants, quarries and fracking sites. Sometimes it seems as if wind energy is the only industry in the world where people seize on business-as-usual as an indication of the end times. Wishful thinking on the part of some of those opposed, and opportunistic attacks on the part of those whose bread is buttered on the other side.
