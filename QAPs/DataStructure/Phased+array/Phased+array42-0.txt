Why do radar screens look like they do?
In the old days, the radar screen literally showed what the radar was seeing: the rotating line was linked to the rotating dish, and the blibs you saw were detected reflections. Essentially, there were circular oscilloscopes. The Wikipedia page on radar displays has a good explanation. Fun fact: modern military radars do not really rotate in the traditional sense of the word. Phased array technologies allows them to scan ahead and behind or don't even rotate at all (e.g. Integrated Mast | Thales Group). However, radar operators are often trained on the rotating display and I happen to know that some customers paid for (very expensive) display software that made the phased array radar updates look like they were coming from a rotating radar. No joke.
