Who would win in a naval battle: the WWII Imperial Japanese Navy at its peak or a modern US aircraft carrier?
Despite the many fine answers here, if we are to take your question literally in that the U.S. component of this battle is only a single aircraft carrier, then the carrier loses by a very large margin. It is a common misconception that an aircraft carrier is an all-powerful fighting machine - but nothing could be farther from the truth.  A carrier has very little organic weaponry. Short range Sea Sparrow missiles and some PHALANX Close In Weapons System (CIWS) are about it. Neither would do a lick of good against a submarine.  Even a noisy diesel submarine on snorkel could score a kill against an aircraft carrier.  Carriers have no sonar, so there would be no clue the sub was even there until somebody spotted the snorkel or the torpedo's started hitting. No, the true power of a carrier is it's air wing and it's escort force.  A single Aegis ship could easily wipe out the entire Imperial Japanese Navy.  An aircraft carrier with it's air wing would at least have a shot at doing the same.  But a carrier by itself, no way.
