Does the science behind uBeam work?
So when Galileo had his breakthroughs everybody was rooting for him and hoping he would Crush It!... Hmmm... No they didn't. And when Bell and Edison where doing their thing the whole world was holding their breath, hoping, hoping more than anything that they would nail it? Well... NO! Now the post mentioned by the people who already answered the question has been repudiated by the lead investor, Mark Suster, and his team in today's post here: The Case for Optimism and Risk at Startups I don't know if the tech works or not but that's what the investment is for, to see if it works. If you asked people 10 years ago if you could put a desktop computer into a device the size of a phone they would say you're crazy. Same goes for drones, self-driving cars and hundreds of other technologies. If $10M is the amount Suster et al. are willing to risk for trying to get this out to consumers then that's awesome! Let's rejoice! If your idea is good I'm sure there's people out there who would kill themselves over getting to invest in it.
