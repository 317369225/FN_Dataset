What practical, real world products have been created as a result of the double slit experiment?
(COBRA DANE radar in Alaska) A phased array is an arrangement of multiple antennas to produce an interference pattern that is similar to the pattern produced in an N-slit experiment, a generalization of the double slit set-up. The interference effects produce a directional radiation pattern that keeps the radiated energy in the desired direction, increasing range and ease-of-detection. Diffraction of light through many closely-spaced slits in a diffraction grating is also used as a component in many modern devices, typically to separate incoming light into component wavelengths. They can be found in many optical devices.
