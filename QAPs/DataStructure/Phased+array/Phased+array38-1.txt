Who would win in a naval battle: the WWII Imperial Japanese Navy at its peak or a modern US aircraft carrier?
It would be a draw: despite overwhelming advantages the US carrier would wink out of existence and return to its own time to avoid creating an impossible paradox, as I learned from this documentary: On the other hand it should be recalled that before History intervened the US aircraft don't need to waste ammo on the Japanese aircraft:  they can destroy them by simply buzzing them at supersonic speeds (at least, that's in the novelization of the movie as I recall it , 35 years on...).  This might come in handy if for some reason the IJN is time-tunneled forward to today rather than reverse. History always repeats itself: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce, the third time as merch:
