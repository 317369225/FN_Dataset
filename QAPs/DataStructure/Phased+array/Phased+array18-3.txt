What are the risks of solar satellites beaming energy to Earth? How beneficial can they be? Is there a programme going on to prepare to deploy them?
We are a long way from having the technology to use solar satellites to collect energy.  And I suspect that even if technological hurdles could be overcome (which is a big if), the economic hurdles could never be.  The cost of launching and maintaining satellites is so high, that the more feasible approach is ground based solar panels.  Actually the cost of solar energy is finally nearing the point that it makes economic sense.  Thanks to the American energy industry (the Obama Administration has actually obstructed the process), America  has the energy we need until solar and other technologies are developed to replace fossil fuels.  Our private companies have developed technologies capable of producing huge quantities of natural gas, a particularly clean fuel.  If the Obama Administration would develop a coherent energy policy, and stop absurd policies like blocking the Keystone Pipeline to placate political cronies, important progress could be made with energy independence, keeping prices reasonable, and reducing green house gasses as well as aiding our Allies having to deal with thugs like Putin..
