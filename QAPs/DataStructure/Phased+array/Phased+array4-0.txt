Can a phased array evoke a standing wave at a focal point that has a much higher frequency that the constituent emitted frequencies?
If I understand the question correctly the answer is no, with a caveat. A phased array is a linear time invariant system, spatially and temporally. As such it doesnt modify spectral content, so frequencies are not modified. Now this assumes the medium itself is linear. For high enough signal levels this no longer holds. Examples includes soliton waves....
