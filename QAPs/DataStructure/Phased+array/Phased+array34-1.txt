What do average people think about their extremely intelligent friends?
The smartest people I know: Spoil me by being able to appreciate biting humor without finger wagging. Make me feel really insecure, simply by nodding knowingly while I talk. Why is she nodding? Does she already know all this? Really spoil me by not only catching on to technical ideas at insane speeds, but being creatively flexible enough that I can use the type of imagery I constantly censor, for example … —suddenly he’s like Obama on bad acid. “Now listen.” Sidelong glances, intermittent jaw-clenching and so-on. —I can see that. ... —so I’m getting this friendly-creepy, you know? This Mr. Rogers slash Hannibal Lecter vibe, right? —Oh yeah, sure. Basically never score points by correcting me. I take it as a kindness, though I suppose they may just figuring scoring points with me is beneath them. Anyway, sometimes they’ll correct me incognito, as in —Okay, so 74 in binary is ten, ten, ten, right… —Yeah, a hundred, ten, ten, go on… Make me feel like a child when they gently try to explain the projects they’re working on. —So, it’s a phased array, right?—don’t worry about it—anyway, the main lobe—the strong part—you can steer it… Surprisingly, amplify my own sense of expertise where I have it, usually because they can focus longer and dig deeper without getting bored or confused.
