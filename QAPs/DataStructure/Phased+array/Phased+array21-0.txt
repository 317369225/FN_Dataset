Is the offshore wind industry in the UK dying with the cancellation of both the Atlantic Array and the 2nd phase of the London Array?
It's worth remembering that the UK has more offshore wind capability already installed than the rest of the world put together [1] It's also worth remembering that the Atlantic Array wasn't "cancelled" on account of how it had never actually been started. There was a proposal, and some negotiation, but also lots of opposition from both locals (for all the normal NIMBY reasons) and environmental groups (though also support from different environmental groups), but no formal go-ahead had been agreed. The Second London Array was further progressed, but subject to meeting other conditions (the data-gathering for which wasn't expected to be ready until 2017.) The bits of the industry that geared up quickly in the hope of ongoing mega-contracts from the UK generators, underwritten by UK tax subsidies are probably worried. The bits of the industry that can leverage that experience on the ground into consultancy contracts helping the rest of the world to catch up will do very well.
