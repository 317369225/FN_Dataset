What are the pros and cons of a sonar array versus a rotating sonar?
I assume you're asking about phased arrays. They require drive circuits that can be controlled digitally, and careful placement of transducers.  More importantly, phased array systems require considerable computing power.  An Arduino isn't the best platform for that, and the programming isn't trivial. In my opinion, your easiest implementation would be a rotary sensor with a stepper motor to drive it.  You could either use a rotary encoder to give you precise feedback on the sensor's bearing, or use one or more index sensors to give you fixed position references to work from. If you're looking at underwater sonar, your biggest problem will be sealing your underwater assembly and hull opening. Good luck with your project!
