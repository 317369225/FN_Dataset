Military Strategy: How useful is a Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea?
It depends on who's carrier group and what aim. If China want's to simply beat up Vietnam into a treaty to agree to their vision of the SCS, the most effective way would still be a land invasion (provided that they somehow convince the international community to not intervine .) Otherwise, the carrier group is simply to make a statement, even if they force the Vietnamese to evacuate their islands, as long as they don't acknoweldge China's full control, the problem will persist. If it's the other way around, the USA carrier group trying to show off and force China to evacuate from the SCS, we would have a much bigger problem.  most of the SCS is within range of Chin'a elaborate ballistic missile system.  and the area doesn't let the carrier group move fast enough to safely avoid them consistently, more over, the group would be far away from any support bases (unless they move back into the Phillipines.) but close to Chinese airfields, if China REALLY want to sink it at all cost , it probably can. and we would have a much MUCH bigger problem.
