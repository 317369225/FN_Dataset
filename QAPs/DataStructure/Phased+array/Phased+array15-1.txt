What is this Orion NASA is currently working on?
Orion, aka Apollo on steroids, is supposed to be the next crew stepping stone to either the Moon, asteroids, and a version upscaled might have gone to Mars. So these things were said during the Constellation Program. Ablative heat shielding was supposed to be part of something to make it partially reusable, but I have no idea how many capsules will be contracted. They will need test simulators and more. It has nothing to do with Dyson's Orion concept. Updated 17w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Suraj Kumar Sharma
