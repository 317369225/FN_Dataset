What are the world's largest engineering projects?
If by largest you mean the most massive (literally the most mass of material) it is probably a tailings impoundment.  One of the largest is the Syncrude Tailings Dam.  The impoundment hold over 500 million cubic meters of fine tailings.  This is 17.7 billion cubic feet or (at about 100 pounds per cubic foot) 1,765,000,000,000 pounds (883 million tons) of material.
