What are good applications to be discussed as an electromagnetic course project for engineering?
Depending on how far up the electromagnetic spectrum your department's interests lie, you could consider some brainstorming on the problems of detecting/generating Terahertz waves.   Anything less than that band of frequencies, and we do it by discrete components, or engineered geometry of microwave cavities). Anthing greater than that band of frequencies, and we do it choosing chemicals with the right ready-made geometry (of valence bands, for example).   There is a gap between the two techniques, though, that leads to it being extremely difficult to generate/detect waves in that region.
