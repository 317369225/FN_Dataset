Which is the best 4th gen fighter aircraft in the world?
the F-15C. it has a perfect air to air kill record. Over 100 aerial victories with no losses. No other 4th gen comes close. We can talk all day about thrust vectoring, phased array radars, pilot training, missiles/guns, off boresight targeting, top speed, range, whatever. But talk is cheap. Until you actually do it, you aint much in my book. Specifications are nothing. Accomplishments are everything.
