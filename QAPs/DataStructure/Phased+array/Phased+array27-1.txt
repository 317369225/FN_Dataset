What are the pros and cons of a sonar array versus a rotating sonar?
In context of your question, that is using the arduino, an electronically steered phase array is impossible.  There isn't enough horsepower. If you can get sufficient controllability over the transducers, you may be able to build a phased array, but steering will have to be mechanical.  The (dubious) advantage would be greater directivity over a single sonar transducer in exchange for lots of extra work. For a simple robotics project, just use mulltiple transducers mounted in a sectorized fashion.  If you really want to steer one mechcanically , just mount it to a servo. Use IR for detecting obstructions?  Sure, that will work.
