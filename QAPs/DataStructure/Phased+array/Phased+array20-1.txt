Why is anti-aircraft artillery used? Aren't machine guns better? Is the artillery (flak) used when the machine guns are out of range?
We call it Air Defense Artillery or ADA.  The flagship artillery piece in our arsenal is the MIM-104 Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) Surface-to-Air (SAM) missile system.  It's capable of launching missiles at targets over 40 miles away with a missile traveling at mach 2.8 (2,131mph).  Its missiles can reach altitudes, track aircraft, and destroy targets that machine guns can't even reach, let alone see.   ​ Pictured: What's faster than a speeding bullet.   Dennis Ferguson explained the historical efficacy and use of flak as ADA.  I hope this explains why we never went back to machine guns.
