How is radio astronomy related to electrical and electronics engineering?
"How is radio astronomy related to electrical and electronics engineering?" ----- It might seem that radio astronomy is more closely related to electrical engineering than other astronomical fields, but that's not really the case. All modern observatories and their telescopes depend on increasing complex support systems. Keeping these systems up-to-date and running properly is the single biggest task for observatories.  Usually, there are more engineers and technologists working for observatories than astronomers. If you're interested in working at a major observatory, whether that's a radio observatory or an optical observatory, an electronics engineering background could be a very attractive asset. A well-rounded technical background, ability to work in teams where the members have many different skills, a willingness to keep learning as technologies and observatory goals change -- I think these would be even more valuable than an advanced engineering degree. Something to remember is that there aren't a lot of professional observatories, so the job market isn't particularly large. On the other hand, observatories are usually in remote locations, and many people simply don't want to work there. Sometimes, observatories have to put a lot of effort into recruiting. You might want to take a look at job postings for major observatories to get an idea of their requirements. The  Mauna Kea Observatories web site has links to the individual observatories and several of them have job posting pages. The http://www.eso.org/public/ website is very informative, too. Good luck!
