Does the science behind uBeam work?
The deal is that sending energy wirelessly is not totally impossible, so every crank, sneak, thief and weasel is not being totally dishonest when they say they can bring it to market. Yes, you can send energy through the air.  That is enough factually to convince maybe 40% of VCs to dump a few million into the idea. What the Rizzo's of the world never get around to explaining is that the power goes out in all directions, drops off as the inverse square of the distance, and anything over a watt of radio waves is never going to be approved by the FCC, and anything over 50 milliwatts of sound is not going to be approved by people or the FDA.  Microwave ovens are already limited to leaking milliwatts.  There is no way that any higher power is going to be approved.   The slime balls never seem to get around to those uncomfortable facts before they pass the golden hat around.   If they get cornered by a physicst that a VC brought along, they can waffle and talk about half-true things like exploiting "resonance" or "near field" or phased arrays until the physicist gets confused or tired of all the babble. In general it's the old case of smooth-talk and telling people what they want to hear, winning out over facts.
