What tech upgrades does the Orion ship have compared with those used in the Apollo missions?
Orion can carry more astronauts for longer periods, is designed to be more reusable (hopefully each capsule can be used 10 times), has more interior space due to technology advances makes things smaller. It's also the first NASA spacecraft with automatic docking abilities, along with being NASA's first manned capsulse to use solar power instead of the bulkier and more problematic fuel cells.
