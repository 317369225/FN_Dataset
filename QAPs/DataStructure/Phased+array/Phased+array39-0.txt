What is the significance of BARAK 8 missile?
A2A All I know is that the missile are designed specifically to counter Brahmos and possibly Moskit, supersonic anti-ship missile. A typical short range missiles would require something like 3-4 missile to successfully intercept a single Brahmos - Barak 8 claimed to be able to do it in 1 on 1 basic which is done through superior mobility and advanced sensor rather than sheer speed Barak 8 is the very first missile that employed active radar guidance system (thus granted them fire and forgot capability and much more advanced detection) and as many already mention, it can attack target for as short as 500 m which allow them to fulfil both short range point defence and medium range missile in one go. Barak 8 however, have neither the range of a true medium range naval missile (like SM2) nor the volume of the short range missile defences (like ESSM which can be quad-pack and will be available for as much as twice the volumn of normal missile) Ironically enough, the missile that designed specifically to counter Brahmos, is also carried by Kolkata destroyer - which also carried Brahmos at the same time Kolkata Destroyer, the carrier of both the poison and the antidote at the same time Updated 3w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Tarun Mishra
