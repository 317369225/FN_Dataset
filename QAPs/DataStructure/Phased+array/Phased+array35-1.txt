Military Strategy: How useful is a Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea?
By itself, not very. Only two nations that can put a carrier strike group in the SCS are the United States and China.  The United States has no claims on the SCS, so that leaves China. The problem for China is that the nightmare for China is that all of the ASEAN countries get together under US leadership and confront China.  One problem for China is that the South China Seas is simply not an issue over which large segments of the Chinese population are willing to go to war over.  So the chain of events goes China takes some huge military action, everyone gangs up against China, China backs down. So China's strategy in the South China Seas involves creating a civilian coast guard and improving islands so that they can be used for airfields.  This is what is known as "salami slicing."  You do tiny things that increase your power over time, but none of them are sufficient to cause a huge reaction.  Aircraft carriers aren't that useful for salami slicing. Right now the Chinese carrier is pretty much useless for China.  The point of the carrier is not that China needs it now, but rather that China wants to learn how aircraft carriers work so that in 30 to 50 years, when carriers really do become useful to China, that the knowledge is there.
