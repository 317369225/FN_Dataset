Which is the best 4th gen fighter aircraft in the world?
I think two aircraft rule: F-15C/D Eagle: No air-to-air losses "Not a pound for air to ground", was a pure air superiority fighter until the F-15E 1,198 built Low wing loading and high thrust to weight ratio - it can turn tightly without losing airspeed It can accelerate in a vertical climb It has landed with only one wing F-16C/D: Supersonic, multi-role tactical fighter Utilises fly by wire for enhanced manoeuvrability Frameless bubble canopy Purpose built to pull up to 9-gs Relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters Another jet that comes to mind is the Mig-29. Â With instantaneous and sustained turn performance, high-alpha capability, and a general resistance to spins, it was among the main competitors of the F-16 and F-15. Its lethality is found in WVR (within visual range) combat, where combines with the helmet mounted sight and archer missiles, not many jets stand a chance.
