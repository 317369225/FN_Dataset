What do average people think about their extremely intelligent friends?
Difficult to answer this one as I'm usually the "extremely intelligent friend". I like being with all sorts of people and some of them appear to like being with me but what they think about me I really couldn't tell you - the area of intelligence I am most lacking in is interpersonal communication, being autistic makes it very difficult to determine what people are thinking, especially what they might be thinking about me.
