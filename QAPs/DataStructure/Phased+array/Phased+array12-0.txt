How can an ECE engineer serve in the Indian Armed Forces?
Thats a good question. Thanks for asking. Basically there are some branches in Indian Army which are totally dealt by engineers. These are EME ( Electrical and Mechanical Engineers) ENGINEERS and Corps of SIGNALS Mostly ECE engineers choose to join EME and SIGNALS branches of Army where these are trained on sophisticated and cutting edge technology of Army. These engineers are trained in operation of various Radars, Antennas,Communication equipments, Embedded Electronics for IEDs, etc. Some might be luck to get into AAD (Army air defence) which have aerial and phased array radars. So definitely ECE engineers play a vital role in Indian Army.
