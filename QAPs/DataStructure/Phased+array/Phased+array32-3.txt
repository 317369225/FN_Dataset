Do engineers need to know Fourier analysis?
Ronald Brcewell use this quote of Lord Kelvin "Fourier's theorem is not only one of the most beautiful results of modern analysis, but it may be said to furnish an indispensable instrument in the treatment of nearly every recondite question in modern physics" Fourier Analysis and Imaging: 9780306481871: Medicine & Health Science Books @ Amazon.com I'm software engineer. And for me: 1. It is a mathematical, physical brilliant which implicitly used by all engineers. 2. I have a dream to design the world class compression algorithm.Â  The number #1 thing which can help me in it - it is Fourier Analysis. 3. From loss compression in JPEG to Tomography - there are a lot of applications. (By the way I'd like to write an interesting scientific-popular article about it. But it is currently in Russian) 4. It is the point where a lot of mathematical areas are intersected (p.d.e, lin.algrebra, prob.theory, linear systems)
