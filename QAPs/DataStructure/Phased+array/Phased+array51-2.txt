Does the length of an antenna have any effect on the strength of a signal that can be transmitted/received?
For a very simple one element vertical antenna wth no compensating circuits, the length that will be the most efficient is about 1/4 of the signal wavelength. This means that the length of the antenna is inversely proportional to the frequency. ie. Bigger is better does not apply in this instance. This type of antenna is omnidirectional in the horizontal plane. By adding other elements the antenna can be made directional and effectively have more gain in the directions where it is designed to be effective.
