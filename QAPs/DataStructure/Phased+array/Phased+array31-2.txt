What technological advancements came out of the Soviet military?
The one that has been the longest lasting and the most influential would have to be the AK-47 assault rifle (Автомат Калашникова 47), first developed in 1945 in the USSR by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is widely considered to be the most reliable and toughest weapon of its kind in the world.  Its design has been copied by weapons makers in every region of the world, and dozens of armed forces use it as their primary weapon (not to mention non state groups of all types, as well as many state police and paramilitary organizations). Though it is not as technologically advanced as many other types of assault rifes, the comparatively low maintenance required to keep it functioning at a high level makes it very popular with its users. U.S. Army Colonel David Hackworth offers the following anecdote about the AK-47 from his time serving in Vietnam: One of the bulldozers uncovered the decomposing body of an enemy soldier, complete with AK-47. I happened to be standing right there, looking down into the hole and pulled the AK out of the bog. "Watch this, guys," I said, "and I'll show you how a real infantry weapon works." I pulled the bolt back and fired 30 rounds — the AK could have been cleaned that day rather than buried in glug for a year or so. That was the kind of weapon our soldiers needed, not the confidence-sapping M16. A number of Soviet aircraft should be mentioned as well, especially the MiG 29 and Sukhoi Su-27, both of which remain in use around the world today.
