What technological advancements came out of the Soviet military?
Multiple Missile Rocket Launchers: Katyushahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kat... source: www.wwiivehicles.com Katyusha multiple rocket launchers (Russian: Катюша) are a type of rocket artillery first built and fielded by the Soviet Union in World War II. Compared to other artillery, these multiple rocket launchers deliver a devastating amount of explosives to an area target quickly, but with lower accuracy and requiring a longer time to reload. They are fragile compared to artillery guns, but inexpensive and easy to produce. Katyushas of World War II, the first self-propelled artillery mass-produced by the Soviet Union, were usually mounted on trucks. This mobility gave Katyushas (and other self-propelled artillery) another advantage: being able to deliver a large blow all at once, and then move before being located and attacked with counter-battery fire. On the level of tactics, the Red Army was a pioneer of Operational Warfare, (Deep Operations / Defence in Depth) and Night Fighting. http://www.militaryhistoryonline... http://www.history.army.mil/book...
