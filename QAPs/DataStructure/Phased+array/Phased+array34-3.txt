What do average people think about their extremely intelligent friends?
In middle school I had a good friend who was very intelligent (an IQ of 150 I think) and he kept on amazing me with his intelligence. It was nice to have someone to talk to about subjects like politics and science. I had very different conversations with him than with other people and for some reason I really enjoyed it. It felt like even I was becoming smarter. With point of view on certain subjects was quite unique and that was refreshing. Of course he wasn't good at everything, since he's still human. His social skills were quite fragile and he constantly asked me for help on how to talk to girls. Our conversations became a fun mix between serious an less serious conversations. Some time later, he moved to another city and I never saw him since that moment. I have read on the news however that a year after he moved to another city, he won certain prizes in physics and has since that moment become one of the best physicists in my country and for some reason that doesn't surprise me, but it still amazes me.
