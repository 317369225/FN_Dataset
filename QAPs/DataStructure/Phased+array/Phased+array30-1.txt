When isn't radar safe?
Radar is always safe... when people take the proper precautions with it. Running a microwave oven (which, as Ian Atkin explained in his thorough answer, was developed when someone noticed that a radar set "cooked" his chocolate bar) is safe...unless you disable the safeties and stick your head inside. Airport radar, which is extremely powerful, is safe...unless you climb the radar tower while the unit is operating. Handheld radar units used by police are safe...unless you keep the magnetron powered up while you hold the unit between your legs for eight hours a day. So... radar isn't safe when it is installed incorrectly, or when people operate it incorrectly, or when people violate safety rules related it its use.
