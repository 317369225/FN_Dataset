What technological advancements came out of the Soviet military?
Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) The BMP 1 was the first mass produced IFV (combination of an APC and a Light Tank) The innovative design led to many allied counterparts such as the M2 Bradley http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_1 Sloped Armour (Tanks) First mass production on the famous T-34 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slo... Satellite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spu... Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) USSR R-7  / NATO Codename : SS-6 The R-7 (Russian: Р-7) was the world's first true intercontinental ballistic missile, deployed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War from 1959 to 1968. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-7... Nuclear Dead-Hand System (Perimeter Project)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dea... Supercavitating Torpedoes VA-111 Shkval The speed of the VA-111 far exceeds that of any standard torpedo currently fielded by NATO. This speed is a result of supercavitation: the torpedo is, in effect, flying in a gas bubble created by outward deflection of water by its specially shaped nose cone and the expansion of gases from its engine. By keeping water from coming into contact with the surface of the body of the torpedo, drag is significantly reduced, allowing extremely high speeds. In effect, the Shkval is an underwater missile. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VA-... Artic Warfare Experience pays... Assault Rifle StG 44? The Fedorov Avtomat pictured above was designed in 1915 and used (while limited...) until 1945. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed... Siege Tower by Ivan Vyrodkov In 1552, he supervised the fortification works during the siege of Kazan, and is credited for constructing a 12 metre high siege tower in just one night. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iva... Armored Ground-Attack Aircraft Ilyushin Il-2 The IL-2 is a single-engine, propeller-driven, low-wing monoplane of mixed construction with a crew of two (one in early versions), specially designed for assault operations. Its most notable feature was the inclusion of armor in an airframe load-bearing scheme. Armor plates replaced the frame and paneling throughout the nacelle and middle part of the fuselage, and an armored hull made of riveted homogeneous armor steel AB-1 (AB-2) secured the aircraft’s engine, cockpit, water and oil radiators, and fuel tanks. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ily... High-Flying Supersonic Interceptor/Recon/Bomber Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 (NATO Codename : Foxbat) The first prototype flew in 1964 with entry into service in 1970. A top speed of Mach 2.83+, a powerful radar and four air-to-air missiles, worried U.S. observers and prompted development of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle in late 1960s. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-25 Coaxial Rotor Design (Helicopter) Kamov Ka-50 "Black Shark" (NATO Codename Hokum A) Coaxial rotors solve the problem of angular momentum by turning each set of rotors in opposite directions. The equal and opposite torques from the rotors upon the body cancel out. Rotational maneuvering, yaw control, is accomplished by increasing the collective pitch of one rotor and decreasing the collective pitch on the other. This causes a controlled dissymmetry of torque. Coaxial rotors reduce the effects of dissymmetry of lift through the use of two rotors turning in opposite directions, causing blades to advance on either side at the same time. One other benefit arising from a coaxial design include increased payload for the same engine power - a tail rotor typically wastes some of the power that would otherwise be devoted to lift and thrust, whereas with a coaxial rotor design, all of the available engine power is devoted to lift and thrust. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coa...
