How is radio astronomy related to electrical and electronics engineering?
While power electronics is used in circuitry driving motors steering and pointing the telescope antenna (unless it is of phased array kind), the cool stuff in radio astronomy is constructing receivers and signal amplifiers with extremely high sensitivity and even more extremely low noise. For those phased arrays you will need circuitry capable of changing the signal phase very precisely, obviously - for fixed staring angle delay lines would do, but for array capable of scanning your electronics must do that duty. I am afraid there are not so many job openings on radio telescopes, but it is best to contact several observatories directly and ask around.
