I was thinking, what if interstellar space exploration was being tackled wrong. What if we used tiny satellites (the size of a coin) and accelerated them to half the speed of light around the Sun's gravitational pull? Is it possible?
The smallest satellites we can produce today are cubesats, 10 cm on a side, and they can barely communicate from Low Earth Orbit. You are proposing a spacecraft of one millionth of the volume. I have no idea what could power such a craft - no technology available today could do so. The energy required to accelerate such a craft to half the speed of light is about the same as three hours of the total generating capacity of the Earth today. I think your proposal is at least a couple of centuries ahead of its time.
