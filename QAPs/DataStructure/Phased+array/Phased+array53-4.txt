Does a radio transmitter use more power when many receivers are tuned to its frequency than when there are no receivers?
No, radio transmissions are "broadcast" by design, which means that the transmitter simply throws out energy for the receivers to catch and process. Think of it as a sprinkler watering the garden - a fraction of the water spent (power) actually waters the grass (receivers), while the rest is simply lost on evaporation/barren patches etc.
