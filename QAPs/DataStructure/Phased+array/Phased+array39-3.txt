What is the significance of BARAK 8 missile?
The Barak-8 is an upgraded version of the Barak missile system already being used by India and Israel. It is designed to defend naval vessels against incoming missiles, planes and drones. By upgradation I mean large size, more in weight and a much heavy warhead(60 kg against the previous version's 22 kg), capability to intercept at more higher altitude than the previous version, much efficient engine system than the previous. Designed to defend against a variety of short-to-long- range airborne threats, including fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, drones and projectiles, it incorporates a state-of-the-art phased array multi-mission radar, two-way data link, and a flexible command and control system, enabling users to simultaneously engage multiple targets day and night and in all weather conditions, It will be helpful for Israel and India to safeguard it's offshore oil fields and refineries, as Israel remains under continuous threat from any unpredictable missile attack by hamas or Hezbollah, and India by many as it has a vast open ocean against itself to make it vulnerable for any attack from any of blue water anti-groups.
