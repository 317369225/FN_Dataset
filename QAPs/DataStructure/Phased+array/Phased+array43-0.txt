Can you construct a spherical wave as a sum of plane waves?
Yes. Since the set of plane waves and the set of spherical harmonics are both complete sets, you can represent any conceivable wave either in plane-wave form or in spherical wave form. The form you choose is purely out of convenience and depends on the symmetry of the problem.Â  If you have an object that scatters light which is shaped like a sphere, then you want spherical waves. If you have a cylindrical object, you'll want cylindrical waves. If you have a periodic system, like a crystal, you'll generally want to use plane waves. Plane wave expansion
