Does the science behind uBeam work?
I'm the physicist that wrote the "pointed excerpt," so I guess that sums up my answer to your question.  Basically, to get to any appreciable power, say 5 W like the standard Apple iPhone charger, delivered into a practical area for a receiver, say 1 cm^2, means you'd need a power density of 5 W/cm^2 = 50,000 W/m^2.  In standard audio intensity units, that's about 165 dB SIL, which is 10x the limit recommended by OSHA and the FDA.  Even down a factor of 10 or 100 from there is still dangerous or uncomfortable from a health perspective, and every order of magnitude you lose in power makes it less useful as a charger. A more in-depth blog post summarizing this is here: http://independentscience.tumblr... (An aside - I would never discourage someone from pursuing any idea they feel compelling.  It's simply that $10M seems like a rather large bet to make when no innovation around these basic physical limits has ever been demonstrated.  In the meantime, there are far more revolutionary ideas - charging is an inconvenience, but it's certainly not a life-threatening problem - floating around that struggle to get traction and could do with a tenth of what uBeam raised.)
