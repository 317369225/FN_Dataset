Does a radio transmitter use more power when many receivers are tuned to its frequency than when there are no receivers?
No. Any radio transmitter broadcasts at its maximum allowable power. The vast majority of the transmitted radio energy is propagated out into space or is absorbed by the atmosphere, water, and organic material here on earth. The tiny amount that is picked up by a radio receiver is then amplified millions of times until the signal is sufficiently powerful to manipulate and apply to whatever purpose it was intended. Many modern cell phone base stations employ what is know as an "electrically steered" or "phased array" antenna. The goal is to avoid losing most of the transmitter's energy by enabling tight radio beams to a particular cell phone or groups of cell phones. This translates into lower power by the transmitter or longer range. In addition, it cuts back on the amount of interference at the base station. A typical use might be tight radio beams along the length of a major highway where orthogonal to the highway direction there might be empty fields with no users.
