Do engineers need to know Fourier analysis?
I've been told by many working engineers that, at least in certain fields, the job requires nothing beyond an eighth-grade education, and that anyone can be an engineer as long as they're willing to sit at a computer, click buttons, and attend meetings. That said, if you actually want to build something interesting rather than just drawing a paycheck, Fourier analysis is the heart and soul of digital signal processing, and also has applications pretty much anywhere.Â  You can learn up to the level an engineer is likely to use in a couple weeks, too, so there's not much reason not to learn it.
