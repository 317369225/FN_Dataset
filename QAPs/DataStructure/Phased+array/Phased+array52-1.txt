Is there a minimum distance to receive AM radio waves?
Do you mean, "Do I need to be a minimum distance away from an AM radio transmitter in order to receive radio waves from that transmitter?" If so, the answer is "maybe." If the transmitter is using a conventional single antenna, then probably not. You can get as close as you want, and you'll still receive the signal. Some commercial broadcasters use what is called a phased array antenna. You usually see this as three (occasionally more) identical towers spaced a short distance apart. The reason for this is that by using a phased array, the transmitter can direct its signal so that more of it goes in one particular direction than another, thereby avoiding wasting power that would otherwise be sent to locations where there aren't any people. But if you're standing fairly close to such an array (at distances that are comparable to the distance between the towers), you can find yourself in a node, a spot where the combined signals from the towers cancel each other out. In practice, the nodes aren't perfect, and you'll always get at least a little bit of signal, but it can be very low compared to the signal you get just a few feet away.
