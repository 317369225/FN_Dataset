Which is the mightiest fighter jet that the world has ever seen?
Not a jet, but I think the Fokker D.VII is the most badass fighter ever: I know what you're thinking: how the heck does this dorky-looking flying tin box even qualify for mightiest fighter ever? I assure you that Allied pilots also underestimated this plane when it first appeared over the skies of WWI France. The Fokker D.VII had great climb rate, turn rate, angle of attack, high altitude performance, AND it could dive without fear of breaking apart. German pilots liked it not only for its great maneuverability and power, but because it was safe to fly too: it doesn't stall or spin easily. Manfred von Richthofen—you might know him as the Red Baron, the top scoring ace of WWI—praised this aircraft as the best he had flown. His recommendation led to the first provisional order for 400 production aircraft. In all, Germany produced around 3,300 aircraft in summer and autumn of 1918. Its career was abruptly ended on November 11, 1918. All of Germany's D.VIIs were singled out for handover to the Allies in their terms of the Conditions of an Armistice with Germany. The Fokker D.VII still holds the distinction as the only aircraft explicitly referred to in a treaty. This is the ultimate definition of badass for a fighter plane.
