How is it possible to identify the location of an RF transmitter?
It isn't always possible.  Well, actually to be precise, it's not always practical.  For example, the signal may be purposefully spread across such a wide swatch of the spectrum that even detecting that there is a signal is problematic. Let's assume for discussion sake, it's a signal that wants to be found - just a stable tone at a known frequency.  One approach is to use "time of arrival" to multiple base stations.  Each base station location is known.  All stations are timed to the same clock (practically, synched to the GPS atomic clock.) Since the base stations are geographically dispersed, each is at a potentially different distance to the transmitter.  Each base station then hears the same transmission at different times.  With the base station on the same clock, time differences equates to distance, i.e., it is possible to derive range circles from each base to the transmitter.  The intersection of multiple range circles locates the transmitter. Additional techniques can be folded in for higher performance.  For example, it is possible to use Dopper at a base to derive the direction to the transmitter.
