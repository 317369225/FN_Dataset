What's the future of space tourism?
My opinion is that a lot depends on the willingness of a nation to accept failure. If we (the collective we) are risk adverse, then space tourism will cease to exist. However, if we are willing to accept death as one of the possible outcomes of taking on the risk of space tourism, then I think space tourism can flourish in the future. Right now, there is an ongoing investigation into the crash of the SpaceShip Two vehicle (http://www.ntsb.gov/investigatio...) which resulted in the death of one of the pilots. Imagine a scenario where a space vehicle is lost where a paying customer is either injured or killed. Will we retreat for any further attempts or will we address any technical issues and move forward? Will we attempt to legislate and regulate the industry to the point where it is too expensive for industry to participate or will we have a system, much like it exists today (Feb 2015), where few regulations exist?
