How is it possible to identify the location of an RF transmitter?
How is it possible to identify the location of an RF transmitter? They use a technique called "triangulation". You can localize a radio source with two measurements. The more orthogonal the measurements are (the greater the angle between the transmitter and the different receive measurements), the smaller the uncertainty in the localization area. Generally, they make many more than two measurements. Each additional measurement helps isolate the location. The measurements do not have to be measured by the same equipment. A drone with proper equipment, plus your vehicle, and sometimes even a satellite can all make the same measurement. In each measurement, they use a narrow beamwidth antenna to get a bearing to the transmitter. In addition, they get a measure of signal strength. The signal strength is only of marginal use, the important measure is the angle.
