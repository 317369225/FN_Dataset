What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search? Why does DFS visit the node after removal from a stack while BFS visits the node before adding it to the queue?
DFS as name suggests is depth first search, will start it's searching from the root node. For each node it search till the leaf of that node and mark all the visited node as true. To do this it uses stack. Once the leaf node is encountered it starts popping out the elements. In case of BFS it start it's search from level. In other words it is also called as level order traversal. Again here also we use a array of visited node to keep track whether the node is visited. Once we start traversal we push all the connected node from the root to queue and start our traversal. Now coming to secon... (more)
