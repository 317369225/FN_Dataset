What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search? Why does DFS visit the node after removal from a stack while BFS visits the node before adding it to the queue?
Breadth-first search (BFS) and depth first-search (DFS) are actually the same, apart from the data structure used to store discovered vertices. A BFS keeps a queue of vertices that have been discovered and are yet to be visited, and then repeatedly visits the front vertex on the queue, discovering all of its neighbours and adding those to the back of the queue. This means that the earlier a vertex is discovered, the earlier it is visited, giving the 'breadth-first' shape of the search. A DFS simply replaces the queue of the BFS with a stack, so that newly discovered vertices are visited r... (more)
