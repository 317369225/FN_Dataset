Is depth first search always better than breadth first search?
No. Depth first search may find the deepest solution, while breadth first always finds the shallowest. This comes at the cost of exponential memory usage for BFS. However, if you are unsure of the depth of the graph, it could be unlimited, and DFS may never find a solution. Iterated deepening is a good blend of these approaches. It provides th benefits of linear memory complexity with a guarantee to find the most shallow solution (if a solution exists of course). This does come with the cost of increased runtime complexity by a constant factor though. In many real world applications, there are heuristics you can apply to get better results via A*. 850 Views Â· 5 Upvotes
