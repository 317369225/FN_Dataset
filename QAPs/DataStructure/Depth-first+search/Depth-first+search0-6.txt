What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search? Why does DFS visit the node after removal from a stack while BFS visits the node before adding it to the queue?
DFS (Depth First Search) and BFS (Breadth First Search) are search    algorithms used for graphs and trees.    When you have an  ordered tree or graph, like a BST, it’s quite   easy to search the data  structure to find  the node that you want.     But,  when given an unordered tree or graph, the BFS and DFS search    algorithms can come in handy to find what you’re looking  for.    The decision to choose one over the other should be based on  the   type of data that one is dealing with.            In a breadth first search, you start at th...
