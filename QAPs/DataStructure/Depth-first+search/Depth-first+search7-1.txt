Which is faster: implement Depth First Search using recursive function calls or using a stack?
It depends, and the only thing you can do is measure. On one hand, you have the recursive call, that can be seen as 'aided by the processor', accelerated or whatnot. But in reality the processor will push more things on the stack than just your recursion data. On the other hand, you have the iterative call that, once identified as such, can be (somewhat) optimized by the compiler. You only push on the stack the data that are of interest for you, and since the stack will be in first level cache you will also profit from locality. So I don't see any clear advantage for either.
