What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search? Why does DFS visit the node after removal from a stack while BFS visits the node before adding it to the queue?
As you know DFS and BFS serve different purposes they are used for visiting the nodes of a graph in different ways. The algorithm only describes a way of achieving this. So, if you were to mark a node visited each time you pushed it in the stack your order of visiting the nodes would not comply with the idea of a Depth First Search (an intuitive understanding: you have to visit the depth before the breadth) Let's see the difference by applying the algorithm provided on Wikipedia procedure DFS-iterative(G,v): let S be a stack S.push(v) while S is not empty v ‚Üê S.pop...
