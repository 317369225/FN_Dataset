What are some real-life examples of Breadth and Depth First Search?
One really important application is in modeling 'Flood Fill' or pretty much anything that resembles a viral growth pattern. Well-constructed stochastic BFS traversals can come pretty close to approximating the actual outcome. Another interesting one is 2-Colorability (a.k.a Bipartiteness Test). A BFS tree is a decomposition of a graph by layers (each successive expansion from the previous set of nodes is a new layer; initialized with a chosen root). This can be useful in problems that must enforce bipartiteness, though I can't think of any good examples off the top of my head. Shortest p... (more)
