Why is breadth-first search slower than depth-first search (graphs)?
Correcting the question here, BFS isn't slower than DFS but depending on the scenario performance counts. Lets say, you need to search for the leaf node in the tree or graph in such scenario BFS will surely be a bad choice and slower but at the other hand if the requirement is to search nodes in between at level BFS would count. For eg. In the evolution pyramid, if one need to search the organism present in current era, DFS would give us better performance. 943 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
