Algorithms: What is the code for a real time application of a DFS (depth first search) and BFS (breadth first search)?
Java Depth First Search, Breadth First search. DFS, BFS both recursive and nonrecursive. here are the links to my github-Gist :For DFS & BFS : Build software better, together Applications of Breadth First Traversalnonrecursinonrecursn We have earlier discussed Breadth First Traversal Algorithm for Graphs. We have also discussed Applications of Depth First Traversal. In this article, applications of Breadth First Search are discussed. 1) Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree for unweighted graph In unweighted graph, the shortest path is the path with least number of edges. With Breadth First, w... (more)
