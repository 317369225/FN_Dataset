Which is faster: implement Depth First Search using recursive function calls or using a stack?
May be because I am old fashioned, but, If possible, use your own stack rather than recursive call, because - recursive call creating "floating memories" which, for large data, shall used up your ram, until all process finished (read, being blocked for a lo~ng time) :) - using your own stack, you can stop in the middle or any iteration you want. :-) But, if your language implement inter object instance event handler, you can use that to call recursively without blocking, and can stop in some count. :-) 1.5k Views Â· 1 Upvote
