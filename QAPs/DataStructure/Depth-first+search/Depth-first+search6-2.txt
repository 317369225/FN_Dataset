What is the best way to explain "depth-first search" to a non-CS student?
Ask them to imagine a museum with many rooms.Each room with doors to many other rooms.Some rooms are dead ends .Each room has only one door. The task here is to visit each room. The entry and exit are from the same door. One trivial way to visit all the rooms is to go to one ,then enter the first door and it will lead you to another set of rooms and the same goes on.Eventually you will find a dead end so you come back to the room that led you there and visit the next room . So on you visit each room . This is depth first search. 869 Views Â· 14 Upvotes
