What is iterative depth-first search?
I assume you are referring to iterative deepening depth-first search It is used when you are looking for shortest paths in an exponentially large graph (often arising in puzzles and deterministic games) where breadth-first search requires more memory than you can use. So, you limit DFS by a certain depth, and gradually increase the depth limit until a path is found. Since no shorter path exists, the one you found must be optimal. A particularly useful extension of this idea is IDA* invented by R.Korf to find optimal solutions of the 15 puzzle and the Rubik's cube. 3.1k Views Â· 24 Upvotes
