How do I solve a maze with depth first search?
A maze is a graph. All mazes can be represented as a tree graph, with each choice point a set of siblings linked off the same node. If the graph is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), then it’s solvable using a depth first algorithm. Not all mazes are representable as DAGs. A maze with one edge entrance and one edge exit, in two dimensions, will be a DAG. Any other maze may not be. The most common method of graph traversal in a depth first search is the right hand rule, where you simply follow the right wall; another variant is the left hand rule. In more complex mazes, it’s necessary to add marking... (more)
