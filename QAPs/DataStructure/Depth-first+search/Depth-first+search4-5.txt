What are some real-life examples of Breadth and Depth First Search?
I am an Electronics and Communication engineer by training. So let me answer this in terms of communication. As users of wireless technology, we demand high data rates beyond GigaBytes per second for Voice, Video and other applications. There are many standards to achieve data rates beyond GB/s. One of the standards is MIMO(Multi input Multi output). MIMO employs K-best Algorithm(which is a Breadth-First Search algorithm) to find the shortest partial euclidian distances. MIMO previously used numerous algorithms (linear detection, interface cancellation, depth first, etc) but none of them p... (more)
