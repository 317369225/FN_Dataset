What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search? Why does DFS visit the node after removal from a stack while BFS visits the node before adding it to the queue?
1. In BFS the root node is expanded first, then all the successors of the root node are expanded, and in next step all the successors of every node are expanded, the process continues till the goal is achived.               while In DFS we explore the root node and traverse as far as possible from the root node untill the goal is achived. 2.In BFS the space complexity is more critical as compared to time complexity.                                                                                               while In DFS has lesser space complexity, because at a time it needs to store only...
