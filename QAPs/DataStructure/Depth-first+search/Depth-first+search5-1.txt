What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
I agree with many of the answerers. I was a Google engineer for three years, did a lot of projects, and was quickly promoted, so I think I'm a pretty solid software engineer. As I read this to myself, I wonderedâ€¦ do I even know ten algorithms by heart, in full detail?? I don't think so. Understanding algorithms is an invaluable skill, but like many domains of knowledge, the skill is in a way of thinking, not in memorization. You want to be able to read an algorithm, and immediately understand why it is the way it is. As far as knowing exactly how a specific algorithm is implemented, that's w... (more)
