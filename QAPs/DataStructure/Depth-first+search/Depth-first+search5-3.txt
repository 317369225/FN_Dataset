What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
Learning algorithms would be like a chemist memorizing chemical compounds, they are infinite. Here are ten things a programmer should understand to create good algorithms. A programmer creates algorithms using a finite set of instructions. It’s better to learn the set of instructions and constructs that are used to make algorithms. Read and write from memory/data structures or input/output Mathematical operations (% or modulus is a useful one for programmers) Conditional branching (if, then, elseif, else, switch, etc… Subroutines (to help organize your code and operations) Looping (for, while, etc..) ...
