What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search? Why does DFS visit the node after removal from a stack while BFS visits the node before adding it to the queue?
As the name implies, a breadth-first search starting in vertex v  v will first visit each vertex w  w that is adjacent to v  v , and next go on to perform a breadth-first search for each such w  w . The search terminates when no more unvisited vertices can be visited in this manner. A depth-first search starting in vertex v  v will first visit the first vertex w  w that is adjacent to v  v , and next go on to perform a breadth-first search for this w  w . When this search eventually terminates, the depth-first search will then visit the next vertex adjacent to v  v . The search starting in vertex v  v terminates when a search has bee... (more)
