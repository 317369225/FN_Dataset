Which is faster: implement Depth First Search using recursive function calls or using a stack?
In general there will be no real noticeable difference in speed. There may be some memory efficiencies in avoiding the recursive function.  So depending how "deep" your DFS will go, will give you an idea of the real cost.  If it can go really deep, you can even cause a stack overflow in some languages. Usually I find the recursive solution easier for my brain to process.  I think there is something pleasant at arriving at a cool recursive answer.  It just feels cool. But I had a professor in college teaching us howALL recursive solutions can be rewritten to avoid the recursion, and usual... (more)
