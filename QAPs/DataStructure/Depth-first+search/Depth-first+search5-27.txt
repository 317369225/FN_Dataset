What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
None. You can google those algorithms. As said below, what's more important is understanding good software design principles (unless you're going into research, of course). On top of this, the algorithms you will use greatly depends on the type of programmer you plan on being (Web Dev? Game Dev? AI?) If you're answering Technical interview questions, however, they may ask you about certain algorithms. I would suggest getting the book “Cracking The Coding Interview” to learn about and brush up on those once you start getting interviews. 9k Views · 48 Upvotes
