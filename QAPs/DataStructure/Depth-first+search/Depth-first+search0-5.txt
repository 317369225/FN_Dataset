What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search? Why does DFS visit the node after removal from a stack while BFS visits the node before adding it to the queue?
Breadth first search is like ripples in a pond. You start a point and sort of uniformly expand your search outward. Depth first search is how you would iterate through a tree. Depth first search looks like this. First we place 1 on the stack and mark it as used. Then we pop off the top of the stack (1), and look at it's children. We check to see if they'd been previously added, add 8,7,2 to the stack, mark them as visited and return. So our stack looks like this 2,7,8. Then we pop off (2) and examine its children. So we add 6, 3 to the stack. Now the stack looks like 3,6,7,8.... In each ca... (more)
