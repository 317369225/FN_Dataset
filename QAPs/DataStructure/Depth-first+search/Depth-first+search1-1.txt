What are some examples of real world application of a depth first search?
Originally Answered: What are the real world application of Depth first search for graph?DFS can be used to generate a topological ordering on nodes and, consequently, also to decompose a graph into its Strongly Connected Components. This is quite useful in a variety of situations, but it most commonly arises when you need to enforce dependencies (e.g. A must be done before B, which must be done before C). This arises in lots of real-world processes, such as in hierarchal distribution networks, smart compilation in large projects, assessing investment decision trees, et al. Thank you for your feedback!
