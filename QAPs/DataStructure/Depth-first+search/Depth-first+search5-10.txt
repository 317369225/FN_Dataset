What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
I wouldn’t memorize any algorithms, personally. You’ll probably end up memorizing a few through studying them, but that’s not the point. The point is to learn the techniques for designing algorithms that have worked well in the past. Study the algorithms to master the techniques they employ, not to memorize the algorithm itself - the reason being, anything you can memorize can be found in a library that has the algorithm already written for you and accessible to you through a simple function call. A good engineer needs to be able to deal with situations where a baked-in solution isn’t available. ... (more)
