Which is faster: implement Depth First Search using recursive function calls or using a stack?
Which to choose depends on the platform you are targeting and what you expect your input to look like, meaning how long is the longest path in the DFS going to be. Speed is not the issue, however. The issue is that in C++ there is no portable way to handle or even detect, really, the situation in which you are deep in a recursive call and run out of stack space. That is other than, (a) formally proving or otherwise convincing co-workers that the recursive algorithm in question is guaranteed to terminate never using more than k stack frames, (b) keeping track of the depth of recursion and a...
