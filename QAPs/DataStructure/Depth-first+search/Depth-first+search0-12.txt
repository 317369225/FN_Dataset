What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search? Why does DFS visit the node after removal from a stack while BFS visits the node before adding it to the queue?
BFS is slower than DFS.DFS is more faster than BFS.BFS requires more memory compare to DFS.DFS require less memory compare to BFS. useÂ  BFS is useful in finding shortest path.BFS can be used to find the shortest distance between some starting node and the remaining nodes of the graph. DFS in not so useful in finding shortest path. It is used to perform a traversal of a general graph and the idea of DFS is to make a path as long as possible, and then go back (backtrack) to add branches also as long as possible 1.9k Views
