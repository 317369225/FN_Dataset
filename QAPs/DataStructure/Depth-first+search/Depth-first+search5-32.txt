What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
Coming from an intensive programming contest background, having read Introduction to Algorithms, etc., but then moving on to doing real-life projects, I find that some of the more interesting and powerful algorithms in a problem solving setting find little use in the industry. I'm thus going to present algorithms that carry over to engineering, not just research and TopCoder. Another goal was for these algorithms to be useful and widely applicable hammers in their own right, not just as an idea. The benefits of most "algorithms" will be hard to explain them to someone who has not yet been in... (more)
