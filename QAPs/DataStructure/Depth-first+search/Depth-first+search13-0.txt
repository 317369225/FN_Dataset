What are the C# simplest examples of implementation of breadth-first search and depth-first search?
Hi, yes there is of course , very simple and straightforward to understand code provided by Prof. Doc. Robert Sedgewick in his book "Algorithms in Java" , also there is free course on Coursera @Page on coursera.org. I use his code adopted in C# (Original is written in Java but as you know its easy to convert in C#). But before we should consider Graph API - methods that your Graph class provides, no difference Graph is implemented as Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix or Classes - Vertexes and Edges. API convention is too simple : Graph should have method which returns all adjacencyÂ  vertex f... (more)
