What are some real-life examples of Breadth and Depth First Search?
Scanning a hierarchical filesystem directory structure can be performed in either a breadth first or depth first manner. Starting at an arbitrary directory, you can find all of the elements in the directory. In a recursive algorithm if, upon finding a subdirectory element, you descend to that subdirectory immediately to continue the search rather than find more elements in the present directory,  then that would be a depth first search. Finding all elements at each directory node before descending to any subdirectory would be a breadth first search. 5.2k Views · 2 Upvotes
