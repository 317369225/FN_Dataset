What is depth first search in data structures called graph?
Depth first search in terms of a graph: In a graph, you have arcs and nodes which would represent graph. So, imagine a graph like that and you want to find a element in that graph. What dfs would do is, go in-depth of your graph and keep looking at the element you are searching. So for example, you have a graph like- A B. C D E. F. G so dfs would go like- A, B, D, E, C, F, G disadvantage of dfs is that it can get stuck in cycle and if your graph is tall and element is in the 2nd row itself then it would have difficulty as it will go deep into the tree and once it explores all the nodes, it...
