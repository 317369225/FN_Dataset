Which is faster: implement Depth First Search using recursive function calls or using a stack?
Asymptotically it's the same,Â  the constant factor rarely matters, and the difference between the constant factors is negligible in this case. In general, I expect your own stack to be very slightly faster because you won't have to deal with the entire stack frame that is pushed whenever you make a function call / popped whenever said function returns. You will just push/pop the two variables you need. In C++ your own stack (from <stack>) is stored in a vector, so using it is cache-friendly. On the other hand, the recursive version is way more convenient, and the difference in runtime is ... (more)
