What are some real-life examples of Breadth and Depth First Search?
Breadth First Search is basically used to find a shortest path between any two nodes in a graph. Since, a graph can be used to represent a large number of real life problems such as road networks, computer networks, social networks such as facebook etc., Breadth First Search can be applied to solve a myriad of real life problems. GPS Navigation systems: Navigation systems such as the Google Maps, which can give directions to reach from one place to another use BFS. They take your location to be the source node and your destination as the destination node on the graph. (A city can be repres... (more)
