What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
I would agree with others who have stated you shouldn’t worry about ‘knowing by heart’ any algorithms. As an illustration of this, one of the simplest algorithms, the binary search in a sorted array, has been coded incorrectly by nearly everyone for decades. It was broken in Java’s binary search function, and broken in most textbooks. If we can’t get this right and multitudes of professional software engineers never noticed the problem for so many years, then it is silly to think that you can implement from memory any algorithm unless it is extremely non-trivial.
