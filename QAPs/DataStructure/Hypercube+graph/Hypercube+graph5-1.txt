Lots of magical numbers out there. Mathematically, I'd go with the Golden Ratio (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gol...), which is related to the Fibonacci sequence. And then there is the table of physical constants, for if any were different the universe is completely unrecognizable, possibly impossible: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phy... (My favorite from this list: Avogadro's number because it is really, really big.) As for Mystical numbers: Many words for the numbers in Chinese (Cantonese, although this is true in other regions too) are associated with similar sounding words with meanings. Thus 8 is associated with luck/wealth. From this some number combinations are very "lucky" in China. 99 = doubly long in time, hence eternal. 888 = Three times the prosperity, means "wealthy wealthy wealthy". And 168 is also considered lucky and used at a prefix for many, premium-pay telephone numbers. In the Bible, three (the trinity), seven and ten occur regularly. Seven is considered lucky in the Western world and often used for lists (seven sins, seven seas, seven ages of man, etc.)
