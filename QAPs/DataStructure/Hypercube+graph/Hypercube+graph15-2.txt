What math topic should I teach to middle school students?
I'd suggest some introductory statistics: things like Bayes theorem, the definition of correlation, and the difference between correlation and causation.  It's probably the most useful bit of math that could be taught at the middle school level but that many college graduates are never exposed to. For a less practical alternative, a lecture on chaos, fractals, and non-linear dynamics could be interesting.  Obviously you can't go into non-linear differential equations, but the behavior of simple iterated functions is something you could introduce without needing a lot of background knowledge.  Also, fractals look cool.  If you have a laptop and a projector for it, you could download one of a number of free fractal generating programs and get the class to give you equations to input.  I tried ChaosPro and like it, though it takes some work to figure out how to substitute your own equations for the standard ones.
