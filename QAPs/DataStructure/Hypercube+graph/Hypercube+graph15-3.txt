What math topic should I teach to middle school students?
Actually I think the most useful thing you can do is taxonomize math and science so they can understand where they're going. They rarely have the opportunity to talk to someone who sees this as a full picture, and as for the specifics of math, for a 13 year old who's talented enough to learn group theory, they're talented enough to learn it on their own. The others you may find might be phenomenally advanced but still not quite advanced enough to cover what you suggest in 8 45-minute sessions.
