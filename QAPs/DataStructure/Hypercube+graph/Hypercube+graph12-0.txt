Do I move through the 4th dimension? What about the 5th or 6th?
I already got stuck on your way of thinking in "the" particular nth dimension. As far as the accepted state of physics goes, we live in 'Minkowski space', that is composed of 3 spatial and 1 temporal dimensions. There is no way of assigning any special enumeration to these dimensions, it is not as if the '3rd' dimension automatically means 'up', cause there is no 'up' without defining which direction you move if you change your 3rd coordinate. This means, dimensions are a way of describing the _independent_ directions that you already know you're moving in. If you feel that you are moving in another dimension than the previously labelled (3 spatial (you can move freely here), 1 time (not here)), and this new dimension is independent from the other ones (think of vectors in linear algebra), you are free to call it 'a' 5th dimension whatsoever. You might go into the esoteric direction and claim that your life experience / spiritual state of mind / etc. is such an independent direction, however, that would be your own choice, not widely accepted physics. Which doesn't mean the concept couldn't help you in your question.
