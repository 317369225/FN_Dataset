In what proof was Graham's number used or discovered?
Graham's number was specifically devised for a proof in Ramsey Theory Connect each pair of geometric vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube to obtain a complete graph on 2n vertices. Colour each of the edges of this graph either red or blue. What is the smallest value of n for which every such colouring contains at least one single-coloured complete subgraph on four coplanar vertices? Source wikipedia.
