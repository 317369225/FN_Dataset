Do they use DFS, BFS algorithms or algorithms of such kind in routing?
BFS and DFS can be used for routing, but there are better alternatives. Not to say they aren't being used because they probably are, but not in IP routing. BFS calculates the shortest path by minimizing the number of edges between the nodes. In contrast, Dijkstra's algorithm which is derived from BFS, calculates the shortest path by minimizing the cost of the edges between the two nodes. Basically, with BFS, you can create a Link-State version of RIP. The obvious advantage in regards to routing is that Dijkstra can use the bandwidth as cost, thus giving a better picture of the network. For example, you have two routers directly connected by one T1 (1.544 Mbps) link which can also be connected through other routers using three 1 Gbps links. The better path is using the 1 Gbps links because they are significantly faster. Dijkstra will give the correct result, however BFS will not. BFS simply sees this as "1 link" vs "3 links" and will consider "1 link" to be the shorter path. Using the same cost on all edges makes Dijkstra behave the same way as BFS. Here's an article on IEEE about DFS and routing. In this kind of architecture, the links are most likely of the same type, thus making the cost between two nodes irrelevant. In this case, Dijkstra is slower than BFS/DFS due to its complexity.
