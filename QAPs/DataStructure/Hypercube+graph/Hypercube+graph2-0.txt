Is there a mathematical notation suitable for representing the permutations of dimensions of a hypercube graph (2^n)?
Are you striving for efficiency of for clarity? If clarity, your 80-character long strings can represent the flips and permutations, for example "[1:2][3-4-5][4:8][8-1-2]", etc. If efficiency, store them directly or almost directly as SSE2 instructions and write a script that would quickly populate them with longer descriptions, perhaps in another file. Technically, if you live in *nix world, it's one Makefile target to convert one (or all) of these compact representations to a longer, human-readable version, and .gitignore for those autogenerated files for them to not pollute the repo. I'd probably go with that solution.
