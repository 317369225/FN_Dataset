Which are the most magical numbers?
I have an interesting number here. Consider the following problem in graph theory: Consider an [math]n[/math]-dimensional hypercube, and connect each pair of vertices to obtain a complete graph on [math]2^n[/math] vertices. Then colour each of the edges of this graph either red or blue. What is the smallest value of [math]n[/math] for which every such colouring contains at least one single-coloured complete subgraph on 4 coplanar vertices? The answer is a positive integer, which has been proven by mathematicians that it is between 13 and Graham's number. What is Graham's number actually? According to Stephen Fry from QI, it is a number so big that all the materials in the universe will not be able to write the number. All we know that it ends with... 7 (no, not really.) According to some, Graham's number is the biggest number ever written on a mathematical paper. If you want to appreciate how big Graham's number is, you can try to look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gra... Updated 175w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
