What is the highest exact number ever calculated, and for what purpose was it used?
As I've alluded to in a comment to Vincent Chu's answer, it's quite possible that any sufficiently big real life quantity can't really be known exactly (and its exact value itself wouldn't really serve a purpose, only satisfy your curiosity, like one might say math does). Any number you see would be an estimate based on data, but also on assumptions and hence would be a made up mathematical number. So, I've decided to provide some meaningful exact numbers that have been computed and that are candidates for an answer: The biggest known prime number [math]2^{43,112,609}-1[/math] (it has almost 13 million digits). In this case, it's very important to have computed this number on the nose because being prime is a very fickle property. So this is a large number whose exact value is valuable. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mer... for more details. In fact, it's possible that at this point higher numbers of the form [math]2^p-1[/math] have been computed exactly but have turned out not to be prime, so haven't been publicized. The biggest known number that has actually been used by humanity (albeit in a mathematical proof, though in Ramsey theory which is a fairly concrete thing) appears to be "Graham's number" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gra...). This is much bigger than the biggest prime number; in fact, the observable universe is apparently too small to contain a decimal representation of this number. But unlike the biggest prime number, its exact value is not as important: it occurs as an upper bound to the dimension of a hypercube involved in a certain graph colouring problem. So, for example, any number bigger than it would also be useful for the same purpose.
