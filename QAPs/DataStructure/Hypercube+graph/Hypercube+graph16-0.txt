What are Graham's number and Tree(3) used for?
Graham's number and TREE(3) are not really "used" for anything. They are both examples of extremely large numbers that emerge naturally from calculations intended to solve problems arising out of graph theory. They are both finite integers. The truly interesting thing about them is their sheer jaw dropping size. Background on big numbers: Both of these numbers are far too large to represent without resorting to some form of Tetration which is a generalized form of exponentiation. There is a variety of notations for this and at first it looks deceptively simple This "tower of powers" form represents n copies of a combined by exponentiation, right-to-left. Donald Knuth's up-arrow notation does the same thing, so [math]a\uparrow n = n_a[/math]. For example [math]3_2 = 2\uparrow 3 = 2^{2^{2}} = 16[/math] but [math]4_2= 2\uparrow 4 = 2^{2^{2^{2}}} = 65,536[/math] so you get the idea that these numbers grow very quickly. Knuth's notation generalizes to multiple arrows, which gets very big very fast. Examples: Back to the numbers: Graham's number  became recognized (for a time) as the largest named number. There are larger known numbers now. There are two published versions of Graham's, both of which are estimated as upper bounds for the solution to a certain problem in Ramsey theory. The question involves obtaining a complete [math]2^{n}[/math] subgraph by connecting the vertices of n-dimensional hypercube. How big is it? In Knuth's notation Graham's number is composed of 64 layers where the number of arrows in each layer, starting at the top layer, is specified by the value of the next layer below it; that is, and where a superscript on an up-arrow indicates how many arrows there are. In other words, G is calculated in 64 steps: the first step is to calculate g1with four up-arrows between 3s; the second step is to calculate g2 with g1 up-arrows between 3s; the third step is to calculate g3 with g2 up-arrows between 3s; and so on, until finally calculating G = g64 with g63 up-arrows between 3s. So ya, it's big. The TREE sequence is a wildly growing function also arising out of graph theory. How fast does it grow? The first two values are 1 and 3. The third is TREE(3), and it is notable because it is vastly larger than Graham's number. I'm not even going to try to write it down in LateX. You can read about it on the web. I recommend at least having a cursory read of the links I provided. The thing I would like you to take away is that these are both very large but otherwise ordinary finite integers. You could add one to them. You could square them, or raise them to another arbitrarily large integral power and they would still be finite integers. You should keep this in mind when you see values of [math]\infty[/math] popping out of equations or being bandied around as a plausible value of something physical. Both of these numbers are gigantically larger than our estimates of the mass and volume of the observable universe. In fact, if the universe began with a radius of almost zero and after the big bang it expanded at the speed of light from the first instant until now, the radius of the universe would still only be on the order of [math]1.3\times 10^{26}[/math] meters. That's only [math]10^{-74}[/math] of a Googol, so not even noticeable in the scale of big numbers. If you don't like the speed of light, use 100 times the speed of light, or a billion times. That would still only get you up to a radius of [math]1.3\times 10^{35}[/math] meters. Infinity is not something that can be reached, no matter how far or how long you go. So when you see an [math]\infty[/math] treat it with a degree of skepticism. It makes perfect sense as a mathematical object, just don't expect it to make any physical sense.
