If just Earth, with no space around it, was a computer simulation, how many of the fastest CPU/GPUs available today would it take to simulate everything in the world simultaneously?
That depends on the level and accuracy of the simulation you want. To the level of animals? Blades of grass? Individual cells? Individual proteins? Molecules? Atoms? Quarks? Simulation interval seconds? Frames? milliseconds? Femto seconds? Planck time units? But the weather people have already shown that simulation must always be approximate: no matter how much processing power you throw at it, you can only keep simulation and reality in step for a finite time.
