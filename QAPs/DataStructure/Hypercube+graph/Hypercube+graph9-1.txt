What is the highest meaningful number in mathematics?
Graham's number. Meaningful in that it actually has some purpose in a mathematical proof, namely, as the upper bound for this problem: Connect each pair of geometric vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube to obtain a complete graph on 2n vertices. Colour each of the edges of this graph either red or blue. What is the smallest value of n for which every such colouring contains at least one single-coloured complete subgraph on four coplanar vertices? The number itself has a value much larger than the number of particles in the universe. The number of digits in the number itself also has a value much larger than the number of particles in the universe. As one Internet video put it, it would be impossible for a human to conceive of Graham's number in its entirety, as the mass you would need to store that much information in the volume of a skull would collapse into a black hole. The equation you see above uses Knuth's up-arrow notation, where each up arrow determines how many nested exponents you use. So 3↑↑↑↑3 is 3^3^3^3, a number so large, I can't find a calculator to solve it. The second layer of Graham's number uses 3↑↑↑↑3 up-arrows in between the threes, the third layer uses as many up-arrows as the value of the second layer, and so on. If you ask me, this upper bound isn't really that helpful for solving the problem. But I suppose it's a start. Updated 80w ago • View Upvotes
