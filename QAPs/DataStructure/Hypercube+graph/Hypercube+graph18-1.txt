What are 4d figures?
When Euclid made the famous postulate that "There can be only 3 mutually perpendicular lines drawn" He actually proved that no matter how hard a human tries, he can't visualise more than 3 mutually perpendicular lines, i.e. he can't visualise more than 3 dimensions. Therefore Visualising a 4 D figure is impossible, in every sense of the word. However, if we do encounter a 4 dimensional being here's an example which would help you understand what it would look like. Imagine a 2D world flatland. In this, there live 2 Dimensional beings flatlanders. They don't know the direction up. No matter how hard you try, you can't explain them about "depth". This is an image of what it would be like for the if you drop (or here, raise) a sphere through their world. They would see a circle, increasing in diameter, then after a maximum radius again decreasing and then vanishing. Similar is the case if we try to enter. First, they would see two ovals (considering we have worn simple oval shoes), which would increase in width, then merge into a larger circle, with two circles beside (our hands) and so on.... Now you can understand what would happen if 4D beings passed through our world. We would see a peculiar blob, varying in shape size and colour
