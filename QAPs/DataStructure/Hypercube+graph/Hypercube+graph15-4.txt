What math topic should I teach to middle school students?
How about something that might be applicable at some future point in their lives such as the the many applications of the time value of money? On a more mathematical perspective, linear algebra and its application to signal analysis and synthesis might be immensely useful for some of these precocious kids. Maybe even introduce them to a simulation tool such as Matlab. Another neat area is complex numbers, especially if you discuss their geometric interpretations.
