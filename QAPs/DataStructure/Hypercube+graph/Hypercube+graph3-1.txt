What does the sequence A027624 for "Number of independent vertex sets in the n-hypercube graph Q_n" mean?
Thanks for the A2A. An "independent vertex set" of a graph, G, is a set of vertices such that no edge of G has both vertices in the set. (Essentially the same definition as Alan Bustany gave, but he left out the context of the graph.) The sequence in the OEIS is the number of Independent Vertex sets (not necessarily maximal), that exist on the graph of the n-cube. n=0: single vertex n=1: single edge (two vertices) n=2: square (four vertices) n=3: cube (eight vertices) The a(0)=1 term should probably be 2 instead of 1, since both the empty set and the set of the single vertex are independent vertex sets (and vertex covers) of a graph with a single node. In fact, if you look at the history of the OEIS page for A027624 (history), it looks like Eric W. Weisstein (of Mathworld fame) decided to make a correction of the initial term, but later changed his mind. As I am an associate editor for OEIS, I'll post a message to the SeqFan discussion group asking for an explanation.
