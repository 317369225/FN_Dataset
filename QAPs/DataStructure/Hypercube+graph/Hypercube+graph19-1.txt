If just Earth, with no space around it, was a computer simulation, how many of the fastest CPU/GPUs available today would it take to simulate everything in the world simultaneously?
What... like, there's a computer running a sim like Sims for every person on the planet.... and that sim handles everything that the person would do and interact with (to a degree) for the day... ... you could probably have a modern computer handle the load for several people, maybe as many as 100... and then a server to handle the world(s) they interact with... several cities per server, say 1/8th swaths of the surface of the earth, 4 sections per hemisphere, one server per section, each server a super computer.... Probably have a weather computer that handles biological disasters and other issues. So my guess... the equivalent of some 70 million desktop computers to represent the life on the planet, with 8 super computers to handle the planet itself that the life would interact with.
