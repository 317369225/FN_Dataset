What are Graham's number and Tree(3) used for?
I can slightly answer for Grahmn's number. There is some question in math about a 4 dimensional graph and counting something, if obam not mistaken. Mathematicians didn't know what the count was or even if the count was finite. Then, it was discovered that Grahmn's number is an upper bound for the count. Grahmn's number is impossibly big, but it is far less than infinite. The count was indeed finite. The TREE function also deals with graph theory and counting something. It is along the lines of creating trees that cannot be embedded in other trees. For trees of size (or whatever the variable really represents) 1 and 2 the answers are "trivially" 1 and 3. Then for input of 3 it grows impossibly large. Please don't ask for details, this is all I know. Hopefully a math guy will come around and enlighten us all.
