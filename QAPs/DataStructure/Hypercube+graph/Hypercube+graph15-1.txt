What math topic should I teach to middle school students?
Probability, statistical analysis, and statistical inference. Those are crucial tools for living in the 21st century. They can build up some of their own models and do predictions, but perhaps more important is being able to identify when assertions made by others are incomplete, incorrect, misinterpreted, or deliberately misleading. Geometry in greater than three dimensions could also be cool for them. That buys you fun, mind-bending visuals and exposes them to the idea that numbers can describe shapes that can't materially exist in the world of their perception.
