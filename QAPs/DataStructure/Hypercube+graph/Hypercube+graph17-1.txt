Can somebody give me a clear and detailed proof of Sperner's Theorem?
Sperner's theorem follows immediately from the Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality. There are many proofs of this inequality, but here's one by Noga Alon which I like. Let [math]F[/math] be a sperner family of subsets of [math] 1, 2,3, \cdots , n[/math] Then [math]\sum \limits_{f \in F}^{} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{|f|}} \le 1[/math] Proof. Let [math]\sigma[/math]  be a permutation chosen uniformly at random. Consider the family of sets [math] B = \left\{ { \{\phi ,\sigma (1), \sigma (2), \sigma (3), ..., \sigma (i) \}| i \le n}\right\}[/math] Let  [math]X_f[/math] be an indicator random variable such that [math] X_f=1[/math] if [math] f \in B[/math] and [math]0[/math] otherwise. The expected size of [math]B \cap F[/math] is [math]\sum \limits_{f \in F}^{} E[X_f][/math] by the linearity of expectation. For a fixed set  [math]f\in F[/math] , the probability that [math]f \in B[/math] is [math]\frac{1}{\binom{n}{|f|}}[/math] So the expected size of [math]B \cap F[/math] is [math]\sum \limits_{f \in F}^{} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{|f|}}[/math] Notice that [math] |B \cap F| \le 1[/math]  (can you see why?) So [math]\sum \limits_{f \in F}^{} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{|f|}} \le 1[/math] I wrote a few (more detailed) blog posts on this some time ago, perhaps you may be interested in reading them. :)
