Can somebody give me a clear and detailed proof of Sperner's Theorem?
Sperner's theorem is about finding antichains of a set(S) with distinct items. An antichain(A) is the set of subsets of given set such, there no subset S_i which a subset of another set S_j.Where S_i and S_j belong to A. Example: for set {1,2,3,4}:{},{1,2,3,4},{12,13,14,23,24,34},{123,124,134,234},{1234} Each set from left to right is an antichain where the length of subset is increasing from 0,1,2,3,4. Now why cant we have antichains from two sets having different length of subsets?Because out antichain already has all sets of a given length L and considering an element from a smaller set of length L-1 implies that would be subset of some set of length L and same logic goes for L+1. Having said that what is the largest antichain? If you observe while selecting a group of elements from given set(say having items n) to form a subset of length (sayÂ  r), we can do that in nCr ways.And this would also be the length of our antichian with each set having r items. And when is nCr maximum? for r=[math]floor(n/2)[/math] Hence the maximum length of antichain for a set of distinct n elements is [math]n C n/2[/math]
