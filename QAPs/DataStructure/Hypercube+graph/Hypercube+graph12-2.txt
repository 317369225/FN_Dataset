Do I move through the 4th dimension? What about the 5th or 6th?
Any object can move in any dimensional space but the object should have at most the dimensions of space, otherwise the object will not preserve its shape, as others have described. But moving through dimensions is a little bit different. A 2D object can move in 3D space but the trajectory of this object will be 2D. It can create a plane or a cylinder without caps. This comes from the fact that any 2 linearly independent vectors can only span a 2D vector space. A 2D object is an object which is described with 2 linearly independent vectors. It is a little surface. Making our object a 3D object moving in a higher dimensional space, nothing will be different. If you are given opportunity, you can span the whole 3D space but nothing more. This is to say that we cannot move through any dimensions different than 3. But we can live in them and never notice it.
