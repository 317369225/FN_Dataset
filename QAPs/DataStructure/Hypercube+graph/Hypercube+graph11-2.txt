What is the highest exact number ever calculated, and for what purpose was it used?
Two examples off the top of my head (there are undoubtedly more): [math]\pi[/math] was recently calculated to trillions of decimal places [1]. The Bohr magneton [math]g[/math] was computed by Kinoshita to a very high degree of accuracy. The computed value agreed very well with experiments conducted by Gabrielse at Harvard [2].
