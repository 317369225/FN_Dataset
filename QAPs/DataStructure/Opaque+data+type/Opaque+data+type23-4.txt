What are the "lost arts" in your field?
In the seventies of the last century, med students and young docs were so impressed with all the technical advances made e.g. the development of echo(cardio)graphy, CT, MRI and other impressive feats of medical technology, that they forgot that to be a good doctor one should first look at the patient, after taking a history including a social history, and a physical examination which often didn't bring much, think of a differential diagnosis after which we could think of which tests, some using these amazing tools, should be requested. So first look at the person in front of you, after that use all the technology we need to do our work. This is even harder to do when working on an intensive care unit where monitoring and care utilizes a lot of high tech equipment.  The temptation is very strong to just look at the (bad quality) chest X-ray instead of listening to the lungs and heart of the very sick patient lying in this bed in front of you, for you to listen to the back part of the lungs for which the patient would need to be hauled upright and supported at both sides by nurses and other people around because they are too weak to sit own their own. Don't make the mistake a lot of young eager docs do: Belly ache (Often an irritable bowel syndrome)?  Abdominal CT! Headache (Often a tension headache)? Brain MRI! Panicky and claiming patients makes acquiescing an easy way out, instead of the difficult and often unpleasant task of explaining to the patient why these exams aren't necessary ("So you can by just looking at me rule out a tumor, doc?"). This approach dehumanize the patient in front of you:  a case of belly ache, a case of pneumonia, instead of a 70 yo ex laborer with new onset abdominal pains who would merit a lot more attention than someone who has had these chronic complains for years without anybody ever finding any pathology.
