Is intuition a manifestation of rationality operating below consciousness?
Yes and no. Yes, in that there is every reason to believe that intuition is a "rational" process -- a highly parallel and mathematically precise statistical optimization of outcomes based in past observation. What makes it "intuition" is that we don't have introspective access to the steps and factors that produce the conclusions. No, in that intuition is a very different kind of process from what we think of as rational thought. Rational thought is a cognitive process involving systematic, sequential structured reasoning by applying rules to true/false beliefs and hypotheticals. Its sequential and structured nature makes it possible to trace backwards and know how we reached a conclusion. In contrast, intuition most likely happens by the parallel statistical weighing of millions of factors and observation fragments. In the brain, this is probably done at the neuron or circuit level, making it possible to incorporate much more information into an otherwise opaque conclusion. Updated 146w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
