How can I add a JSON file to SQL Server 2008 in C#?
Hello, Instead of saving the JSON data as a binary data or file in SQL Server, you can better parse JSON data and store in a row-based data structure in a database table   Unfortunately, only SQL Server 2016 has support for JSON data SQL Server 2016 JSON Support for Database Developers   For previous SQL Server versions, you can create a T-SQL CLR function which can parse JSON data and then insert the outputs of this function into a database table   You can create CLR objects in SQL Server using VB.NET Shop or C# Here is a sample CLR function: SQL Server String Split T-SQL CLR Function Sample   I hope this helps for a starting point
