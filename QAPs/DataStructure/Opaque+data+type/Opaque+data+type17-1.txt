In layman's terms, what exactly was the discovery announced by the BICEP2 experiment on March 17, 2014?
First of all, things are getting garbled by the news media.  This is not "evidence for the big bang" since the big bang has enough evidence without this finding, and no one in the community has serious questioned the big bang for decades. What this finding is data from much earlier in the big bang than what we had before.  We've believed that very early in the big bang, the universe expanded very rapidly.  This generates gravitational radiation, which affects the microwave background, and we are seeing evidence of the that radiation. Since this comes very, very early in the big bang, this data lets us go much closer to time t=0.  If we are lucky, then we can figure out what happened t<0.  There are a lot of different models right now about what triggered the big bang.  The BICEPS2 data will certainly let us cross out some of those models, and we might be able to narrow down to one particular model. Also, because these happened very early in the big bang, we are seeing how matter behaves at extremely high energies.  At the time of inflation, matter was heated to energies that have not existed anywhere in the universe since the big bang.  Once we know how matter behaves at ultra-high energies, this gives us more pieces of the puzzle to work out a "theory of everything."  This data has already ruled out some scenarios.
