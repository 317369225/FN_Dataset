What databases or persistent stores are recommended for storing large streaming data, such as from sensors?
On persistent data stores front, would recommend you taking a look at: HBase (http://hbase.apache.org) - OpenTSDB (http://opentsdb.net) is a very similar implementation like your sensors data use case. Cassandra (http://cassandra.apache.org) - An article of how to use Cassandra with time series and sensor kind of data (http://rubyscale.com/blog/2011/0...) Both technologies may be a great fit for the use case you have. Also, it's definitely worth to take a look at Storm (http://storm-project.net) for real-time analytics and it integrates well with any queuing and database system. Updated 186w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
