What is New SQL?
<sarcasm> NewSQL is SQL that is newer than old SQL.  Old SQL is very old thus it can't scale or perform.  NewSQL is new thus it scales and performs. </sarcasm> To piggy back on Bill Karwin's answer, this is a term that started to catch on with the advent of in-memory processing databases like VoltDB and MemSQL.  Of course, its not like the engineer's at Oracle and Microsoft haven't thought about in-memory processing.  Virtually all databases have varying degrees of in-memory processing and some give you very fine grain control over it.  It just comes with trade-offs, which the "NewSQL" vendors don't exactly advertise.
