What makes people lose interest in Quora?
When Quora and I met for the first time I was amazed at how well it worked, I saw many interesting and thought-provoking questions. When i look back at my answers from back then and the questions they answered, I feel less and less compelled to even put any effort into answers to ever-repeating questions, especially questions that clearly have no thought put into them, trivial question, Yahoo Answers questions. These days I'm being asked to answer all kinds of uninteresting and mundane questions, I see lots of kids abusing questions to ask for help with homework assignments ( like Yahoo Answers ) ever since asking anyone is free. Yes, I think the credits system was superior to the current non-system. It put some weight into asking someone something, yes, some questions would cost 5000 credits to ask the appropriate person for an answer and such person would feel more compelled to answer that call seeing as the questioner went to the trouble of spending a larger amount of virtual currency on it. Having asking people cost something also encourages people to at least check of maybe there's already an identical question with a good answer already available... The moderation has also changed by my experience. Just the other day I had some troll ( zero questions, zero answers, zero edits, zero followers, following zero people ) flag a comment for allegedly violating BNBR, it was removed right away, no answer to any appeal - Quora used to care a little more, not censor anything anyone wants to be censored. I've heard of more questionable actions than this. I'm also not a big fan of how the feed works these days, it looks more like an echo chamber than a feed of interesting things to take a look at. This used to be different, not sure what exactly changed there though.
