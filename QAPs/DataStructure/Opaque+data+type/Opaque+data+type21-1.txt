What does the concept of Universal Grammar mean?
The observation that babies, regardless of the linguistic environment they find themselves in, acquire at a surprisingly rapid rate and in a relatively fixed order a huge number of complex features and a sizeable vocabulary has lead linguists to believe that the only way such a quantity of intricate information could be digested so aptly by young developing brains was that part of the information must already be available, pre-encoded if you will, in the brains of newborns. Such a conclusion further implies that all languages should share a predetermined underlying set of features that could only surface in a limited set of possible configurations, ie. that we should find universal rules that can account for all variation in word order, sentence structure, sounds, etc., across all human natural languages.
