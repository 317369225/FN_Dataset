Why is there so little respect for designers in the tech industry?
I feel that the relevance of good design has increased ALOT in the past years, also in a development stage. But what you are referring to is coming from the fact that design is subjective, while engineering is largely based on simple functional facts. I'm experiencing this periodically, designers asking for something because it "must be like this", engineering stating "it can't be done for this and this reason, unless we invest additional xx". In the end, when executives have to decide, a engineering assessment offers a much clearer set of conditions with low margin of opinion, while the design department provides largely a opinion, without a strong set of conditions. Compromising on engineering mostly affects costs or functionality, compromising on design leads to a different result without clear measure on how much it actually affected the final product.
