Why is there so little respect for designers in the tech industry?
Because software engineers need reminding that P != NP in the design world, too -- let me elaborate: There's two reasons that contribute: 1) There are often a ton of ways to get design wrong, and only few ways to get it right. 2) The correct designs often look very simple. This means that when an engineer asks, "So what did you come up with?" and the designer shows some work that satisfies both 1 and 2, they scoff, thinking, "I could have done that! That's so simple! Why are we paying this designer so much?" Just because Software Engineers can recognize good design and simple solutions doesn't mean that they can efficiently find them. When engineers don't take into account all the trial and error and failed attempts that didn't work prior to getting the design right, they don't end up respecting the person who produced the end result. Having seen the correct design, any other design seems obviously flawed, and this priming makes it difficult for engineers to realize the blood, sweat, and tears that it takes to design well. Full disclosure: I'm a software engineer.
