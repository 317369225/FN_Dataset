Is corruption as prevalent in America, if not more so than in the so called "third world countries"?
Low level corruption is nearly non-existent. As Christopher Reiss pointed out, bribing a cop to get out of a ticket in America is a recipe for a bad, bad day. And cops are civil servants. They don't make that much money. At all. Hooooooooooowever, our senior politicians are financed in large part by interest groups comprised of the very industries that lawmakers' laws are supposed to regulate (almost every single if not every single industry in America has one of these groups),Â  and write laws based upon what the (very legal, if registered) representatives of large interest groups called "lobbyists" suggest to them with embarrassingly large wads of cash. Oh, I'm sorry, I misspoke. I implied there that the lawmakers actually write the laws. No, that's wrong. The lobbyist firms write draft laws for them. All the politicians have to do is take the money, throw that turd in the hopper, and work on a speech to justify why they're now in favor of whale flaying or whatever.
