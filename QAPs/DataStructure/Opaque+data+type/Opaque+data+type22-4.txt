Why is there so little respect for designers in the tech industry?
This probably was the case so far, but we are seeing a shift in my humble view. In world where the vital combo UI/UX is getting more and more significant, the role of the design specialist wins more and more respect. This is the case not just in social media and mobile applications but also in SaaS and cloud companies. We are even seeing more and more designer as entrepreneurs. It's in the making, but there is a change.
