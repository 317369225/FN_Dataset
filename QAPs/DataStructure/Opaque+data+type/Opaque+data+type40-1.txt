People who've taken Scala into production: what has your experience been like?
Once you go Scala, it's hard to go back to Java. However, there are a few things to keep in mind: Writing libraries in Scala can be a bit problematic. Scala libraries are compiled to a particular major version of Scala. (e.g. 2.9.x, 2.10.x). I've found I save myself a great deal of grief by writing libraries in Java and providing a thin Scala wrapper around the library to get all the Scala goodness. Maven!! The Scala community really seems to push SBT as THE build tool for Scala, but Maven works just fine and currently will cause you much less grief. The first few applications you write in Scala are destined for the great /dev/null in the sky. Don't get too attached to them. There's a lot of sophistication and complexity in Scala and it takes some time to wrap your head around it. Twitter provides some helpful documentation and practices to get going with Scala at http://twitter.github.com/scala_... and http://twitter.github.com/effect... . They are worth the read. There are a lot of very, very smart folks in the Scala community and you can learn a whole lot from them. But take their advice with a grain of salt. Not everything needs to be immutable, you can still use Scala if you don't grok category theory, and Scala is NOT Scalaz. Don't let them scare you off with their high-faluting talk about applicative functors, lenses, and comonads. There's some gotcha's in high-performance coding with Scala. Be careful about unintended Boxing/Unboxing of primitives (Double, Float, Long, etc) and understand why while is much faster than for in Scala Take your coffee breaks while the Scala compiler is running.
