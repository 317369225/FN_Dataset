Is there a possibility that "junk" DNA could be nature's comments in our programming?
No. Just to dismiss the obvious part first, don't anthropomorphize evolution. It has no need to leave notes to itself. It has no plan and no goal. Slightly less obviously, the real problem here is that the term "junk" DNA is a misnomer. Non-coding DNA has a number of purposes, and changes to it affect the way chromosomes form, cells do signaling, and transcription is performed. These functions are a lot more complicated than the basic DNA code, and so much harder to understand, but that doesn't mean they're useless. The similarity of non-coding DNA between species suggests that changes to it do not occur easily, and thus must be relevant. There is very little "junk". But setting all that aside, the answer is just plain "no".
