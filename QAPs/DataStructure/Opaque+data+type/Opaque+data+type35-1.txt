Big Data: What kind of data science could you do with the usage information of a ski resort?
If you only had the data you could determine the same things you could determine through observations: People eat lunch at noon Blue slopes have the most utilization Chairlifts that service blue/green are going to be busisists Women prefer easier runs - and the associated chairs Younger men prefer harder runs - and the associated chairsAt the end of the day, that's not really that interesting. What is interesting is....               how you could change behavior So if you were to look at the women who prefer easier runs vs women who are skiing on harder runs.  What is the difference? Age Family members Years of skiing Year of first skiing experience If you a resort you'll looking for two things Increased guest satisfaction - reduced crowding is an easy one (on the hill) Increases in frequency of visits What changes do you need to make to your mountain to increase satisfaction and increase participation.  This can't really be done with the cold dataset, but would need to be done with lots of A/B testing through out points in the season.
