C++ (programming language): How do you judge a C++ programmer by only 5 questions?
What are some things about c++ that you found out recently? [for any level. Tells you about his learning habits] What advise will you give to a junior developer in your team? [for any level. Tells you how he knows about and cares for good practices, and whether he can distinguish them from personal tastes] Which STL container is your favorite and Why? [2+ years. Tests space/time complexity understanding.] Which features of C++ you avoid in spite of knowing them well? [4+ years. Tests thoughtfulness vs eagerness to use whatever feature he discovers. ] If you were to design a better C++, what would you change? [6+ years. Tests broader knowledge across technologies, multiple paradigms, tradeoffs in design etc.]EDIT: Thanks a lot for this question! I routinely have to take interviews, and I always wondered how to test a candidate in a short time. I have never asked  the questions that I mentioned above. It was only after I read this question, that I thought of those. May be we can think better when a constraint is available (like only 5 questions). I will surely use these henceforth. EDIT2: If you are a good C++ developer looking for a challenging job in Pune, send me your CV :) Updated 49w ago • View Upvotes
