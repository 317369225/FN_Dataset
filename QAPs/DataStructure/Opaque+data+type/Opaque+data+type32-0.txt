Is corruption as prevalent in America, if not more so than in the so called "third world countries"?
There is far more corruption in developing countries (many of which are considered "third world" even though it is an outdated term). Of course, this depends on the countries being compared to the United States. That said, it's pretty tough to beat how accountable the United States is held from the president of the United States on down to local police officers. I have lived and worked in the "third world" and am from the United States. Bribes may be the most common and visible portion of this. From airport security guards to traffic cops to massive bribery for political officers. Of course, it can go much further than that. But let's look at what some of the people who study this for a living are saying. This is a screenshot from the corruption perceptions index, highlighting the United States' 17 out of 175 rank. As you can see, the United States does pretty well on the whole. Meanwhile, many developing countries are a dark or vibrant red, ranging toward the bottom. The countries that are "beating" the United States in the corruption perceptions index tend to be highly developed and Europe-centric. Many people who argue for campaign finance reform in the United States will mention legalized Corruption. I would argue that many developing countries still have "legalized corruption" in a similar manner as well as much broader systemic corruption and casual corruption.
