Big Data: What kind of data science could you do with the usage information of a ski resort?
This is often used in business to passively analyze current customers and note patterns/trends. Who, what, when, and where.  simplistically, you can look at what customers are drawn towards, what they avoid, and then look at both 1. Ways to improve their experience in what they already like - kicking up the profit margin. & 2. Identifying trouble spots; routes, lifts, etc with a lack of interest. You can either combat that by altering it and making it appealing to consumers; or the data may tell you it's not financially stable and stop putting money into what the customers use the least. In retail the "sales" pattern is seasonal (special occasions, gifts) so an analysis of a business such as you described may show a large discrepancy in accounts payable depending on the year's quarter. If you know when people are not likely to come, you can cut staff hours, perform necessary repairs you wouldn't want to do with a full house, and most importantly - make short and long term financial forecasts.
