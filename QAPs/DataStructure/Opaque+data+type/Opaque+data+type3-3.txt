Why has there been an explosion of different data storage technologies in recent years?
You can probably find many many answers to this question. Let me start with the following reasons. Large scale applications : today when you develop a successful application (Web, Mobile) the number of users, or volume of data is really huge. You need to have a database/storage that allows you to handle that properly. For example, social mobile applications can have a crazy growth, for example the DrawSomething application move from 0 to 36 million of users, from 0 to 1 billion drawing in a month! NoSQL databases for example have been built to manage this helping developers and system administrators to easily add new ressources (new commodity servers) to store more data and handle more users. This is also a good fit to leverage the cloud infrastructure and its elasticity (for example Amazon EC2) I am not saying that it is not possible with an RDBMS, but using some NoSQL databases that have been designed to scale. Flexible data model : with agile development method, it is important to be able to push new version of your application in production easily. New databases/storage allows developer to store different structures, and change the structure of data easily. This helps the developer to push new version of the app to production. Manage "big data": new systems like Hadoop allows you to store almost anything, and analyze these data in an efficient way. Once again this leverage a large number of machine : distribute the data and the processing on multiple nodes.
