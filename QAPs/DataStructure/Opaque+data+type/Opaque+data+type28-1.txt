What would VCs think if a startup buys early customers?
I am not a VC. But, I can tell you how it would look from the viewpoint of a potential team member and an experienced business owner.   If you must resort to buying customers, there is something ****VERY WRONG**** with your marketing plan (a.k.a. your business model).   Review the 5 Ps, over and over, not stopping until you find the flaw and/or conclude that the business is simply not workable. Purchased customers prove that a business it is not feasible. See Marcas Neal's answer to What are the best books about business model generation? EDIT -- Your founder is committing fraud/bribery against the government with that plan; it is illegal and will get both you and any politician/official who goes for the deal in *VERY DEEP* legal trouble (criminal offenses). It's not worth it.
