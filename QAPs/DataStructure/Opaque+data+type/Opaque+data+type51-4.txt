Why are some Americans opposed to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)?
One reason is the first three syllables. When you ask people about the program using a different name, their opinion of it is higher.Â  For example, in a poll in Kentucky, far more people liked "Kentucky Care" than "Obama Care" even though it's the same program.
