What are the strangest airplane accidents/incidents?
US Airways Flight 1549, January 15, 2009. A US Airways plane with 155 people aboard flew into a flock of geese and lost power in both engines after taking off from La Guardia Airport on its way to Charlotte, N.C. The pilot, Capt. Chesley B. Sullenberger, splash-landed the plane in the icy Hudson River. Ferries and rescue boats swarmed toward the plane from both banks of the river, and all on board were brought to shore safely in a dramatic episode that made Mr. Sullenberger a national hero to many. Here are some of the pictures of the event. Here is a documentary on this miraculous rescue. Credit: YouTube, Google, Wikipedia. References : US Airways Flight 1549   Chesley Sullenberger
