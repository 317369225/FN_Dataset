Is there a possibility that "junk" DNA could be nature's comments in our programming?
As other responders have pointed out, "junk" DNA is surely not there for the purpose of helping us understand how the DNA works.  But there is a sense in which a substantial amount of junk DNA is code that has been "commented out".  (If you're a programmer I'm sure you understand that term.) What happens is that when a piece of DNA becomes harmful -- whether because it comes from a retrovirus or some other reason -- it has a strong tendency to get chemically modified so that it no longer is expressed.  The most common type of modification is called "methylation"; at a conceptual level methylating a chunk of DNA is comparable to commenting out a chunk of source code that is no longer functional.
