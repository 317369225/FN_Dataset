People who've taken Scala into production: what has your experience been like?
Having done Scala in prod, I'd say the following tips: - dont feel a need to use EVERY scala library. For example we used jetty+jersey, not lift. Figuring out lift seemed excessively complex on our short timeline. - do use maven and intellij.  While everyone in the scala community cried over the sbt stuff, I kept productivity up with intellij.  I tried eclipse, but against my code base size, it just couldnt keep up. - maven has lots of nice integration with jenkins, so it isnt all bad - keep an eye on the product development, endless arguments about what is 'proper scala' can be dangerous. Save it for the bar. - dont be afraid to use Java when you have to.  Scala isn't a ideologically pure language, and any modern productive programmer shouldnt be either. Sometimes Java is better, it is smaller and lighter for some operations.
