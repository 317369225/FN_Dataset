What does it feel like to be an employee of a company that goes public?
I can only speak for myself, but... When you first hear about it, as an employee, it feels like when you make plans for a vacation.  You know something big/exciting/different is about to happen, but don't know quite what to expect, given the big day is not yet near.  The employee atmosphere quickly turns to 'ho-hum,' and it quickly becomes just another day at the office. On the big day, it's like telling a secret you've never told before or going on stage and being the only one there.  Suddenly, the spotlight is on you (i.e. the company) and all eyes are watching with great interest.  You may see your CEO on the Internet ringing the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange.  Suddenly, what was so private, isn't so private anymore.  If you were granted stock options (or purchased shares at a discount), you frantically check the stock prices every five minutes.  The atmosphere is one of hope, optimism and anticipation.  Everybody has the distinct feeling that they are "about" to become rich, expecting the stock will jump five-fold on the first day of trading. If you were on the IPO team, the big day is like crossing the finish line to a marathon.  It is a grueling journey with thousands of man hours and millions of dollars spent.  It was the biggest distraction from your regular duties you'll have ever gone through.  Failure is not an option.  My only 22 hour work day was during an IPO (I was on the IPO team), followed by two hours of sleep, followed by another 20 hour day.  When the opening bell rings, you say to yourself, "I'm glad that's over."
