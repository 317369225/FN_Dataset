Why is there so little respect for designers in the tech industry?
Some companies (especially some early stage start-ups) see design as a luxury.Â  To be fair engineers can make software without a designer. It's rare the converse is true. As companies mature, design often gets a seat at the table. I've had the good fortune to have worked in several organizations where design has equal "respect and authority" to the engineering organization. That being said, respect is earned, and as for "authority", I think a healthy environment is one where neither design nor engineering has "authority" over the other; but rather work in concert for the good of the user.
