What are the strangest airplane accidents/incidents?
May 07, 2015 Jet Airways Flight 9W063: Pilot falls ill at controls in mid-air The Jet Airways flight, which had 200 passengers on board, was halfway through its journey from Bangkok to Delhi when the co-pilot informed the Air Traffic Control of the midair scare and the captain couldnâ€™t take the stick. Co-pilot Samir Malhotra suddenly noticed the pilot was sleeping & then to his astonishment he found the pilot has fainted & lost his consciousness. ( This sounded funny but even more scary ) He was then forced to take over the aircraft though he wasn't confident enough to make an emergency landing all alone. But luckily a Jet Airways pilot was travelling as a passenger, who assisted co-pilot Samir to make a safe emergency landing. He joined the co-pilot in the cockpit and the pair landed at the Indira Gandhi international airport. The Captain was being looked after by a Doctor that was traveling as a passenger on board the flight.
