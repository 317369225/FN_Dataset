What are the "lost arts" in your field?
I do not have a field as such, but I use the Internet for everything in my personal and business endeavors both so I will comment on what I believe is a 'lost art' as it relates to finding information quickly and efficiently. I am very good at finding things on the Internet and I believe it is because I spent hundreds of hours at a library searching through card files and familiarizing myself with the seemingly arbitrary classifications within the Dewey decimal taxonomy.  When I needed a book, I had to find it physically using only the topic categorization of the general subject. If the book I had selected was not the right one, I would only know this by skimming the contents and index to find what I was looking for. This forced me to learn more about the particular category and book. I would also browse other books in its vicinity, storing the information for later searches. Many times I would pick up an interesting book regardless of whether or not it was what I needed. If I guessed wrong or selected the wrong book, it was often a three to five minute roundtrip from the physical book, back to the card files.  This penalty forced me to get better at searching and I did.  It also taught be about classifications and indexing, both of which are are central to the way information is digitally managed and retrieved. I realize now that I was in essence 'surfing' the library in the same manner that I 'web surf' nowadays. It's just a lot easier and more gratifying these days. The advent of the Internet has made searching (and finding) relatively easy. My kids do not understand that there are deeper layers and multiple approaches that can be used for elucidating the correct keywords or search terms. They ask in plain English and hope they get lucky.  I hope they learn how to use a library more rigorously in college because this is an "art" that pays for itself in spades if you are adept at it. Thanks for the A2A.
