What are some things I can learn in minutes?
Learning to use a Fire Extinguisher. This might save your life someday. Remember the PASS word (Pull - Aim - Squeeze - Sweep) Pull Pull the pin in the handle. This will also break the tamper seal. Aim Aim the nozzle (or its hose) at the base of the fire. (Don't touch the plastic discharge hose on CO2 extinguishers, it gets very cold and may damage skin) Squeeze Squeeze the lever (operating handle) slowly. This discharges the extinguishing agent. Sweep Sweep from side to side till you completely extinguish the fire. If the fire re-ignites, repeat step 2 to 4. Yup! That's it. Now you know how to operate a fire extinguisher. Word of Caution: Don't attempt to extinguish any fire if there is a threat to your safety. If the fire is small and you know how to use a fire extinguisher, you  can attempt to extinguish the fire. Fires can  increase in size and intensity in seconds, blocking the exit path as well as create a hazardous atmosphere. Before attempting to extinguish a fire, activate the fire alarm system. Know what kind of fire you're dealing with. If you use the wrong type of extinguisher, you might make the problem  worse. If you're not sure, let the fire department handle it. Make sure the extinguisher is in good condition and periodically inspected. Face the fire in the direction of wind. Aim the extinguisher so the extinguishing agent travels in the direction of the wind, away from the user. Other than the type mentioned above, there are few extinguishers (see image) which can be operated by rotating the knob in the anticlockwise direction (just like opening a water tap).
