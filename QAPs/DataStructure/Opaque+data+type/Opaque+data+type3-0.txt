Why has there been an explosion of different data storage technologies in recent years?
The biggest contributing factor to this is the relatively cheap cost of computing power.  Combine that with the value companies have realized in analyzing data and you see what we have today. None of the technologies are new ideas.  Columnar stores like hBase or Vertica have been around a while.  Key-Value stores of the NoSQL stores are nothing new.  Even Hadoop, at its core, is a file system.  What has changed is how these technologies scale thanks to cheap servers.  If you needed the kind of compute power of a large Hadoop cluster 10 years ago, you had to pay a company like IBM or Cray upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars to build a supercomputer. Back in the late 90s, Google realized there was a lot of value in analyzing all their web traffic, which was both massive in size and completely structureless.  They had no way to store & process the data.  No technology existed that they could use to do it.  So they had to invent it.  The whitepapers that Google researchers wrote created something of a renaissance for new storage technologies. It's also fair to note that Teradata has been doing the same concept of horizontal scaling that the newest databases use since the late 80s.  Until recently, they primarily focused on relational databases.
