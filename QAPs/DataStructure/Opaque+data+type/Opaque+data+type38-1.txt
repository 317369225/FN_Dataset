What are the advanced topics in C which are not taught in college but one must know?
A few I had to learn on my own: How to design APIs that expose only what the API user needs to know, without the user needing to #include your library's whole world. How to create and handle truly dynamic data structures that have associated "descriptions", but are otherwise seemingly unformatted, but contiguous, blobs of memory.  These are heavily used in both db engines and in networking. How to debug.  I don't think I had a single hour of instruction in debugging.  Not sure if younger developers have any courses in it, but judging by how badly they usually handle debugging, I'd guess not. Related to debugging, how to detect memory leaks, and how to test for memory leaks. Macros: when to use them and when not to. Function pointers: why they're useful, when and how to use them, etc.
