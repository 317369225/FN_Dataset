What are the "lost arts" in your field?
Black & White Photography I learned photography at the end of the analog era. I can remember trips to the darkroom to load my black & white film, process the film and make enlargements from the negatives. Prints from those negatives are still treasured by me today because each one was unique. I printed my photos full-frame, which means that the composition that I did when I shot the photo was the same when I printed it. That process taught me about getting the shot right. There are people still doing b&w photography, but it is rapidly becoming a lost art. While I have fond memories of b&w photography, I don't miss sucking up all those chemicals after an all-nighter in the darkroom! Speaking of Getting the Shot Right... Something else that's rapidly becoming a lost art in photography is nailing the composition, exposure, focus and lighting when you take the shot. Digital photography allows for an infinite number of fixes once you're working the photo. You can take an average shot and make it shine if you know what you're doing. However, I see a lot of inexperienced photographers (and some pros) who take terrible photos and try to fix that in Photoshop. No program can fix deep foundational issues. It pays to get it right when you snap the shutter. Don't get me wrong, Photoshop has saved my ass on many occasions. I'm not a purist either; I like to cook my photos to give them some "pop." Photoshop and Lightroom are wonderful, but they are not a substitute for good photography. Want to read more from me about photography on Quora?
