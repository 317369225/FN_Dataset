What databases or persistent stores are recommended for storing large streaming data, such as from sensors?
It depends on you data requirements. If possibility of losing data is acceptable, you can select very scalable non-ACID DBMS system, like Cassandra or possibly Hadoop with Spark (Apache Sparkâ„¢ - Lightning-Fast Cluster Computing) . If every data piece is critical, you have to select ACID compliant system - like ORACLE, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc or NewSQL systems, like VoltDB, etc that are also very scalable while ACID compliant.
