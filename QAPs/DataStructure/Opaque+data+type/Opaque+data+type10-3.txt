What is the difference between SAS and R languages?
I'm not a super-skilled programmer, so you may want to take this with a pinch of salt. However, I anyway seem to spend most of my worktime in R developing algorithms. I find it generally true that from a programming point of view, R is a mish-mash. However, from the same point of view I find SAS absolutely absurd. I mean - Don't get me wrong. It's really powerful and has really good and informative output. I used to love it, but less so now that I migrated to R a few years back. It is still my favorite go-to-program for repeated measures mixed models. But SAS doesn't follow the same kind or programming logic as I'm used to. If you have experience from scientific or mathematical/numeric/statistical programming, chances are that you'll find coding SAS a bit awkward. However, with those same experiences, you'll most likely be off to a flying start in R. Personally, the main advantage in using R comes when developing new or customised statistical algorithms. R has the stats power and the syntax which makes it easy for me to do this. Plus, of course, the plethora of tools out there - In Bioconductor or on GitHub mostly. Peter's caveat is however super valid: You'll have to be able to read code to use stuff properly (especially if you're using non-base stuff) - And this can take a lot of time! But like with most things, the more you do it, the better and faster you'll get. In SAS you can be pretty sure it's thoroughly tested, validated and with solid support. HTH
