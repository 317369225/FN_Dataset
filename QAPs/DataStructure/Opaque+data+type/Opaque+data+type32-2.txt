Is corruption as prevalent in America, if not more so than in the so called "third world countries"?
No. Try to bribe a cop that's pulled you over and ... You're going to have a pretty bad day.    Similarly for judges, health inspectors, etc. For the most part America plays by the rules compared to, say, Mexico. A lot of it is simple standard-of-living.   It's harder to bribe people who earn enough to support their family.   We may, however, want to draw a distinction between "micro-corruption" and "macro-corruption." While you can't slip a cop a hundred bucks to get out of a speeding ticket, Goldman and Sachs or Monsanto can influence lawmakers to the tune of billions. In sheer dollar value, the USA is possibly the most "macro-corrupt" country on earth.
