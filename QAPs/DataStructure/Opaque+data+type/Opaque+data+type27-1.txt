What are the changes that a student would like to see in the faculty at BITS Pilani?
I don't know how many of you agree with this but i think the most important change that i would love to see in the faculty at bits is to stop "Teaching" and start "Inspiring". Personally, I've had some really great teachers during school and intermediate. In retrospect the only difference i see between them and the average Bits faculty is that the Bits faculty fails to inspire us / motivate us to do better. Of course there are exceptions, and i'm not saying this just to sugarcoat my answer. Maybe the senate can create a program where these much respected and admired exceptions (voted for by students) can instruct the other faculty and try to improve the overall skill levels of the faculty. And how come no one has mentioned about the politics between profs? Not to mention names but each dept has its own sub cliques. the Marathi clique, the Bengali clique, the Andhra clique etc etc. If a student does a project under a powerful Prof from one of the cliques its rest assured that he will not be able to do a project under any prof from the other cliques. These problems exist in every college out there, but as Anon 1 put it, This is BITS PILANI !
