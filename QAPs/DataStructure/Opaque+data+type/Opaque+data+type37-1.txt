How many questions answered does it take to make "Top Writer"?
Being a Top Writer isn't about quantity, but quality. So, if you have 100 immensely good answers that really improve the site, you could be a Top Writer. Alternatively, if you have 2,000 really bad answers of terrible quality, you won't be a Top Writer. So, there really isn't a number of answers, but more a bar of quality that must be met. As for actual requirements to meet Top Writer status, they are unknown to all but a few Quora employees.
