Big Data: What kind of data science could you do with the usage information of a ski resort?
Things came into my mind are: Study of the traffic patterns and figure out the number of equipments needed in general in order to keep both enough equipments and avoid purchasing too many of them Find out repeatedly coming skiers and maybe reward them somehow (discounts maybe?) If there are data about every single record of date-time-sky course that an user used, the resort can figure out popular slopes at different date-time to announce skiers the traffics and maybe able to direct skiers to less popular slopes to avoid excessive waiting time Ski resorts now start to have RFID (radio frequency identification) system, which allows the resort to track a skier’s activity from the moment they start hitting the slopes which can be used to greatly improve the skier’s experience. (more info at:  Even Ski Resorts are Benefiting From the Big Data Explosion | Articles | Big Data) Will keep update if I think of any.
