What’s wrong with OpenID?
You log in with a URL. This blows every user's mind. As per Charlie Cheever's comment inline (he's totally right), some services have implemented a graphical login (meaning you simply click your OpenID provider) but this doesn't necessarily correlate with what a user expects. For example, on Stack Exchange it asks you to "click your OpenID account provider". Most users have no idea what this means. "So I log in with my Google account - but, I want to sign up. I don't want to login to Google." So, I'd argue the user experience of OpenID is not mature enough for most web users. Updated 236w ago • View Upvotes
