How can Bayes' theorem be interpreted in terms of inferring causal relationships in the data?
So far as I know, there is essentially no intrinsic relationship between Bayes and causality, a somewhat opaque subject that's received massive attention in statistics, philosophy, and decision theory. [I can't recommend Judea Pearl's book on Causality highly enough, or summarize its main points in a short post.] But, in the end, Bayesian analysis is a way to incorporate various types of information in a carefully built statistical model (as Andrew Gelman correctly keeps emphasizing). Inferring causality is in a sense orthogonal to whether a Bayesian or Frequentist approach is taken, so far as I know. I'd like to hear others' perspectives on this, though. Speaking of Pearl, he has addressed the topic directly in a somewhat personal and especially accessible paper: http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_..., called "Bayesianism and causality, or, why i am only a half-bayesian". And, speaking of Gelman, there is his book with Meng on this topic, "Applied Bayesian Modeling and Causal Inference from Incomplete-Data Perspectives". But this is really more about missing data and Rubin's perspective than some deep philosophical link between Bayes and causal inference, specifically.
