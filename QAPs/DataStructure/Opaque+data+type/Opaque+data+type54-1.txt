Why is the US government making it illegal to grow food?
The same reason why an abusive boyfriend tells his woman to stay at home rather than visiting her friends: "for safety." I think some major agricultural interests are concerned by the significant market share growth that small farmers have enjoyed over the years. New films about the unseemly nature and risks associated with the factory farms supported by US agricultural subsidies have tarnished the brand reputations of such major firms. HR875 essentially criminalizes small organic farms. One of its sponsors, Rosa DeLauro, is married to Stan Greenberg, a political consultant who works with Monsanto among other clients. Agribusiness corporations want to protect their giant subsidy racket from smaller competitors. But that is, as usual, only the surface reason. If only our political elites were rationally corrupt so that they could be bribed to behave properly. No, this is only the latest expression of the instinct to dominate every aspect of the lives of the citizenry. They throw innocent people in jail for drinking raw milk, just because they can. It's rather like forcing people to walk through the nude scanner. It's humiliating and demeaning. And don't think for a second that your rulers don't derive great pleasure from your pain.
