Theoretically, are Document store and key-value store the same?
No they are not the same. Although both are types of NoSQL databases, Document stores are much more than simple KV stores. The major difference between the two is that - the data (values in k-v store) is opaque to the store, where as the data (documents in document store) is transparent to the store. Roughly, you can think of the document store as another layer over the simple k-v store. As the data is transparent to the store, document stores can index the fields of documents, enabling the user to query not just by the primary key (key for the k-v store) but also by the documents' contents. Regarding your question on JSON data. Well yes, you can always have your k-v store assign a key to each JSON document and retrieve using the primary key. But you won't be able to look into (and query) by the fields in the JSON document.
