What are the changes that a student would like to see in the faculty at BITS Pilani?
Make your own slides if you want to use them! Most of the slides can be found on the websites of UC Berkeley, Kent University etc. When you expect us to be honest and sincere, so do we. The problem with using other professor's slides to teach is that you tend to stick to the slides prepared by someone else and fail to improvise.
