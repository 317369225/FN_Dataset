What is New SQL?
Like NoSQL, NewSQL is a marketing term and therefore has no precise technical definition. It applies to a variety of implementations, with different behaviors and features. That said, most products that count themselves as "NewSQL" have some things in common: Use SQL and the relational model, i.e. each table has a fixed schema that applies to all rows of that table. The technology promises to be more scalable than traditional RDBMS implementations, at least for certain workloads. That's about all we can say about NewSQL databases as a group. Some try to be distributed data stores, scaling out by splitting data over a cluster of servers and allowing applications to query transparently. Examples are Oracle RAQ, MySQL Cluster, Clustrix, or FoundationDB. These optimize for short transactions and fine-grained index lookups. Because queries that span lots of data are likely to touch many individual nodes in the cluster, you lose your scalability benefit. Other types of databases that purport to be "NewSQL" aren't cluster-based, but they do store data differently to optimize for certain workloads. Examples are column stores like Infobright or compressed storage like TokuDB. Updated 11w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Bharath Shivaram
