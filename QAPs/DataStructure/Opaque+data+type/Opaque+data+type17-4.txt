In layman's terms, what exactly was the discovery announced by the BICEP2 experiment on March 17, 2014?
Faint ripples of polarisation in the Cosmic Background Radiation have been found. If the Big Bang was followed by Inflation, then Gravity Waves of this sort would be expected.  Unless the measurements are mistaken, they prove that inflation happened and that gravity is subject to quantum effects. Both of these notions were questions.  And could still be correct even if the measurements are wrong.
