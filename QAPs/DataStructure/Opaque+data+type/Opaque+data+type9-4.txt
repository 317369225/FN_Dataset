What are the differences between Crunch and Cascading?
I helped set up the Cascading infrastructure we used at Wealthfront for data analytics. While Cascading flows were easier to set up than raw Hadoop jobs, the Tuple abstraction became a big productivity drain for our team. All of our data is well-structured (using Avro schemas), and we found ourselves having to debug runtime failures in long-running Cascading flows that the compiler should have caught. Tuples forced us to use magic strings and index numbers instead of type-safe fields. These failures would often happen an hour or so after a job was running, leading to a painful iteration cycle for developers. To solve this problem, we ended up writing type-safe wrappers around Tuples. Our Cascading code looked more like Crunch than Cascading. Maintaining this abstraction layer was a pain, so we eventually switched over to Crunch. We got roughly a 4x productivity boost for the team and jobs typically ran about 20% faster.
