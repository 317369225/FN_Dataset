Is a pure phonetic orthography desirable, at least for English?
I loved Marc Ettlinger's answer.  I just wanted to speculate a little bit. While I agree with all of his explanations as to why reform is very difficult, I believe that spelling reform is inevitable for English but will occur slowly.  The existence of a very large corpus of important published texts is said to be a main reason why languages do not undergo spelling changes easily.  (Once published, word forms become conventional, and conventions are hard to change when there is no centralized way to force change.)  As we rely more and more upon digital text and as English develops as a commonly spoken language in every country, I think it will become not only possible but even desirable to make at least some changes.  The ease with which changes can be made in digital text will help accelerate the process.
