What is the difference between SAS and R languages?
The main difference is that R is open source and free. This allows for implementation in a wide spread of industries ( big data, finance, social analytics). Really is more of a explorers tool I would say. SAS is seen as more of a enterprise standard product. Most big corporation use SAS for data processing for non developers and reporting. SAS does offer different packages of products that dive deep into big data type things and such but it comes at a steeper price. SAS licenses can cost thousands depending on all the tools needed. I would say this is more of a business tool. Both products really can do most of the same things just in different ways. The main appeal of R is that it's free and there is plenty of discussion forums and things of that nature to get started with.
