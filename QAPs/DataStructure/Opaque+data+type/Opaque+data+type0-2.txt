What databases or persistent stores are recommended for storing large streaming data, such as from sensors?
Here are three real time stream processing systems that scale like map reduce but achieve low latency for complex, multi-stage computations.  They are the next cool thing in "big data". Twitter Storm - http://engineering.twitter.com/2... Nokia's Dempsy - http://dempsy.github.com/Dempsy/... Apache S4 - http://incubator.apache.org/s4/ Spark Streaming: Spark Streaming Programming Guide Storm will be available in September.  It differers from S4 and Dempsy in that you can only shed load at the input to the system, whereas the other two allow/force load shedding within the processing steps.  Dempsy is simpler to use than S4 and probably more reliable, but was just released a few months ago.  S4 has been out for over a year and is beginning to get some traction. Spark streaming was released recently and is a great addition to the whole spark ecosystem by adding transactional stream processing. Updated 79w ago • View Upvotes
