What is New SQL?
Indeed, they aim to scale some scenarios, like distributed query, but not others (like long transactions perhaps), and there are multiple tradeoffs. And interesting aspect is that some have a "structuring" layer, on top of a distributed object store, or key-value store, or distributed file system. This structuring layer can be on write, or on read. It can be "relational", "document", "graph", there are quite a few ways of data structuring in persistence. The advantage is that apparently sharding can happen more naturally (via consistent hashing perhaps). Interesting to look at. CockroachDB is one doing that. Last time I checked, they were not very advanced on the implementation though. There are like 15 NewSQL products (including those just being built and including open source vs commercial), as of June 2015, according to Data Platform Map 2015. This is an active research area. I think NoSQL and RDBMS have much to learn from one another, and there is a growing body of research like "HighlyAvailableTransactions, not CAP", which give much better hopes for distributed transactions even in the presence of partitions. So now the issue is not NoSQL vs NewSQL vs RDBMS, but it is 1. use case to technology mapping 2. advancing research coming at least from all the 3 db types, distributed systems research and research discovering the real landscape in which these db types are just some zones, in this contiguity some new systems will emerge, that will probably solve more of the use cases, as well as providing the ability to solve quite different use cases within the same product and perhaps within the same running cluster.
