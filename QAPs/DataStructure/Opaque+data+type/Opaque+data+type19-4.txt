Why are there no startups solving the Real Estate problems?
Full disclosure, I'm the founder of a CRE startup.  I couldn't agree with you more.  For me, the issue was having to pay over $1,500 each month to multiple different platforms and still having to verify data.  While I believe that there are many startups in the CRE space that seem to be doing a good job, they are adding to the problem of fragmentation, in my opinion.  I don't want one more platform that I have to add my lease listings to, and another that I creating my marketing packages at.  I want a platform that has all the tools and services that I need in one place.  Since I couldn't find the solution I needed, I found a great team and we built it.  We have over 30 services and tools integrated into one platform.  We're testing our beta now, so stay tuned.  SnapProp
