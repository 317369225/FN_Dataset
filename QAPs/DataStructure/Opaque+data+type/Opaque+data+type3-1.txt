Why has there been an explosion of different data storage technologies in recent years?
Here are a few reasons that I can think of .. Explosion of data volumes. In today's age of internet and social networking, we are seeing a plethora of data being processed across systems. We are now trying to analyse every trait of a visitor who reaches our web sites. Machine learning algorithms that track user behaviour, develop recommender systems, do forecasting need tons of data. And these data need to be stored in durable media and in a manner that also offers easy query capabilities. We need storages that offer huge read and write scalability far beyond those offered by traditional relational models. Hence we have various kinds of databases that can store data of various shapes and forms. e.g. key-values, documents, JSONs. Because we need to store data for very specialized purposes, it's always advantageous if we can store them in a form which is close to our domain model. This means that there's minimum impedance between the model in which the application processes data and the database stores them. This specialization has led to various kinds of stores with varying capabilities. Relational model is based on a strict schema definition. While today's requirements are more based on data that are semi-structured, i.e. they don't always have a fixed structure. Hence we have systems like Hadoop that can process these type of data efficiently and stores like HBase or MongoDB that offer flexibility in the form of data that they store. If you need to store opaque data that can be fetched using keys then databases like Riak offer this capability.
