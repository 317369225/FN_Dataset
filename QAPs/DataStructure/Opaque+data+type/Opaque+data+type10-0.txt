What is the difference between SAS and R languages?
I think of SAS as being more of a 'data' language, not really caring about new algorithms all that much.  But what  Carl said is true, from a pure programming standpoint both R and SAS do not cut it. R is however better at developing algorithms, as was mentioned. Most people, or analysts, shall I dare say, like to manipulate data as a means to an end, and on that point, SAS is a superb 'data' language, much better than R. One begins to wonder how much 'lift' an improved algorithm will really give as opposed to mastering existing ones, and transforming the data a bit to a slightly different view.
