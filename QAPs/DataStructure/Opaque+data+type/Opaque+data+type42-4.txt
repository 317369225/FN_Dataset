Are producers of wearable mobile devices on the right track?
Very nice point. I complete agree that wearable devices should be subtle and for sure we don't need extra screen for it to be functional. There are few people who are bringing paradigm shift to market. I know http://ringly.com is doing great job. Our team is also contributing to this market by launching world's first smart earring Ear-O-Smart ! Hopefully we can bring positive change to the society with your help. Please support us to bring these new innovative products to market so that we together can push the market to embed electronics in products which we already wear everyday.Â
