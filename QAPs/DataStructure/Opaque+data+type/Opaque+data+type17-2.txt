In layman's terms, what exactly was the discovery announced by the BICEP2 experiment on March 17, 2014?
I think the CNN article is decent, as well as the link to a Stanford article linked within it (New evidence from space supports Stanford physicist's theory of how universe began) - you should really try to read that carefully.  But, here's a quick and dirty recap: The "Big Bang" is the idea that the universe started out very (infinitely!) small, and "exploded" into the vast expanse we see today.  "Inflation" is an addition to the Big Bang theory; instead of the original idea that you had a 'boom' explosion and then the rest was just that explosion expanding from that initial 'bang', the "inflationary Big Bang" said that after the initial 'bang', there was an additional "boost" of expansion that happened.  (Why did they add in this 'extra' expansion?  Because having just the initial 'bang' wasn't enough to explain the appearance of the universe.  The extra boost of "inflation" made the chunky explosion of the Big Bang "smoother", which we 'need' because even though the universe has all these chunks (galaxies! stars!) those chunks are (trust me) 'small' - a non-inflationary Big Bang would have had bigger chunks of material that wouldn't have made galaxies, only black holes.) Now (whew!) this "inflationary Big Bang" theory was again modified, because of *other* details about the 'smoothness' of the universe.  That's the "new inflation" and "eternal chaotic inflation" theories the Stanford article mentions.  As well as being better fits to what astronomers were seeing about the smoothness of the universe than the original inflationary Big Bang theory, they predicted a couple other really subtle things about the universe.  They just discovered that those really subtle things actually exist, which is really strong evidence that this modified, tweaked inflationary Big Bang theory is true.  (Or, really close to the real truth.)
