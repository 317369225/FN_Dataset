How Data Abstraction and Information hiding are different?
Information hiding can be thought of as data abstraction enforced by language features. It is a special case of abstraction. In a modern language, you can make certain operations on a data structure off limits - for e.g. using the private qualifier on class members. Data abstraction is a more generic term, one often sees C data types like FILE* which are used as an ADT even though the internal details are not actually hidden. Some ADTs in C use an opaque void* to achieve hiding For e.g. the Win32 API data type HANDLE
