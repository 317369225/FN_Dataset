C++ (programming language):Â How do you judge a C++ programmer by only 5 questions?
For medium level expertise or filtering I would ask the following... What are the important high level features of C++ that distinguish it from other high level languages? Why could the C standard library function qsort() be slower than the C++ STL std::sort() even if they used the exact same algorithm? Explain when and why parameters to a function should be passed as const reference. Implement a simple C++ class as a dynamic library whose functionality can be used from another C program. Implement a reasonably complete clone of the std::vector<> class. Expected answers : RAII/Deterministic destruction. Type safe genericity. Compile time meta-programming. Because the compare function is indirectly called via a pointer. When they are not primitive types, and are larger than the size of a pointer. Why? Because it avoids copying of data. Expect something similar to a PIMPL idiom, each class member is exposed as a function with an opaque void* Bonus points if the coder avoids complexity by implementing iterators as raw pointers
