Are producers of wearable mobile devices on the right track?
Instead of putting a definitive verdict, I'd just weigh in on both sides. YES : With respect to reduced real estate, fashion-forward design and bringing the technology with even closer proximity to accessible, personalized data. For enterprise aspect, there are three distinct benefits : greater line of vision for C-suite, connectivity, real-time data access and safety. Decision makers in enterprise workplaces (~ 66%) see wearables as their solution to connectivity, efficiency and innovation. Finance vertical (real-time market updates), healthcare (patient info), field workers (alert and job duty updates) etc. are all reliant on information access via wearable devices. Plus there's the aspect of VR and simulations to train, tour without being in physical proximity of potentially hostile environments. (source: Realizing the Potential of Enterprise Wearables in the Workplace ) NO: The commercial aspect means, most innovators are focusing on bringing the portable media or phone down to your palm. The aim must be to give the minimum required for a carrier of that size. Also, the security for a device interfacing so closely with our personal, human end-point must ensure it's much better than where it's now. I wouldn't always say it should be complimentary, but as a replacement media for real-time data access, they should focus more on stuff like "hands-free" features, voice activation, simulation, and secure remote connections.
