What are the advanced topics in C which are not taught in college but one must know?
Error handling matters. In college you get the wrong idea that library and system calls error handling are some optional thing. In production code the opposite is true. Error handling is very important and when accessing system ressources, such as files, correct error handling can take 80% of your time, which is probably why is wasn't done in college. What is disputable is if it's easier to learn correct error handling by oneself or correct use of system calls. Updated 122w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
