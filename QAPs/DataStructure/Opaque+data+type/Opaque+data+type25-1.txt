Is there a possibility that "junk" DNA could be nature's comments in our programming?
No. Programmers leave comments for other programmers or for themselves to read later, so they can remember the point of what they were doing. We have no reason to believe that Nature is collaborating (with other Natures?), and there's no need for notes, because Nature never goes back and debugs its earlier work. It's extremely linear, always building on the most-recent generation. If you believe in some kind of god or designer, you might also believe that junk DNA is its notes for us, explaining what it wants us to do with our bodies and with plant and animal bodies. I see two problems with that idea, besides the total lack of evidence for it. The first is that, if it's true, your question is a bad analogy for it. Programmer comments aren't for users, which is what we are, since we didn't collaborate in the creation of DNA. Comments are just for other programmers. The second problem is ... why such opaque code? Why not just write in some easily decipherable language, "Please don't drink too much beer. It could damage your liver"? You could invent a sort of "2001," Arthur C. Clarke scenario in which God (or whoever) doesn't want us to decode the message until we're mature enough to use the information in it. Cool sci-fi idea, but there isn't a scrap of evidence for it.
