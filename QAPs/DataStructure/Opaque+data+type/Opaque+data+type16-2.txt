I want to know everything about high frequency trading and/or algorithmic trading, where do I start?
Depends on your background obviously but "Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance" is a great place to start. Assumes only a limited finance background. Actually, even if you've got a trading background I think that's the place to start. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/04... Paul Wilmott On Quantitative Finance is widely recognized as a must read. More of a reference than something to curl up in bed with though. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/04... If you want to jump into it there's also the Certificate in Quantitative Finance http://www.cqf.com/ Covers everything you need to know to get an entry level job on a quant desk (note: I'm not saying you will get one but there's nothing not covered here that you actually need other than experience). If your math is rusty (they'll assess that) there's a prep course you can do. Good luck!
