What is the difference between forwarding state and flow entries in SDN?
OpenFlow works using a set of rules that contain match-action pairs. These rules are issued from the controller either by a network administrator or by the controller itself in an automated fashion. When a new data packet reaches the switch, the controller is notified. The controller sends back a decision to the switch in the form of these match-action pairs that tell the switch to look for specific matches in the traffic and take a particular action if the match is found. These rules are called Flow Rules. The switch stores these flow rules in one or more flow tables. This record of flow rules is called as a Forwarding State of that particular switch. Hope it helps.
