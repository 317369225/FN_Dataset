What does it feel like to be an employee of a company that goes public?
Also speaking for myself. For me the PayPal IPO was a glee and happiness that constituted so much more than financial gain. When you join a startup at an early stage. You are pouring your soul into it. The amount of care placed at the success of the company is akin to a group of folks stranded on a desert island together. Especially at PayPal. Working with the closest of friends, facing any kind of craziness a startup can face and learning to succeed on the fly. The IPO was the kind of validation of your 16 hour days and 48 hour push schedules. Being on call and woken up every morning at 4am for 2 months. So in the end... for a rank and file early employee the IPO is a reward for the hard work, and absolutely financial gain that will effect how they act from that point on. To me, this doesn't mean that IPO's are bad... but rather an appropriate step for when a company is already at the point in it's life where it is slowing down, burning out their employees, and not fully able to award shares to new employees because of dilution. A company would be wise to pick the point to IPO when they've done their own introspection and realized the culture is shifting towards a more grownup culture anyways. If they do it too soon they won't be able to hire the same type of employees, if they do it too late, they will lose employees that hit their cliffs and are tired of working the startup type hours when the culture has already shifted away from the startup culture, along with not being able to give decent options to new employees. I can only hope to one day lead these type of choices... and make the right choice.
