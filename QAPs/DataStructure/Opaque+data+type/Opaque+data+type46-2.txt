How can I join India's intelligence agency RAW?
The Research and Analysis Wing does not have a direct recruitment process. 1.Candidates who do exceedingly well in their UPSC examinations are given a chance after undergoing some tests (which are of greater difficulty). 2.Top police officers of the rank DIG or DGP or maybe lower work for the Agency on a deputation basis. 3.Linguistic experts: Those proficient in languages and accomplished in translation work for the R&AW (you can see newspaper advertisements calling for translators in the Cabinet.) 4.Technical experts: In case you are a techie and you have to be the bloody best in your field. Stuff like stealth technology,cryptography,hacking and basically the more badass tech stuff. In these instances,the RAW comes to you and not the other way round. 5.Armed forces: Armed forces from the rank of Captain upwards (i'm guessing) are given opportunities to work on a deputation basis for the Agency. In the past,the RAW has contracted all sorts of people to work for it (i'm not fully sure). A good example is late theatre artist Ravinder Kaushik Ravinder Kaushik
