Is a pure phonetic orthography desirable, at least for English?
No, it is not. Even if you mean a "phonemic" orthography, a system not unlike the one currently used is preferable. A strong point about English orthography is that it is "deep": in many cases, it allows the meaning of a word to show through in spite of the sound. This may reflect how the word is, underlyingly, stored in our brains. Here's an example: In English, syllables are often reduced. If this were reflected in the spelling, we would lose a lot of information. We would also lose a lot of consistency between related words. "Telepathic" and "telepathy", for example, would look much different. It would also be more difficult to predict what words mean and what language they come from. In addition, it is important that any phonetic transcription involves interpretation and abstraction. No matter what, sounds will need to be interpreted as phonemes and morphemes. Added to this is the complexity of variations in a word's pronunciationâ€”not only in terms of regional variants, but also small differences by the same speaker in different situations. The bottom line is that orthography doesn't represent sounds; it represents words. This applies to all orthographic in general use. True, some kind of more-nearly-phonemic system could be developed, but it would certainly not purely represent sounds. This is where the weight of historical use comes in.
