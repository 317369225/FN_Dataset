How many questions answered does it take to make "Top Writer"?
It's completely opaque. I showed up in late (like September) 2013, wrote a bunch, stopped using Quora completely in December, came back in April and found out that I was a Top Writer for 2014, based on my 2013 work.Â  What the hell? I only wrote for a couple of months... I do note some consistency in the top writers. They write, consistently. They also consistently write really good, informed answers, based on personal experience - you, Eugene, do that really well. They also usually provide embedded links to outside sources. If I want to talk about my time building CSnet, instead of just writing it inline as I just did, I'd probably link to the Wikipedia article CSnet instead. Most of my pieces have 4-7 links like that, because while *I* know what I'm talking about, my readers usually don't, and providing the links helps, a lot. And they often use pictures. If I'm talking about the issues in dealing with IMPs (see what I did there?), I'll probably include a picture, like this People love that shit. Seriously. I learned a little hack from Oliver Emberton early on as well - he said that most of the questions asked don't have the right topics connected to them, and that if you know the answer, you can probably see other topics that will help get the answer a broader circulation. I use that liberally - added three topics to this question, for instance. It seems to be a combination of providing a personal touch by talking about your personal experience, writing really well, writing frequently, including references and pictures, and reaching enough views through having the right audience. And pure dumb luck. I wish you luck. You're exactly the kind of person that needs a bigger audience, because of the unique value of your perspective and experience. You make Quora a better place for me, just as you did USENET in the 80s and 90s.
