Are producers of wearable mobile devices on the right track?
Wearable technology should have the following things: Instead of making them do things which can replace our phones, they should be complementary. As in, they should be displaying things like missed calls, messages received, so that a person can go through them without wasting time on getting the phones out of their pockets. Secondely , the wearable technology should monitor the health of the person wearing it and must notify the person when something goes wrong! In a case of emergency, it should have the capability to notify the concerned people associated with the person in emergency. Thirdly, wearable technology should not have any kind of camera stuff. It can be misused. And finally,the display should be a flexible one, to make it look good and rugged so that it can be used in different circumstances. The most important thing which should be kept in mind is to price it the range of 100$ to 150$.
