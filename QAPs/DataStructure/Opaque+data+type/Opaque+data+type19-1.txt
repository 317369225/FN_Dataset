Why are there no startups solving the Real Estate problems?
The biggest control of information is the control of title reports. Brokers used to be the gateway to property info, and now we have services like loopnet.com. Figure out how to do the same for title reports and you will save lots of businesses and entrepreneurs lots of time and money. Also, speaking of the industry being behind in technology, it is really behind in the technology used in physical space itself. The auto industry incorporates more technology in economy line standard products than the real estate industry does, and that is disappointing.
