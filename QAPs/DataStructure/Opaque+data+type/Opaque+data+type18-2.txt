What are the strangest airplane accidents/incidents?
Inspired to answer by the excellent answer Kshitij Salgunan gave. "The Exploding Flight Attendant" is not nearly as amazing as Kshitij's answer, but it's certainly funny. I'm translating it directly from Quest magazine, which is like a Quora feed published monthly in Dutch. Note that the italicised part was English (and uncensored) in the original Dutch text. It seemed like a normal workday for Steven Slater (39) a flight attendant by the American-based carrier JetBlue. It turned out quite differently. Right after landing in New York, [but while they were still taxiing,] as Slater later explained, he got into a fight with a passenger who stood up too soon. After the scolding the passenger, Slater completely lost his cool. The passengers, still in their seats, were shocked when Slater took the intercom [and said]: "To the passenger who called me a motherf***er, f*** you. I've been in the business for twenty years. I've had it. That's it." He then opened the emergency exit, causing the inflatable slide to inflate. After snatching two bottles of beer, Slater, who was still beside himself, left the plane [via the inflatable slide]. He pulled off his bowtie as he walked towards his auto to drive home. Slater was later arrested for reckless behaviour. Following an investigation, it appears that Slater had not had a quarrel with a passenger, but was drunk and had underlying psychological problems. Slater was given a one year suspended sentence. The story was all over the news media for months. Slater was the subject of songs. It's certainly possible to understand why Slater, who later resigned from the airline, did what he did: shouldn't more people who are bullied while doing their jobs learn to fight back? And there you have it. From the July 2015 issue of Quest
