How do retailers dispose/sell their season ending excess inventory ?
Hi Guys great post, I was googling the same question! I manage a well know clothing retailer and we have been using a company in the UK that destroys (shreds) everything we send to them. This is so the stock can be "written off" properly from an accounting side (can remember the proper term for it) and also to protect the brand image & value.Â  Secure textile disposal & Secure clothes disposal
