Is there a possibility that "junk" DNA could be nature's comments in our programming?
It's more like nature's backspace key was broken. So, instead of deleting all the old crud and all the gibberish that resulted when it got frustrated and smashed on the keyboard, it just commented it all out instead, because hey, that stuff is just going to be stripped out at compile time anyway, right? You are correct, though, in that left over retroviral junk DNA can often be traced. It can be as reliable as native genes are for constructing phylogenies and deducing ancestry. That's not its "purpose," though: that word really doesn't have a place in evolutionary biology.
