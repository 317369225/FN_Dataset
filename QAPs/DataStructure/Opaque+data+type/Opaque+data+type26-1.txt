What grants are available to study Chinese language?
I'm currently studying at Beijing Normal University on a full ride from the China Scholarship Council (http://en.csc.edu.cn/) which has a terrible website and a frustratingly opaque admissions process but if you can get it it's a great deal and applies to just about every Chinese university for both degree and non-degree programs. This annual thread on chinese-forums serves as kind of an information resource/support group for applicants: CSC Scholarship - 2013 General Discussion
