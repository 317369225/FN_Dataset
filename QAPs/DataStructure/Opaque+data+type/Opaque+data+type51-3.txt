Why are some Americans opposed to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)?
Pretty much everyone agrees that people should not have to go bankrupt due to medical bills and that means insurance or health care that is available for everyone. The problem is how to get it done in a fair way that doesn't take away the benefits that the majority of people have. It is all about execution. Under the ACA many people's health insurance premiums went up significantly. So they had to pay more to be able to see the doctors who were already taking care of them. Some of the plans are so bad that no specialists accept them because it costs us more money to treat these patients than we get paid. Naturally these plans are cheap for the patients so a lot of people have them, but they effectively don't cover anything other than typical stuff without a ridiculous amount of calling, paperwork and fighting on the part of the patients and providers. And then there's a massive deductible (up to $5000) So they are seen by many of us as a corrupt scheme made up by congress and the insurance companies. All that being said I think the framework is good and can be fixed. Other people think we should start over.
