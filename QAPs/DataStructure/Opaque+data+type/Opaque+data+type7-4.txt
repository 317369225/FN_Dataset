How does a relational DBMS internally store its data?
According to Date in "An Introduction to Database Systems" the internal storage method is irrelevant and could be in hash tables, linked lists, trees, etc.  What's important is how the data is represented to the user.  Presumably, it should be easy to convert from the internal representation to the external one and also operations on the data should be fast, so that will limit what kind of data structures can be used (i.e., linked lists are probably a bad choice, whereas some kind of tree or hash tables might be a good choice).  And then there is the issue of long-term (disc) storage and syncing up changes made by various users with the data in disc. In other words, it will depend very much upon which DBMS you are using: what its capabilities are, and what applications it has been optimized for.
