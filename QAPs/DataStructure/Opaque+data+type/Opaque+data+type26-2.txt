What grants are available to study Chinese language?
Studying Mandarin is certainly not as expensive as you would think, so maybe you can consider self funding.  If you study in Beijing, its not a great deal like it used to be, but its still not particularly expensive if you plan it well. you can take morning classes that run from 8 am to noon at most universities in the city and they run from $2300 to $3000 for the semester which runs 4 months. In the afternoons/evenings you can teach english on the side, which pays about $15 an hour.  alternate plan 1 is that you can go to a cheaper private mandarin school, some of them are fly by night, but I have friends that switched over and were moderately satisfied, and you can pick your own schedule.  Either way the schools are all about memorization, so be prepared for that.  Alternate plan 2 is you go to a city were no one speaks much English at all. I would suggest Qingdao.  the cost of living would be lower, the schools would probably be cheaper, and you would absolutely be forced to use mandarin for EVERYTHING.
