Is there a possibility that "junk" DNA could be nature's comments in our programming?
According to one theory junk DNA is inserted in order to retain stochastic resonance with the ribosome resonant modes during transcription. You see DNA is not just an instruction book of life, it is that too, but the ribosome "eats" life's words to create proteins. So you must worry about mechanics as well as meaning. Jeff Wright said it very nicely in a comment below: DNA is both message and medium. So while the ribosome chews it helps to pace out the input stream. This is just theory at present. Another theory is that junk DNA is there to provide ready raw protein material for expression and transcription.
