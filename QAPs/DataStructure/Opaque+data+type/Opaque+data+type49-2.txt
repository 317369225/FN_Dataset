What will happen to Theranos?
Theranos (company) runs out of cash, but CEO Elizabeth Holmes manufactures a sale for an undisclosed price (very possibly near zero) to some barely reputable company. So she will have an "exit." Theranos fires a few passive, easily scared employees with weak visas, blaming them for the bad science, because f$&@ them. Theranos has a really hard time getting any top medical school tenured faculty - including Harvard Medical School, where Elizabeth is a board fellow - to join Theranos' new medical board of advisers. In court a top class action plaintiff law firm shellacks Theranos and David Boies - Theranos lawyer and new board director - because facts.
