â€œApple event is a Carbon message passing API."-from Apple docs. What's the meaning of 'Carbon message'?
There are two profoundly different APIs and application frameworks in OS X: Carbon and Cocoa. Carbon is (or was) the old API, based on Mac OS 9 and familiar to developers who were already used to coding for Macs before OS X was released. Cocoa is the UNIX/NextStep API and framework for modern OS X apps. It can do more than Carbon but it's very different. Apple maintained both Carbon and Cocoa as a way to provide developers a familiar environment and to let them get their apps running on OS X quickly while they learned Cocoa, which is frankly a weird beast for those of us acquainted with old-school Mac programming. Apple Events is a system that lets Carbon applications pass messages to each other and receive events from the operating system and other Carbon apps. It's essentially identical to Apple Events on older versions of Mac OS.
