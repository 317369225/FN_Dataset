What are the "lost arts" in your field?
In the field of medicine, there are many lost or vanishing arts. Just to name a few: Orthopedics Skeletal traction [ shown above from the final scene of the movie It's a Mad Mad Mad World... yes, that's Spencer Tracy in the foreground ] for fractures has been largely replaced with other techniques and hardware for fracture reduction and fixation. For example: Manual Disimpaction i.e Fecal This is a euphemism for a very old fashioned yet very effective way for curing people who are "full of shit". All kidding aside, fecal impaction is a huge problem for many in-hospital patients, and especially the elderly. This one problem can cascade into an array of other quite serious problems ranging from malnutrition to breathing problems to blood clots to bed sores. In an age of technology it's much easier to order an enema than to stick on a glove and do the dirty work. Yet, often times that's what's called for. Obstetrics With the rise in Caesarean sections has come less dependency on and subsequently less skill in the use of forceps for difficult deliveries. Upper Gastro-intestinal bleeding [ specifically varices ] The Sengstaken-Blakemore tube, originally described in the 1950s for control of bleeding from distended esopahageal veins known as varices that result from cirrhosis. Not much needed anymore, largely replaced by endoscopy and sclerotherapy for urgent treatment.
