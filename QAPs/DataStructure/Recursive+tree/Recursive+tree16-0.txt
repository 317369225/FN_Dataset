What is the complexity of [math]T(n) = 2T(n-1) + C?[/math]
Let's bring it to a closed form. Now T(n+1)=2T(n)+C T(n+2)=2T(n+1)+C=2T(n)+3C T(n+3)=2T(n+2)+C=4T(n)+7C ... [math]T(n+k)=2^{k-1}T(n)+2^kC-C[/math] Substitute n for 0 to obtain T(k): [math]T(k)=2^{k-1}T(0)+2^kC-C[/math] Let's assume T(0)=1 (but any constant works) The dominant term in the expression of T(k) is [math]C\cdot2^k[/math], which brings it in the class of exponentials, that is, exponential complexity. Â  For the unproven general case T(n+k) you can apply an induction (and actually obtaining that general formula I've done through some pattern matching and, well, experience)
