What would be the space complexity of a recursive inorder traversal of a binary tree?
The space complexity of this traversal seems to be O(h).Â  h is height of tree. The best way to think about space complexity of recursive functions is (# of stack frames)*(space per stack frame). In your case, in worst case, you can have h stack frames. With each stack frame having O(1) space. So total space complexity is O(h).
