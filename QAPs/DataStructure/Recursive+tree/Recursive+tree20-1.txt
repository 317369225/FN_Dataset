How can a segment tree be built and queried non-recursively?
I think yes. If we know the structure of the recursion tree, that is involved in querying and construction of the segment tree, it can definitely be converted to an iterative solution(Using stacks). There are bunch of termination conditions involved in both query and construction methods(the constant return conditions). Put them appropriately into the termination condition of while, and keep pushing the not at hand required values to the stack). However an iterative solution would be too intimidating to code and get working. Therefore it is generally avoided.
