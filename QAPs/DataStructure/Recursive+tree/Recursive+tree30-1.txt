How will you visualize recursion in general and in data structures like trees?
I don't visualize it. I feel it. It's hard to explain, because it doesn't really map onto actually touching things with hands. This is good, because I only have two of those, and I'd rapidly run out. Vertices are like boxes, three-dimensional things roughly like those UML class thingies. Edges are like piano wire. Dangling pointers (edges) are sharp and pointy. A stack is a stack of boxes, and I always have a "hand" on the top. I can feel down to the next one before another "hand" takes it off. Scalar values are like rectangular holes in the boxes. They feel kind of like Braille (though I don't know actual Braille). Nil is just a pit, and a pointer is a wire coming out of it. When I think of algorithms, recursive or not, I think of moving the boxes around and plugging and unplugging wires.When I unplug a wire, I keep another "hand" on it so that I know what to do with it later.
