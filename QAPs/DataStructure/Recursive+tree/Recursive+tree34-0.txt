What is the best method for tracing the recursive functions?
Make a note of calls and create a recursion tree. It will help you understand the flow of control and parameters that are used to invoke the call and return values which are used to evaluate the final result. Following is Pseudo Code for Towers of Hanoi problem and its recursion tree FUCNTION MoveTower(disc, source, dest, spare)    IF disc==0 THEN:         move disc from source to dest    ELSE:         MoveTower(disc-1, source, spare, dest)         move disc from source to dest         MoveTower(disc-1, spare, dest, source)     END IF
