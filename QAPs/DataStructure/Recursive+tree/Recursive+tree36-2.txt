Are you expected to write perfect code on your first attempt in tech interviews?
Only a newbie interviewer would flunk you on syntax, so I'm thinking that  syntax errors might not be your problem in itself. It might be that the interviewer thinks you are too dependent on the compiler and/or debugger and doesn't understand the language on a fundamental level. Andreas Blixt is spot on with his suggestions (especially the last one) and I won't add anything to it, except that you might want to try out some competitions on Top Coder (http://www.topcoder.com/). Oh, and when it comes to tech interviews, practice with a friend, ON A WHITEBOARD. Don't start writing code immediately, start with the algorithm, first and write it in plain english and make sure the interviewer is following you. Elaborating further on Andreas first point, consider doing code Katas. Super-cool example on Vimeo: http://vimeo.com/8569257 Updated 53w ago • View Upvotes
