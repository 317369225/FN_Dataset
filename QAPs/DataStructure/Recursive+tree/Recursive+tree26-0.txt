Is there a way to do a BFS traversal of a binary tree with recursion (using Java)?
BFS and recursion don't gel the way DFS and recursion do. But for implementation sake, it can be done. With each node of the tree being of type Node and the function/method first called with an argument queue which has the root node in it, the recursive implementation (in Java) would look something like : public void bfsRecurs(Queue queue) {     if (queue.isEmpty())           return;      Node node = (Node) queue.remove();      System.out.println(node);      for (Node child: node.child) {          queue.add(child);      }      bfsRecurs(queue); } If you notice, the recursion is merely just another way of looping in this instance and thus not perfectly a fit for BFS.
