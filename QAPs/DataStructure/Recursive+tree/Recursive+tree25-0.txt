How do I create a Python program that illustrates the tree-like structure of recursion?
Tip #1: Let's aim for drawing the tree in the same way a word processor formats multi-level lists. fibo(5)-- fibo(4)-- -- fibo(3)-- -- -- fibo(2)-- -- -- fibo(1)-- -- fibo(2)-- fibo(3)-- -- fibo(2)-- -- fibo(1) Tip #2: Each level printed is a function call fibo(x) that has not only the "x" parameter, but also a "depth" or "indent" accumulated, so that "depth" must be passed as a parameter to the function. So fibo(n) becomes fibo(n, print_indent). Tip #3: To generate a string named my_string of N characters "-" in Python, use my_string = "-" * N I suppose that should be enough for you to figure a complete solution.
