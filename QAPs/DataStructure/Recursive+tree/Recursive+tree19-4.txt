What is memoization?
If I have to describe memoizing in the most basic way, I would say, you keep a copy of the result once computed and use it later instead of computing it again. Think of it as a notebook/journal, where you note down each time you perform an action. Whenever you stumble upon the same calculation, all you do is fetch the result from the notebook/journal. I have written a post about how to use memoizing as a means to cache class objects and use it as a singleton pattern. The uses are diverse, I particularly like to use it to create singleton methods which help me create configurations and instantiation objects. These objects are cached in a hash table and returned as they were initiated. This avoids a lot of dependency issues and keeps the code base really clean. https://datqaguy.wordpress.com/2... The other use is obviously in computing intensive operations where you process huge chunks of data and reprocessing the same time would render your application slow and not-so-pleasing.
