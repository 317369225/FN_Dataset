What would be the recursion tree for [math]T(n) =T(n−1) +T(\frac{n}{2}) +n?[/math]
I (intuitively) understand what a recursion tree is - I use recursion, although for non-algebraic problems. My problem with the problem as stated in the question is that I don't know what the domain of 'n' is, or more simply what is the value of T(0) (or T(1)).  Otherwise, I don't see a limit to recursion for this formula.
