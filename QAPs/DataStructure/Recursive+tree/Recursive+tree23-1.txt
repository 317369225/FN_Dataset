Competitive Programming: What do working software engineers think of competitive programming if they are not competitive programmers?
I've done some online coding competitions for fun (e.g. code golfing), but I had never heard of competitive programming before I started reading programming questions on Quora earlier this year. I get the sense that if I were a 20-year-old CS undergrad, instead of "old" (47), I would have. What do I think? My overall impression based on the stream of questions here (which is really all I know) is of a lot of smart, motivated  young programmers with little or no work experience getting very anxious about something that may not be as important as they think it is. Honing one's skills is a fine idea, and sometimes a competitive exercise can help with that.  But when I see all these anxious questions on Quora about performance in these competitions, it makes me sad.
