What is the best method for tracing the recursive functions?
Logging can be helpful. On entry into the function, append the following line to a text file: A timestamp The calling parameters The depth of the call, which you should add as another parameter to the call and increment it when the recursive call is made. The name of the outermost calling function, if called from multiple locations. For ease of analysis, use a tab as a field delimiter.  You'll then able to open the file in Excel and use filters, pivot tables and other features on the data.  You could even write a script to transform the data into input to a graphing tool like graphviz.
