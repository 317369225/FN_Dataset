Why is non-recursive better than recursive for tree traversal when more nodes need to traversed? How many stacks will recursive method consume?
Stack control is at user end. In the environment, where there is recursion depth limit, iterative version might work well for large tree. In iterative version, there might be function call overhead to stack which can be inclined. Using one stack, traversal can be done. See http://algorithmsandme.blogspot....
