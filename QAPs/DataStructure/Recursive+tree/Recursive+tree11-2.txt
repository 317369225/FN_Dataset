What can be done to master recursion in tree traversals?
Totally agree with Shriram. How to Design Programs was thoroughly helpful in helping me grok the nature of trees, most of functional programming for that matter. Other resources that would be helpful in your journey would be Huet's Zipper functional pearl: Page on cs.uni-saarland.de It generalises patterns of traversing and modifying a tree and is the basis of Clojure's Zippers Page on clojuredocs.org Yet another resource is Jeremy Gibbons : Publications Jeremy has written pretty extensively on the tree structures as you can see from the proportion of papers.
