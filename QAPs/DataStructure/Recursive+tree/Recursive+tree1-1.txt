What would be the recursion tree for [math]T(n) =T(n−1) +T(\frac{n}{2}) +n?[/math]
To see the recursion tree, refer to the answer by Máté Kovács. Unfortunately, as opposed to for simpler recursions, it is not so easy to read off good asymptotic bounds on [math]T(n)[/math] directly from the recursion tree. I'll outline a proof that shows that [math]T(n) = n^{\Theta(\log n)}[/math]. With a bit more work, it should be possible to make this bound even tighter. Let's first show an upper bound, i.e. [math]T(n) = n^{O(\log n)}[/math]. To do this, consider instead the recurrence [math]T(n) = T(n-1) + T(f(n)) + n[/math], where [math]f(n)[/math] is equal to the greatest power of 2 less than n. Since there is always a power of 2 in the range [math][\frac{n}{2}, n][/math], [math]f(n) > \frac{n}{2}[/math], so this change only increases the values of [math]T(n)[/math]. Now, applying this new recurrence [math]2^{k-1}[/math] times to [math]T(2^{k})[/math] we get that [math]T(2^{k}) = (2^{k-1}+1)T(2^{k-1}) + \sum_{i=2^{k-1}+1}^{2^{k}}i \leq 2^{k}T(2^{k-1}) + 2^{2k-1}[/math] Applying this inequality recursively [math]k[/math] times, we find that: [math]T(2^{k}) = 2^{2k-1} + 2^{3k-3} + 2^{4k-6} + \dots + 2^{k(k-1)/2} \leq 2^{k^2}[/math] If [math]n = 2^{k}[/math], then [math]2^{k^2} = (2^{k})^{k} = n^{\log n}[/math], so this shows that [math]T(n) \leq n^{\log n}[/math]. To show a lower bound on [math]T(n)[/math], consider the number of ways [math]W(n)[/math] to reach the number [math]n[/math] starting at [math]1[/math] where the only allowed operations are a) multiplication by 2 and b) addition by 1. For example if [math]n=7[/math], one such way is [math]2*(2*1 + 1)+1[/math]. Another way is [math]2*2*1 + 1 + 1 + 1[/math], and yet another way is simply [math]1+1+1+1+1+1+1[/math]. Note that each such way corresponds to a path from a leaf of the recursion tree to the root. Since [math]T(n)[/math] is at least as large as the number of leaves of the recursion tree, it is at least as large as [math]W(n)[/math]. We'll show that [math]W(n) \geq \sqrt{n}^{\log \sqrt{n}/2} = n^{\frac{1}{8}\log n}[/math]. To see this, let [math]\ell = \frac{1}{2}\log \sqrt{n}[/math] and consider an [math]\ell[/math]-tuple [math](a_1, a_2, \dots, a_\ell)[/math] where all the [math]a_i[/math] lie between 1 and [math]\sqrt{n}[/math] inclusive. We now claim the number [math]a_{\ell} + 2(a_{\ell-1} + 2(a_{\ell-2} + \dots + 2(a_1))\dots)[/math] is less than or equal to [math]n[/math]. To see why, note that each time we add an [math]a_i[/math], either our current total is less than [math]\sqrt(n)[/math] or we at most double the current total. Likewise, each time we multiply by 2, we exactly double the current total. Since we add [math]\ell[/math] of the [math]a_i[/math] and perform [math]\ell[/math] doublings, the resulting total is at most [math]\sqrt{n}2^{2\ell} \leq n[/math]. Therefore, by incrementing until we reach [math]n[/math], this expression can be extended to get an expression of the form above. Since each different tuple gives rise to a different expression, this shows [math]W(n) \geq \sqrt{n}^{\ell} = n^{\frac{1}{8}\log n}[/math]. We've thus shown that [math]n^{\frac{1}{8}\log n} \leq T(n) \leq n^{\log n}[/math], and therefore [math]T(n) = 2^{\Theta(\log n)}[/math].
