What's the best way to print an in-order traversal of a binary tree without using recursion?
Two ways to do it, afaik: 1. Emulate recursion using stacks. 2. Do a 'Morris Traversal' on the threaded binary trees. #Morris Traversal1. Initialize current as root2. While current is not NULL        If current does not have left child                a) Print current’s data                b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right        Else                a) (rightmost node in current's left subtree)->right = current                b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left Dive into http://geeksforgeeks.org/?p=6358 Note: Andrew Cooke pointed out in the comments an I quote: "A Morris traversal mutates the tree during traversal (it's a hack that lets you store the same info you would store on a stack in the tree itself).  That's not at all clear in the pseducode above (which is completely pointless and misleading without the supporting text)."
