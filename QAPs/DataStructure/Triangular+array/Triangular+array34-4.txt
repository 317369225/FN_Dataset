What is the difference between billiards, pool and snooker?
Billiards is a game with one red ball and two cue balls.  I get a cue ball and you have your own cueball.  They are differentiated by a dot or by colour.  Object of the game is to make points.  Points are made by having your cue ball hit the other two balls or by making the balls or by going in-off Pool is any variation of games using the 15 numbered balls.  You can play 8 ball, 9 ball, straight pool, elimination, poker pool, and more with the pool balls. Snooker is the game with 15 red balls, a yellow, green, brown, blue, pink and black. Of these three, pool is easiest.  Bigger pockets, smaller tables and smaller prize money.  Billiards isn't played much. It's more of an old timers game.  I love it but not many people are any good at it or know how to play. The term 'Billiards' is also an umbrella term for any of these games and is a word used by people that aren't too familiar about playing.
