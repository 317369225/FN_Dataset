What is the cause of the downfall of the Spanish football team?
The problem with Spain is their defense and their forward. Since the retirement of David Villa they have not been able to come up with a world class forward. That might change however with young forward like Morata, Alc√°cer, Juanmi coming in. But it will still take some time for them to reach their peak. In midfield Spain as usual are full of talent. However, they should start playing a little bit direct style of football since they don't have Xavi and Alonso any more who were the key in their "Tiki-Taka" style of football. They now have Isco, David Silva, Iniesta who are all technically great. They should stick to their possession style of play but they should stop making pointless passes. Their defense is the biggest problem. Pique's form is largely inconsistent and Jordi Alba and Carvajal are good in attacking but they can't defend effectively. Juanfran is a good defender but lacks pace. They are short of quality options in the defense. Current world champions Germany have so many quality options in every position. That makes them so strong. The goalkeeping position is not a problem for them. However, Del Bosque must give de Gea the starting position rather than Casillas who is no more the confident figure he used to be in between the sticks. Del Bosque should stop placing too much trust in certain player's who are unable to perform. For Spain's current slump in form I would say del Bosque is responsible largely for it because of his team selection. Had he started De Gea instead of Casillas and David Villa instead of Diego Costa the outcome of the 2014 world cup could have been different. Also he must start Fabregas who has been in great form for Chelsea now as Xavi and Alonso have retired.
