What are some benefits of reading?
To me personally, I don't read keeping in mind its "benefits". I take it as an exercise to grow intellectually. Just as you need to stretch your muscles, lift weights, perform myriad exercises in order to gain muscles and have a pleasing personality, reading is essential to improve one's intellect and comprehensive ability.   Looking in retrospect, most of the great leaders and cerebral heroes had one thing in common, i.e., an unquenchable desire to read and grow intellectually. Apart from  augmentation of knowledge, reading can cement an individual's command on language. That, of course, would happen if a person prefers to read in the same language for a considerable amount of time. I have done majority of my schooling from regional Marathi medium school. Forget about expressing myself, I couldn't even properly construct sentences up to standard 10. I think after this answer I need not elucidate what happened next via reading :)   I bet reading can turn out to be a good leisure. If you can read for even half an hour, it has a potent to shape your personality. Undoubtedly, people can debate on this, but the kind influence that reading can make on an individual, by and large, depends on person's genre of reading. For me, reading has manifested as the fruitful venture :) Updated 51w ago • View Upvotes
