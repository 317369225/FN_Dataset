How much harder and costlier is it to manufacture triangular solar panels, compared to rectangular?
I, too, love these triangular panels, but the price pressures in the solar industry are pretty intense, so any added costs have been eliminated by most manufacturers. These panels used to be offered by Sharp, I believe, but I don't think anyone makes them anymore. Not only does it add unnecessarily to installation costs, it adds to the manufacturer's (and reseller's) inventories (two additional SKUs per panel model), they also make more work for system designers and installers. They predate the era of micro-inverters, which probably would make their use even more difficult (since they'd need their own, specially sized inverter, or wiring two together over the length of the array). When I started in the industry, I heard many system designers state that they disliked designing around them. There also used to be a thing called "dummy" panels, which where used toÂ  filled in excess space. The triangular panel look could be done this way as well, with non-operable, triangular panels. I don't believe that the practice of using dummies has lasted either. Cost seems to beat out aesthetics the majority of the time, sadly.
