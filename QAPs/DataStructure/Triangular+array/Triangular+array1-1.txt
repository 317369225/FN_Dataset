I have a mathematical conjecture that is basically a triangular array but I don't know how to show the world. I discovered it since I was 9 below
This is A003991 on the OEIS. Many properties are listed there and, following proper guidelines, you could add more properties to that entry. One way to think about the triangle is that the nth entry of row k is [math](k - n + 1) * n[/math]. From that, here are what should be understandable reasons for a few of the features you conjectured: 2.  The middle values of odd rows have odd k and [math]n = \frac{k + 1}{2}[/math][math].[/math] So, those values are equal to [math](k -[/math][math] \frac{k + 1}{2} + 1) * \frac{k + 1}{2} = \frac{k + 1}{2} * \frac{k + 1}{2}[/math], which is square. 4.  If [math]k[/math] is even, then either [math]n[/math] is even and thus the [math]n[/math] at the end of the formula makes the whole thing even, or if [math]n[/math] is odd then [math]([/math][math]k - n + 1)[/math] is the even term since [math]n + 1[/math] will be odd. 5. When summing all the values in row [math]k[/math], you can split up to get [math]\sum_{n = 1}^{k}{n k} + \sum_{n = 1}^{k}{-n^2} + \sum_{n = 1}^{k}{n}[/math]. Then [math]\sum_{n = 1}^{k}{n k} = \frac{k^3 + k^2}{2}[/math], [math]\sum_{n = 1}^{k}{-n^2} = \frac{-2k^3 - 3k^2 - k}{6}[/math], and [math]\sum_{n = 1}^{k}{n} = \frac{k^2 + k}{2}[/math]. Combined, [math]\frac{k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k}{6} = \binom{k + 2}{3} = T_k[/math] . 6. [math]T_k + T_{k - 1} = (2 k + 1)\sum_{n = 1}^{k}{n} - \sum_{n = 1}^{k}{2n^2} = \frac{k(k + 1)(2k + 1)}{2} - \sum_{n = 1}^{k}{2n^2} = \sum_{n = 1}^{k}{3n^2} - \sum_{n = 1}^{k}{2n^2} = \sum_{n = 1}^{k}{n^2} = P_k[/math]
