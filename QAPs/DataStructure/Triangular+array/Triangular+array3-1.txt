In how many ways can one tie a tie? Which of these look 'good'?
I'm not sure how many there really are, but there is a book called 85 ways to tie a tie. I only use four different ones. The Four in Hand, Windsor, Pratt, and the Prince Albert. My favorite of these would have to be the Pratt. The Pratt is an informal knot that looks formal and is a lot easier than the Windsor.
