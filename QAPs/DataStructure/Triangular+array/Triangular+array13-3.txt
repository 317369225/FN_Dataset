Are prefix sums of arrays similar to fibonacci sequences?
A prefix sum of the array [math]a_i[/math] is given by [math]s_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i[/math] which can be efficiently calculated as [math]s_n = s_{n-1} + a_{n-1}[/math] But you'll note that this bears little resemblance to the Fibonacci series; [math]f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}[/math] because the prefix sum refers to two different arrays, and to corresponding elements in those arrays. You can also see in toy examples that they don't behave similarly.  If we start out with the all-1's array: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, .... then the prefix array is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .... and the prefix array of that is 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... which are the triangular numbers.  Iterating once more gives us the tetrahedral numbers: 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, ... From then on we would go to the 4-dimensional triangular numbers, the 5-dimensional version, etc.  But all of these sums have polynomial rates of growth, while the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially.
