How should one revise electricity and magnetism for JEE?
No doubt, HC Verma is the best book for Physics. Physics can be broadly divided into the following parts: 1.)Mechanics : for this, HC Verma is the best (along with NCERT) for theory and for practice, IE Irodov is the right book. You can also try DC Pandey. Mechanics requires intense practice and good exposure to a number of questions. It is one of the most scoring part of JEE Paper. 2.)Thermodynamics : Again, for this part, HC Verma is sufficient. From this part there will be around 3-5 questions in the JEE paper. 3.)Electricity and Magnetism : For this part HC Verma is not enough. You need to go beyond that, because in JEE, there will rarely be any straight - forward question from this part. Having a command in this part will definitely give you an edge over others because it has a huge weightage in the JEE paper. 4.)Optics : One of the easiest branch of Physics if prepared well. MostÂ  scoring and easy to grasp. But, beware - this part has the widest scope of silly - mistakes. Sign convention must be kept in mind otherwise the question is bound to go wrong. 5.)Modern Physics : Tough nut to crack. Difficult, quite theoretical. This part, besides numericals has a lot of theory based questions. So prepare well especially the Radioactivity and the X-Ray part. HC Verma and NCERT must be thoroughly covered for this section. To summarize, HC Verma is the best book for Physics. But don't ignore NCERT. Read complete NCERT atleast 2-3 times. You will definitely find something new. If you simply study Physics, then it isn't going to work. You need to feel it, enjoy it and more than that apply it.
