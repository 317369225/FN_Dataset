What are some interesting properties number 6 has?
It's the smallest natural number that is not a Prime power, after the trivial case 1. The next are 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20. Equivalently, it's the smallest natural number > 1 whose Möbius function is positive; however, this function is only nonzero for Square-free integers, so the first positive values are 1, 6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26. It's a Superior highly composite number and Colossally abundant number. These mean it's a maximum for two similar measures of how divisible a number is, measured by either the number of divisors, or the sum of its divisors. The first 15 of each form the same sequence,  2, 6, 12, 60, 120, 360, 2520, 5040, 55440, 720720, 1441440, 4324320, 21621600, 367567200, 6983776800; after that most are different. High divisibility is why the first 6 of those numbers have been heavily used for counting and dividing goods through history.
