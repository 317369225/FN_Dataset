What is a good resource for experienced programmers to learn Excel VBA?
Rather than trying to learn sequentially from a book, I would recommend directly jumping onto sample programs. If you are already familiar with any of C/C++/Python, you should be able to read and understand the code easily. Use the "Record macro" option and perform a set of actions. Once you stop recording the macro, you should be able to see the VBA for that macro in the VBA editor (Alt+F11). Manipulate that code with if/else conditions and loops. That will do most of the work. Now and then, you will have to search online for your specific need and you will find the solution pretty easily on the forums.
