How can order and chaos exist at the same time?
Thanks for asking, Silvia. I'll give an example that might shine some (star)light on this. When we look up in the sky we see the stars. We are used to the patterns. For example, in the southern sky we can see Orion (assuming you live in the northern hemisphere). Our minds are almost programmed to look for patterns. This is our way of making sense of things. And in the early days of mankind helped us survive as a species. Now we make an imaginary travel to one of those stars. Let's take the centre star of the so called belt. It's name is Alnilam and it's about 1300 light years (ly) away. If we would be close to that star the entire sky would look different. We would not have a single constellation as reference although a star like Betelgeuse (the big red one top left) would give us a clue. Yet we would have to look in a different direction, we have passed it a long time ago in our travel (it's about 600 ly away). Now imagine we were asleep on our travel. When we arrive we would be confronted with chaos, something we don't recognise. We don't see the familiar patterns. In short time we would have looked to the sky a few times and started to have a few reference points. Stars like Betelgeuse for example. And in due time we would make new constellations. Order exists because we try to make sense of our environment by looking for patterns. When we can establish patterns we call it order. When there is no pattern because for example there is rapid change we speak of chaos. Order and chaos exist as concepts only. One means we found a pattern, the other means we have not (yet) found a pattern. That's all.
