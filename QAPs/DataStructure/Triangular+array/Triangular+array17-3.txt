What are the most surprising or interesting aspects, from defense technology perspective, of China's military parade on September 3, 2015?
Thanks for Jon Davis's professional analysis of clips like a soccer coach,  I can't wait for the rest. And Gleg Blandino's reference is useful too, as most of the descriptions on the weapons were clear and accurate( sorry it is only in Chinese). I just supplement some trivial information to make their articles more worth reading. Although Chinese are divided by the different views on the intention or implication of this military parade,   most of them at least agree the live broadcasting of this parade by the CCTV was so bad that it almost ruined the parade(here is one of the typical complaints on the website,  http://www.xinwenquan.org/pic/hu... , sorry in Chinese again) The  terrible broadcasting not only greatly compromised CCP's efforts on  the arrangement and rehearsal of this parade, but also made Jon 's analysis more difficult. There was s trailer from the documentary taken by the PLA's August 1st Studio 秒拍视频, which was much more professional and accurate. I am sure when the full documentary released, Jon can make more insightful analysis. In contrast to the seemingly invincible Dong Feng missiles which are claimed to be aircraft carrier killer or the ultimate deterrence  stirring the so-called patriots' fever of planning the delivery of Dong Feng to places from Tokyo, Guam to New York like this on the Weibo of Sina Military Channel  I am much happier to witness the most popular one among the spectators on spot was this ultimate Weapon of Mass Attraction Yes, free WiFi!
