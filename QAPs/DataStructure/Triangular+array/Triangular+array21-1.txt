How many neurons (or how many connections) does it take to recreate one image in our mind?
This is like asking "how many transistors does it take to run Microsoft Word"? In a computer, almost all transistors are being used all the time on all aspects of running a program, with different transistors specialized for different roles. Something similar is going on in the brain. In a computer, transistors are specialized for roles like arithmetic vs. data transfer. In the brain, the specialization is by brain region, with roles that are sensory-motor functions (vision, hearing, physical movement) and certain behaviors (speech, face recognition, motor coordination, episodic memory). There are around 30 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex, and probably half of them are involved in evoking mental imagery, or 15 billion neurons. The brain regions specifically dedicated to visual processing comprise 1 - 8 billion neurons, depending on how broadly you count. It would be hard to say what minimum number is required for a particular visualization. When people suffer a stroke on one side of their brain, they lose their ability to imagine visual elements on that side. One famous individual could not remember one side of a familiar european plaza, but if he imagined himself turning around and facing the other direction, he could visualize and recall the other side. See answer link below for more on the neural mechanics of how the brain constructs visual imagery (as much as this is understood which is not very much yet).
