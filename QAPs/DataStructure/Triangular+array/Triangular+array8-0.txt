What are bermuda triangle and pascal's triangle?
Bermuda Triangle is an geographical area , which is also known as Devil's Triangle. Its apexes are in Florida, Puerto Rice and Bermuda. Justifying to its name "Devil's Triangle" there have been many accidents or mishaps happening at this place from past 5 centuries. Coming to Pascal's Triangle , it is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number in the triangle is the sum of numbers directly above it. Here, you can see no 2 is the sum of 1 and 1 which is above it, same way 3 in the 4th row is the sum of the number which is above it i.e 1 and 2. These numbers are also the coefficient in the binomial expansion. The row in the triangle starts from 0 and goes till n. Lets suppose you want expansion for (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 so you can see the coefficients of each term is the no from row 2. Same way if you want expansion for (x+y)^5, coefficients will be from 5th row, just make sure you start the counting of row from 0, otherwise the whole trick will go wrong:)
