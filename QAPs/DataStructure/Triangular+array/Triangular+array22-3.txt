How can I differentiate between a sine wave or triangular wave (or any kind of wave) using an AVR microcontroller?
It would probably pay to condition your signal with an op amp differentiator circuit first. A triangle wave passed through this circuit should be close to a square wave at the output, whereas a sine wave will turn into cosine. If you then sample the output at say >1ox higher than the input frequencies and compare the deltas between samples, it should be pretty easy to spot the difference  between a square wave and a cosine wave.  A square wave going through this circuit will give you a rather spiky output. Build one and have a play :)
