What is Chinese Dumbass Notation?
I never heard of it, so I googled it. I'm amazed that anything interesting and useful would be given such a name. The first reference I can find is a question about it in the Art of Problem Solving forum, 11 Jan 2010: I have read around the forum of Chinese "Dumbass" Notation, used when "dumbassing" an inequality - however, a Google search yields nothing of the notation. Can somebody please explain this notation? The first answer that I can find to that question is the article by Brian Hamrick 2 Jul 2010 The Art of Dumbassing at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.  It explains it well. I still have no idea why that term is used. But what is it?  It's a notation for homogeneous polynomials in three variables that makes working with them easy.  A homogeneous polynomial of degree n is a polynomial all of whose monomials has degree n. For example, [math]f(x,y,z)=x^4+3xyz^2-5y^3z[/math]  is homogeneous of degree 4.  The coefficients of a homogeneous polynomial in three variables can be written in a triangular array where you place the coefficients according to these positions of the monomials [math]\begin{bmatrix} &&&&x^4\\&&&x^3y&&x^3z\\ &&x^2y^2&&x^2yz&&x^2z^2\\ &xy^3&&xy^2z&&xyz^2&&xz^3\\ y^4&&y^3z&&y^2z^2&&yz^3&&z^4\end{bmatrix}[/math] so that the example polynomial would be displayed as           [math]\begin{bmatrix} &&&&1\\&&&0&&0\\ &&0&&0&&0\\ &0&&0&&3&&0\\ 0&&-5&&0&&0&&0\end{bmatrix}[/math] Symmetric polynomials will have symmetric representations.  For example, Here are some articles that show how you can use the notation: Evan Chen's 2013 article Supersums of Square-Weights: A Dumbass's Perspective Farrell Eldrian Wu's 2014 article Triangular Polynomial Notation Joel Antonio Vásquez's 2015 article Chinese Dumbass Notation Daniel Liu's 2015 article Using Chinese Dumbass Notation to Find Algebraic Identities I'm interested if anyone knows the history of the term or if triangular arrays like this were used before.  (I suspect the term was created by the inventor as an excessively modest term.)
