How much harder and costlier is it to manufacture triangular solar panels, compared to rectangular?
Because solar cells are square, or square with rounded corners, you would need to use non-standard cell shapes if you are trying to optimize the panel efficiency. This can be done, and there are triangular shaped solar modules specifically designed to "fill-in" spaces on roofs that rectangular panels can not. They are not very common in the US, but I believe they are commonly used in Japan. These types of panels are more complex and more costly to make, and I don't think they are typically equilateral. Another interesting form factor I have seens is from Armageddon Energy, a start-up in the US. Solar On Every Rooftop They have a "Solar Clover" which might be interesting for a geodesic dome.
