What was the first robot ever to be able to transform into something else?
Many proto-robotic mechanisms were built in antiquity, a few fragments of which survive today, such as the Antikythera Mechanism, constructed around 50 BC, shown in x-ray imaging below. Its exact function is unclear, but it consists of more than 30 moving parts and gears.   Most such machines are known only from descriptions. Hero of Alexandria (c. 10-70 AD), the inventor of the steam engine (or aeolipile) and the vending machine (dispensing a measure of liquid in exchange for a coin), also designed and built a miniature theatre in which figures of Dionysus and his followers moved around on a self-propelled and self-guided cart. This machine also was the earliest recorded use of a "programming language," using a system of winding and unwinding string that steered the cart on a programmed series of moves forward and back, and turns left and right.     Many of the technical innovations of Greek antiquity were in the realm of the theatre, including a "transformer" device, the Periaktos. It was first described in Vitruvius' book De architectura (c. 14 BC), and was much later revived in the Renaissance theatre. One notable theatrical designer who used it was Nicola Sabbatini (1574-1654). In essence, it was a series of triangular prisms, driven by a series of interlocking gears.   Using a clock-driven timing mechanism OR operated by human assistants, the array of Periakoi prisms rotated all at once to transform, for instance, a view of the sea to a view of the city at an appropriate point in the Greek drama. In other situations, a group of, say, Greek fighters, could be transformed into a group of group of wailing mourners. The images were painted onto the faces of the triangular prisms. This is a modern example of the ancient principle.
