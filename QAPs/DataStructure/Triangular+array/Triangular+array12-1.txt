What is a good resource for experienced programmers to learn Excel VBA?
If you are experienced in some programming language then it would be a little easy. Even if you are not aware of any language, then knowing few programming constructs can make your job easier such as IF condition, Loops and arrays. As Harsha Vardhan has mentioned, the best way is to jump onto sample programs.  Start a workbook - > record a macro ->Press ALT+F11 to open the VBA editor -> Perform some action such as adding a new worksheet - > see the code on editor. This way you can learn cool techniques such as coloring a cell, clearing contents of a worksheet and you can do possibly anything on VBA which you can think of doing on excel such as VLOOKUP, using functions like FIND and SUBSTITUTE. In order to get started, you can take a look at some basic examples which I prepared sometime back using below links: How To Generate Pascal Triangle Variant Using VBA A Guide to Data Tables in Microsoft Excel How To Generate A Backward Triangular Series of Numbers How to Generate a Forward Series Triangle of Numbers Clear The Active Worksheet With a Click of a Button How to Check #N/A or Any Error in Excel Range Using VBA PS: When you do VLOOKUP using VBA, 6th Link given above would help you a lot as I had to waste many hours finding the fix for #N/A issue in VLOOKUP. (The typical error that you will get is : Run-time error ’1004′: Unable to get the VLookup property of the Worksheetfuntion class. )
