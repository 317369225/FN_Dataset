Suppose A is an NxN matrix whose entries are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance σ^2. What is the mean and variance of X = det(A)?
Answer: [math][0,\sigma^{2N} N!] [/math] respectively. This is surprisingly easy, in the case when the distribution of the random variables (not specified in the original post) are Gaussian.  First let [math] B=\frac{1}{\sigma} A [/math].  It is known that B has a QR decomposition whose triangular form R has independent chi-variables [math] \xi_{i} [/math] on the diagonal, with i-th term (moving up and left from the lower right corner) having i degrees of freedom. Further Q's columns are spherically invariant random orthogonal vectors independent of each other and independent of R. See my Quora post http://qr.ae/RHMAni where I map out the formula for the Cholesky factor built from a rectangular array of Gaussian zero mean unit variance independent random variables.  One can easily show that the case M=N leads us back to the QR problem at hand here. It is a little bit trickier to show that the Q matrix is independent of R, but this can be done, see Adaptive Radar Detection and Estimation (Wiley Series in Remote Sensing and Image Processing): Simon Haykin, Allan Steinhardt: 9780471544685: Amazon.com: Books. Note that this result has a name, as Joe Blitzstein pointed out, it is due to Bartlett and is found on Wikipedia, Wishart distribution (ignore the name of the link, the Bartlett representation is included). Note that since Q is unitary and real valued its determinant must be either 1, or -1.  Due to spherical symmetry we conclude either value is equally likely and conclude that det(Q) is a binomial random variable, with equal probabilities of 1/2. It follows from the fact that [math]det(QR)=det(Q)det(R)=\pm det(R)[/math]  that the mean of det(A) is zero, as Michael Hochster proves, otherwise,  in his Quora answer already posted. (The  [math]\pm [/math]  here is shorthand for a binomial random variable of mean zero, entries 1,-1). My addition here is giving the variance, and in fact the implicit distribution for det(A). We do this as follows. First note from the QR decomposition, and the determinant property of triangular matrices  that [math] det(BB^T)=det(B)^2=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\xi_{i}^2 [/math]. Thus, with [math]  =_d [/math] denoting equality in distribution, we get: [math] A =_d \pm(\prod_{i=1}^{N}\xi_{i} )\sigma^N. [/math] It then follows from variance/product commutation for IID variates that: [math]var(det(A))= (\sigma^{2N} \prod_{i=1}^{N}i)=\sigma^{2N} N! \\  [/math]  and     [math] E(det(A))=0 [/math] As a fact check this agrees with Lee Witt's reply for N=2. I bet this is published somewhere.......  Joe Blitzstein knows for sure! Note: changes added 9/8/2015, thanks to Michael Hochster for suggested clarifying comments.. Updated 20w ago • View Upvotes
