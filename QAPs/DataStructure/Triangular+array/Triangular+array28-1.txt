What does the number 30 mean to you?
Well it seems that you want to know about the No. 30 and since it is just a no for me here are some of the facts associated with that no that you may find interesting.. 30 is a natural number (aka whole number; counting number; non-negative integer; positive integer) following 29 and  preceding 31. 30 is a positive whole number with two digits. 30 is the 19th composite number (aka  nonprime number; non-negative nonprime; natural nonprime; whole nonprime; counting nonprime). 30 is an even number. 30 is equal to: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10; 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8; 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 12; 6 + 7 + 8 + 9; and 1 + 4 + 9 + 16. 30 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 and 30; its divisors sum to 72; it is thus congruent  to 2 mod 4: a(n) = 4n+2, i.e., is an integer possessing equal numbers of odd and even divisors (aka  singly even numbers). 30 is the 3rd primorial (2∗3∗5);  the first two being 2 (1∗2) and 6 (2∗3). It follows that all primorials ≥ 30 are evenly divisible by 30. 30 is the smallest sphenic number; divisible by exactly  3 distinct primes (2, 3 and 5) and a total of 8 divisors (see bullet, directly above). 30 is the smallest of the four terms in the arithmetic progression  of positive integers possessing three distinct prime factors:  30-66-102-138. 30 is smallest number not the sum of three integer cubes. 30 is equal to multiples of the first three prime numbers, namely: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15∗2 = 30               3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10∗3 = 30                            5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 6∗5 = 30 30 is a square pyramidal number  in that it is the sum of the first four square numbers (1² + 2² + 3² + 4² = 30), as illustrated below: 30 is an octagonal pyramidal number: n(n+1)(2n-1)/2. 30 is a 5-smooth number (aka Hamming sequence) in that its prime divisors are all ≤ 5. 30 is a 7-smooth number (aka highly composite number or humble number) in that its prime divisors  are all ≤ 7. 30 is an 11-smooth number in that its prime divisors are all ≤ 11. 30 is the product of the first 5 nonzero Fibonacci numbers (F1, ..., F5),  thus: 1∗1∗2∗3∗5 = 30. 30 is equal to (1+5)+(2+5)+(3+5)+(4+5) = 6+7+8+9 = 30 30 is equal to 12 + 22 + 52. 30 is equal to 25-2 and n5-n is divisible by 30. 30 is a pronic number (aka oblong, rectangular or heteromecic number) and as such is the sum of two triangular numbers. 30 is the smallest Giuga number. 30 is the sum of two successive primes: 13+17=30. 30 is the index number for Fibonacci number, F30 = 832040 = 5∗11∗23∗31∗61 = the largest  Fibonacci number with 6 digits. 30 is the smallest integer with three distinct prime divisors. 30 "splits" twin primes  29 and 31, the latter both a Mersenne prime and a  lucky number. This relationship can also be expressed as  30 = average of twin primes 29 and 31 or as                 ________       30 = √ 29∗31+1 30 is an abundant number (aka excessive number) in that the sum of its divisors (72) exceeds 2n. 30's abundance is  thus calculated as: 72 - (2∗30) = 12. 30 is a highly abundant number. 30 is a member of the Lower Wythoff sequence. 30 is the largest number such that all smaller numbers prime relative to it are actually 1 or prime; those numbers  being: 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 & 29. 30 is thus the largest member of the 10-element sequence of  very round numbers (the other 9  elements in this sequence being 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 & 24)  a reduced residue system consisting of only primes and 1. In 30's  case the reduced residue is expressed as {30,{1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,  29}}. 30 is the number of ways to  color a cube with 6 colors. 30 has an aliquot sum of 42. 30 is a semiperfect number (aka pseudoperfect number) in that a subset of its divisors (5, 10 and 15) = 30. 30 is the total unit length of the straight line segments used to construct a  star polygon  notated as {p/q} where p=10 and q=3 (q is termed the density of the  star polygon; in this case the straight lines connect every 3rd point  of 10 equally spaced points lying on a circle's circumference.); thus  {10/3}. The Schläfli symbol for this polygon is {30}.
