What is Chinese Dumbass Notation?
David Joyce's answer does a great job of explaining the math behind Chinese Dumbass Notation (CDN). I'll talk a bit about its history and when it's used. CDN is a notation that makes it really easy to expand 3-variable homogenous polynomials. So it's used to "dumbass" 3-variable homogenous inequality problems, like 2003 USAMO Problem 5 or the second problem here (my dumbassing solution is here, and computations were done with CDN). Dumbassing is an approach to solving inequalities by indiscriminately expanding all polynomials and blindly applying Schur/Muirhead (Schurhead). Some Chinese math olympiad participants got really good at using CDN and showed the Americans how to use it, hence the name. CDN makes dumbassing really efficient, so when you see a problem like this on the USAMO you know you can grind it out, guaranteed, in 20 minutes top. It makes applying Schurhead a lot more visual and intuitive--the "strong" terms like [math]\sum a^4[/math] are on the outside of the triangle, which dominate weaker terms like [math]\sum a^2bc[/math] on the inside of the triangle. Unfortunately, inequalities and especially the symmetric homogenous type are dying away in olympiad math. Most of them tend to be uninteresting and too knowledge-based.
