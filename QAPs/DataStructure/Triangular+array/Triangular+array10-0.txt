What is the function of excitatory pyramidal neurons?
Excitatory pyramidal neurons account for around 80% of the neurons in the cerebral cortex or around 20 billion cells. They are the information processing workhorses of cognition. The cerebral cortex is composed of around 80% excitatory neurons and 20% inhibitory neurons, which are organized into 6 layers according to a complex replicated circuit pattern. The excitatory neurons are all pyramidal cells, so called because the cell body has a triangular pyramid-like shape, and they are all fairly similar. The 20% inhibitory neurons come in a wide variety of esoteric shapes and behavioral characteristics and likely have a diverse array of functions. The pyramidal cells receive around 10,000 inputs each from other neurons, maybe 80% excitatory and 20% inhibitory. The job of the neuron, as much as is understood, is to detect simultaneously activated configuration patterns in its excitatory inputs, subject to suppression and filtering by the inhibitory inputs. Activated collections of millions of these neurons represent thoughts and perceptions. Collectively they construct a model of what is "out there" in the environment and "vote" on responses that, when aggregated, become the actions we take in the world. Here is what an Excitatory Pyramidal Neuron looks like, surrounded by some creatively-named inhibitory neurons. 99% of the cells are not shown, creating the impression of empty space between neurons, when in reality, neurons are packed with high density.
