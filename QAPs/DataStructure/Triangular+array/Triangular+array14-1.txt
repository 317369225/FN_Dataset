How much harder and costlier is it to manufacture triangular solar panels, compared to rectangular?
Here's another image of non-rectangular panels contributing to a beautiful install: This is the Sebastopol CA Police station. Wow... I believe that non-rectangular shapes are no longer manufactured, and my sense why is that manufacturers have been competing on price, and have drifted away from any SKU not price-competitive. Unfortunately, the stepped designs that non-rectangular roofs require are not near as attractive: Let's hope that some smart manufacturer (SunPower seems a logical choice!)Â  brings the three-sided panel back to market.
