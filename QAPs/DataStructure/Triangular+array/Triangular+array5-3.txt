Why do array indexes start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?
The Programming Language Lua is another in which array subscripts start at 1. Some languages, like Python (Welcome to Python.org) allow negative array indices to indicate the nth element from the end, and in this case, -1 indicates the last element not the "last minus one" element. Think of this as subscripting modulo the length of the array. Shashank Agarwal answered based on pointer math, and on pointer - subscript duality, in C. I think that as good a way of understanding the underlying issue as any. In the C language, v[0] is the same as *(v+0) because that is easiest to compile, maps most directly to how hardware works, and avoids certain kinds of off-by-one errors when working interchangeably with pointers and array subscripts.
