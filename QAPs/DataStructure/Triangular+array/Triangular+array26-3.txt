How can technology help to change the color of my room walls with the click of a button?
My first post :) i think im gonna like quora. Also, im glad to see a question i can sink my teeth into. In my opinion, the best way for achieving consistent color throughout each wall would be as follows: Assuming the walls are not for structural support, you may have to remove the panel on the show side. Either that, or lose a bit of space in the room. Purchase RGB strip LEDs, the more the better, maybe one LED per 4 square inches, max (for extremely high quality). You'll need a controller of some sort for these (can easily be powered by arduino). I would certainly include a master potentiometer in the controller design. Anyway, lay out the LEDs on the wall in the most consistent fashion possible. Then, perhaps about 4 to 5 inches from the surface on which the LEDs are mounted, put up a large panel (or multiple small panels). This panel should be a translucent 'frosted white' type of panel, something similar to how paper is, but plastic, and slightly more translucent. If you Google a bit, I'm sure you'll find people selling frosty white looking acrylic, with the option to customize the size of the sheet that you buy.
