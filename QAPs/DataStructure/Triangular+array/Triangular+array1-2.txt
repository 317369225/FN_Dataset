I have a mathematical conjecture that is basically a triangular array but I don't know how to show the world. I discovered it since I was 9 below
The numbers on the diagonal of the multiplication table in fact, follow a parabola, and the properties come from this. However, the reason they teach the tables in columns, to the extent of 'do you know your eight-times tables', suggest that learning the eight-times tables has an advantage over learning the grid.  This advantage is, that when you're multiplying or dividing by eight, the mind only loads the 'eight times tables'.  It's a quite noticable shift if 'eight by seven' is faulty, and you load 'seven by eight' as a remedy.
