What are some interesting properties number 6 has?
Being a rather small number, it isn't hard to find all kinds of properties which 6 is the first number to have. It's more challenging to find naturally-defined properties which 6 is the only number to have. Here's one. The symmetric group [math]S_n[/math] is the set of permutations of [math]n[/math] objects. It has [math]n![/math] elements. For example, [math]S_3[/math] is the set of permutations of three letters A, B, C, and its six elements can be described as "do nothing", "swap A, B", "swap B, C", "swap A, C", "A->B->C->A" and "C->B->A->C". Groups themselves have symmetries. When studying a group [math]G[/math], it's natural to wonder what are the sets of permutations of elements of [math]G[/math] which keep the group law intact. For example, we may wonder about the symmetries of [math]S_n[/math]. Don't get confused: we're exploring the set of symmetries of a set of permutations. Among those symmetries, the simplest ones in any group are the so-called inner automorphisms, which are defined like this: pick any element [math]g[/math] of your group, and then permute the elements of the group by sending [math]x[/math] to [math]g^{-1}xg[/math]. Remember that multiplication isn't generally commutative, so this expression usually maps [math]x[/math] to something other than [math]x[/math]. It turns out that the symmetries of the symmetric group [math]S_n[/math] are all inner automorphisms... ...except when [math]n=6[/math]. Yes, this is the only exception. The symmetric group on 6 elements is the only symmetric group to afford a symmetry that is not conjugation by a fixed element. There is no really quick way to construct such a symmetry of [math]S_6[/math], but the quickest I know is this: there are six ways to color the edges of [math]K_5[/math] (the complete graph on 5 vertices) in 2 colors such that each color class is a cycle. The group [math]S_5[/math] naturally acts on this set of colorings by permuting the vertices, so we get a "surprising" inclusion [math]S_5 \to S_6[/math] (it's not hard to verify that it is an inclusion). Now [math]S_6[/math] acts on the six cosets of this copy of [math]S_5[/math] inside [math]S_6[/math], and this action gives the desired outer automorphism. (Note: I suspect, but am not absolutely sure, that the nontrivial endofunctor mentioned in Sridhar Ramesh's answer is the same thing).
