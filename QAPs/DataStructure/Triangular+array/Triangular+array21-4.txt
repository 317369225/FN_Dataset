How many neurons (or how many connections) does it take to recreate one image in our mind?
The question cannot be answered definitively because it is not well-defined.  The answer is probably -- a lot less than you think, and in a much more complex way that is fairly unique and home-grown for each individual. The brain is not a machine like a video recorder, and there are no pure, separate "image representations" in the brain, like an array of pixels.  It is unlikely that a "cerebroscope", a machine that would read the brain and generate an external display of image contents, is remotely possible. Instead, memories are multimodal, integrating some degree of both sensation, movement, propioception, and other features.  One word for this is synaesthesia.  Moreover, memories are to a significant degree "made to order" as needed, based on other structures and schemas.  Folk words for this process include visualization and imagination.  There is likely a lot of overlap between the structures associated with "different" images, with sets of neurons representing multiple images.  This confounds any kind of quantitative estimate of neurons-per-image. There may be some parts of visual memory that are like spatial maps, but these would be a direct map, not something with an intermediate code.  The memory process is gated through the amygdala and hypothalamus according to emotional salience and body-sense information including what we'd call emotions and "gut" feeling signals from outside the brain proper.  In addition to the above, the process likely varies quite a bit between individuals, and there is a large variance in the ability to memorize and recall images.
