Are prefix sums of arrays similar to fibonacci sequences?
A prefix sum array gives you the sum of the input array up to the nth-element. Let say you've the following input: input <- [1,2,3,4,5] Then : prefixSum <- psum(input)// prefixSum = [1,3,6,10,15] In fact, each element of prefixSum array is simply the last computed sum to which you add the current input element. lastSum <- 0for each element i of input at index    lastSum <- lastSum + i    prefixSum[index] <- lastSumend It is closer to a running total than Fibonacci ! When input array contains the first integers, prefixSum will contain triangular numbers!
