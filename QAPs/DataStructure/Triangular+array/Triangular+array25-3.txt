How would you find all the Pythagorean triplets in an array of n numbers?
Here's one approach: 1- Let's say the ordered list is x1,...xn where xn > x1 2- Take any 2 no.s xa and xb from this list where xb>xa      (start with xa =x1) 3- Find out (xb-xa) and (xb+xa)     If xb-xa and xb+xa are both odd or both even then proceed or go back to step 2 and pick another pair.     If xb-xa or xb-xa is a prime, then go back to step 2 and pick another pair 4- calculate z=(xb-xa)*(xb+xa) 5- Evaluate if z is a square (for example, is it the sum of any 2 consecutive triangular numbers). If yes then go to step 6, else go back to 2 6- Pick all numbers between xb and xa and square them 7- If any of these match with z, then you have your pythagorean triplet. Go back to step 2 till all pairs have been exhausted.
