What is the most unexpected relationship that you have come across in mathematical statistics (connecting different distributions)?
Suppose you form X, an N by M matrix of zero mean Gaussian random variables. Now suppose you form the lower triangular L (Cholesky) factor, of the outer product matrix XX'. Then the resulting matrix L has independent entries as follows: [math] L= \left( \begin{array}{cccccc} \xi_{M} & 0 & ... & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ n & \xi_{M-1} &0 & ... & 0 & 0 \\ n & n &\xi_{M-2} &0 & ... & 0 \\ n & n & n &\xi_{M-3} & 0& ... \\ n & ...&... & \ddots& \ddots & 0 \\ n & n & ... & ... &n&\xi_{M-N+1} \\ \end{array} \right) [/math] where [math] \xi_{i} [/math] is a chi random variable with i degrees of freedom, and n is a Gaussian random variable. I develop a simple derivation (but didn't discover) this result in a book I wrote years ago called "Adaptive Radar Detection and Estimation". It doesn't seem to be well known. It vastly simplifies many derivations in multivariate analysis, as well as accelerates numerical stochastic simulations! -------- I will sketch a proof: Simply create the expression LL'. Check that the independence assumption is valid recursively. Then.......Done! PS: Joe Blitzstein pointed out in a comment that this result has a name, Bartlett distribution, Page on duke.edu.
