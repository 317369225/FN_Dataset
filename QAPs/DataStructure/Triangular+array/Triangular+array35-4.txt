What is the cause of the downfall of the Spanish football team?
In my opinion its lethargy. A man is driven until he gets his goals same goes for any great teams or athletes. The ones who are satisfued with success go on to become legends. The Spanish team won everything they could within a span of 8 yrs. They still have a lot of character in them, but they lost to a dutch team who are yet to win something. Moreover most of these current dutch players are still licking the wounds of a bad finals of the 2010 world cup. The Spanish side are not to be written of just yet. They need motivation again and such losses are bound to kick the football in them again. If you have watched the latest match they were playing with an entirely new game plan. More of a Madrid style than Barca's. They need to get the right mix of both to win matches again and Spaniards are good at rev vering from losses.
