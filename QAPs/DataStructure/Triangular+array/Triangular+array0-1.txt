Find the row number and column number where 20096 occurs in a triangular array?
(Assuming indexing starts at 1.)  The first step would be to find which diagonal 20096 is on.  Find the integer d such that the d'th triangular number (d(d+1)/2) is less than 20096 and the (d+1)'th triangular number ((d+1)(d+2)/2) is not less.  20096 is in the (d+1)'th diagonal.  Now to figure out where on the diagonal.  Calculate m=((d+1)(d+2)/2)-20096.  This is how far away it is from being at the end (top) of the diagonal.  The end of the diagonal is in column (d+1), so 20096 will be m columns to the left; the end of the diagonal is in row 1, so 20096 will be m columns down.
