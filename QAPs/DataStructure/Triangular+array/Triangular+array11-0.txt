What is the most unexpected relationship that you have come across in mathematical statistics (connecting different distributions)?
There are lots. Here are a couple surprising mixtures. 1. A Gamma mixture of Poissons is Negative Binomial. That is, if [math]X|\lambda \sim \textrm{Pois}(\lambda)[/math] and [math]\lambda[/math] has a Gamma distribution, then the marginal distribution of [math]X[/math] is Negative Binomial. This is an important result in Bayesian statistics, and helps explain why the Negative Binomial is an overdispersed version of the Poisson. 2. It is well-known how to get from a Normal to a Student-t distribution as a scale mixture, but much less well-known how to get from a Normal to a Logistic. Andrews and Mallows (JRSS B, 1974) proved a very surprising result that the necessary "bridge" is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution. Specifically, if [math]Z \sim N(0,1)[/math] and  [math]K[/math] has the distribution that arises as the asymptotic distribution in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, then [math]2KZ[/math] has a Logistic distribution. This relationship gives a connection between probit and logistic regression. Andrews and Mallows remark that they "know of no probabilistic interpretation of this relation"; I would like such an interpretation too!
