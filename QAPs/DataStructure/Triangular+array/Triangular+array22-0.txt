How can I differentiate between a sine wave or triangular wave (or any kind of wave) using an AVR microcontroller?
Sine vs. triangle is pretty tough, because the components that distinguish a sine wave from a triangle wave are small. Here are the magnitudes of the fundamental and the first five harmonics of a triangle wave: The only thing that differentiates this from a pure sine wave (red) is the harmonics (blue). If you want to do this kind of analysis with a generic waveform, you're going to need to sample it at a large multiple of the fundamental frequency in order to pick up the harmonics. So you're going to need both a fast analog/digital converter (one that can sample at, say, 10x the highest frequency wave you expect to see), and good pre-filtration. You'll definitely need a low pass filter to avoid aliasing from the high-frequency harmonics, and you might also want to use a notch filter at the fundamental frequency. In order to come up with a good circuit design, we would need to know all of the detailed requirements, especially the range of frequencies over which the circuit should operate, and the required accuracy of the sine/not sine determination.
