How can order and chaos exist at the same time?
There is no "order" in nature: everything is constantly changing, just as it has been doing since the very beginning of existence. Life is a constant struggle for survival: any creature can die at any time from any of a host of causes. Anirudh Shetty has suggested looking up at the night sky ... many people cannot see it because of all the lights that blot it out, but go into the wilderness and look up. All you will see is total chaos. Our galaxy is a gigantic, cyclonic storm. On Earth, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, hail storms, gale-force winds, floods and a host of other phenomena disrupt peoples' lives all over the world. We try to balance it out with city planning, roads and railways, landscaping, to-do lists, art, culture and a million other things that give us the illusion of order. Only humans seek order: it's a human invention that keeps some people sane.
