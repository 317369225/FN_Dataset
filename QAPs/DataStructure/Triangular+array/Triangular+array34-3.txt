What is the difference between billiards, pool and snooker?
Billiards, pool, and snooker are all different types of games and each game makes use of a different type of table. Billiard tables: Snooker and pool essentially developed from billiards. Speaking in terms of “carom billiards,” the objective of billiards is to strike the object ball with the cue ball, hitting the rails three times, and then contacting the second ball. There is no need for pockets. Customary dimensions of a billiard table are 9.3 feet by 4.7 feet. In the U.S., tables might also measure 10 feet by five feet. A billiard table’s surface is covered in 100 per cent worsted wool, which is a smooth and wrinkle-free compact fabric. It’s referred to as baize. (Pool and snooker tables use felt.) The surface area of a billiard table is roughly 112 inches by 56 inches. Pool tables: A pool table, on the other hand, has six pockets; four of which are located on each of the corners and two on the midway point of each side the long side of the table. Pool tables come in different sizes of nine feet, eight feet, and seven feet in length. New style “condo” pool tables come in even smaller sizes of six-or-so feet. Snooker tables: Snooker tables are larger than billiard or pool tables. They are also lower in height and have smaller pockets. Snooker tables in Europe are generally 12 feet by six feet. Snooker tables in the U.S. are smaller, measuring 10 feet by five feet.
