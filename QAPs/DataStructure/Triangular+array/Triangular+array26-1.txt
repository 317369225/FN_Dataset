How can technology help to change the color of my room walls with the click of a button?
You could try a wall paper (once somebody makes it) made of Magnetochromatic material according to this news article I came across. This new material is composed of microscopic polymer "magnetochromatic microspheres," or beads, whose structural stability allows for instant changes in color with "no change in the structure or intrinsic properties of the microspheres themselves," according to Yadong Yin, who led the study. The beads' colors change in response to magnetic fields, which alter the relative orientation of the periodic arrays within them. This use of magnetic fields allows for "instant action, contactless control, and easy integration into electronic devices already in the market." The color-changing beads can also be used to create environmentally friendly pigments for inks and paints. "Rewritable energy-saving display units such as papers and posters are our main interests," Magnetochromatic Material Changes Color on Command Or a Color Changing Wall from Yanko design, which uses triangular shapes that are turned around to change the wall color, each of the triangle shapes are of a different color. Change It! by Amirko aka Amirkhan Abdurakhmanov " Yanko Design LED wall washer lights as mentioned by Malcolm Sargeant is the best option currently, readily available.
