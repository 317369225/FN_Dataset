How many neurons (or how many connections) does it take to recreate one image in our mind?
This is a very hard question to answer, since you wouldn't even be able to get neuroscientists to agree how many brain areas are involved, let alone how you should define or measure visual imagery. Honestly, I am not even sure I can give a reasonable guess within an order of magnitude. But, as a really rough estimate it's probably on the order of 10s or 100s of millions of neurons. 100,000,000s of neurons. Some very dirty back-of-the-envelope figures (all google-able): The human brain probably has on the order of 100 billion neurons. Maybe 1/5th of those are in the cerebral cortex, and about 1/3 of cortex is visual cortex. The higher-order visual cortices are almost certainly involved in visual imagery and even if you allotted just 1/100 of the visual cortex that would still be 70 million neurons or so. But that could easily be off by an order of magnitude in either direction. And how many connections? Well, cortical pyramidal neurons easily receive 1,000 or even 10,000 synaptic inputs each so, that is a lot of connections. In reality the brain is a highly interconnected and distributed system, and  higher order functions (like mental visual imagery) tends to engage many parts of the brain, not just one isolated area or set of neurons. So the question is hard to answer without a stricter definition of the behavior in question and a definition of what it means for a neuron to be necessary for the behavior. This is not thoroughly understood, but also not unstudied. There are lots of relevant studies using fMRI in humans to study the neural correlates of mental visual imagery. For example check out this highly cited review on the topic:  Neural foundations of imagery. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2001 Sep;2(9):635-42.
