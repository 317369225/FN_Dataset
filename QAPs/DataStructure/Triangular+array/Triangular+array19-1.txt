Intel Haswell CPUs have 22nm processor technology - what exactly is 22nm in Haswell CPUs?
22nm (nanometers) refers to the feature size of the gates and circuitry that make up the processor.  In the case of the 22nm process node, it represent half the distance between elements that make up the processor. The smaller the feature size, the less power is required to run the processor and it produces less heat.  Or it can run faster for the same amount of heat produced by a previous, larger generation processor. Haswell is Intel's name for their 4th generation Core architecture.  Intel follows a Tick-Tock strategy in their processor releases with a "tock" being a new processor architecture and a "tick" being a shrink of the feature size of the processor architecture.  Followed by another tock, tick and so on. Haswell is the "tock" from the previous generation "Ivy Bridge" tick which was a process shrink from 32nm to 22nm of the "Sandy Bridge" tock architecture.  The "tick" for Haswell is the Broadwell which will shrink its feature size from 22nm to 14nm. 22nm was a significant advance.  Only a handful of fabs in the world can make hardware at this feature size and Intel is the best at it.  Everyone else is playing catch-up. All semiconductor technology has been shrinking for the past several decades.  It is following the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors which lays out approximately when smaller fabrication steps will occur.  This has been going on since the 1970s.  The most significant time will be when the size reaches 5 nanometer (nm), at which time we will be at the end of conventional silicon technology and Moore's Law.  We will be in the early stages of nanotechnology at this point.
