Are prefix sums of arrays similar to fibonacci sequences?
It's not quite the same thing, because you don't add up the terms in the prefix sum array. The value of the prefix sum at index i is equal to the sum of all of the elements up to i in your original array. Therefore, the prefix sums for the array [1, 2, 3, 4] will be: [1, 3 = 1 + 2, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3, 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4].
