How do I solve for equivalent electrical resistance a triangular prism of r ohms resistances sides?
Hello, this is a very interesting question which I hadn't come across before. I have been thinking for a while until I came with a simple mathematical approach: My assumption is: 1. Voltage between O to E only allows current to go towards E and not "backwards". The idea is to find routes to move from vertex O to vertex E (those are where the wires would be plugged). I found the routes that I show in the picture. Therefore, the equivalent resistance would be: R_eq = 2* (R+R) || 3* (R+R+R)||2*(R+R+R+R)||2*(R+R+R+R+R) where || means "paralel" applied to equivalent resistances: R_eq = 2* (2R) || 3*(3*R) || 2* (4R)||2*(5R) when two resistances are plugged in paralel array, you have: R = R_1 || R_2 = 1/( 1/R_1 + 1/R_2), you just need to apply that to the above-mentioned resistances. I won't prevent you from having that fun by yourself ;) My concerns to this solution are: 1. Are there be more paths from O to E? If so, what is the general formula. 2. Is this approach valid always? I'm not sure about the ultimate answer about this problem. My first idea was to try a 2D-development of the prism using resistances that were not exactly R but summed the same total amount... However, I think that approach lacks physical sustain, as the current actually move following the paths I mention above (or some of them). However, can we be sure about the sense of the currents not going "backwards" in this arrange? I'd like to know more about the possibilities that this involve. If I come up with something else about the problem, I'll let you know.
