What are some benefits of reading?
Benefits of reading? Where do I even start? Well, let's begin. Increases Vocabulary - It proliferates one's vocabulary to such a great extent that using simple words would feel the same as committing a sin. Let me enlighten you with a few examples: You would come to know that there are millions of words that can be used as a compliment other than "Good", "Nice", "Amazing", "Brilliant". You can use these instead, "splendid", "sublime", "Exhilarating", "Superlative", "Extravagant", "Flamboyant", "panache" etc etc etc You won't be adding "Very" Before every word to exaggerate it. You would simply say, "That's terrific", instead of, "That's very good". Improves Grammar - your grammar would eventually improve. You'd be in possession of strengthened grammar. Benefits of strong grammar? You'd be framing sentences correctly. You can correct others like a boss! You can even gain respect. ;) Gives a reason to live - yes, it does give you a reason to live. In times when you feel like nothing's right, simply grab a book, snuggle in a blanket and start reading. You'll be so indulged that nothing would seem problematic. It gives you a reason to cherish your life. They say "A man who reads, lives various lives". This is truly true. You get to become the characters that you're reading about. If you read, you're not confined to your own life, you get to know how it feels to live someone else's life. Imagination becomes vivid - Now at last but not the least, your imagination becomes broader. You can imagine things to a greater and fuller extent. In simple words, you become creative! I hope you got the answer you've been looking for. Have a nice day. Go and get some books, already. Happy reading. :)
