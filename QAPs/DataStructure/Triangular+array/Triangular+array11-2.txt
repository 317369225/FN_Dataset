What is the most unexpected relationship that you have come across in mathematical statistics (connecting different distributions)?
If [math]X,Y,Z[/math] are independent random variables, uniformly distributed in [math][0,1][/math], what would you guess is the distribution of [math](XY)^Z[/math]? (I don't know if this satisfies the "asymptotic" part of your question, but since I don't understand that part I figured I'll go with what I've got). I'm not sure what I would have guessed except that I most certainly would *not* have guessed that the answer is "uniform". But, amazingly, it is. (I learned this from Ori Gurel-Gurevich).
