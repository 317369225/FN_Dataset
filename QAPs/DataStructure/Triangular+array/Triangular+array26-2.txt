How can technology help to change the color of my room walls with the click of a button?
I have this thought too, I am also want to change my room walls, colors or patterns, just like changing them in SIMs via several clicks. For now, LED wall washer would be an option, it has several color modes, like seven colors, full colors, single color. Although it doesn't seem like high tech. If it's just one wall of your room, you may try install a big screen, but it would be easy to be broken. In future, I assume there would be optic painting materials that could replace paint, and you can change how the lights reflect by computers or standalone devices. You can download 3D modeling files or make by self and apply them to walls controlled by computers. I just find a news about your question, some scientists from Shenzhen of China have made an innovation, to change wall color by one phone swipe. Change your wall colour with one phone swipe
