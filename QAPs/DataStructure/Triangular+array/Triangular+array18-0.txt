What is the clearest proof of the Spectral Theorem?
This of course depends on which spectral theorem you want.  The motivating case is that of Hermitian matrices over a finite-dimensional complex inner product space, and it's quite straightforward.  To be precise: Theorem. If H is a Hermitian operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space V, then V has an orthonormal basis consisting of H-eigenvectors. Proof. Since we're working over an algebraically closed field, H has an eigenvector v, say with eigenvalue [math]\lambda[/math].  Since H is Hermitian, [math]v^\top[/math] is H-invariant: if [math]w \in v^\top[/math] then [math]\langle v, H w \rangle = \langle H v, w \rangle = \langle \lambda v, w \rangle = \lambda \langle v, w \rangle = 0[/math] Now recurse, replacing V with [math]v^\top[/math]. Of course this presentation is a touch disingenuous -- this argument probably wasn't initially for a Hermitian map on a complex vector space, it was probably for the usual dot product on C^n.  The Hermitian maps are then precisely those maps for which this argument works.
