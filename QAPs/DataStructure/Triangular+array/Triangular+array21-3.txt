How many neurons (or how many connections) does it take to recreate one image in our mind?
All of the parts that you use for seeing normally, pretty much. Most of the systems in the brain appear to be bidirectional. When you imagine something, you're just regenerating the stored image back up the visual pathway. The trick is when it comes to fine detail that changes in objects depending on their state or usage. Your brain is pretty great at regenerating fine-detail images of (say) yourself lying in bed reading your cellphone screen. It can do this in about as much detail as in real life - but what it can't do is consistently recall changing details - like what's actually on the screen. Or what's in a book. This is why it's nearly impossible to read in a dream; the first time your eyes hit the page, it might make sense, but look away and back again, and the paragraphs might be in the same place, but the letters in the words are all going to be completely random and jumbled. But! It's still using the same system, so you still get a high-resolution image. The reason images are fuzzy and indistinct when you imagine them with your eyes open is that the input signal is overriding the image you're trying to conjure.

Also, check out Image and Brain (Kosslyn, 1994) for a detailed analysis... although it's quite self-evident once you look at how the visual cortex is organized, and its feedback mechanisms - or how the auditory system generates similar things - particularly when hearing is damaged).
