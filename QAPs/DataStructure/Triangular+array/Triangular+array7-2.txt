How does the MOT justify the simultaneous formation of bonding and antibonding of the molecular orbital? How does the existence of the antibonding orbital result in the formation of a molecule?
Another way to think of this: orbitals are not necessarily volumes in which electrons are but rather those which, by the rules of quantum mechanics, they may be found with greater or lesser degrees of probability. Remembering two things: that the electrons participating in molecular bonds are no longer localized to any particular atom but are 'smeared out' (delocalized) in a probability distribution involving two or more nuclei; and electrons are not little balls of 'stuff' whizzing around nuclei; all we know is that they can be characterized as having charge, rest mass and spin, and behaving in wave-like manners in accordance with the Schroedinger's equation.means that all the term anti-bonding orbital tells you is that, in the vicinity of two or more atoms involved in inter-atomic bonding, the 'shared' (delocalized) electrons may potentially be 'allowed' to be found in these orbitals but only at the cost of raising the energy level of the molecule above ground state i.e. reducing the 'depth' of the potential well amongst the nuclei, and therefore the ease with which the bond can be broken.
