How can you solve simultaneous linear equations with 3 variables using Gaussian elimination?
Thanks for A2A. Actually,  this is quite boring.  It means that using elementary row transformations you reduce matrix of your linear system to the upper triangular form and then using the row transformation once again but progressing upwards you reduce it to a diagonal form. You are allowed to  swap rows of course since it corresponds  to changing order of equations in your linear system. For example, if you have the linear system below, you can swap 1st and 2nd rows first and then proceed like in video. [math]\left[\begin{array} {ccc|c}0 & 1 &1 & a\\1 & 0 & 0  & b\\1 & 1 & 0  &c\end{array} \right][/math]
