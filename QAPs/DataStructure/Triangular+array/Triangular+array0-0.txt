Find the row number and column number where 20096 occurs in a triangular array?
You may note that the first row contains all of the triangular numbers, which are of the form n(n+1)/2 where n is an integer (and is the column number). You may also note that all of the numbers between two triangular numbers are in a diagonal ending with the larger of the two triangular numbers. So, what you need to do first is find out which two triangular numbers in the first row are closest to 20096. Since n(n+1)/2 is close to (n^2)/2 and 20096*2 is close to 40,000, my first guess would be to calculate the triangular number for n=200 and then move to the left or right as needed. For n=200, n(n+1)/2 = 20,100 and for n=199, n(n+1)/2 = 19,900, so it turns out that n=200 is the exact diagonal you want. The diagonal that ends at row 1, column 200 contains the numbers from 19,901 to 20,100, so your number 20,096 is four rows to the left and four columns down from there.
