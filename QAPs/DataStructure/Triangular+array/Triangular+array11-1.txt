What is the most unexpected relationship that you have come across in mathematical statistics (connecting different distributions)?
The standard central limit theorem assumes that your random variables are independent, identically distributed and have finite variance.  None of these conditions are necessary to get asymptotic normality.  See Central Limit Theorems for CLTs with non-identically distributed random variables and the infinite variance case. (The Martingale central limit theorem is the classic example of a CLT without the independence assumption, but the version on Wikipedia leans pretty heavily on the assumption of boundedness.  Needless to say, it's not the strongest possible version.) There are also strong laws of large numbers for dependent sequences of random variables, but it's hard to pick a single version to present.
