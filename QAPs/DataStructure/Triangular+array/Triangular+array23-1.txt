Suppose A is an NxN matrix whose entries are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance σ^2. What is the mean and variance of X = det(A)?
Assuming [math] N > 1.[/math] Let [math]B[/math] be a matrix which is formed in the same way as [math]A[/math] but swapping the first two rows. Clearly [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math] have the same distribution, so their determinants have the same expected value. On the other hand, since they differ by just a row swap, [math]{\rm det}(A) = -{\rm det}(B)[/math], and  [math]E({\rm det}(A)) = -E({\rm det}(B)[/math]). So [math]E({\rm det}(A)) = 0[/math]. This would hold whenever the rows are exchangeable. I don't see how to get the variance offhand.
