How do I get the number represented as nodes of a LinkedList?Suppose My Linked list is of the form 7->4->3->5->1 Where 7 is the most significant digit and 1 is the least significant digit. I want to write a function which takes this linked list and returns 74351 as the result. Is it possible to implement the solution using LinkedList ThanksSupposing your node structure looks like: struct node_ { int value; struct node_ * next; }; typedef node_ node; Then you have the function: int getNumber(node * head) { node * ptr = head; int number = 0; while(ptr != NULL) { number = number * 10 + ptr->value; ptr=ptr->next; } return number; } The above syntax is in C, and assuming the number can be contained in a 32-bit integer. 145 Views  View Upvotes
