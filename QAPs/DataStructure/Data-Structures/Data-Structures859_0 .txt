Where can I find Java or C++ test cases for Red-Black trees?I don’t have any code developed yet, so I’ll take your data structures, and write the balancing code. I just finished with HackerRank’s AVL tests (Solve Self Balancing Tree), but they don’t have anything for Red-Black trees.You need to write them, because they are obviously implementation specific. You could insert in your Red-Black tree in random order (or some random numbers), and check that they are sorted. 124 Views  Answer requested by Thomas Johnson
