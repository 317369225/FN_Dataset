Which data structure in java can be used to search latest entry of .txt file having duplicate entries for an id (along with income and tax)?If I understand correctly, you have a file with multiple single line entries formatted something like this: Id, Income, Tax and the last entry with the same ID is the one you are looking for. Map<Id, TaxEntry> is your answer. While reading the file from the top, store the entry from each line in it. If you happen upon an entry with a duplicate ID, the new value will overwrite the old one. After reading the whole file, you will have a map that shows the latest entry for each of the IDs. 285 Views  View Upvotes
