Why is a lookup in a hash data structure so fast (O(1))?They are not “O(1)” but only O(1) in the best + average case lookups. That also excludes the complexity of your hashing function, which would be O(n) (n=string length) in the case of a string. Nevertheless, that is trivial, since strings are usually short, can be treated as constant average lengths, and because O(n) on the string length is unavoidable in any search algorithm. When considering just the number of array elements, the average case is O(1) because you don’t iterate through each element. The hash func gives you the array location of a linked list, which in the average case would have 1 element, assuming that you have set the array size to equal the number of elements in the hash map. 112 Views
