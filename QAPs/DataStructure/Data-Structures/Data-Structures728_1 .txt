Is there any data modeling pattern for versioning changes on data (not schema) of 50GB database with 300 tables?The simplest answer is, define your standards upfront. You never want to be caught late in your modelling plan with errors that could have been prevented with some thinking early on. Also, take advantage of some pre-designed model templates online, and then modify them to your liking. 300 tables isn’t THAT much, but you still want to be active in managing it yourself, as well as letting some other people work on it with you. Make sure you have a rich data glossary set up as well as this will help with any kinks along the way. And lastly, be constantly taking snapshots of your model, so that if anything does go wrong, you can go back and change it later. Nothing is worse than discovering an error, but not being able to locate it within your code. As well, you might want to consider purchasing an enterprise level RDBMS to help you manage the database once you are done your modelling strategy!
