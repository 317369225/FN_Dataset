Can you delete a node from its element in a double linked list?So a linked list is a collection of nodes containing elements. One nodes points to another and etc creating a chain that is the linked list. I understand how to delete a node from a list, but how can you call the element.delete() method to notify the node containing it to also perform node.delete()?If what you mean by “element” is something contained within a node, then no - the element probably doesn’t know which node it’s contained in. The only way would be if you explisitly told the element about the container when you added it. 39 Views
