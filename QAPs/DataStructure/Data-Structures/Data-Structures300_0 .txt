Should I focus on learning more languages or Algorithms and Data Structures?What is more important if I want to pursue a career as a Computer Programmer?Definitely Algorithms and Data Structures. You still need to know at least one programming language well enough to be able to implement those, because you can only think you understand an algorithm/data structure, but you don’t until you actually implement it. This is one of the main points of our Specialization - to have you implement all the algorithms/data structures that you study, but you are free to use any out of 10 languages of choice. Learning one more programming language is relatively easy when you already know some. 129 Views · Answer requested by Danish Ajaib
