Can I work as a data scientist with merely basic knowledge in data structures (mathematical programming, numerical analysis)?It is definitely good be familiar with data structures, but that is only one of many topics you need to know as a data scientist. You need to have a strong command of a programming language such as Python or R, a good academic grounding in statistics, probability and linear algebra, and an understanding of when to use and how to optimize machine learning algorithms. You may not be able to work as a data scientist right now, but you can certainly start self-studying towards that career path.
