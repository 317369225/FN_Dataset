What is the difference between node* next & node *next?I am working on linked list and I got stuck with this ……If there is a difference between the two could someone just explain it to me.(if possible diagrammatically to understand in a better way.)Syntactically? Absolutely none. You can write Node * next or Node* next or Node *next. Just adding more whitespace around the * changes nothing. C parsers are better than that. 804 Views  View Upvotes
