What's the best way to teach "Algorithms and data structures"?Next year I will be teaching course named “Algorithms and data structures” for two groups of students in my university. I was given the possibility to change the way this course is taught.I’m a student myself, but I highly recommend the text: “The Algorithm Design Manual” written by Steven S Skiena. The book teaches exactly the title of your class, and is presented in an excellent manner. Part one of the book reads left to right just like a normal textbook, with problems at the end of each chapter. The second part of the book is a massive algorithm/data structure reference with information and usage. In my opinion any teacher who uses this book really can’t go wrong. 143 Views · View Upvotes
