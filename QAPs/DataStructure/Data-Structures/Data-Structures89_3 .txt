I am a 16 year old self taught programmer. What are the best books to go all the way from data structures, algorithms to complex programming topics?I am planning to go through this list, step by step down the list: Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou. Introduction to algorithms by CLSR The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie. any other books to clear off my concepts on data structures? And if so, where should I put it in the list?First I would appreciate that you are a self taught programmer.I really support self study and my personal thinking is that it is the best form of study.Now coming to your question, I think that you should learn C first because it is basic and easy to learn language.I would recommend these books in order of their preference: Let Us C by Yashwant Kanetkar ( If you have not done programming before) Programming With C by Byron S. Gottfried ( Best book in my opinion) Data Structures Using C by Reema Thareja Introduction To Algorithms by CLRS I would strongly not recommend Kernighan and Ritchie because this book is not at all for beginners.Also, the concepts are not given in depth and the content is also not good.I hope that my suggestions will be helpful to you. Wish you luck for your programmer journey. 94 Views
