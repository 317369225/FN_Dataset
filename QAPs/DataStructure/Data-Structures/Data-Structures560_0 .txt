What is a DFS (Depth-First-Search) tree?There are lot of tutorials online which explains this concepts! Anyway long answer short, DFS and BFS are 2 main tree and graph traversal algorithms. As the name indicates depth first search, this algorithm starts from the root , traverses all the nodes let's stay in left sub tree until it reaches the leaf node before exploring the nodes in right sub tree! Which is take a sub tree first go as deep as you can until you hit the leaf node before taking the other paths! Preorder, in order and post order traversal are 3 main classifications of DFS and they have slight variations in which sub tree is explored first ! It is typically implemented using recursion or stacks! I would recommend looking at websites http://geeksforgeeks.com or others for implementation details! 225 Views
