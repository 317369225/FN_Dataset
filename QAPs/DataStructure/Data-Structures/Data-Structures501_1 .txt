What are some good use cases to implement customized data structures rather than using the ones in the library?The most common is speed… and not big-O running time but actually real world speed for your use case. Consider the C++ Standard Template Library for instance. The data structures provided therein are generics, and often pay a performance penalty for that generality. Engineers in performance-critical contexts who understand their data often write their own versions of those data structures, giving up reusability for the purpose of speed. 12 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
