What are some advanced algorithms Data Scientists use to clean up and make sense of data?Well this is the question everybody asked and why not this process (data cleaning) takes almost 80% of whole data science project. So now I will go through my experinces. There is no predefine algo for cleaning of data. Moslty it depends on your intuition and your experince with previous data. (For this I would suggest Doing one or two kaggle compitions). With some crude way one can easily clean data and fill missing values like if any of the two featurs in a data multiset are collinearly dependend then linear regression can be used to fill missing data (again here intuition will come into play means you need to check linear relationahip between features). Data cleaning some times also conaidered to be creating new features like out of date feature one can create weekdays, days , month, year and etc. (Intuition and exp here again) With current data size (here what I meant with size is columns/features in data multiset) secnario one needs to reduces the data size and find the inportant ones. Now for this one can use PCA or one can go with domain expert that which variable (feature) are important. Data cleaning also depenfs upon what type of problem you are solving like fraud detection problem where people will usually go with outlier detection techniques and then label those points with required label and the do the analysis. Well these things are more kind of hit and trial things you have to do one way then validate if not working then do it in other way then again validate and this goes on until you get a required result. Above points are some of the most used procedure to clean data. Some people call data cleaning as a dark magic of data science so if a data scientist master this dark magic then he/she can impress anyone with the results, but as said there is no shortcuts and not predefined algorithms for this, you have to prectice and practice and practice. 332 Views
