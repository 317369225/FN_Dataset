Which algorithms and data structures are encountered in most software jobs?The most common data structures I have encountered are arrays, Array Lists, Sets and Hash table/Hash maps. Some data structures are rarely used in production environment plus you don’t need to implement it yourself since the most common data structures are available as API in programming languages like C++ and Java that’s the reason why most programmers have a hard time reversing a Linked List. 138 Views
