How do I get the number represented as nodes of a LinkedList?Suppose My Linked list is of the form 7->4->3->5->1 Where 7 is the most significant digit and 1 is the least significant digit. I want to write a function which takes this linked list and returns 74351 as the result. Is it possible to implement the solution using LinkedList Thanksyes . int retrieve(struct node *p ) { int number=0; while (p) { int i =p->data; int number =number*10+i; p=p->next; } return number ; } //head has to be passed to p from main 20 Views
