Should I practice data structures and algorithms with Python or C++?It depends on why you are learning data structures and algorithms. For me I’m learning Python and data structures and then I will try to learn algorithms because I want to learn about data/business analysis. Hence if your goal is data science/analysis then python is the way you want to go. 273 Views · View Upvotes
