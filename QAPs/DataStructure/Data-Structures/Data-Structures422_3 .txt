Why do some programmers ignore algorithmic efficiency and rather focus on just making a program work?I am an Aerospace Engineer and I enjoy coding. To me, one of the most important part of an efficient program is an Algorithm but then I met developers who have no clue about time complexity or space complexity. I am just curious as to why algorithmic efficiency is ignored when itâ€™s so important?Different people have different styles of working, and also sometimes circumstances in which you are working dictate what approach you take to design. Some people believe in delivering a working feature as soon as possible and they think about optimizing only when a real performance issue is reported. This kind of approach will work if the data that is going to be used by the code is not big or there may not be too many people using the software concurrently. 34 Views  View Upvotes
