Though I'm good at 'Data structures and Algorithms' but I never participated in ACM ICPC and have a mere cgpa of 7.5. Will this harm me in placements?Not participating in ICPC is never going to harm you in any way. The only thing which will matter in interviews will be your sound knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals. And being good at DSA will give you an edge over the others as majority of the companies prefer to ask algorithmic questions in their interviews. Best of luck! 80 Views  View Upvotes
