What is data structures as a computer science course about? . And is it dependent on any language?Data structures classes are taught differently at every university I’ve seen, and most universities will make the class dependent on a particular programming language that the school chooses. The reason is because usually this class is taught shortly after a student has finished their intro programming classes, and so one of the purposes of the class is to give the student more practice with programming. The other purpose is to teach data structures. What are data structures? These are things like arrays, linked lists, trees, heaps, dictionaries, hash tables, etc. These are things that are often provided by modern programming languages in the form of library functions (and sometimes primitives), and are used by programmers all the time. Data structures are semantic representations of what you use to store, organize and manipulate the data that you store in a computer’s memory. In a data structures class, you will learn not only how to use different data structures, but how to implement them from scratch without using any libraries. You will also learn about the efficiency trade-offs between different types of data structures. 149 Views · Answer requested by Simdi Ejinkeonye
