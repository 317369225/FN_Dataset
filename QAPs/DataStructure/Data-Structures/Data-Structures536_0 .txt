Which data structure keeps the data sorted at runtime?All the data structures where the insert action follow comparison. e.g. BST, B-Tree, Red-Black Tree(obsolete now),B+Tree, AVL Tree, Hight Balance Tree, Heap ( priority queue). Most of the sorting algorithms are used with linear data structures. e.g. quick sort[sorting algo] is used when you have continuous incoming data getting stored in an array[DS]. In case of databases they use DS like B+,AVL etc so that data get stored in sorted fashion. 1.5k Views  View Upvotes
