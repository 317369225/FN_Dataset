If I read the entire CLRS Introduction to Algorithms book and implement all the exercises in it, how much better will I get at Computer programming?You can’t do that (and that’s a good thing). First of all, CLRS is not about computer programming as such. CLRS is about the design of efficient algorithms. This is a sub-topic: essential for some areas, almost unnecessary for others. A deep understanding of a large portion of CLRS will certainly give you a lot of knowledge needed for many, many interesting jobs. If you like algorithm design, this is certainly a good path to choose, and CLRS is a good book to use while following that path. Now let’s get back to the first sentence of my answer. As you do some work with the CLRS, you’ll (hopefully) quickly realize that its focus lies elsewhere. Implementation is secondary. The ideas behind the algorithms and data structures are what matters. And in fact, many exercises cannot even be implemented, they focus solely on the ideas. That’s why I’m saying your plan is already doomed to fail :) Of course, the implementation does also matter in practice. And certainly there are many who understand the ideas and still cannot produce a good implementation of an algorithm. CLRS will not help you with this aspect. In general, reading other materials is better than trying to come up with your own implementations of stuff that you don’t find straightforward. 1.5k Views · View Upvotes
