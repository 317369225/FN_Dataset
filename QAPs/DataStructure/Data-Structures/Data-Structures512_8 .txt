How much emphasis should I place on studying data structures and algorithms if my goal is a job in Data Science/Machine Learning?I’m interested in an expert’s opinion on how much focus should I give to getting a good understanding of the various algorithms that are usually tested at tech companies interview processes vs. getting hands-on experience through data science competitions, focusing on learning statistics, etc.I cannot emphasize more than Joel Young and Arjoonn Sharma had pointed out. You must take critical focus on data structures and algorithms to do most of the software development in efficient way. In fact I would steongly recommend for any CS focused students or newbie to software development. 421 Views  View Upvotes
