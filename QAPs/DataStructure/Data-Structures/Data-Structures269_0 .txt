What can you do with a solid knowledge of both programming (algorithms/data structures) and mathematics?I want to know specific areas and/or problems where this knowledge could be useful.I now do machine learning with my mathematics skills and my mediocre programming knowledge. It is fulfilling intellectually, has gotten me work, and has allowed me to work on problems I care about. Additionally, the field of Machine Learning is currently in a very exciting state where we have many beautiful tools that solve important problems, but no real unifying framework to understand them. To me, that indicates that there is important work to be done. 354 Views  View Upvotes
