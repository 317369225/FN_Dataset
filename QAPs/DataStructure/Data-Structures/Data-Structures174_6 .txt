When should I use a binary search tree over a hash map?They serve 2 very different purposes. A binary search tree is used to sort data into an easily traversable structure. In a BST, inserts and removes take the same amount of time and the tree always is sorted after the operation is completed. A hash map is an unsorted list keyed by the hash of some value. It provides quick access to arbitrary elements of the list referenced by their corresponding key. The major considerations of a hash map are the efficiency of the hashing function used and it's propensity for collisions. 87 Views  View Upvotes
