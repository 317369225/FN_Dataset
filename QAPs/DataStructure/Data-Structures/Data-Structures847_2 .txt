How can I learn algorithms and data structures?Hello, I know Java and Python but I’m really bad at solving problems. I know what Data Structures and Algorithms are but I’m not the best at them. How can I learn algorithms and data structures?All you need is a good book and willingness to spend 2–3 hours with it for the next one year or so. Knowing programming language alone will not help - it’s a good start that you have good understanding of a programming language. Now, that hard part is to learn how to implement hard problems with this language. Where to start: Introduction to Algorithms - CLRS (book) Introduction to Algorithms - MIT OCW videos. Mathematics for CS (MIT OCW videos) This is sufficient to start - you will find your ways afterwards once you master this content. 204 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Arihant Bansal
