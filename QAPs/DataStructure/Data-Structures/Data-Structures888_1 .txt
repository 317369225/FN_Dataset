I want to get good at data structures and algorithms for placement purposes. How should I proceed?Course in coding blocks is too expensive(17000 INR). I have enrolled on coursera courses. But what, according to you , should be my approach. Like, is it ok to be a self-learner ? Which book should i consider, websites to refer. Is it possible to get good at them, without joining any institute ?Dashboard - InterviewBit There are about 250 problems covering all basic Data structures and Algorithms,enough to crack any coding test. The proper tutorial is also provided for each problem. Take a leave of 2 months from everything , sit down in a room an enjoy coding all these problems. You will definitely see the Difference. 442 Views  View Upvotes
