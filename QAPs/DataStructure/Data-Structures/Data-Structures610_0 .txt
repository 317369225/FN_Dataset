When is it good to represent a binary tree as an array instead?In real life problem solving? Solving interview problems? Any particular use case? Please elaborate.The alternative of not implementing Binary trees as arrays is to use pointers which are not so easy to understand or debug in every programming language. Moreover, implementing Binary trees as an array also provides some benefits such as turning a Breadth first search into a simple iteration over the array, and O(1) access to any node in the tree instead of traversing from one pointer to another. Moreover arrays are supported by almost every programming language. I remember getting a Null Pointer exception in C++ a few hours before an assignment submission on Markov Decision Process to find optimal strategy in Blackjack. Instead of spending time debugging it (it would have taken a lot of time since it was my 2nd day working with C++), I reimplemented the tree as an array, fixed some bugs and submitted before the deadline. 205 Views  View Upvotes
