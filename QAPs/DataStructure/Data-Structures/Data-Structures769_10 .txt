I'm trying to be a self taught programmer. What should be the correct flow of online courses I should take or books I should read?Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen is a great book. Study it thoroughly. LeetCode Online Judge is a great platform for coding. Also, http://www.dreamincode.net/forum... has many nice ideas for projects. GeeksforGeeks | A computer science portal for geeks is also a great resource with lots of questions and solutions to them from basic to optimised approach. CS50 is a nice course for this too. Seeing the description to question, you seem to have it planned well already, but you should also start participating in coding contests. Hope these are enough to keep you interested. All the best! 369 Views  View Upvotes
