For a kernel level process, should the variables be stored in a stack or a heap?In the Linux kernel, each kernel space process will have it’s own stack. Even user space threads will have their own stacks within the kernel. So it will most likely be in the stack. Unless it has been specifically allocated using the slab allocator or slub allocator. These are the Kernel equivalents to malloc in the user space. malloc in the user space will allocate memory from the heap. In the kernel space, there are memory regions which you can use to get memory for your objects by using either the kmalloc or vmalloc. These allocate memory from the kernel’s own memory reserve. You can google to find more about each. 150 Views
