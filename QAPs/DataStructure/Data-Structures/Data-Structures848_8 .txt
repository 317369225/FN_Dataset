What is the difference between node* next & node *next?I am working on linked list and I got stuck with this ……If there is a difference between the two could someone just explain it to me.(if possible diagrammatically to understand in a better way.)Short answer. There is no real difference. Just some messed up books and some bad coding practices. You should always try to use this one. Node *next It has a clearer meaning, it says, next is a pointer which points to data of Node type, which is in fact very true. Whereas , Node* next This one says, next is a node pointer. This as well has the same meaning but the one above is a better practice to use. 100 Views  View Upvotes
