What is Amortized cost in data structure?Amortized Analysis gives the average cost of a single operation. The average cost means that even though a single operation may be expensive however when you do a sequence of such operations, the cost per operation (total cost / total no. of operations) becomes small. This average cost is known as amortised cost and this type of cost analysis is known as amortised analysis. Ex - Here is the very traditional example of Incrementing a Binary Counter. suppose we have a b bit binary number (0000 1111 i.e 15 in decimal) Now suppose we add 1 to the number (0001 0000 i.e 16 in decimal). Now considering the above single operation only, the cost of performing one such operation is O(b) where b is the number of bits in the number. Now coming to Amortized analysis - Suppose we have number 0000 0000 , and we perform a sequence of N increment operations. Number - 0000 0000 operation 1 - 0000 0001 operation 2 - 0000 0010 operation 3 - 0000 0011 operation 4 - 0000 0100 operation 5 - 0000 0101 operation 6 - 0000 0110 …… N times. Now observing closely, the leftmost bit (lsb) alternates for every increment operations, i.e half numbers are odd (lsb 1) and half are even(lsb 0). It is flipped every time a number is incremented. Similarly for 2nd bit, it is fipped every other time i.e (n/2 times) while incrementing n times. The similar pattern can be seen in other bits. Now for a number N , number of bits(b) = log(N). therefore calculating sum of flips for each bit , the total number of flips done are ∑ log(N) i=0 12 i    ∑i=0log(N)12i the Summation can be done by summing till ∞  ∞ , which come out to be 2*N, since the number of increment operations are N so after dividing by N, the average cost of a single operation comes out to be O(1). 159 Views · View Upvotes
