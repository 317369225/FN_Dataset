I would like to develop a new type of data structure, how should I go about this?Iâ€™d like for this data structure to have its own storage and search policy as well as operate as close to the memory as possible. (Alternatively, where could I find the documentation/code for existing data structures?) Thanks!In C you would use typedef struct { . . . } newDataStructure; You would usually pass a pointer to a variable of this type to any necessary function. 51 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
