How i can get mid of in order traversal of binary ?Note: we have to get the mid using single traversal of Binary TreeIf it’s a basic binary tree, with no ordering or branch balancing, then the you are going to have to go through the entire tree. According to the comment I read, we need something that works on any binary tree, this means that we can’t use any child to leaf placement rules to help us out. If the tree had been ordered with the child of lesser value to the left, then we would have been able to just use the an order transverse and stop it half way through. Since we don’t have the luxury of ordered child nodes, I think that fastest way may be to insert each node’s value into an array, sort the array, and pull the median value from the array. This is going to have a run time of O(n*log(n)) at best. 28 Views
