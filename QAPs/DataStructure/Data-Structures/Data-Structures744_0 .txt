Can a Electronics Engineer get a job as a Software Developer if he knows C/C++, Java, Algorithms and Data Structures?Oh, hell yes. If she (or he) knows them really well, I’ll even invite them in for an interview as soon as they express interest. Most of the best high performance C++ programmers are EE, Physics, or Math degrees who taught themselves C++, algorithms, data, ML, distribution, etc. I don’t see it to quite the same extreme outside of systems programming and other high performance computing areas, but in general, EE is considered a very good background (frequently better than CS) for a software engineer. 538 Views · View Upvotes
