How do I break down a problem and solve it with the use of Java programming?Simple Steps that I follow :- Limit the input first. Suppose you have to sort a million numbers from a list then first write a program which can sort a list of 5–10 numbers only. This saves time. Debugging is easier Understand the problem taking a real life scenario. Again, sorting a number. Visualize the problem in your mind. Think of million people in front of you and you have to sort them. Keep your input and output intact. Make sure you have the input data cleaned as you need in your program with the desired data type. Say use input “1 2 3″ a string type but you may need to have it like a list a = [1, 2, 3] for easier processing. Write the code as needed and see if it works. No problem if it doesn’t because mostly it doesn’t. Now, start tracing the program with the static input you gave. Take the first input and read each line of code’s input and respective output and so on for all the iterations. I know this might feel like a lazy task but believe me you will get better and better at debugging and finding the root cause of a problem. You will get to a situation when even just looking at someone else’s code you will be able to find the issue causing the problem. Hope this helps. 330 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Arihant Bansal
