How do you find the count of every element of a linear queue in C?How do you find the count of every element and if the element occurs more than once, then it should be printed only once?If your talking a fairly mundane situation where everything fits into memory (and assuming you have a queue that’s not implemented as an array). You load all the keys into an array and sort them (stdlib qsort). Then walk down the array and output each item when the array items change. It’s not the fastest way but unless sorting is very slow it will be good enough in most cases. The other choices are to find or implement a hash-set, mix in some C++ and use the STL for it’s maps, or do insertion sort with some deduplication. 182 Views · View Upvotes
