How do I understand the salary structure?I got an offer from top multinational company. This is what they sent in the mail about my salary details. I donâ€™t seem to understand how much in hand salary I would be taking home every month. What amount of salary is distributed as variables? someone please help me with this.After doing the math. Fixed Component: Monthly Fixed: 30709 Annual Fixed: 368508 Taxable income ( After deducting your PF contribution ): 351948 After tax deduction: 341753.2 Monthly (in hand without variable) = 28,479 Variable (after tax deduction): Monthly Performance Bonus (assuming 100%): 2880 Quaterly Performance Bonus (assuming 100%): 900 So, my estimate will be 30,000 - 31,500 (in hand) + extra quarterly bonus. (assumption, no 80C tax savings, no HRA declarations, food coupons are taken as cash). If you can invest 1 lakhs per annum (max limit is 1.5LPA) and declare that as 80C, then you can exempt yourself from complete tax payment. In that case you can get 833.33 extra per month. 78 Views  View Upvotes
