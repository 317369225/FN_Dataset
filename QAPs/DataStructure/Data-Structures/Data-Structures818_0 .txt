What thought process would lead us towards using a stack to solve the "Largest rectangle in a histogram"?I understood the solution using a Stack. But I am not sure if I have learned anything useful. What properties of this question will lead us towards this specific solution which uses a stack. Thanks in Advance!The stack based solution for Largest rectangle in a histogram problem came so that one can find an O(n) solution instead of the trivial O(n^2) solution. Since you already understand the algorithm, I wonâ€™t explain it. So, after starting with the simplest solution one notice that even thought it has O(n^2) time requirement, it does not have any additional space(memory ) requirements. Therefore, the next step it to use the fact that nothing comes for free, and try to use some sort of container( any container will do) to reduce the time complexity. To do that, one tries to notice the fact that there are some elements in the original array( histogram) that are needlessly visited many times. Then one can simply use an array to store the values, which will perfectly work. However, one will not that s/he is not using the random access property of an array, and will realize that the implemented data structure with an array is just a simulation for the stack. 122 Views
