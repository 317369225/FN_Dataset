Is coding not for me if I take long hours to learn to implement a basic Data Structures in C?Should I give up coding?NO. Never give up the coding. It really seems to be pretty uninteresting in the beginning. But once you get into it, you will just go on coding and coding new new codes. Just get your basics clear first. Have a healthy discussion with your teachers about it. Always rely on them till you are clearing your basics. Once you expertise the codes, you will start enjoying the coding. C and C++ seems boring but they are definitely not. Another thing to remember, sometimes the DOS Program on which you are running your code, may have faults, due to which, even though your coding is correct, but it may not give you the expected results. So also learn to figure out, which DOS Program is working correct and which one is not. I am sure, coding will be fun for you if you go on like this as suggested above. Because, I have followed the same way. ALL THE BEST!! 26 Views  View Upvotes
