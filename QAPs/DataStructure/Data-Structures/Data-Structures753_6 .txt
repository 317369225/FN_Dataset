Are there good and high paying programmers who never implemented data structures in C?I am finding reasons to make a living without learning C and that too in the long run I want to jump into product management. Does C become inevitable to progress through this track? I have to learn programming though. I am asking it in view of getting through the interview for the likes of Amazon.Depends on your definition of ‘programmer’. In today’s world, software engineer could be anything from programming PLCs to writing aerospace code. If you are writing application software using model based tools, you are pretty much staying away from doing DS in C. And these jobs pay pretty good (80–125K, depending on experience). However, I do not know of Amazon/Google as use cases. 127 Views · View Upvotes
