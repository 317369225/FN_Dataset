How can I make a polymorphic data structure in C++?Say I have a base class MultimediaFile and derived classes with different number of member fields (Audio = url, duration | Film = url, duration, genre, directorâ€¦) Now I want a Queue of MultimediaFiles. The push() function must push every MultimediaFile derived class, depending on which one is passedBy using the concept of function over loading. for those who dont know about function overloading In some programming languages, function overloading or method overloading is the ability to create multiple methods of the same name with different implementations. Calls to an overloaded function will run a specific implementation of that function appropriate to the context of the call, allowing one function call to perform different tasks depending on context. you can have a brief idea about it from the link given below http://www.studytonight.com/cpp/... 43 Views
