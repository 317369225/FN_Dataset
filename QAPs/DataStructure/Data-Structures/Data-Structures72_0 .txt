Why should I learn data structures and algorithms since there is a collection concept in Java?I recently was filtering elements form an array list based on certain criteria. The procedure was Iterate through the list till it’s not empty fetch an element If applyCriteria(fetchedElement) == true, remove else continue. that was my first approach and then it struck that after removing say 2nd element, all the elements from 3rd to last will have to be shifted one index up to fill the gap which was created after removing 2nd element. That means for each deletion there will be a huge overhead of shifting all the elements to fill the gap. what to do ? Java does gives collection but it doesn’t gives you or tells you which one to prefer over the other depending on scenario neither it tells how one remove operation in list is causing this much overhead. A better option was to use linkedList but that is altogether a different discussion. My point is you should know how a data structure which you are using works so that you can choose the best one and optimize it if the need be. 165 Views · View Upvotes
