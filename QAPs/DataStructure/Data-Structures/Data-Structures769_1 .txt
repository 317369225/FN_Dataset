I'm trying to be a self taught programmer. What should be the correct flow of online courses I should take or books I should read?It's very simple. If you're going to learn the programming for the first time in your life then, build solid knowledge of basics. For building solid understanding of the basics, you need to accumulate as much offline help as possible: Talk to a friend (who should be good at coding) to help you out, treat him as your mentor. Ask him/her about every confusion which pops up in your brain. I had the privilege of having two best friends, both helped me out countless times & also advised me about how to proceed further. Join a crash course, this will help you to get started in minimum time. Make sure to clear all your confusions. Grab a good reference book. No one in this world can teach you everything & that too in a limited time. Most of the minute details are left or forgotten by the instructors. However, a good book will contain very useful insight details & will help you to gain edge over others. Now why you shouldn't go for online courses right away: It's my personal experience that these online courses makes better sense when you already have some working background knowledge about the subject. Unless the courses are interactive, I'll not advise you to rely on them completely. You can use them as Primers after completing the basics. Following are some of the books that I have kept for reference purposes, they contain so much knowledge that neither have I used everything at least once nor any course out there offers this level of expertise: 2k Views  View Upvotes
