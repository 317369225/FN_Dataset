A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?I assume you're a student so if that's the case your professor is right. Learning a new programming language usually means starting to learn basic syntax for mundane tasks such as text output and data input. None of this is really going to help you make anything spectacular as you’ll just have the ability to make “Hello world” in many different languages. Now, if you focus on one language and use it to solve complex problems then you’ve gained more proficiency with that language and also gained much more knowledge and experience solving those problems. When you graduate school you can then focus on whatever language you want and you’lol have the knowledge to creat complex programs in any language you choose. 361 Views · View Upvotes
