What is a good book about java data structures?I have read usual books that are available and usually refer to tutorialpoint or oracle for DS in java. But what I am looking for is a book that explains and most importantly exemplifies concepts like HashMaps, Collections, Vectors, Dictionaries, Sets in java. Basically the util package.

When I was in second year university we used “Data Structures and Algorthms in Java” by Michael Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia. It covers all the important data structures without going into overly complex mathematical proofs. This is a good book to read before moving onto CLRS. The book my Weiss is very hard to follow and the code is much more complex than it really needs to be. 226 Views · View Upvotes
