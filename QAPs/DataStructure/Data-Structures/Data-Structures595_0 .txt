What are some of the data structures and algorithms I must know as beginner C# developer?Basically what I mean to say is that, what are some of the data structures and algorithms that will help me in my programming career.C# is an OO language (OK not pure), so everything is object biased. So you need to understand objects, simple inheritance (base classes etc), castING and (maybe later) boxing. This will help you understand how and why data structures are handled the way they are. It will also lead you to reference types and value types. As to data structures directly available in C#, look at: simple one dimensional arrays, array lists, lists, multidimensional arrays, jagged arrays, dictionaries, queues and stacks, collections, hashset, Ienumerable. As to algorithms, I cannot think of anything specifically C# related in this regard. General algorithms will suffice and thus any good algorithm book or MIT YouTube course will help. 166 Views  View Upvotes
