What are some beginner to intermediate project ideas that involve using (relatively) complex Data Structures and existing algorithms?I’d like ideas which would help me learn about something new, as well as something that demonstrates how the Data Structures and algorithms are used in real world software. Just as an example, I have worked on a text editor that uses a gap buffer. I’m comfortable with C++, Java, Python.You can directly implement the any algorithm. Take travelling sales person’s problem and give a solution to that. PS: It is not yet solved by anyone. 30 Views
