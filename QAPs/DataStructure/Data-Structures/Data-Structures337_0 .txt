How can I overcome my struggle while solving Leetcode or any data structures & algorithms problems?I am a SDE with 3 years of work ex. I find it v v difficult to solve DS & algorithms problems. I just feel like giving up but I aspire to become an efficient programmer with good problem solving skills. I took 6 hours to solve this problem at Leetcode. Can someone please help me. How can I improve?Some of the questions that are tagged “easy” could be tricky to solve. Try solving the list of questions in the Algorithms Basics course first. This should prepare you with the fundamentals to tackle harder problems. We also frequently add new articles to the course to help you prepare for the basics. 233 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
