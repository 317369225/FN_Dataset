What is a good book about java data structures?I have read usual books that are available and usually refer to tutorialpoint or oracle for DS in java. But what I am looking for is a book that explains and most importantly exemplifies concepts like HashMaps, Collections, Vectors, Dictionaries, Sets in java. Basically the util package. Cheers.Originally Answered: Which is the best book for data structures in java? Weiss is pretty standard. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java (3rd Edition): Mark A. Weiss: 9780132576277: Amazon.com: Books It covers algorithms and data structures at a much easier and more practical level than CLRS. It provides a good overview of all the common sorting algorithms, including rationale as to which algorithms are best in certain cases. One negative: some of the code is too tricky for its own good. Weiss loves a good prefix increment, and sometimes it you’ll find yourself lost in his bare-bones-for-bare-bones-sake style. 302 Views · View Upvotes
