I can understand some data structures and algorithms but I can’t memorize their implementation, what should I do to prepare for the interview?I try to learn and review the data structure and algorithm as I will have technical interview soon, but I can’t memorise their implementation, I have idea how they works but I can’t reimplement them in code, what should I do?Memorizing implementations is useless. If you just intend to write code from memory, you will not be able to fix any bugs you might make, and you will not be able to do any meaningful changes to the code if requested. If you really do understand how a data structure works, you should be able to implement it without any memorization. If you aren’t able to do that, you don’t really understand it. (Alternately, your general coding skills simply aren’t up to par. That’s also a possibility. If you have the pseudocode of an algorithm, do you still struggle while implementing it in an actual programming language?) In practice, the big picture is often enough: knowing what the data structure does without knowing how it does it. This is because the common data structures are usually available in the standard libraries, so you don’t need to implement them, you just need to know how to use them. However, if you expect being questioned about the implementation of classic data structures during your interview, you should learn more about the how. 779 Views · View Upvotes
