Should I learn DS and Algo in JavaScript itself instead of a compiled/VM language, as being a MEAN stack dev, I will be implementing them in JS only?I know JS fairly well, and am seeking a job as a MEAN stack developer. However, I am starting to seriously learn DS and Algorithms too. Since the most probable platform where I will be implementing them is JavaScript / Node, should I learn DS and algos in JS itself or go with Java?You can learn it in any language you want. But exposure to other languages makes you a better coder. For following reasons: As you get exposed to more language you also get exposed to their best practices. Which gives you better ways to think. As you are exposed to different language your ability to go through new code base and understand them increases drastically. So learning more language is good for you. Though you need to have a good command over your primary language as well. It is not necessary to use compiled language but it will be a good exposure. Try Using both while trying out problem. At the same time you will get better comparison of languages 157 Views
