I am good at data structures, algorithms and programming. If I could not get a job with a top notch company, should I join a mediocre startup?Joining huge company or mediocre will not matter after few years of professional experience What matters is job satisfaction. If at the end of the day you feel happy, content and evolving- you are at best place. I have seen my students working at best companies complaining about their frustration as they are given most of copy-paste work! Look for profile, Chances of evolving/learning and that select company! :) All the best 223 Views  View Upvotes
