Should I take data structures in C++ or Java? I am studying chemical engineering and often have to get outdated hardware to work with newer computers.Take data structures in whatever language you know. The concepts are the same , only the language syntax differs. A heap will always be a heap, a hash map will always be one so will arrays,binary trees etc. If you know java take it in java, if you c++ get started already. 91 Views
