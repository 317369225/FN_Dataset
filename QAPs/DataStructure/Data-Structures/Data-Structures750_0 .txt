Is it common for programmers who work on enterprise applications to never implement data structures?Sure. All the best data structures have been standardized into libraries. Many, such as hash tables and property lists, are built into programming languages like python. A prebuilt library is going to do a better job than you can at optimally trading off performance, space, and scale. Most enterprise applications focus on capturing workflow functionality. This is a mixture of so-called “business logic” and application logic (which controls the user’s experience in engaging with a work process). There is very little need for abstract data structures in this type of coding beyond the basics already available in libraries. Maybe you could call object-oriented class hierarchies “data structures”, but only in a limited sense unless you are inventing a specialized application framework. For advanced specialized technical work, data structures still play a large role. This is especially true in the “back-end” server software that powers scalable infrastructure. The implementation of virtual computing, cloud storage, and multi-datacenter data caching tiers push data structures into the state-of-the-art. But most software engineers will use services like these, not write them. 1k Views · View Upvotes
