Can I work as a data scientist with merely basic knowledge in data structures (mathematical programming, numerical analysis)?There's no simple answer to this, however I strongly believe that anything is possible as long as you work towards it. Fundamental understanding of data structures and algorithms are absolutely essential for anything non-trivial in Computer Science, having said that though, most of the data structures that you'd encounter starting up in data science have excellent Python implementations(which had pretty much become the de facto language for data scientists) and you can get away for a while without knowing their bare bones implementation. But eventually you’d need to know these stuff. Also data science uses a lot of advanced mathematical and statistical concept which most people learn as they grow through the process of learning data science. Long story short, be prepared to burn a lot of midnight oil and spend time on honing your skills up. 126 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
