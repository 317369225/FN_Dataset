Which is the best way to learn data structures & algorithms from beginner to advanced level?The best way to learn Data Structures and Algorithm is indeed what is taught in your class, follow your notes and teaching by Professors. Apart from this, if you want to prepare these topics on you own: At the beginners level, follow MOOCs provided by Coursera and NPTEL. These are also available on YouTube. NPTEL: Data Structures and Algorithm 2. Introduction to Algorithm by MIT 3. Data Structure and Algorithm by Stanford University From, this you will get to know only basic ideas of Data Structures and Algorithm. While learning this, follow pen and paper method. I feel that's the best for the beginners. Now, when you have completed those, next step is follow these books. For Data Structures: Buy Data Structures Using C and C++ Book Online at Low Prices in India For Algorithm: Buy Introduction to Algorithms Book Online at Low Prices in India People love to read novel. I love to read these books in similar way. Hope that helps. Also, follow this blog by Ashish Kedia: Life of a Debugger He is an Alumni of NIT Surathkal and a Web Solutions Engineer at Google, Hyderabad. All the info I am providing.
