What is the complexity of inserting a node at the beginning of doubly linked list?It depends on the definition of “beginning”. A few implementations use the same structure as any node. The only difference is that the “preceding” pointer is given the NULL value. In this case, there is no difference between inserting at the beginning or in the middle. In the case where the “beginning” is being pointed to by a single link, then the special case of no “preceeding” link has to be handled.
