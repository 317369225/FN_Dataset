Is it necessary to learn algorithm and datastructures when applying for a job as an application developer?The job I’m interested in require these knowledge: web technolgy (HTML, CSS, JS) Docker, AWS Java I want to take courses about Algo and DS on MIT OCW. Do I need knowledge about Algos and DS for the kind of job I’m interested in? Otherwise I could save myself time and learn more hands on skills.The truth is you dont need knowledge of algorithms and data structures to land such jobs. But your employers dont know that and will think less of you if you dont know those stuffs. Interviews are done so horribly that good amount of talent get left out. All you need is good problem solving skills for the particular domain you specialize in. Solving algorithms and data structure problems makes you acquainted to problem solving which will be helpful to you . A company asking algorithm and data structure related question during interview for HTML/CSS and JavaScript jobs is like Screening someone for a position as a cleaner in a hospital by asking the person to perform a brain surgery. Does performing a brain surgery makes you good cleaner : maybe Does failure to do so makes you a bad cleaner and not fit for the job?: Hell no! 124 Views  View Upvotes
