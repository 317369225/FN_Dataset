What is the difference between local spacetime structure and global spacetime structure?Can I say like for general relativity, it can describe curvature due to a mass/energy, which is local spacetime structure while for global spacetime structure, it will be like for the FRW metric?Yes in Einstein’s theory of General Relativity the local geometry encoded by the spacetime metric, being a local quantity, is dynamically determined by the local distribution of mass/energy upon this geometry. Of course, the global geometry arises as a culmination of this effect and includes properties such as topology, presence of boundaries, orientability etc. as Nirmalya suggests. Roughly speaking, local structure pertains to the geometry in a small open neighbourhood of some point, whereas global properties refer to the entire geometry itself. 195 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
