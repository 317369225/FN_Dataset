Is there any book or series of articles similar to "Purely Functional Data Structures" by Chris Okasaki but with code in Haskell?Purely Functional Data Structures itself has Haskell code in an appendix. Apart from that, I don't know of any other books on the same subject. If you want to learn about more functional data structures, you'll probably have to look through blog posts, papers and talks online. (What's new in purely functional data structures since Okasaki? is a great place to start.) 1k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Karpichev Roman
