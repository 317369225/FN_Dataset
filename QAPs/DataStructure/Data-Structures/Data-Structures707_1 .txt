I am good in competitive programming and data structures, what are the technologies or fields I should explore in which I will be able to use these?I do coding on Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) and have a world rank of under 100. Didn’t mean to brag but included the detail to help people answer more accurately.I would suggest Big Data analysis in Bioinformatics based (specifically genomics/NGS) companies. In India, where experimental infrastructure is relatively poor, but where there is a very large number of biotechnology and IT educated manpower this genre’ is bound to flourish. You may want to look at companies like Strand Life Sciences and IBAB, and just imagine how you can work with them. I am quite certain that this area will become very hot in India pretty soon. 107 Views · View Upvotes
