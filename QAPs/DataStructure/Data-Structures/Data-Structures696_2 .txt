What is a good book about java data structures?I have read usual books that are available and usually refer to tutorialpoint or oracle for DS in java. But what I am looking for is a book that explains and most importantly exemplifies concepts like HashMaps, Collections, Vectors, Dictionaries, Sets in java. Basically the util package. Cheers.Originally Answered: Which is the best book for data structures in java? Algorithms, by Robert Sedgewick Hands down, my favourite book for algorithms, when you want to refer code. It has both data structure and algos (like most books). Data structures and algo go hand in hand . You can also refer 1. CLRS 2.
