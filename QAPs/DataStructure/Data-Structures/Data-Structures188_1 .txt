What data structure does Spotify use for their "songs" list?Linked list for the deleting and inserting?I highly doubt that a platform as complex as Spotify uses just ONE data structure to organize their songs. For instance, when you right click and select “add to up next/play queue”, those songs are probably put into a queue that uses FIFO (first in, first out) organization. I’m sure they use a plethora of other data structures to manage a lot of other things too. 75 Views · View Upvotes
