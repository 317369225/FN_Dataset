Are there good and high paying programmers who never implemented data structures in C?I am finding reasons to make a living without learning C and that too in the long run I want to jump into product management. Does C become inevitable to progress through this track? I have to learn programming though. I am asking it in view of getting through the interview for the likes of Amazon.Haha, no. Not being able to implement (at least relatively simple) data structures in C shows a serious lack of understanding in how computers work - you can be an OK programmer, even a productive programmer, but I doubt you can be called a good programmer, for pretty much any definition of “good”. It’s not about C, and it’s not about data structures - it’s about knowing how the damn computer works. But, if you’re merely “passing through”, then I don’t understand why you care about being a good programmer. 976 Views · View Upvotes
