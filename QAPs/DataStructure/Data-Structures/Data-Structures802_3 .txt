Is Boolean logic based only on binary transistor circuits or can it be applied to more complex physical systems?Where can I read about this stuff in more detail? (but oriented towards beginners)boolean logic is just the idea to reason based on only true and false. It can apply to any system amenable to boolean logic, transistors or no transistors. For example, decision trees can evaluate arbitrary hierarchies of boolean conditions to diagnose an illness in a person. 145 Views  View Upvotes
