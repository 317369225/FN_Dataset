What is the best book for Algorithms and Data structures (separately)? Is there any for implementation on C++?I am having a keen interest in coding and data science although itâ€™s not of my branch in engineering. But I like solving puzzles and do competitive coding. I think i should develop it more than just my hobby.The two of the best books containing Data Structures and implementation in C++ are: Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ by Adam Drozdek Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis in C++ by Mark. A. Weiss Most of the algorithms books that contains purely algorithms have pseudo code. But if you are looking for the implementation in C++ then the books are: Algorithms in C++ by Robert Sedgewick The Algorithm Design Manual by Skiena (Implementations are in C) 301 Views  View Upvotes
