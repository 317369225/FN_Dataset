What should one prepare if data structure is my area of interest in an interview?Remember one thing, all questions asked in interview are linked to one another. Most of the questions are derived from the answers of previous ones. So all you need to do is answer in such a manner that he is forced to ask the next question from your area of interest. When I was preparing form my interview, I studied thoroughly about my project (as it was a new domain unknown to many), so I would answer in such a way that the flow of question would turn towards my project domain and then obviously I would consume most of their time explaining the project in detail.
