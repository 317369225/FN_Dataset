What coding exercises and language build strong programming skills, adaptability and increased mental acuity?Just like learning scales and tablature on a piano develops strong musical skill and leads to highly transferable skill what is the best excercises and language for programmers.I don’t honestly think that there is one stand out language that it a better choice than all the rest for something like this. I would suggest that to improve adaptability and acuity, solving algorithmic challenges from site such as ‘The python challenges” or “hacker rank” - as far as I know they exist for a wide variety of languages. In terms of programming skills to do something useful, I would try to develop a project - something that you are interested in, again you will turn up many sites which have suggestions for possible projects in programming. 168 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Sayth Renshaw
