What skills in terms of programming, data structures and algorithms should you have before you can hope to solve coding interview questions?I’m having difficulties solving coding interview questions, problems on topcoder and problems classified as “easy” on codechef. What am I missing? What books should I study and can I hope to land a job in a good tech company in the next 3 years (I am a cs graduate)?So you go to Topcoder or Codechef and you find these easy questions to get your hands dirty. You try to solve them, and then after a few failed attempts, you give up. Don't worry, you're not alone. A lot of people face the exact scenario. A lot of them question their abilities and their skills. A lot of them give up. But you don't have to! See, this is the 'skill' that you need. The will to not give up and to work slowly towards finding the solution to that question. A lot of the questions can be solved, if you approach them correctly. So, go through the data structures you have studied. Understand when a particular data structure should be used and when it should be avoided. Understand how one algorithm may perform better in one scenario, but may fail at the other. And once you're confident with this, start solving those questions. Try your best to solve it. If you still face some problem, Google is your friend. Practice all that you can, learn as much as you can. And remember, what is easy for you, may not be so easy for me and vice versa. I hope this helps. Now go to work! :) 248 Views  View Upvotes
