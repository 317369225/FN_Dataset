Does it matter which programming language a data structures class is in?I am currently learning C, C# and Java. I really want to learn more about data structures and algorithms. It looks like the Data Structures class through IIT Bombay covers it in C++. If I learn this with the class in C++, Iâ€™ll be able to implement this knowledge to any language I learn, correct?Just want to say that you dont learn data structures through a language. The concepts must be understood as they are through pseudo code. Then implenting an algorithm in any language is just a matter of knowing the syntax. I do however understand why c++ is used. Its easier to explain the concept of say linked list in c or c++ where you have pointers rather than in Java for instance. Delink the programming language - its just a means to an end. 81 Views
