Is using 2-d arrays for problems that could be solved by Linked Lists or Hash Maps frowned upon in interviews? Does using 2-d arrays have cons?I use C, since Python’s not allowed in this target company’s interviews. I could solve 60% of the questions this company asked with 2-d arrays. (I saw previously asked questions by this company) These are the set of questions I solved with 2-d arrays : q5yws - Ghostbin.What exactly do you want to achieve with a 2d array? Many of those questions are exactly intended to show how you choose different data structures. If you only have the one single ds you know of, my guess would be they’d not hire you. E.g. that second question about find the number of grand children. While for the 4x2 array in the given example a normal linear search should be ample. If anything larger you may want to start rearranging the input into a tree structure and/or a hash table. Would make searches orders of magnitude faster - would be the difference between a program taking hours or milliseconds. So yes, using 2d arrays everywhere IS a problem. Using them where they make actual sense (and using something else where it doesn't) is exactly what the questioner wants. 55 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
