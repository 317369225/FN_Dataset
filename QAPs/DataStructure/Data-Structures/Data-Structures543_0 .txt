What are the preconditions of binary search and what role do they carry out?The preconditions are: There must be a way to compare any two elements of the array and get that either first is smaller, second is smaller or they are equal. This result must be deterministic, in the sense that if you compare them once again the results must be the same. The array must be ordered either in increasing or in decreasing order according to the comparison operator above. Let’s assume the array is ordered in increasing order. The role of these preconditions is in the corollary from them that if you compare an element of the array to the value you are searching for, if the element is less than the value, than the element you are searching for can be only to the right from this element, otherwise it can only be to the left. This in turn allows you to cut in half the number of elements to look through after each comparison you make. For the details, watch this. 211 Views · View Upvotes
