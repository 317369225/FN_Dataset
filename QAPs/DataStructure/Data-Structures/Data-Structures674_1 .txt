I want to learn algorithms and data structures from scratch. Can I do it all with a book, pencil and a paper?Provided you are experienced enough to implement them in a single go, yes you don't need a computer to learn Algorithms and Data-Structures. However inexperienced programmers need a stand-by implementation to verify their code. But mind you , they look so intellectually cool in pen and paper you end up procrastinating. 347 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
