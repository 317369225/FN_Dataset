How can one be well prepared to answer data structure/algorithm questions in interviews?Originally Answered: What is the best strategy to adopt in learning algorithms and data structures for cracking interviews?A2A. 1) Cracking the coding interview. 2) http://geeksforgeeks.org 3) careercup These three would be your best resources. Now coming to the practising part, DO NOT PRACTISE IN YOUR COMPUTER. Write your code down in paper or on a board. Once you finish writing a code snippet, compare it with the solution found in your book/internet and see what all cases you missed and how your algorithm differs from theirs. Do not attempt to see the answer for a question as soon as you think you don't know the answer. Try. Write something. See how far your imagination takes you. Finally, once you think you've attained a saturation level, see the answer and get amazed. Prepare the topics one by one. Take notes, make notes. Many of my friends did this mistake : By preparing questions company-wise and not topic wise. This technique MIGHT help you only when you have that particular company's interview tomorrow and you're clueless as to what to prepare today. In all other cases, its a strict no-no. Finally, you might want to do a revision of what all you prepared a couple of days before the placements to bring the concepts back your cache. Well, that's about it. Good luck. P.S : I guess Quora is flooded with these questions "How should I prepare for placements/ what should I prepare for the interviews" etc. Looks like Quora needs a mod like SO to avoid repetition of same questions. 11.8k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
