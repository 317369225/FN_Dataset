I started working in a startup, but I don't like that job as they are expecting me to deliver fast result. Should I leave that job and look for other?I’m a college pass out student. My company is expecting me to deliver fast result which I’m unable to do so, as I just know basics of coding.I’m feeling depressed and dissatisfied. I’m thinking to leave this job and take break, practice coding and then try for some other job. What should I do now?Here is my view I started my career at a start up, moved to a mid sized organization and now in a MNC. My experience in each has had a unique effect on my career growth. In my initial years in the start up , the pressure helped me develop at a faster pace. This would happen if you could channelize the pressure to Motivate you to do better. It did for me. It also depends on individuals. You could do better maybe under a different scenario, maybe at a MNC, where it's settled and process oriented. See what suits you the best ! Don't give up and do well ! 279 Views  View Upvotes
