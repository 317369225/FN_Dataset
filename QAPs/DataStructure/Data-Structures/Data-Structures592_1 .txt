What is the role of heap memory?I want to mess around with my PC by writing infinite looping “for” on my code, said that it will run forever until it runs out of heap, I don’t understand how it works. all I know that it display message like exception handling (out of bound, mismatch etc)In Java, the JVM will have a certain amount of computer memory set aside to run its program, this is the heap in its simplest form. Simply the area where Java programs run. The Heap may grow in size but if it becomes full garbage collection starts and tries to remove unused objects. If you happen to fill the Heap up beyond its current size that’s when you get exceptions. 166 Views · View Upvotes
