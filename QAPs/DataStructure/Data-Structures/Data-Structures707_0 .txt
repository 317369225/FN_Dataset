I am good in competitive programming and data structures, what are the technologies or fields I should explore in which I will be able to use these?I do coding on Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) and have a world rank of under 100. Didn’t mean to brag but included the detail to help people answer more accurately.Well, according to the details you provided about yourself I am assuming that your are exceptionally good and data structures and algorithms. You see computer science is everywhere around you if you can’t figure out what to do next just look around yourself and try to solve a primitive with computer science and things will be so much fun. There are a lot of sub domain in the field of computer science which require advanced data structures. You can try picking up some project ideas and work on them. Learn Mobile App Development. Deep Learning :: Also known as deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with multiple processing layers, composed of multiple linear and non-linear transformation. Directed Hyper Graphs:: Used to model chemical networks.
