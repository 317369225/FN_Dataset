Is it worth paying $3,000 more just to take a Data Structures and Algorithms course?I’m going to play devil’s advocate, adopt a controversial point of view, and say probably yes. As all responders pointed out, there is no material in the traditional classroom-based course that is not also available for free and that you can not study by yourself, or through an inexpensive MOOC. But material availability is not everything. In a traditional classroom-based course you have an instructor that you can answer questions to, a structured testing schedule that forces you to plan your study time seriously and provides crucial motivation, and a social setting that provides opportunities for competition and mutual support. In between all of that, self-guided study is still a core component of your learning. Alternatives typically offer none or very little of the above except for material and self-study. You can easily misunderstand a basic concept and carry that mistake with you all the way to the finals, or even through the finals if testing is inadequate. In a traditional course with an experienced instructor and peer interaction, that’s a lot less likely. If you are very self-disciplined and have great attention to detail, you definitely can teach yourself all the course material with equivalent or better results than a classroom-based course, but that’s not representative of the typical case. Most students perform better in a more structured environment. 179 Views · View Upvotes
