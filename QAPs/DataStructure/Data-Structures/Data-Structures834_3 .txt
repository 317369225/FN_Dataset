What is linked list in data structure?First we use array but in case of array we have to define size at the time of declaration or we can tou dynamic array but then link list is there in this we make a node then to attach another one we gave the address of previous node to this node using this pointor we can access all the nodes of a linked list. In this we only need address of one node if it's single linked list then we want first node if doubly we can access both prev and next. In linked list we won't run out of space as if whenever we want to add we create a node and attach to linked list that is main powerful feature of a linked list. Hope you understand it well. Let me know if you're having any other doubt regarding linked list. 128 Views
