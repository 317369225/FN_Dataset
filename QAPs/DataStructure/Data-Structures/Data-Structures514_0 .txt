What are the 5 best built mega-structures?Something like the Panama CanalI would say: Three Gorges Dam (beast of a dam) Burj Khalifa (Tallest building in the world, for now) Capital Gate (the engineering in this one is breathtaking) Gigafactory (single factory that doubles the worldwide production of batteries and is green) Great Wall of China (considering when it was build, it is a feat of unparalleled determination) 160 Views  View Upvotes
