How do I solve dynamic connectivity graph problems?There is an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. There have been three types of requests: to add an edge (X_i, y_i), remove the edge (X_i, y_i), and check whether or not vertices x_i and y_i connected.Link-Cut Trees works only when given graph is a tree. For any graph we have to solve dynamic connectivity problem. Here more info about dynamic connectivity problem. Thanks. 76 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Shweta Singh
