Is coding not for me if I take long hours to learn to implement a basic Data Structures in C?Should I give up coding?Coding doesn’t have only DS. Coding could be anything that you code. :D It could be to print hello world too! C is pretty old language and not (easily) human-readable. Probably this could be one of the reason. It’s syntax, and libraries. Also depends on the IDE. These days, new IDEs have intellisense. Data Structures involves Math and computer science. You must be lagging in any of these, but it does not mean you are bad in coding. It takes time, silly mistakes, and misconceptions but that shouldn’t stop you learning. Happy coding :) 53 Views · View Upvotes
