If you have a pretty intense day job, how do you find time to improve the data structure and algorithms skill?I’m fortunate in that I am in R&D so I have to stay abreast of the latest technologies. I read articles and blogs on my own time so that i get exposure to new things, but I get to use work time to learn about new things and try out new software tools and systems, configure them, and exercise them. Often I end up making use of these in my projects and I learn a lot about data structures and algorithms when reading the docs and writing code that uses these systems. My work is fairly broad, encompassing analytics, machine learning, big data systems, app dev, some IoT, and a bit of web dev. Of course it also is limited to the fields that apply to my job, so I no longer get much practice in device drivers, networking, embedded systems, and so forth. So how do I find the time to my data structure and algorithm skills? I use a lot of data structures and algorithms in my daily work, and as I tackle new projects, I often have to do research that improves my knowledge of these and other things.
