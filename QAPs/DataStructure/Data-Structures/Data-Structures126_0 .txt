If you have a pretty intense day job, how do you find time to improve the data structure and algorithms skill?You coud ask this about anything else. If you don't have a lot of time, how do you find the time for a girlfriend? It all depends on whether it's a high enough priority for you. If it matters to you, you find the time. You set aside a little bit of time here and there. One thing I will say is that practicing a little bit daily should give you better results than practicing rarely for long periods of time. It keeps your mind in that algorithmic mindset. Try setting aside 30–60 mins a day for problem solving practice. 406 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Mohamed Fadlalla
