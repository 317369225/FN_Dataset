What are digitized microfiche?Before we had computers that were capable of storing large amounts of image data, the archive process for newspapers and magazines was to make film-based photographic reproductions, reduced considerably from the size of the original. There were two types of this; one was called ‘microfilm,’ which came on a spool of 16mm or 35mm film, and another called ‘microfiche,’ which was a small sheet of film around 100mm × 150mm, or 3 inches by 5 inches. Digitized microfiche are, then, just that—microfiche film sheets that have been digitized, meaning ‘scanned,’ into digital form for storage on a computer. 214 Views
