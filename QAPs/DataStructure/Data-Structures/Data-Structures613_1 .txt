Given a string, search it in a set of strings (say among 1000).What data structure would you use to store those 1000 strings and get the results faster?Use the Binary Tree for this , that will perform the average searching time in O(log(N)) time. you can also use hashing O(1) but in that way you have to select a good hash function to minimize the number of search operation ..!! 42 Views
