Why do we need to learn data structures before learning algorithms?Most of the time the algorithms depend on organizing the input data in such a way that will help the algorithm arrive at the desired results in optimum time and use optimum space for it, for eg. Heap Sort which depends on data organized in the form of a priority queue / heap. And also, a lot of time these Algorithms directly work on a certain Data Structure to do operations like traversing, insertion, search, etc on it. Algorithms like BFS, DFS, that work on data in the form of a Graph Structure for traversing / searching for data inside the Graph. 247 Views
