Why do some programmers ignore algorithmic efficiency and rather focus on just making a program work?I am an Aerospace Engineer and I enjoy coding. To me, one of the most important part of an efficient program is an Algorithm but then I met developers who have no clue about time complexity or space complexity. I am just curious as to why algorithmic efficiency is ignored when it’s so important?Most usually because your manager, who doesn’t really know how difficult is your task, had planned not enough hours to program an efficient solution but the quickest one to code that gets the job done. If programmers had the time to refine their algorithms, software would be more efficient. Also: bear in mind that in certain offices, experienced programmers move up the corporate ladder into management and not always the most expert programmers are at the front line. So it’s both a lack of experienced workforce, a lot of pressure with usually not enough allocated hours of work and a simple general sense of “get the sh*t done and get over with it”. 63 Views · View Upvotes
