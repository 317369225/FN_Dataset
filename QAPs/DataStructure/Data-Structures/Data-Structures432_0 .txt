What is a good book about data-structures and algorithms in javascript?I would say that the Coursera Algorithms Course by Robert Sedgwick is very good. It helped me get a good hold of things like Big-O analysis, Algorithms and Data Structures. You can then go back and read books like : The Algorithm Design Manual - Steven Skenna (Very good introductory algorithms book, which has good examples) Introduction to Algorithms - Cormen (Standard reference, more in depth then the above book) Also, besides reading and watching videos, you should also try to get hands on with the concepts by solving programming problems on sites like TopCoder, HackerRank, CodeChef. Only when you use these data structures and algorithms yourself when you code, rather than just reading about them, will you start really appreciating the difference that they make. 173 Views
