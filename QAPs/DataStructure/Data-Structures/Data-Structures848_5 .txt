What is the difference between node* next & node *next?I am working on linked list and I got stuck with this ……If there is a difference between the two could someone just explain it to me.(if possible diagrammatically to understand in a better way.)node* next Simply declaring it as Node* does not make it point anywhere, it just tells the compiler that it's a pointer to some Node (or no Node at all). There has to be actual code which sets the next pointer to point to the next Node. node *next node *next ensures that you've a variable next which is a pointer to the node. Thanks for A2A! Edit As stated below, it’s just a style to write the code. There is not much difference in both of these syntax! But, please provide me the reason behind if possible:) I am looking forward for the response as I don’t know about. Thanks! And, one more thing the answer provided here by me does not seems to be cent percent correct! So, it’s not required to get it upvoted. I’ll be much obliged then:) 405 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
