Is it necessary to learn algorithm and datastructures when applying for a job as an application developer?The job I’m interested in require these knowledge: web technolgy (HTML, CSS, JS) Docker, AWS Java I want to take courses about Algo and DS on MIT OCW. Do I need knowledge about Algos and DS for the kind of job I’m interested in? Otherwise I could save myself time and learn more hands on skills.HTML: No, absolutely not CSS: No JS: No, but it would be helpful DOCKER, AWS: No, but it would be quite helpful JAVA: Absolutely necessary It can't help to learn more, but if the job/your interests more heavily lean towards front-end web development, very little uses algorithms and data structures. 284 Views  View Upvotes
