Are there good and high paying programmers who never implemented data structures in C?I am finding reasons to make a living without learning C and that too in the long run I want to jump into product management. Does C become inevitable to progress through this track? I have to learn programming though. I am asking it in view of getting through the interview for the likes of Amazon.Maybe not C, but definitely something comparable. I'm sure I've implemented all of the major data structures and algorithms at some point. Most of them probably from memory. I'm not a big proponent of algorithm problems (unless you're doing it for fun), but there's a palpable difference between people who know the fundamentals and those who do not. 1.7k Views  View Upvotes
