Which algorithms and data structures are encountered in most software jobs?I have been working as a software developer for 11 months and have only come across arrays, sets, dictionaries, queues and an occasional tree or graph. As for algorithms, besides the basic sorting, duplicate removal, I have dabbled a little in Machine Learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Hidden Markov Models. Once I applied the Depth First Search algorithm with some heuristics for Optical Character Recognition. Primarily working in web development, I have rarely implemented any advanced data structure from scratch and there are several tools and libraries to help you with common algorithms and data structures, such as Redis for queues and dictionaries. I doubt anybody implements Red-Black Trees or Tries from scratch. That being said, it is critical to be familiar with as many data structures and algorithms as you can never tell which you'll be needing and where. 1.6k Views  View Upvotes
