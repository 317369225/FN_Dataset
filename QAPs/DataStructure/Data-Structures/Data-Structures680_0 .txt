How do I delete any node from a SplMinHeap in PHP?For reference, here is the reference to SplMinHeap - Manual. I guess I need to write the logic to replace the node to be deleted, with the last node of the heap and then put the newly inserted node at proper place by comparisons. But how do I get the last node? Also, how to get the value at any node?A min-heap only supports a delete operation on min element, not an arbitrary delete(x) operation. A min heap is a binary tree in which smallest element holds the root position . Whenever you delete an element, again heap has to be arranged so that smallest element goes to the top most position . Are you looking for linked list instead ? This below code add data to heap and prints back <?php $h = new SplMinHeap(); for ($i = 0; $i<6; $i++) { echo $d = mt_rand(1,500); echo ","; $h->insert($d); } echo 'min heap elepements are'; while ($h->valid()) { echo $h->extract().','; } o/p adding elements to heap 773,512,782,336,113,854 min heap elepements are 113,336,512,773,782,854 42 Views
