I want to get good at data structures and algorithms for placement purposes. How should I proceed?Course in coding blocks is too expensive(17000 INR). I have enrolled on coursera courses. But what, according to you , should be my approach. Like, is it ok to be a self-learner ? Which book should i consider, websites to refer. Is it possible to get good at them, without joining any institute ?One can definitely learn Data structures and algorithms by himself/herself. You just need to follow a step by step procedure. First start with basic data structures like arrays,linked lists,stack,queue,trees and graphs. Never be in a rush to complete them.Implement them along side,after learning about a particular Data Structure visit sites like Hacker-earth and Hacker-Rank and try some problems. Alongside this learn basic sorting techniques like bubble sort,quick sort etc. If you find any difficulties or have any doubts you can surely refer to stackoverflow.com (Best thing I have ever found :) ). Some of the Books I have found that are brilliant: 1. Data Structures through C in Depth by Srivastava and Srivastava - for learning basics of data structures (It's an amazing book). 2. CLRS for advanced data structures such as Red-Black trees and algorithms. 3. Cracking the coding interview by McDowell for interviews. Some of the Online courses : 1.Data Structures by The New Boston (These tutorials are freaking ausumn for beginners) 2.Introduction to Algorithms by Princeton university on coursera.
