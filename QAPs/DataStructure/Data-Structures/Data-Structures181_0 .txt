What does a top node identify in semantics?The “top node” is a concept in a formal semantics method. The idea of compositional semantics is that a meaning can be assigned to language elements such as words and phrases, that these can be combined into larger units (usually sentences), and that the “meaning” of the larger structure is a combination of the meanings of the parts. This is a bottom-up way of analyzing meaning by parsing the larger unit (such as a sentence) into a structure of smaller units (phrases, words) and then assigning meaning from the bottom up, composing larger meanings. A parse structure is a tree diagram with one “root” or “top node” (depending on whether the tree is drawn with the branches pointing up or down. The “top node” is simply where the process stops (typically, a sentence). 89 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Gabriele Giordano
