Why does the following simple C code crash?13. new_node = malloc(sizeof(Node)); 14. current_node = malloc(sizeof(Node)); After both the nodes are allocated memory, next of each node points to NULL i.e, current_node->next equals NULL and new_node->next equals NULL 16. new_node = current_node->next; Due to this statement, new_node is assigned NULL. But current_node->next is still NULL. Thus, when you try to pass current_node->next->age in print function call, you will encounter a segmentation fault. 30 Views
