Where can I find a good tutorial on Data structures and Algorithms in C#?One advice I think i can give here is - try to find a good sources which which give you a good understanding of the data structures and algorithms rather than code for those data structures and algorithms. Try to understand the inner details of the algos, try to understand how they work, how the different operations are carried out on different data structures and try to code them yourself later in any programming language you are comfortable with. Try to find a sources which will give you good use cases for these data structures and algos, things like when you should which data structure / algorithm and when you should not use them. By experience, i can tell you that generally sources that give you running code in X programming language are not good for understanding that complete details, which i think is more important, if you are trying to master data structures and algorithms. 176 Views
