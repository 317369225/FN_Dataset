What is the relationship between "thread_info" and "task_struct" structure?A reasonable start point is here Need for thread_info structure in Linux 2.6 Kernel? it is essentially a procedure to allow better scaling for the kernel. The task_struct structure is a very large beast to have on the kernel stack. A thread_info structure is much smaller, as a result somewhere in the series 2 kernels (2.4 ~ 2.6) the task_struct was removed from the kernel stack and replaced by thread_info structures that point to the task_struct. The relationship can be summed as a thread_info structure describes a child of a task that is defined by the task_struct structure. 174 Views  View Upvotes
