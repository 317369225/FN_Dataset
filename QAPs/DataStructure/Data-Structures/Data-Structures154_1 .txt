Which data type should I use for storing n=10^14 in C?I always store those Million & Billion range numbers in a arrays. Looks weird but here are benefits. You can do manipulation with it by your wish very easily. Because you have separate integers of that big number. So, we can use them easily. Second benefit is, we can do insertion too. Just insert one more number in that array at last. And you will get 10 times larger valued number in your array. So, this is also easy. Third benefit is we can convert that whole number into integer too. Of course by dividing that whole number in to sum of two or three numbers (just because we have to change it in Integer data type range. All that two or three child numbers are in Integer range.) So that Addition, Subtraction, Multiply, Division can be done easily. Other alternative is, we can use some adder circuits too. We can give input in the form of one array element (one Digit of that while number.). We can make one array for Carry too. Because we can't ignore carries while performing addition. We can use Linked list to store that too. But for that addition and all that kind of calculation(addition, Subtraction…) are difficult as compared to array. So, as per my point of view. Array is better than all other data types to store Millions and Billions or 10^14 ranges numbers. 163 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Prerana Babbar
