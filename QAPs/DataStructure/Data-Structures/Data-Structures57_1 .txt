How do HashMaps work?HashMaps are an implementation of the Hashtable data structure, in most of the programming languages, i think. So, a hashmap works in a way where it actually store values in a storage efficient data structure like array, and it figures out the array index at which to store the value at, by means of a hash code calculation function, which returns a hash code calculated based on the value that we want to store in the hashtable. The hashMap, i think takes a separate key and value, and calculated the hash value based on the key, and stores the value at the array index that we get based on the key hash value. 161 Views
