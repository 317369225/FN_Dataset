Does software engineering require the usage of dynamic data structures and pointers?Is dynamic data structures (e.g linked lists, binary trees) commonly used in software engineering? Also are pointer variables (like in C) used in software engineering as well?Yes, especially if you want to work on the complex areas of a program. Many programs do not use these but the key parts of an application usually use all you listed and more. As a side note, the ones who work on the complex areas usually earn more money and are less likely to be laid off. Of course, many programmers with this level of skills are contractors. 68 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Durga Devi
