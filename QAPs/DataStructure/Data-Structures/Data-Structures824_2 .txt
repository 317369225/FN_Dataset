Where can I find someone willing to teach me data structure and algorithms for free or in very cheap cost?I always want to become a software developer but the only barriers for me is the technical interview, I can’t pass it, I want to find someone to teach me the data structure and algorithms.Your first step is to stop thinking in terms of whatever language and libraries you’re used to and start thinking in slightly more abstract terms. That is, for each problem, ask “what does this need to do?”, then search for a suitable data structure or algorithm (the two often go hand in hand). You need to start with the basics: arrays, simple linked lists, stacks, queues, (very simple) hash tables. Next up you get to sorting and searching, (binary) trees, balanced trees, graphs (including basic path finding), priority queues, sets, state machines, and so forth. I recommend against trying to learn these in isolation; it is better to start with problems that interest you and try to find elegant solutions: this is a good way to pick up a feel for new data structures and algorithms in context. You can get plenty of answers and feedback from StackOverflow and CodeReview; there’s no need for a personal mentor. Oh, read Jon Bentley’s “Programming Pearls” — it’s a lot of fun and will teach you a great deal about how to tackle programming problems. 239 Views
