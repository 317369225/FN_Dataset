Are structures in C-language similar to objects in Java?No. Thinking that way misses the point of OOP. C structures collect related data items together. The private fields of Java objects also collect related data items together. But here's the difference. The defining part of an object is its public "tell don't ask " methods. An email object will have a method: email.sendTo(postbox); Where postbox is another object. Did you see how none of the private data appeared in that method? Things like ‘recipient’, ‘subject’, ‘messageBody’? The advantage of this is you are free to change how it works - what data it needs - without changing the calling code at all. With a C structure, every time the data changes, all the calling code changes. You can't change how the internal object behaviour works, because a C structure does not have that concept. This idea of encapsulation is foundational to OOP. It is all about what behaviour an object has, not the data it hides. 1.2k Views · View Upvotes
