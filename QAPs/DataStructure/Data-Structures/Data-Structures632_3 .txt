What are some hidden secrets of C language?I dono if this is a secret for you. But when i got to know this, i felt like i know a secret :D Here it is The return values of scanf() and printf() Scanf returns number of items successfully read and it can also return the EOF Printf returns number of characters successfully written. You can verify the above by this printf("the return value of scanf: %d\n",scanf("%d",&num)); And notice this is a kind of recursion and there is no ; for scanf.. its rare to see scanf in such a fashion. 1.8k Views  View Upvotes
