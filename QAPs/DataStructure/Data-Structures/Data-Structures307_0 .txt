What kind of programming questions are asked while interviewing a candidate in C?In C it is hard to solve the problems related to graph, tree etc as they take up a lot of time needs several other data structures to be implemented from scratch so what kind of question should I prepare for?If you’re being interviewed for a programming job in a particular language, the interviewer should be checking a couple things (in terms of that language). That you know the language well. I would probably ask questions to ensure you understand how struct data is packed, how function pointers and varargs work, how to typedef and to create struct’s. And of course typecasting, double pointers, that sort of thing. That you can solve problems in the language. I’d ask the same questions I ask in most any language to see if you can figure out what to do. If a particular thing is too much code for an interview, I’d expect the question ‘can I assume I have a library / access to BLAH?’ That you can be productive in the language. This means understanding how to make trees, linked lists, how to sort, and the relationship between arrays and complex data structure, memory incrementing for different pointer types, and so on. Good luck. 966 Views · View Upvotes
