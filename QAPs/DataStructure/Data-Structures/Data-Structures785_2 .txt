How could we implement queue using linklist?You need a head and a tail pointer to implement a queue. You also need to consider an empty queue as a special case. I will assume that you are enqueuing or dequeuing a node rather than a value: FUNCTION enqueue: current.next = null IF head = null THEN head = current ELSE tail.next = current ENDIF tail = current END Function  FUNCTION dequeue: current = head IF head = tail THEN // only one element left head = null tail = null ELSE head = head.next ENDIF return current END Function 41 Views  Answer requested by Birendra Achchhami
