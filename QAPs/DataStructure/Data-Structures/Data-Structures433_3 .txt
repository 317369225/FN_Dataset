Where is knowledge of data structures useful in Swift?I have been a Swift developer for less than a year now, but I have never came across a problem set that required knowledge of data structures. I occasionally read about it yet with no practical use case. Also people recommend this book which I haven’t read. Can anyone share examples of DS use case?I would expect data structures such as arrays or hash tables would be used in Swift in the same way as in any other language. Perhaps if you are doing a lot of front end development you have not come across much need for it yet. I haven’t read the book you mention so I am unable to comment on it.
