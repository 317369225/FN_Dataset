When should I use a binary search tree over a hash map?Binary Search Trees are better suited to in-order traversals and functions like min() and max() are readily implemented. Hash tables are designed so that insertions, deletions and lookups based on a key can be done in constant time provided the bucket array is sufficiently large. However, by design, each item is assigned an apparently random position in the bucket array so in-order traversals and min() and max() functions are much more difficult to implement. 192 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Joel De La Cruz
