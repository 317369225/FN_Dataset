Where can I find someone willing to teach me data structure and algorithms for free or in very cheap cost?I always want to become a software developer but the only barriers for me is the technical interview, I canâ€™t pass it, I want to find someone to teach me the data structure and algorithms.There is a nice youtube collection (mycodeschool) - once you understand the content in it - refer to MIT OCW videos (Introduction to Algorithms). 106 Views  View Upvotes
