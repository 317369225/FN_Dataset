Does the Universe have an underlying Data Structure?It might be possible to imagine the universe as a “forest” of galaxies where each galaxy is a “tree” with stars as “internal nodes” and planets as “leaf nodes”. (The root of the galaxy is just a gravitational centre and not necessarily a body). However, thinking of the universe this way doesn’t seem to add to the way we understand it. If you mean that information is “stored” in the way the universe is structured then that is unanswerable because we don’t know what information might be stored in the structure and we scarcely know a tiny fraction of what the universe is anyway. 79 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Maya Benowitz
