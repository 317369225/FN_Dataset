How can a high school student self study Data Structures and Algorithms?It seems You are beginner or at whatever level you are i think everyone should start with beginner or basic level. So if you want to study data structures and algorithms you can do this by watching few tutorials on it and that too in some the website like Coursera- Here you can refer to plethora of courses on Data structures and algorithms like Algorithmic Toolbox,Algorithms on Graphs,Algorithms on Strings, Advanced Algorithms and Complexity (which’s link is here - Data Structures and Algorithms | Coursera) ,also you will be happy to know that all courses are carried by University Of California San Diego, also if you want to intital start for algorithm then you can refer to algorithm by Princeton University(here is the link Algorithms, Part I - Princeton University | Coursera). Saying about your practice and self study i would like to suggest that cousera gives you practice sheet right after a topic or video ends and if you are lucky to enroll in it on time you can also get check your answer sheet by the professor which is carrying the course like in this case it will be the professor of UCSD . You can download tutorial video too. Certifiction of course is also available(paid certification). edX- You can carry your self study here also and if you want certification of course you can get it here too(paid). Here also you get opportunity to learn from different universities like from Tsinghua university there is course of Data structures (here’s the link Data Structures and Algorithm Design 数据结构与算法设计) and also from IIT Bombay they are foundations of data structure (here’s the link Foundations of Data Structures) and algorithm (Algorithms) . Here you can get practice sheets and quizzes for self study and can download course video. THank you 165 Views · View Upvotes
