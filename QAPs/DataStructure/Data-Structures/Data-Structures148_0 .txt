How are directed acyclic graphs different from trees?I would put it like this, since trees implemented in software are actually directed: Tree: Connected Directed Root Node No Cycles One Parent (one path between 2 nodes) DAG: Connected Directed Root Node No Cycles One Or More Parents (one or more paths between 2 nodes) From this view, both trees and DAGs are connected, directed, rooted, and have no cycles so this means that starting from any node and going up the parents you will eventually work your way up to the top (root). However, since DAG nodes have multiple parents, there will be multiple paths on the way up (that eventually merge). Another way to see it is Tree is like single class inheritance, and DAG is like multiple class inheritance. If you were to approach this from a purely mathematical view, the problem with relating these two is that that trees are defined in terms of undirected edges, but DAGs are defined in terms of directed edges, so they are hard to compare without getting more detailed. If you took a DAG with double paths and changed edges from directed to undirected (to make it like a tree), the tree would now have cycles, i.e., it is no longer a tree. 6.1k Views  View Upvotes
