If I read the entire CLRS Introduction to Algorithms book and implement all the exercises in it, how much better will I get at Computer programming?Just an insight You would to able to find a given number X from 1000 ( 1024 to be precise ) stored numbers in just 11 comparison instead of doing 1000 comparison, using a Binary search tree and can maintain large amount of data and would to able to retrieve the smallest or largest number in constant time without using extra space, using a HEAP In short you would start to think to solve the problem efficiently and that will lead you to become a much better at programmer. 149 Views  View Upvotes
