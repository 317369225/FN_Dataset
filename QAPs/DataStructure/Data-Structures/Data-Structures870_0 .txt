Why is j>=0 is checked in insertion sort logic?You decrement j in the loop, so it can drop below 0. This happens when an element is inserted in the leftmost position (index 0). BTW, one way to find the answer would be to remove it and see what happens. Though, if you never have any case where an element is inserted into the leftmost position, you might not have detected the problem with removing it. 147 Views
