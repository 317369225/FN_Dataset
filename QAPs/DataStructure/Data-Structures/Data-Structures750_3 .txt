Is it common for programmers who work on enterprise applications to never implement data structures?Generally yes, off-the-shelf data structures from programming languages’ standard libraries are good enough in ~95% of situations. Time to time you might have to implement something like a trie or a very custom queue or a highly specialised cache (so knowledge of how to do it is still valuable), but cases when it’s necessary are few and far between. Which by no means imply that enterprise software development is easy; it’s difficult in other ways. 61 Views
