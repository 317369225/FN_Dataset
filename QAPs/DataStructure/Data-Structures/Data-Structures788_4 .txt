Is coding not for me if I take long hours to learn to implement a basic Data Structures in C?Should I give up coding?I have solved 1000+ competitive programming problems and have also developed a few apps ranging from android to windows. But wait , there’s more to it I don’t know how to implement hash map or AVL tree . So it doesn’t matter if you can’t implement them just make sure you know them well so that you can use libraries. 158 Views · View Upvotes
