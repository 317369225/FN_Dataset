When should a binary search tree be used in an algorithm/problem?Some of the less obvious applications are when you need to compute order statistics of a set in an online fashion (the set is changing, and you need to compute k k -th order statistics for different k k ) and when you need to do complex manipulations on segments of an array or a string, like cutting a segment and inserting it back at another position, we have a programming exercise like this in the module about binary search trees. 205 Views
