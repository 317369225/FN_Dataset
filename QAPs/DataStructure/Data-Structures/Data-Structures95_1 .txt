I started working in a startup, but I don't like that job as they are expecting me to deliver fast result. Should I leave that job and look for other?I’m a college pass out student. My company is expecting me to deliver fast result which I’m unable to do so, as I just know basics of coding.I’m feeling depressed and dissatisfied. I’m thinking to leave this job and take break, practice coding and then try for some other job. What should I do now?Startups in general work at a running speed, as they expect everyone to toil hard so as to make the business stand as soon as possible. From my experience of working in two companies, where in the first one was just an year old and in the second one I am the first employee, I would suggest you to give yourself some time. Own your work and then you will never feel it as a pressure. Leaving the job will not be the right decision, from my point of view. Every startup will expect you to have a short learning curve and deliver results as soon as possible. 251 Views
