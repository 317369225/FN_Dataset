What is data structures as a computer science course about? . And is it dependent on any language?A data structures course is about data structures. Specifically, it’s about different ways to hold and arrange data, how to manipulate the data held in those structures, and the trade-offs involved in picking a data structure to use. For instance, a stack is a simple data structure where you can add data (“push”) to the “top” of the stack, and retrieve data (“pop”) from the “top” of the stack. It has the “LIFO” property — last in, first out. A data structures class would explain what it is in more detail, how to implement one, why you might want to use one (it’s handy for doing depth-first searches, among other things), and what the cost is of using one. A queue is a similarly simple data structure where you can add data (“enqueue”) to one end and remove data (“dequeue”) from the other end. It has the “FIFO” property — first in, first out. A data structures class would explain how this is different than a stack, how to implement one, and the cost of using one. Typical data structures covered in a data structures class include stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hashes, etc, including variants like double-ended queues, priority queues, doubly-linked lists, circularly linked lists, doubly-linked circular lists, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, tries, B-trees, B*-trees, and more. 217 Views · View Upvotes
