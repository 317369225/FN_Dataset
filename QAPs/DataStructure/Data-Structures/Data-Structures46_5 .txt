How do I learn the Data Structure effectively?If you are learning a data structure Get to know when you can use the data structure. Get to know what are the functions supported by the data structure. Think how you can implement all those functions effectively( with the knowledge you have). Look how that data structure has been implemented. You will learn to understand how arranging the elements in a different manner can effectively reduce the complexity of the functions that the data structure supports. Always keep in mind that the methods supported by a data structure should be optimised as far as possible. You might have to use existing data structure to build your own data structure. 23 Views  Answer requested by Ajay Kumar Dubasi
