What are the best resource to learn about data structures, algorithms, design pattern (books, online resource)?I don’t want something focus on one language, thanks for your answers.For most students we recommend Skiena’s book The Algorithm Design Manual and his accompanying video lectures. Another good option is Tim Rougharden’s algorithms course, available via Coursera. Then, to consolidate your understanding, go and do a bunch of the problems on a website like Leetcode. 174 Views · View Upvotes
