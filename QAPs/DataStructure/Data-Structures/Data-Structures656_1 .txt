Why do we use a struct pointer inside a structure definition in C?Actually the structure pointer is a pointer of structure type. Reason being that it can't be void as it can't be dereference and other data type pointer can't point structure. Now your answer , inside a structure it is a pointer that is pointing to another structure and a part of the structure. Just like the data value. When you create a node you actually create a structure that contain data value of that node , address of the next node( this particular is actually the pointer to structure ). If you write outside it then it's not a part structure of node. 114 Views  View Upvotes
