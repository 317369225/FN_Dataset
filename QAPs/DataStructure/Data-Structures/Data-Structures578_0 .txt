What is reference data type?Reference data type is based on a class rather than primitive data types like int,float. The class can be either pre-defined or you can define it. if the object is assigned to a variable, the variable is actually assigned a reference to the object, not the object itself. This reference is the address of the memory location where the object is stored (objects are stored in the heap memory). 39 Views
