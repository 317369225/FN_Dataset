Is it possible for someone to master at least 20 programming languages, 100 frameworks, and all data structures and algorithms in their career?It's not hard to learn a programming language once you know how to think in programming terms. Most algorithms and data structures are optimized for a specific purpose and well documented enough to not require that they're memorized, but if you really wanted to it really is just a question of memorization. The thing is, you don't get to be a good programmer by focusing only on the breadth of your knowledge. I'll take someone who specialized in learning how to do a specific applicable skill really well over someone with a lot of general knowledge but little hands on experience in applying it any day. 165 Views  View Upvotes
