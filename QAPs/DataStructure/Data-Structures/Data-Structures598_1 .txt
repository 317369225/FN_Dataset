How do I use algorithms and data structure in real life?The question you asked is unclear and I am assuming that by “real life”, you are meaning to use it outside of software development for simplifying day to day task. Algorithms and Data Structures are based on Real Life cases and solutions. If you are familiar with there is a data structure known as Hash Tables. The way the hash tables generally work is that it hashes every key with a position in array and stores corresponding value in the position in that array. This is a rather familiar use of arranging books in a library or storage of drugs in a drug store. The books are sorted alphabetically and are arranged in each wardrobes with labels from A-Z. So if you want to look for Harry Potter, you would go and look it up in H row. Another real life usage is for Binary Search algorithm. It is simple to search for a book in the method of binary search rather than iterating over the stack one by one. Another yet interesting hidden usage of linked list is that of communicating with someone in the backbench in a class. You cannot communicate with someone directly as it would gain the attention of your teacher. So instead you tell your friend to pass it on. 1.4k Views · View Upvotes
