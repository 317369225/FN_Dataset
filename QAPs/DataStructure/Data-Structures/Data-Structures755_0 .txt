What is a non-leaf node in a binary tree?Binary tree is acylic graph with n nodes and v vertices,where n nodes are connected by v edges with the following properties- -First node is called as root node. -All other nodes are divided into different subsets where each subset is called as binary tree. -Each node contains either zero,one or two subtrees. Hence,a binary tree is a tree in which each node is having at the most two subtrees. When you look at a binary tree, you can see there are lots of nodes in it. The bottom ones are called leaf, and all the others are called non-leaf. You can find more detail in here. 66 Views
