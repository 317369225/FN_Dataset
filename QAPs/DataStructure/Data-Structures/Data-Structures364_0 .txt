How can I learn algorithms and data structures from scratch in 30 days?What strategy I need to make to learn data structure and algorithm in 30 days. Suppose I am working professional and having good knowledge of programming language C# and C++. I just want to lean data structure and algorithm and it’s implementation in any of the programming language.If you are a beginner programmer and you just started with C, first of all what you do is : 1.brush your skills with basic C programming concepts. 2.Most importantly know the concept of pointers well, for which you can refer to Pointers in C/C++ by “My Codeschool” in youtube 3.Then you go for the Data structures - YouTube by “My codeSchool”. 4.For more advance learning you can see the CLRS - Introduction to Algorithm, which is “no questions asked” the best book on Algorithm and Data Structure 5.You can also go through by Derek Banas or you would know “NewthinkTank.com”, it provides standard Data Structure tutorial in JAVA However I would suggest going through C first. Hope it helps :) 119 Views · View Upvotes
