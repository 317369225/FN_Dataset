What is a good book about java data structures?I have read usual books that are available and usually refer to tutorialpoint or oracle for DS in java. But what I am looking for is a book that explains and most importantly exemplifies concepts like HashMaps, Collections, Vectors, Dictionaries, Sets in java. Basically the util package.
