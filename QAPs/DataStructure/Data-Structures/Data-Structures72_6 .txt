Why should I learn data structures and algorithms since there is a collection concept in Java?I think before learning java collection firstly you should learn some data structure like stack,queue, tree,hash etc .no need to learn in depth but atlaest you should know about time complexity like that if u don't know about these terms so u won't understand importance of these data structure's. If u like competitive programming so you must learn because these are really helpful :) 119 Views
