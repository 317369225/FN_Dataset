How does node fs.watch work?Is there a loop that constantly checks all files over and over? Or does it listen to HD events from the operation system? In other words: Is it possible to watch changes in all file systems (C:\) without eating all the CPU & HD in Node.JS?A quick check of the docs for v6.4.0 reveals the following: On Linux systems, this uses inotify On BSD systems, this uses kqueue On OS X, this uses kqueue for files and FSEvents for directories. … On Windows systems, this feature depends on ReadDirectoryChangesW. This isn't surprising as file system changes are deeply tied to the kernel. Because of this, performance will likely vary between OSs, kernel builds, and file systems. That said, to answer your question as best as I can, for the majority of OSs, node is registering for notifications of file system changes directly from the kernel/OS, however the way specific OS configurations handle this will vary. 46 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Aminadav Glickshtein
