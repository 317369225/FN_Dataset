How do you find the count of every element of a linear queue in C?How do you find the count of every element and if the element occurs more than once, then it should be printed only once?Besides what Seth Sims said, if you know the limits of values in the queue and the range is small (for instance, the queue is the age of several costumers) you can use (pseudo code): int counter[200] = {0}; // start all elements with 0 // 200 is a safe limit for max age for element in queue: counter[element]++;  for i in 0 .. 199: if counter[i] != 0: print i This will be faster than using qsort, but it requires that you have a small max value in the queue.
