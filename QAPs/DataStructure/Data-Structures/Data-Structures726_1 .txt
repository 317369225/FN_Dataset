What is the difference between cluster and node?Node is you. Cluster is your family. You are there ( just like a node is) to perform some function so that family (cluster) gets some value out of you. When you are dead ( node dies, unless you are the master node(most important member of family) ) , depending on if there are other members (nodes) who can continue doing what you were doing (boy, I hope not, when I die), you are, or are not critical. 160 Views
