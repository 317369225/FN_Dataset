What are some comprehensive resources on algorithms/data structures for competitive programming such as USACO? (Especially Books)I am preparing for the USACO competition at the start of ninth grade in the next few days. I already know the basics of C++ and programming, so what are some good resources that students have used to learn/practice algorithms. I am looking at more textbook-like instruction and books.I don’t think there are comprehensive resources: for the Platinium division of the most recent USACO USOpen 2016, most of the coaches tasked with preparing solutions + data waved white flags at the two harder problems: Bull in a China Shop, Landscaping (I ended up throwing in a brute force for bull, and happen to have seen harder versions of landscaping). Especially if you’re starting, it’s more important to draw a clear barrier of things that you know you can solve, and things that you plan to learn about later. My impression from previous years is that for getting to camp more or less boils down to solid fundamentals / intuitions in greedy and DP, as well as decent coding abilities. For those topics, Google or Codeforces can find you plenty of good resources. 740 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Ryan Yang
