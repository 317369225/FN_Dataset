If I focus only on data structure and algorithms and don't care to learn new programming languages, are there any problems?I always believe the core value of a developer is the CS fundamentals like data structure and algorithms and problem solving skills, I think I donâ€™t need to care to learn many programming languages, as if I really need it, I can learn it very fast if I have a solid CS foundation.There is no problem. Learning the algorithms and data structures is actually the tough task. All language mainly are different only in syntax and you can code same things in every language.Your thinking is correct, you can program in almost all languages with only very little work if you should know the algos. 74 Views  View Upvotes
