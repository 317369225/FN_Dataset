How do I say on my resume that I know data structures and algorithms if I haven't taken the course?Write in the section describing your technical/programmistic skills “good knowledge of algorithms and data structures”, “knowledge of algorithms and data structures”, “proficiency with algorithms and data structures” or the likes (depending on how strong you are). If you have knowledge/experience don’t care too much if it was from the course or not, if the employer wants to verify you in this field they’ll do so by giving algorithmic exercise in the interview. Even if the discussion goes in the direction when you’ll say you learned it yourself then I think it either should be irrelevant for them or a point in your favor: it shows you wanted to learn more than you were obliged to and that you had abilities / patience to self-teach yourself something, which are valuable skills from company’s perspective - and whether you’re good in the field they’ll rather not judge based on what course one would claim (s)he did (maybe they did and still don’t know much while you know more being self-taught) since they can simply check it for themselves during the interview. 201 Views
