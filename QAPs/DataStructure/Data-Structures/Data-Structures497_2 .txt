What is a priority queue? What are some examples?A regular queue adheres to FIFO (first in first out). This means that the first element pushed onto the queue will be the first element popped off the queue. A priority queue is a completely separate data type from a queue. It doesn’t care about the order in which elements are added (save for the special case of resolving tiebreaks). When you enqueue an element, you also enqueue a priority associated with it. When it’s time to pop off an element, the element with the highest priority will be returned. As a trivial example, we can make a priority queue where the element with the highest priority highest priority is the one with the smallest timestamp. This would be the same as a regular queue. An actual useful example would be using a priority queue in Dijkstra’s algorithm. In the algorithm, you add not-fully-processed elements to a priority queue, where the highest priority is defined as the shortest distance. To actually implement one, you generally would use a heap, which gives logarithmic time for insertions and removals. Much better than having to linearly search through the list for the element with the highest priority! 178 Views · View Upvotes
