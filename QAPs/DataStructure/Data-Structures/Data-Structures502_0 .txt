Can a binary tree node have multiple parents?The drawing you provided above is not a tree because there are two paths from the very top node in the first layer of the tree (root node) to the middle leaf node in the third layer. That violates the definition of a tree in graph theory, which states that a tree must have only one path between any two vertices. Google defines a binary tree as “a rooted tree data structure in which a record is linked to two successor records.” In practice, it’s assumed that a binary tree has one root (hence “rooted”) and would not be able to have any nodes in it with multiple parents. This is because in the case that you did have a node with multiple parents, one or both of the following two cases that violate the definition of a binary tree would always be true: If there is a node with two parents, either: 1) Similar to the drawing above, there would always be two paths from the root node to the node with two parents and hence it would not be a tree. or 2) You end up with a graph that is not a rooted tree (example shown in the drawing below), in which case there are not multiple paths to the node with two parents from the roots as before, but instead we end up with more than one root (orange and yellow), violating the property that it must be a rooted tree. Both of these cases are not mutually exclusive. Below I include an example where both violations occur: 556 Views · View Upvotes
