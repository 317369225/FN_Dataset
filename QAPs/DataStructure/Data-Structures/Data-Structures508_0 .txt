How do I understand the salary structure?I got an offer from top multinational company. This is what they sent in the mail about my salary details. I don’t seem to understand how much in hand salary I would be taking home every month. What amount of salary is distributed as variables? someone please help me with this.This is why CTC is such a confusing way of understanding how much money actually you are making. You should be more concerned with how much of this is gross salary, TDS(Tax Deduction at source), retierals (PF, EPF), and finally the take home/in hand salary. If you don't have proper understanding of this you may actually end up rejecting a good offer and accepting a bad one, just because CTC looked bigger in one case. To help with this specific problem I have created an Android app called CTSee. It is available on Google Play. Try it . I have designed the app in such a way that with very minimal inputs you get a proper break down of various components and what your take home will be. If you want to have a quick demo of the app, please have a look at below demo video. If you have multiple offers and wants to see which one has better prospects this will come in handy. I myself have used this during job hunt. As of now the app is up to date with tax calculation in compliance of financial year 2016–17. I will be shortly pushing another update for to make it compliant with FY2017–18. However you can still use the app as it is to see your breakups, as new tax rule changes will not make significant difference in take home salary or other components of the salary. Any suggestions, feedback for improvements would be much appreciated. Hope this helps. 78 Views · View Upvotes
