If I have to find number of p letters in a document what would be the best data structure to find it?Piggybacking on Michael Makris’ answer, here is an illustration in python code. from collections import Counter # assuming `doc` is represented as python string # p is letter of interest doc = "In a sea of text" p = "a" p_counts = Counter(doc)[p] print p_counts   #if you interested in how to do this a python dict try:   from collection import defaultdict #set the default value for all possible entries # as type int with value 0. Then increment letters counts # as you see them letters = defaultdict(int) for l in doc: letters[l]+=1 print letters[p] 195 Views · View Upvotes
