What is the best data structures and algorithms book for a beginner?The content should be simple and precise. It should have more examples with step-by-step explanations with diagrams. It should be easy to understand.Algorithms and O(n), O(log n) (which I'm not much familiar about) should be expained in an unambiguous manner so that I can implement it on my ownThis one is the best book for beginners to learn Algorithms. The book contains simple language and algorithms for all concepts. Unlike other books of data structure where language specific code is given, this book discusses in form of algorithms. Hence upon changing implementation language even same applies. It also covers all required concepts. Best book as per my suggetion. 205 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Seshadri Kesavan
