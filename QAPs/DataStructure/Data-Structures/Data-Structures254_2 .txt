Are data structures and algorithms really worth learning?Yes absolutely. One can observe the difference between logic implemented by those having knowledge in algorithms and data structures and those who don't. There logic implementations are far better then others. If I was an interviewer I will consider it ( Is knowledge of algorithms ) as a priority.When you are sound with algorithm and data structures, you can write optimised code and also reduce time-space complexity too. 122 Views
