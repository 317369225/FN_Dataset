Are structures in C-language similar to objects in Java?Well for a novice programmer, it can be treated as same because they have not worked with both of them. But technically Objects in Java are way more advantageous than Structures in C. Objects in Java have more features than Structures. Objects are way more safer than structures as there are no access specifiers (like public, private, protected etc) available in C language. Moreover the pointer to a structure variable might risk the information contained in variables of structure. There is no other way to access class members other than its own objects or its own member methods. Hence we can say objects in Java are more safer and secure than structures in C. 188 Views  View Upvotes
