How much emphasis should I place on studying data structures and algorithms if my goal is a job in Data Science/Machine Learning?I’m interested in an expert’s opinion on how much focus should I give to getting a good understanding of the various algorithms that are usually tested at tech companies interview processes vs. getting hands-on experience through data science competitions, focusing on learning statistics, etc.Being able to solve problems in simple and efficient ways is critical. If you are interviewing for a machine learning/data mining position you will need to be quite comfortable with leveraging common data structures such as hash maps, RB trees, priority queues, comfortable with using unordered, preorder, postorder tree walks to solve problems. Able to layout and solve dynamic programming problems (e.g. viterbi). For the programming language of your choice, you should know how to use these data structures. For example, you should know that std::map is a rb-tree and what that means for run time and space. You should also be able to do order analysis for your code — both in time and space complexity. In addition , you should be able to solve basic coin, die, and balls-in-bags problems and be able to use this to solve real problems. You should be able to find a minima for a convex function and recognize if a problem is convex. That is, if you want to work as a data scientist at a place like LinkedIn. 1k Views · View Upvotes
