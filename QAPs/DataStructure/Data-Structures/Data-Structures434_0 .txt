What coding exercises and language build strong programming skills, adaptability and increased mental acuity?Just like learning scales and tablature on a piano develops strong musical skill and leads to highly transferable skill what is the best excercises and language for programmers.Programming skills Adaptability Mental acuity I’ll go from 3,2 then 1. Mental acuity: You need to think to improve that. You can even play games(Even Chess or Go). Try to solve coding questions on HackerRank . Adaptability: Do different things. Try different projects out of your comfort zone, in which you might be interested. Work with API and study third party codes, and understand the flow. It will make you comfortable even with the language you don't know. I have personally tried this : ) Learn something on Coursera - Free Online Courses From Top Universities | Coursera or Udemy Online Courses - Learn Anything, On Your Schedule and start making something. Make games with 3D camera gesture support or VR support if interested. Programming skills: Understand data structures and algorithms deeply. Read project codes by good engineers. Work on the domain where you want to apply your programming skills. Whether you want to work on front end, back end, network stuff, machine learning or data analytics, search for that. You can do something that you don't do at your workplace. You can do competitive programming (Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming ,HackerRank ) , or learn some new hot technology and work on projects. Maybe these things will not help you at your office work, but it will give you a change. It will help you to think like new young programmers. I'm learning BrainF**k to improve my programming skills. It is not used in development, but it improves your mental ability. 899 Views · View Upvotes
