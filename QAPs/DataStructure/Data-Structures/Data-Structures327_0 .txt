What's the differences between database and data structure? When do we use each?Data Structures : 1.> Data structures are an important concept in Computer Science. 2.> They help solve a lot of real world problems in an efficient way. 3.> You can use data structures to efficiently solve problems in your code. Some of these problems might not be solvable at all without using a good data structure. 4.> Most of the modern programming languages like Java, C++, Python, C#, Scala etc have library implementations of most of the data structures, so most of the time you will not have to implement a data structure in your code, you can just directly use some library implementation of the data structure that you want to use, in the programming language of your choice. But, even though you do not need to implement these data structures in your code, it is very important to know the concepts behind these data structures to know which data structure to use for what kind of problems and also how to efficiently use them for various operations. 5.> Examples of basic data structures : array, lists, trees, graphs Database : 1.> Databases are programs that use the above data structures and other low level computer science concepts to solve the problem of efficient, fault tolerant, highly available and consistent data storage. 2.> You can use Databases for storing the data that your application ingests, uses and outputs. All interactive web sites / mobile apps have some kind of database at the back, which is helping the web site / app to remember things and help solve a certain user problem. 3.> There are two flavours of databases that are popular these days - The traditional Relational Databases (RDBMS), and NoSQL databases. You can Google them up, if you want more information about them 4.> Examples of database products : Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, etc 133 Views  View Upvotes
