How is the nptelhrd course of Data Structures by Dr. Naveen Garg? Does it cover all the basic data structures in a good way?It is a great course for learning data structures. I did it in my previous semester and found it to be quite enriching. In fact, I owe my success in data structures to it. I don't have a coding background and I was having a lot of difficulties in comprehending the nuances of trees and graphs. Mycodeschool has some decent videos but it doesn't cover the advance concepts in an exhaustive manner. Dr. Naveen Garg's course on the other hand starts from the basics and develops the concepts in an intuitive way. The only downside is its monotonous tone and the length. But if that doesn't bother you then you should definitely go for it. Cheers! 474 Views  View Upvotes
