Are there quadtree implementations that are dimension agnostic?Whenever Iâ€™ve seen a quadtree example, it always uses 2 dimensions, x and y. Are there quadtree implementations that can work with an arbitrary number of dimensions (guessing by iterating over which axis to split on), and what are they called?No. By definition, a quadtree works with 2 dimensions. Similarly, an octtree works with 3 dimensions. The generalization is called a k-d-tree. You are looking for a k-d-tree with n dimensions. All of these trees are spatial trees. 61 Views  View Upvotes
