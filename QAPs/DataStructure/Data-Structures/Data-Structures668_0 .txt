What is the best datastructure to store and perform an addition of two 512 bit large number ?If you need to do this for practical reasons, you should use an “arbitrary-precision integer” or “large number” or “big number” library in the language you are developing in. In modern versions of Python this is built in for integer types, so you can just write it directly into the interpreter or in code like: 2**511+2**510 => 10055855947456947824680518748654384595609524365444295033292671082791323022555160232601405723625177570767523893639864538140315412108959927459825236754563072 In Java there is: BigInteger (Java Platform SE 7 ) Reusing a library is not only easier, but it will be dramatically less error prone, and likely more efficient than what you’d cook up on your own. If you are doing this for educational purposes and you want to implement it yourself, then consider what you need: Let’s assume we’ll represent the numbers in binary Then we need a way to store 512 1’s and 0’s We need a way to read then n’th 1 or 0 out of any number The best choice here depends on language, but an array of integers is pretty good (if a bit larger than strictly necessary). It would be possible to jump through a bunch of hoops to use a data structure of size around 512 bits to store this number, but doing so will be much more complex than just using 512 integers. 26 Views · View Upvotes
