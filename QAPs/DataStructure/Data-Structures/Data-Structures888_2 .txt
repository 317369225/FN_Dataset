I want to get good at data structures and algorithms for placement purposes. How should I proceed?Course in coding blocks is too expensive(17000 INR). I have enrolled on coursera courses. But what, according to you , should be my approach. Like, is it ok to be a self-learner ? Which book should i consider, websites to refer. Is it possible to get good at them, without joining any institute ?The first book that came to my mind when i read your question is : "Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy" by Narsimha Karumanchi. The book is written in view of students preparing for placements. It contains all the concepts necessary for placement interviews as far as data structures and algorithms are considered. Alongside concepts, it consist of a number of questions with different solutions of different complexities and different time and space constraints. As far as websites are considered, hackerrank.com gives an organized list of questions based on different categories of the subject which you can practice.
