Why in almost all the books and online tutorials of the data structures and algorithms are not implemented in C#?C# is not as widespread and ubiquitous as C/C++ or Java because unlike these which can be written in and their programs be executed on just about any platform, native C# support is mostly only for windows (even with packages like Mono which allow you to run some simple C# code in Linux ). So in an attempt to appeal to a majority of the viewers of the tutorials and not make them learn something in order to learn data structures, C# is not used in such tutorials. 19 Views
