What are some good youtube channels about different types of algorithms and advanced programming (C++, Python)?Donâ€™t refer any channel of any university or channels containing lengthy lectures and well known channels like thenewboston,code school etcBest thing I can suggest you is to stop wasting your time and read a good book on algorithms and then search youtube for the concepts that you find hard to understand (use the search box). Read Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen its a great book. Tutorials are good if you do not have any prior knowledge of the subject. I will assume that you already have some programming skills in Python and C++, as you want to learn advanced algorithms. 715 Views  View Upvotes
