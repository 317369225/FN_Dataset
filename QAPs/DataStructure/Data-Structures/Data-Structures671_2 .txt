How can I train myself to be efficient at solving medium and hard level problems on CodeChef and SPOJ?I have solved most of the *beginner* level problems on Codechef. But some *easy* level problems seem genuinely tough to me. I donâ€™t have sufficient knowledge in DS & Algo. Please suggest what to do!If you are facing difficulty in solving the medium and hard problems, i suggest you to first practice more on similar problems.
