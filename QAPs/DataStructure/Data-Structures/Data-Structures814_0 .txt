How can I detect cycles in undirected graph using BFS?I always see code for DFS not BFS. so can i have a code or pseudocode for BFS? Thanks.If you need to describe the cycle and not just detect its existence, you need to store the paths as you traverse the graph, which is why DFS might be more convenient. Just perform BFS while keeping a list of previous nodes at each node visited, or else constructing a tree from the starting node. If I visit a node that has already been marked by BFS, I found a cycle; trace back along the path to describe it. Remember that either will only work on the connected subgraph of the node you started at, not necessary find cycles on the whole graph. 510 Views  View Upvotes
