Should l learn existing algorithms or try to reinvent them by myself?Reinventing slowed me down, so now I learn existing algorithms. Actually, now when I read about an algo, I read some portion and then try to make sense of it and try to analyse where it could be going. Then I read some more to check my logic, and so on. There are quite many algorithms to learn, so attempting to reinvent everything you need is going to slow you(anybody) by great amounts. And if you do manage to reinvent some algorithm, you’ll get addicted to it(possibly). Instead, try to read and analyse, and there’s always things like variations, proofs, etc. which you can think about on your own. Remember, you can only reinvent things which you are already comfortable with. You can’t reinvent what you have no understanding in. So its not in your best interest to go that way. 453 Views · View Upvotes
