When should I use a binary search tree over a hash map?You should use a Binary Search Tree when : 1.> You are going to need to iterate over the elements that you would be storing in the dataset in a sorted order. 2.> If you want to do operations like find all the data that is smaller / greater than a particular value and other kind of range queries. You should use a hashtable when : 1.> You need quick lookup of an item. Hashtables theoretically support O(1) lookup operation, but it depends on how good your hashing strategy is. 2.> You are going to do a lot of additions and removals. But, here if in case the underlying array has to be resized to be able to efficiently fit in more data, it could be time consuming. Also, you need good hashing strategy here so that you donâ€™t end up with the same hashvalue for a lot of the keys, and consequently long chains. 211 Views
