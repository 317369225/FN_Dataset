What exactly should a beginner do to master algorithms and data structures?Learn them slowly but steadily. [1] Start with mastery of sorting functions in language libraries (example: the qsort function of C) [2] Learn to sort arrays of structs or objects. [3] Learn different sorting algorithms and the associated data structures. [4] Learn searching techniques. [5] Learn simple data structures like arrays, multidimensional arrays, stacks, queues, etc. [6] Learn Binary Trees and associated algorithms [7] Get into Graphs and related algorithms The standard academic route is what I have outlined here and it works!
