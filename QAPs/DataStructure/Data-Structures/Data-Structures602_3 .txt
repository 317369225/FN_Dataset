Why do we need to learn data structures before learning algorithms?You don't. I think, realistically, you learn them simultaneously. You don't have to know how an array works to sort one, you just need to know the API for the array. You can learn all your sorting algorithms in this way. You only need to understand data structures when it comes to traversing them within algorithms. 61 Views  View Upvotes
