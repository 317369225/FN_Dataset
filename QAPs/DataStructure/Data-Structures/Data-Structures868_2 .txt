Are there quadtree implementations that are dimension agnostic?Whenever I’ve seen a quadtree example, it always uses 2 dimensions, x and y. Are there quadtree implementations that can work with an arbitrary number of dimensions (guessing by iterating over which axis to split on), and what are they called?k-d tree is a binary tree that always splits on one of the axes. Note however that in very high dimensional spaces they don’t really work too well. The logarithm of number of points should be significantly larger than the number of dimensions. 55 Views · View Upvotes
