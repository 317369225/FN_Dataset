What is a good source to learn data structures and algorithms?Well according to me “Data Structure and Algorithmic Thinking with Python” by Narasimha karumanchi is best book. this book contains Lots of examples with explanation All code is written in python. Not too theoretical point to point explanation in easy language. Real life scenario examples with diagrams. if you don’t get bored of watching videos then i suggest you check following lectures taught by Awesome professors. Algorithms - Shai Simonson you will fall in love with his teaching. Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews-Udemy. 214 Views · View Upvotes
