Should I focus on learning more languages or Algorithms and Data Structures?What is more important if I want to pursue a career as a Computer Programmer?If your hold on a particular language like Java or C# is good, then picking up another language will not be tough. While if your hold on Algorithms and Data Structures is not good, then no matter what language you know or learn, you might not be able to use it efficiently for performance. So, i would suggest you should focus on Algorithms and Data Structures first, try to master them if you can. Learning more languages should not be very tough like i said, you can do it any time. 11 Views  Answer requested by Danish Ajaib
