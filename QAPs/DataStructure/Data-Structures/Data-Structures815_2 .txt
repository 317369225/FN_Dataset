I'm 16 years old and know Java, PHP, JS, Python and Ruby. I know almost nothing about data structures and algorithms. Where should I start?Firstly congrats. The best book I think is this one Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (MIT Press). As you’ll see it is dense, take your time to read it, implement the algorithms. Ideally you should also learn more about Math. It will open your mind far beyond these algorithms. You are young so you have plenty of time to learn and once you’ll be graduated you’ll be able to compete to get your dream job. 468 Views · View Upvotes
