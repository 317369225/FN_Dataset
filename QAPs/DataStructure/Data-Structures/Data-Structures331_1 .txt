How can I structure a new React project?I have a lot of experience with Angular, Grunt, CoffeeScript, npm, bower, etc. Given that it’s a pure front end project, what’s the best way to get started?In React everything is based on components which are .js, .jsx files. I am not sure what framework you are using like redux/flux etc. But as your question emphasizes on React which deals with only view layer I’m describing structure of view layer only. It can be divided into Views and Components directories as shown. Views have HTML files and parent level components. Also if you have any external files like images, CSS files goes here. Components directory containers all child components in the application. You can further sub categorize sub-components into different types as shown in picture. 122 Views · View Upvotes
