Where can I find really easy and fast understanding of all data structures and algorithms?There is no one place where you will find EASY, FAST, SIMPLE, LESS TIME CONSUMING AND WHAT NOT FOR Data structures & algorithms. There are so so many resources online TopCoder, HackerRank, HackerEarth, GeeksForGeeks, Introduction to Algos by Cormen. You can start anywhere. You will find tons of answers on Quora on this. A solution for some problem/algorithm if you won’t understand on say TopCoder you will get a solution which you would understand easily on HackerRank. Something on HackerRank which you won’t understand you will comprehend it simply on TopCoder. The trick to fast learning is implementation. Read a solution from multiple places don’t just stick to one resource. This is how I learn. Look for real life implementations of a data structure, Google about it. That will motivate you to learn. Say while learning Greedy Algorithm you must solve the Activity Selection/Event Scheduling problem. Try to implement it without Greedy Algorithm. Test your code with 100s of inputs. Then approach it with the Greedy Algorithm. See the difference. You will have a better understanding why the hell Greedy Approach exists. And most important thing don’t try to learn everything at one time. Whatever you learn, learn better. 190 Views · View Upvotes
