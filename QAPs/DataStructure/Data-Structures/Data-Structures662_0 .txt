Which data structure would be best to find the number of students within a given height range in a scalable way?Given, the heights (in cm), of the primary school children in India (in millions), which data structure would you use, for supporting the following use cases and functionalities - remove data when students get un-registered from school. How will you return number of students within a range?Okay, lets analyze this, there is a million data and i am taking the maximum height to be 8feet (Even thats not possible though). Also 8ft = 243.84cm. So even taking a precision of 0.01, if we create kind of mapping from height to no of children with that height we will still have only 24384 keys (2.43 x 10^4), which can easily be stored as array indexes and later can be operated on by segment trees for the range queries. So we just create an array with indexes denoting the height in cm multiplied by 100 and the values at those indexes denoting the count of children with that height. We then create a segment tree out of it. Creating Seg tree: O(n) Range Query: O(log n) Removing a student (Update): O(log n) To read about Segment trees: https://www.hackerearth.com/note... 439 Views  View Upvotes
