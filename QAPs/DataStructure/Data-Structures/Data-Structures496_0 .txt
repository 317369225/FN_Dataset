What are the applications of a binary search?A binary search takes in a sorted array and finds a given element, if it exists, in logarithmic time. This is instead of having to search linearly through an unsorted list. The downside is in the construction of the sorted array: while adding to an unsorted list takes constant time, to add to a sorted array you have to perform a binary search. So it’s a trade-off - you spend more time constructing your data structure, but you can look up things faster. This is especially useful when the array doesn’t need to get modified much. For example, if you want to look up a word in the dictionary, which you obviously aren’t modifying, you optimally would use a binary search. 189 Views
