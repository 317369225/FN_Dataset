How do I design a data structure to store sets, efficiently add new sets and, given any set, check if we have already stored any of its subsets?Nothing’s going to be logarithmic. The best you can probably do is to maintain a bipartite graph where one set of nodes are the elements of the sets you’ve stored and the other is the sets themselves, and there’s an edge between an element to a set if that set contains the element in question. You can do inserts pretty easily, and finding subsets that you’ve already stored is only slightly more complicated. 249 Views
