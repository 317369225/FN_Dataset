How does inserting a new link works in linked lists?This must be a fragment and I assume first is a static variable. This is inserting to the front of the linked list It’s important to realize that first is a pointer to a link object (not the object itself). Create new link and set nextlink pointer to whatever first was before. First=link you are adding (that is it, pointer changed to refer to new object. Previous entries maintained by properly updating nextLink) The if linked list is empty you will have one node with a null nextlink. Otherwise it will point to next link. 146 Views · View Upvotes
