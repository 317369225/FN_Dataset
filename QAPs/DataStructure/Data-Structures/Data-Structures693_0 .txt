If I intend to become a software/(back-end) web developer, what are the CS courses other than Data Structures and Algorithms that I have to take?What are the CS courses that I can afford to not take (Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Computer Vision????)? Please rank the courses that helped you on your job or in finding your job.I would say that you should skip none. There is no shortcut i’m afraid. Back-end development requires you to understand what’s happening before your scope (Hardware, Networking, Protocols, Memory Management, OS whereabouts, Programming languages caveats, OS security, scalability, basic hosting admin…). More over, it requires you to understand what’s happening after your scope. A good back-end is back-end that a front-end developer can exploit easily. So you have to understand front-end requirements too (UI/UX, Ajax/Browsers/Javascript constraints, CORS, XSS…). Plus, you have to be good at team work and team methodology, and estimate accurately the time you need for your tasks. This requires some project management knowledge and also to be good at documenting your work. Also, you must be aware that you are to develop products, this is not just about code. So you have to be interested in who use your product and how your company sells it. It requires basic marketing knowledge. Anything you will skip will miss you later. Happy coding. 34 Views
