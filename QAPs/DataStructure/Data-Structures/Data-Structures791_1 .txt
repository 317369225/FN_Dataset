What is data science and how is it used in practice?The Wikipedia answer is: Data science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, data mining, and predictive analytics. My simplification to Wikipedia is: Data science is the study of large sets of data used to extract useful insight. A data scientist is a person who takes this large data set, along with their coding and statistical abilities/knowledge, and makes that data useful to someone else (or themselves). To answer the second part of your question, companies employ data scientist to help visualize market trends, analyze competitors, and use their knowledge to help solve existing problems. For example, at an advertising company, a data scientist would help clients target customers whose location, interests and demographics make them an ideal audience. In news organizations, data scientists help with election forecasting, finding compelling stories no one else has or upping subscriber revenue. Hope this answers your question! 214 Views
