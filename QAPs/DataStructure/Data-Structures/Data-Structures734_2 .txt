How does inserting a new link works in linked lists?Here’s how it works in a step by step fashion. In the very beginning, first points to NULL, as shown below. When the first link appears, first is made to point to that link and the nextLink to the new link points to NULL, just so: When the second link appears, the second link’s nextLink points to the first link and first points to the second link. This goes on. First always points to the most recently inserted link. This kind of a linked list is suitable for implementing a stack. 152 Views · View Upvotes
