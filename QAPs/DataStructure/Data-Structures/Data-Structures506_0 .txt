What are the minimum number of queues needed to implement a priority queue?Based on my understanding, it is possible to implement a priority queue with just a single queue. Depends on how you define priority and how you're programming the input to be accepted. If the element you're entering is itself the priority, then you have no problem, just insert a nice sorting algorithm to get it sorted by priority. If you have a different priority other than the elements' value, you can use the same queue. Now this is where it gets tricky. You'll need to use a two dimensional array, and while sorting you'll have to be careful to swap both, the element and it's priority while sorting. Or you can maintain another queue just for the priorities. The aforementioned problem will remain constant, but the only difference being that now you have two arrays to manipulate, which, in my opinion, is a little more tedious than the former solution. I could be wrong of course :) this is just based on what I remember from my data structures course 2 years ago. 149 Views
