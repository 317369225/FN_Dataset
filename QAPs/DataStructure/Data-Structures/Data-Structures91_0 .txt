When is the use of a break statement unavoidable within a loop?While trying to prove my Programming III teacher wrong I realized that breaks can be substituted by properly thought while and do while control structures, Is there any instance where the situation calls for a For loop and the use of the break statement is unavoidable?Realistically, never. You can always convert something like: while (1) { ;do something if (predicate) break;; ;do something else } into: while (keep-going-p) { ;do something if (predicate) then { keep-going-p := false } else { ;do something else } } Typically, a good compiler will transform them into more-or-less the same thing, although it’s likely the former will come out slightly better (smaller, faster, whatever) and maybe a little easier to read. 265 Views · View Upvotes
