Should I take data structures in C++ or Java? I am studying chemical engineering and often have to get outdated hardware to work with newer computers.It depends on what language you have a better hold on. If you currently more comfortable with the Java syntax then you should take it in Java, if you have better understanding of basic C++ then take it in C++. If neither, then Java is a safe bet, as i think it easier to grasp than C++. The other point is you are having to use outdated hardware, so in that case i am assuming that the outdated hardware might not have JVM running, so then maybe you should take up data structures in C++. 60 Views
