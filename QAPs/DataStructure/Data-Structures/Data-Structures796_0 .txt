Why is only branching pattern considered as data structure in computer science?If by “branching pattern” you mean linked structures (linked lists, search trees, etc), then the answer is that those are not the only things we call data structures. For example, a Hash table with open addressing is a data structure with no (explicit) links, although you could view the collision resolution strategy as a sort of implicit linking. 173 Views · View Upvotes
