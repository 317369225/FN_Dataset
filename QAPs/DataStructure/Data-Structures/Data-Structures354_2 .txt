Why is it quicker (O1) to find an item in a list through hashing (hashmap), than it is do go directly to the item that you're looking for?For clarification: Why is accessing an item in a python3 list, by index slower than accessing one in a dictionary, by key?The assumption in your question seems wrong. If you can go directly to the element you want then that is also an O1 runtime. With that being said just because two algorithms are O1 doesn’t mean they both run at the same speed. One of the algorithms may complete its operation in 1 second where as the other algorithm may complete its operation in 1 hour. The point is that regardless of the input size the operation will always take the same amount of time. 346 Views · View Upvotes
