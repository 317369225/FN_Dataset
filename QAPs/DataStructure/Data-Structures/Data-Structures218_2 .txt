Are structures in C-language similar to objects in Java?Well, i would say pointers to structs in C are theoretically similar to objects in Java, baring the fact that structs cannot include methods. Structs are a way to create complex data types in C, similar to Classes in Java, but Classes can include methods that operate on the data, while structs cannot. Broadly speaking C is not an object-oriented language, while Java is an object-oriented language, and objects in Java are a consequence of it being object-oriented. 111 Views
