How can I learn algorithms and data structures from scratch?Here I’d first like to claim the difference between a bad programmer and a good one that whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. A power programmer: Rarely creates programs from scratch! Often creates programs using building blocks:) Anyways, coming to the point to learn from scratch:) You can go for this to get your emphasis more on the performance analysis.
