A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?It’s better to be able to build something in one language, than be able to build nothing in 10 languages. Yes, your professor is largely correct, many people get bogged down in languages, thinking it’s somehow valuable to know a dozen different languages. You need to be able to write software, languages can be a major distraction, pick one good language, C++ is a decent choice, yes, learn data structures, you’ll get nowhere without them. Don’t be the guy who remembers the keywords of 10 different languages. Be the guy who can build software. 8.6k Views · View Upvotes
