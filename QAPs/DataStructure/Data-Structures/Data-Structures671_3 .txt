How can I train myself to be efficient at solving medium and hard level problems on CodeChef and SPOJ?I have solved most of the *beginner* level problems on Codechef. But some *easy* level problems seem genuinely tough to me. I don’t have sufficient knowledge in DS & Algo. Please suggest what to do!I was also on the same track 3 months ago! So this is what i did, trained myself whole-heartedly in individually in different topicsand sub-topics + alwys try to solve problems in cook-offs/lunchtime and long contests. However I’m still doing these things. SO I suggest you to try solving problems in UVA OJ this is the best algo classifier I’ve ever seen. You can get question from each and every category for ex- If you learning Bellman-ford then goto graphs-Single source shortes path/-ve or +ve edges-there you can get variety of dijkstra,bellman-ford algo. etc related questions. SO in short you can try this strategy and goodluck. 777 Views · View Upvotes
