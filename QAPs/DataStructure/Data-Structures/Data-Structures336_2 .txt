A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?Up to a point yes. Having multiple languages helps you cast a wider net when you search for jobs, but if you cannot pass the technical interviews for those languages, you won’t get the jobs. If you know one language well, your have to narrow your search, but you will have a better chance of passing the interviews. Most developers these days are polyglots. If you know C++, you can probably pick up C#, Java, and JavaScript easily (although, there will be new concepts you will need to learn, and some practices you will need to abandon when moving from a native language to one that runs in a VM) The languages where C++ won’t help you much will be those in the functional language family, since it’s not just a new syntax, it’s a different way of thinking. 530 Views · View Upvotes
