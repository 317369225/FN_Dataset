What is use of malloc function in linked list?It is not that malloc() is used in Linked Lists alone. Malloc is used: When you don't know how many object of some kind you need (e.g. linked list elements); when you need to have data structures of size known only at runtime (e.g. strings based on unknown input); this is somewhat mitigated by the introduction of VLAs in C99, but see the next point: when you know at compile time their size (or you can use VLAs), but it's just too big for the stack (typically a few MBs at most) and it would make no sense to make such thing global (e.g. big vectors to manipulate); when you need to have an object whose lifetime is different than what automatic variables, which are scope-bound (=>are destroyed when the execution exits from the scope in which they are declared), can have (e.g. data that must be shared between different objects with different lifetimes and deleted when no one uses it anymore). Notice that it isn't completely impossible to do without dynamic memory allocation but there are cases in which you actually need to emulate it by using a big static buffer and writing your own allocator. 207 Views  View Upvotes
