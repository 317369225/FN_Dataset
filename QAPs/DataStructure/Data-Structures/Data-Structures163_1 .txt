What is the use of the structure variable *start=NULL and *new_node in the below program?Start is a global variable It can be accessed anywhere from the program. Initialising it into NULL is a good way of programming. Literally start now points nothing. whereas newnode is created inside the do..while loop so its scope is within it. You cannot access it outside while loop. Also it is initialised during run time. (Heap is the place where memory gets allocated for newnode) But both newnode and start are pointer to an node structure. 8 Views  Answer requested by Gayatri. Ramasamy
