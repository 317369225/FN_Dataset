What is the simple possible application using B tree?The simplest reasonably appropriate use would be for recording and checking a list of keys. Imagine a spellcheck: You want to read a list of correct words, and then check every word typed against those words. Storing all the words in a tree of some sort makes the lookups quicker - scanning through an entire list each time would be slow (scaling with the number of words), while a looksup in a tree scales with the logarithm of the number - roughly speaking. In a similar way, you could use a tree to compare two lists - put the first in a B-tree, then check each item in the other against the tree. I’m not sure if a B-tree is the best for that sort of use, though. A binary tree has better theoretical scaling (since there’s no linear scan of the values in each node), so if you can keep everything in RAM it might be preferable. A B-tree saves a lot of disk reads, so they’re better if you have to read each node off a disk. They are typically a bit more memory efficient, too - less space used on pointers to child nodes. 277 Views · View Upvotes
