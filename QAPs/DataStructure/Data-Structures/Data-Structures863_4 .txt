How can I store and process large 2d array?I have to store and process the relations (correlations) between a large number of objects. And I'm looking for a right concept for this problem. The array can be dynamically resized by adding new objects. I'm going to present the relation values as a float number (like in the image).Save it in a database, then search for it with a SQL statement. You can search for any combination of Object_0, Object_1 … Object_1000 … Object N, or any combination of cases. (IOW, all cases where Object_1 is True and the others don’t matter.) 93 Views · Answer requested by Tomasz Antas
