What are some websites similar to mycodeschool.com where data structures and algorithms are taught by videos/articles and then given workouts online?In mycodeschool.com, there are tutorials for learning data structures. After each tutorial, they provide a platform for hands-on(online) exercises to implement the same. I find it very effective. Are there other websites with similar features(tutorials followed by hands-on exercises)?Other answers are good.
