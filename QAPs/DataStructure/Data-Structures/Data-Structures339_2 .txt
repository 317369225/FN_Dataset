Is it possible for someone to master at least 20 programming languages, 100 frameworks, and all data structures and algorithms in their career?Well yeh, sure it is. But that's not an accurate metric of a god-like programmer. A god-like programmer is one who is diligent, curious and always learning. He MAY have mastered 20 programming languages, 100 frameworks and wateva else in that time, but that's only a bi-product of time and practice. I will go ahead and assume this question came from someone getting into web/GUI/app development and someone who doesn't really understand the life of a tech, that's ok. I would say it is far more likely that this god-like programmer will have mastered things like interfacing with the web in general. Learning how to identify familiar coding patterns and see the pitfalls of certain practices, ahead of time. The same way someone like myself (an embedded C programmer) will have mastered C, but would also have spent a considerable amount of time programming hundreds and hundreds of different boards. I will have mastered the art of programming hardware, the intricacies of memory management etc. So in short, it's possible. Don't let me discourage you, if that's a goal of yours, go for it! 117 Views
