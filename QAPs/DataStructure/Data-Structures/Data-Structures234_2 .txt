How do you print the inorder traversal of a BST?“Give a non recursive algorithm that performs an inorder tree walk”. Wouldn’t this just be a standard depth first search? None of the non-recursive solutions I saw online for this problem did anything that really resembled DFS (even though they all used stacks)…is my reasoning incorrect?Simply print the values of the tree in their naturally sorted order. For a BST this means recursively printing the left child, then the parent and then finally the right child. Edit: Just noticed that it says to do this non-recursively. In that case you’ll want to iterate and use a stack, but it’s really the same thing. 129 Views
