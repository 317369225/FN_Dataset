Can I work as a data scientist with merely basic knowledge in data structures (mathematical programming, numerical analysis)?Thanks for A2A Data scientists are the professionals with in depth knowledge of statistics, programming languages (Python, Java, R etc.), business skills and vizualization tools (Tableau, Qlikview etc.). While the knowledge of vizualization skills comes secondary, statistics and programming languages are the foundation. As the basic knowledge about Mathematical programming and numerical analysis is good to have, you will have to develop the above mentioned skills to work as a data scientist. I hope this will help! 143 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
