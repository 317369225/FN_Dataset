What is a good source to learn data structures and algorithms?I think the most awesome source to learn Algorithms and Data Structures is the Algorithms, Part 1 and Algorithms, Part 2 MOOCs by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne from Princeton University. Below are the links to the courses on Coursera : Algorithms, Part I - Princeton University | Coursera Algorithms, Part II - Princeton University | Coursera It pretty much fits the bill as far as your criterias are concerned, except for code example in Python. If you can get through some really concise and succinct Java code examples on this course, then i bet you will not regret investing your time and money on this course. Highly recommended. Also, the book Algorithms Design Manual by Steven Skiena is a great and concise book with a lot of examples. Again, it has example code not in Python but in C. But, if you can get through with C code, then i would highly recommend this book. I hope the above information helps you in your pursuit to learn Algorithms and Data Structures. All the best. 139 Views
