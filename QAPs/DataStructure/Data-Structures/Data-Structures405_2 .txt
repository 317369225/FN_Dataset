What are some tips for self-studying Data Structures and Algorithms?Don’t aim for an exhaustive study of every single data structure and Big-O values. It will be an impressive feat, but such knowledge is seldom required in one’s career. Get comfortable with Algorithmic Complexity. Please do not ignore it. You cannot master data structures without mastering algorithmic complexity. Learn to visualize the data structure. You can draw it, see it in your head, or whatever. Just make sure that you understand the internal structure and how various operations work on them. Learn when to use a data structure. I have seen students struggling with solving problems with an obvious and simpler stack solution. What happens if I use a hash table in the problem? Or a heap? Or a BST? Code it up. Never stick to *reading* alone. You need to start implementing what you have read. Again, I have seen students struggling with this. You shall start seeing edge cases in your code that you did not even notice while reading. Practice. Start doing competitive programming. Its not an absolute necessity, but as you become more experienced, you can easily pick up the optimal data structure for each problem.
