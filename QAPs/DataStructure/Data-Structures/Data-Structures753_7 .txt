Are there good and high paying programmers who never implemented data structures in C?I am finding reasons to make a living without learning C and that too in the long run I want to jump into product management. Does C become inevitable to progress through this track? I have to learn programming though. I am asking it in view of getting through the interview for the likes of Amazon.One good and highly-paid programmer I know knows his data structures and algorithms inside out, but that is because he has worked with teams building products in C and C++. That said, it is possible that there are people with high-paying programming jobs who are unable to implement a data structure or algorithm. 115 Views  Answer requested by Nikita Benjamin
