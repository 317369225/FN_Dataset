What are non-terminating nodes in binary tree data structure?The terminology “non-terminating” is unusual - I can think of two things it might express: Non-leaf nodes, or internal nodes to the tree. This would be any node with at least 1 child. In the case of some algorithm on the tree, a non-terminating node would be any node at which the algorithm continues (e.g. does not terminate). 56 Views · View Upvotes
