How do I order a list of list by the date?The list of lists have 4 elements: and one of its is a string of the date: "08/06/12"(month/day/year) so the problem is when I have to order the list by the date.The idea is to use a score function like score = day + month * 31 + year * 366 or again, just as simple as could be, format your score function to be score = day + month * 100 + year * 10000 Or again score = int(year + "" + month + "" + day) It’s now according to the score, you can get the sorting (ordering). The implementation however differ from a language to another. .NET languages can use a custom function for ordering (sort, compareTo). A general solution is to make a double-list (i.e dictionary) , where the first column is “index” and the second column is the “score”. The final solution will be the ordered indexes (example: 9, 2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 0, 4, 7, 8) that you can use to order the list. 13 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
