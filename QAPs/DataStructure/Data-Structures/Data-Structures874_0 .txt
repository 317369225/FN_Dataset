Why doesn't diborane have structure like ethane?Diborane is not similar to ethane because borane is not isolobal to methyl (isolobal meaning, ‘equivalent in terms of symmetry and with similar electron count). Elemental carbon has four electrons, while elemental boron has three. When Boron binds three hydrogen, it has an empty p-orbital available for bonding; when carbon bonds three hydrogen, it has one electron left, a radical fragment. When an atom is electron deficient (hasn’t achieved full octet) and has an empty p-orbital available -just like our friend boron, it can often participate in what is called an electron deficient 3-center-2-electron bond [1], where it is best to view the empty p-orbital as occupying the same space as the bond between two other atoms. In this way, it can share some electron density and achieve a full octet. When two radicals come together -like our carbon fragments, they form a two electron bond, in this case forming ethane. So the reason diborane doesn’t have the same structure as ethane is that boron doesn’t have the electrons to do so. If you give diborane an extra electron however, it does have the same structure as ethane [2]!
