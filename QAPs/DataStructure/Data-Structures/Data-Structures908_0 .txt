What is the simple possible application using B tree?I use a B-tree for geotagging photos retroactively. Each GPS location and timestamp is entered into a Perl hash tied to a B-tree database, then to tag a photo I look up the locations bracketing that time. This is the code that tags a photo taken at time $time: sub compare { my ($k1,$k2) = @_ ; $k1 <=> $k2 ; } $DB_BTREE->{'compare'} = \&compare ; $trackh = tie %track, "DB_File", "trackdb", O_RDWR, 0666, $DB_BTREE ; #... $key1 = $key2 = $time ; $trackh->seq($key2, $next, R_CURSOR) ; $trackh->seq($key1, $prev, R_PREV) ; $dtime = $key2 - $key1 ; $dtime1 = $time - $key1 ; ($lat1,$long1,$ele1,$course1,$speed1) = split(/,/,$prev) ; ($lat2,$long2,$ele2,$course2,$speed2) = split(/,/,$next) ; $lat = $lat1 + ($lat2-$lat1) * $dtime1/$dtime ; $long = $long1 + ($long2-$long1) * $dtime1/$dtime ; I.e. assume the camera was travelling in a straight line at constant speed between the two trackpoints, and interpolate the position. I don’t know about simplest possible, but it seemed a good fit for a B-tree instead of just an associative array, as there probably is not an exact patch for any given time. 637 Views · View Upvotes
