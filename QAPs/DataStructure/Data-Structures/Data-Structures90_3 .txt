Given a point (x,y), how can you find the number of unique ways of getting to that point from your current position?What algorithm would you use and how? I came across this question on glassdoor asked in an interview at a company with no other information. I was just curious to understand how to proceed with the problem. Any specific constraints that would make sense, please consider them in your answer.It looks like a path finding problem in a maze. You should confirm with your interviewer about the valid moves, like for example, you can move down and right etc. For this problem, I would consider, I can move down and right. It means if I am at location (r, c) where r is the row and c is the column, then the valid moves could be (r+1, c) and (r, c+1). Consider for example, I trapped at a deadend and couldn't find the path, so I have to backtrack myself in order to come out from the deadend. Does it look recursive to you? It surely does. So to mimic recursion, I would take a stack, and push the cells that I have traversed and pop them when I enter in a deadend or couldn't find path. I hope this explanation would help you to understand the problem, if this is what have been asked! 194 Views  View Upvotes
