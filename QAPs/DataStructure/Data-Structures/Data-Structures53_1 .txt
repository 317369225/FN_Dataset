How could an ArrayList be turned into a fifo data structure?Have two factors in my program, keywords and a text document. I want to search the text document identifying each keyword I find & then finally identify the section of the document which has the shortest section while maintaining every keyword. I want to use a FIFO DS for this, could AL work? ThanksYou could, but just use LinkedList instead LinkedList (Java Platform SE 7 ) you could then use methods .add() and .removeFirst() to manage the queue FIFO class in Java but there are other facilities useful here. In particular, peek() can be very handy for text processing - gives you a look ahead if you need conditional processing. 126 Views  Answer requested by Joshua Borland
