Which programming language contain the feature of dynamic data structures?I have learnt in school that C contains dynamic data structures like linked list and binary tree. Are there other programming languages that contain these dynamic data structures?Almost all the programming languages have one or more implementations of those. In fact C, does not have an internal library implementation of Linked List or the Binary Tree until and unless you are talking about a third party library. 101 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Durga Devi
