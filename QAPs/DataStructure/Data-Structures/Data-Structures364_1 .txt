How can I learn algorithms and data structures from scratch in 30 days?What strategy I need to make to learn data structure and algorithm in 30 days. Suppose I am working professional and having good knowledge of programming language C# and C++. I just want to lean data structure and algorithm and it’s implementation in any of the programming language.For learning DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM ,implementing on any of the programming language you are comfortable with you must have deep and clear concepts of that language . If you think you have good knowledge of coding then its good and you need not to worry about your ALGORITHM part for DATA STRUCTURE you have to pay attention and you should give your time on that . In case of algorithm it became easier because of having good knowledge of programming and having your thinking and logic ability because it is being developed already during your coding session ,but for data structure you should know its basis and it’s implementation . for that go through the reference books and many types of tutorial and other study materials are available on internet take help from that . 98 Views · View Upvotes
