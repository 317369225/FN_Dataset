Finding difficulty in learning data structures and algorithms. What should I do?Initially you will face some difficulty in learning any new concept or thing. But eventually, with time and practice, you will begin to understand them. For learning data structures, I would say you can read C programming language by Denis Ritchie”. If you are learning some other language other than C then you can directly refer to data structures in this book. All the data structures are properly explained in this book. For learning algorithms, you can refer to Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen. It’s a standard book for learning algorithms. All the algorithms are properly explained with pseudo code of each algorithm. It’s a good book for learning algorithms. Additionally you can refer to online tutorials for data structures and algorithms. The one which I would recommend for data structures will be by Naveen Garg of IIT Delhi and for algorithms I would recommend this user - saurabhschool. 215 Views
