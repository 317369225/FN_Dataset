What kind of programming questions are asked while interviewing a candidate in C?In C it is hard to solve the problems related to graph, tree etc as they take up a lot of time needs several other data structures to be implemented from scratch so what kind of question should I prepare for?How is it different coding graph/tree in C vs (C++, python, java, etc)? If you are coding a graph you use adjacency list(two dimensional array). If you are coding a tree that is a struct with pointer members. All other languages require pretty much same technique. 174 Views  View Upvotes
