What is the difference between an I/O, a mapped I/O, and a memory mapped I/O in the interfacing of the microprocessor?I/O is simply an Input or Output port at which microprocessor can give some data(in case of O/P) or can receive some data(in case of I/P) Mapped I/O are those I/O for which microprocessor has an extra space, separate algorithm for reading and writing and sometime have dedicated hardware. Memory mapped I/O is a kind of I/O which is stored in the same space where your programme is stored, so fetching algorithm of these kind of I/O data is same as for accessing the memory content. 9k Views  View Upvotes
