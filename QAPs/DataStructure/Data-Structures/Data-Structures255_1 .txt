What is the structure of icl2-?I guess compound is ICl2- (dont get the 9 after that). Structure can be reasonable found by VSEPR. VSEP(valence shell electron pair)= 7+2+1(electron)/2=5 SO, basic geometry is Trigonal Bipyramidal(TBP), however, we see there are only 2 bond pair, and 3 lone pair so deviations arise. And in forming the actual geometry, Lone pairs are at equatorial position(to minimize repulsion as would have been in other positions). So, geometry turns out to be Linear. 45 Views
