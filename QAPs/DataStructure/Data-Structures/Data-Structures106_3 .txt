How can I master coding in a year?Coding data structures algorithms etc.You can, if you think you can. Start with any one language (Preferably C or Java or .NET) Start with one chapter at a time, practice all unsolved questions Once you have finished first 10–12 chapters, start working on complex problems available on internet, that will help you to sharpen you logic building skills. One thing I would like to mention here, you can learn syntax part within a week or month, all you need is to practice logic of different problems. Once you know one language, you can probably work on any language in the world, only syntax part is different (that you can anyhow google it and use it) But you need to know how to solve problems by your logic. Good luck :) 204 Views · View Upvotes
