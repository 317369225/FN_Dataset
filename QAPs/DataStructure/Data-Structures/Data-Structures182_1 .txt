When should a binary search tree be used in an algorithm/problem?One of a number of different types of binary search trees can be used when you want to store data in such a way that insertions, deletions and lookups can all be done efficiently (all take log N time with BSTs). I don’t know of any class of problems where BSTs form the algorithm for solving but “divide and conquer” is a common technique for solving many classes of problems. For example, the “bisection method” can be used to find the value of an unknown quantity. 111 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Joel De La Cruz
