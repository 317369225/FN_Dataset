What are some websites similar to mycodeschool.com where data structures and algorithms are taught by videos/articles and then given workouts online?In mycodeschool.com, there are tutorials for learning data structures. After each tutorial, they provide a platform for hands-on(online) exercises to implement the same. I find it very effective. Are there other websites with similar features(tutorials followed by hands-on exercises)?Coding Interview preparation made easy and HackerRank are two good examples of what you want. Former is dedicated for the kind of study you want. Latter one has one section that teaches you data structure and algorithms step by step and has many more sections for offline practice and online coding competition, so make sure you don’t confuse yourself. 109 Views · View Upvotes
