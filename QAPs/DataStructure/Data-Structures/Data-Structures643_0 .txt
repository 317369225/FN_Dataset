Which is the best book for Data Structures and Algorithms through C++?First thing, there is no best book. Second, IMO, recommended book will be: Sams Teach Yourself Data Structures and Algorithms in 24 Hours You will get the soft copy easily from any site if you are from India due to the cost of Book. Except India, I will recommend to buy this book its very handy for understanding concept clearly with C++, again due to cost :) . Hope this helps ! 272 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
