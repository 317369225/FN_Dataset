Is it possible to have an id-number structure for the attachment page in wordpress and having the page-name structure for others post type?Is there a way to have the attachment page permalink like ...com/attachment_id=37 (with Wordpress not trying to assign the name of the uploaded image to the attachment page but just the id number or a similar structure?) and all the other permalinks (page or post) with the sample-post structure ?You can do this by get id of page by using permalink structure in which you can select POST or PAGE_ID which you can use in attachment. Page name structure you can solve by selecting template. You can make different templates and save it with different id . Once you select the template in your page or post so automatically you can get structure of post type and and id-number. 199 Views  Answer requested by William Esposito
