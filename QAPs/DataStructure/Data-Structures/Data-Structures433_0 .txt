Where is knowledge of data structures useful in Swift?I have been a Swift developer for less than a year now, but I have never came across a problem set that required knowledge of data structures. I occasionally read about it yet with no practical use case. Also people recommend this book which I haven’t read. Can anyone share examples of DS use case?A better question is “when is a knowledge of data structures useful in software development?” There’s nothing special about data structures and Swift. The libraries that are used in Swift, or in Objective C, are the iOS or macOS SDKs. The have a number of data structures implemented in them as classes for your use. There are arrays, dictionaries, strings, sets, structs, and buffers. And all their supporting classes as well. These are usable in Swift so that you don’t spend your time reimplementing them for each project with the overhead and bugs from that. But, that doesn’t mean you don’t have to write your own sometimes. Or be aware of how the standard ones work so that you can use them well. Besides, the standard data structures are the simple ones that you use to build your complex structures you need in your particular application. One example might be a communications app where you keep an internal dictionary of the people your user might want to contact. You want to have their information and profile easily available, but you also want to minimize your use of memory too. A list of users kept in order of most recent use would be handy for that. To be an advanced or expert developer, you do need to know about data structures. 180 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by M. Joseph Fani
