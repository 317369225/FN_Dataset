How can I learn algorithms and data structures from scratch?If you’ve never studied DS before and want to start from scratch then I’d suggest you to study it through video lectures first. Because it might be a little tough to comprehend the codes and analyse the way they are implemented in memory. One of the best sources I found to study DS for a beginner is by a YouTube channelmycodeschool. They’ll teach you DS with all it’s aspects including time complexity and space complexity of each algorithm as well. You can refer to other videos of this channels as well for searching sorting algo. This will give you the basic knowledge and good hold over data structure. After this you can refer to any high level book for elaborated form of data structures. 1.1k Views · View Upvotes
