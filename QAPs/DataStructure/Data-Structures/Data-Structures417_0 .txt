What is heap data structure?In data structures, a heap is a collection that allows elements to be inserted and the smallest element to be found and/or removed. Concrete implementations include the binary heap, pairing heap, skew heap and Fibonacci heap. In the context of dynamic memory allocation, the heap is a collection that allows variable-sized blocks to be allocated and subsequently freed. The heap’s job is to try to pack these together as tightly as possible in order to avoid wasting memory due to fragmentation. 194 Views · View Upvotes
