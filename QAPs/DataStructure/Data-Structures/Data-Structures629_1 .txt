Why are the candidates not evaluated on frameworks like Spring, Hibernate along with problem solving skills using Algorithms and Data Structures?Based on the interview testimonials, the technology leaders like Google, Facebook and Amazon generally evaluate candidates solely on problem solving using Algorithms and Data structures. Do they use frameworks like Spring, Hibernate and other Java EE solutions?Those bigger companies are looking for a good programmer. So they ask data structures, algorithms and puzzles in the interview. A good programmer can learn different frameworks and diffferent languages very quickly. Although they use frameworks like spring, hibernate in their organization they may not ask questions related to it in the interview because they can learn any time. But in some cases if company does not have enough time for their employees to learn and work on frameworks like spring/hibernate then they will hire people who have knowledge on frameworks. In this case interviewer will ask questions related to it. Mostly this also happens on service based companies when client specifically requests for a candidate with good experience on particular framework/tech stack. 123 Views
