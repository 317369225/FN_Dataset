Why should I learn data structures and algorithms since there is a collection concept in Java?Java Collection API’s provide you a way to directly use the suitable data-structure for your application . But the selection of which data-structure for your application depends upon your knowledge in the fields of algorithms and data-structures . Even if you have control over collections and you do not have the grasp of choosing the appropriate data-structure for a given problem then all your collection command goes in vain.The selection of appropriate data-structures for the problems comes with lot of practice and grasp over variety of problems . For ex :: Think of the data-structure used by the web-browsers for maintaining the back and forth visited pages . Data-Structure for this is a Doubly Linked List . If you have gained command over choosing the appropriate data-structures for the problem then I think you don’t need to go into the internal implementation of the functions in the java Collections.You could directly use them.But at times selection of data-structure depends upon its internal working so my advice to you is practice as many problems as you can using Collection API’s and with time you will internally come to know the internal working of the API’s functions with the demand of the question. Hope you got the answer !! I too am a novice in this field but that’s what my feelings was !! 63 Views · View Upvotes
