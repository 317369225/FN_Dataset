A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?Somehow true. From my experience, if you are strong in them, everything else will be smooth. So consider them your first major goals to master. One can replace C++ by other programming languages (e.g. Java)…although I prefer C++. Then, your next steps will involve learning multiple languages and more about CS fundamentals. Before going to market, you may give more attention to technologies (e.g. web or mobile technologies). Btw, one of the best ways to be really strong in data structures and algorithms is through competitive programming. 1.3k Views · View Upvotes
