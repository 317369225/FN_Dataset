I'm trying to be a self taught programmer. What should be the correct flow of online courses I should take or books I should read?Being a good programmer isn't only about knowing a language, a programmer is a wolf who has strong hold of data structures and algorithms, A man with knowledge of only a language like c++, JAVA or any other known language (however it is necessary to learn one) falls under the category of bad programmers . To be known as so called a good programmer one should be good in maths, problem solving and data structure & algorithms. The best way to be a good programmer is to use the "hit and trial" technique which can be briefly explained as to use random knowlege from various sources and then try to implement that knowledge.Internet is the best source to learn. However if you are a systematic learner and want to learn programming with rules here are few steps :- TRACK TO FOLLOW :  1. Learn a language( any programming language ). 2. Solidify your maths background ( SERIES AND PROBLEM SOLVING ) 3. learn data structure and algorithms Books : 1. Data structures and Algorithm by narsimha karumanchi, career monk publications 2. Introduction to algorithms ( also knows as bible of programming religion) 3. There are various others look on internet. 4. Use sites like codechef.com Hakerrank.com, codeforces.com, topcoder.com( recommended) and solve as many problem as possible.take part in monthly competition to know where you stand. 5. Build something: it can be any software you wish that should help to solve some common problem of everyday life. thats it by the time you have done all this you would be writing the same answer to someone else's question on qoura. cheers.
