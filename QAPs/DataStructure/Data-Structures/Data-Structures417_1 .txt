What is heap data structure?It is not clear what type of "heap" is meant here. There is an area of memory known as the "heap" from which dynamic memory allocations are made from. There is a set of code known as the "heap manager" which handles memory allocation requests from a program. The heap manager may or may not include a "garbage collector". There is also a data structure known as the "binary heap" which is a form of binary tree. It has the property that the value stored at a parent node is always less than that stored in that node's children (so that the root of the tree always has the minimum value) and that all insertions are made at the same level and a new level of child nodes is not utilized until that level is full. 43 Views
