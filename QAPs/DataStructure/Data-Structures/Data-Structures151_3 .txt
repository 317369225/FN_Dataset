Is it worth paying $3,000 more just to take a Data Structures and Algorithms course?Have you thought about a MOOC? It may not carry exactly the same weight, but for $50 or so you can get a certificate of completion. Listing that on a resume would show (me, at least) that you are interested in extending your knowledge further and broader than the requirements for your degree, *and* you’re doing it in a cost-effective way. There’s no guarantee that your extra effort will be noticed- but spending 60 times as much won’t get it noticed 60 times more effectively, either. If you like the subject, if you like to learn on your own- do it. Learning more is never a bad thing- you never know when some tangentially-related subject will suddenly pop an idea into your head. Also: $3k is a lot to spend- $50 is a nice dinner. My last online course (for NO immediate career reasons whatsoever- just interested in the material) probably “entertained” me for 100 hours at least. $0.50/hour for entertainment is a pretty good deal. 326 Views · View Upvotes
