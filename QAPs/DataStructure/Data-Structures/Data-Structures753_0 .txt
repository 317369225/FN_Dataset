Are there good and high paying programmers who never implemented data structures in C?I am finding reasons to make a living without learning C and that too in the long run I want to jump into product management. Does C become inevitable to progress through this track? I have to learn programming though. I am asking it in view of getting through the interview for the likes of Amazon.There are two questions here: Are there highly-paid programmers who never use C? Yes - there are lots of programmers using numerous other languages such as Java, Haskell, numerous Web languages, etc who rarely or never use C, and who make very good livings as programmers. Are there highly-paid programmers who never implement data structures in any language? Probably not - once you get beyond the simplest programming problems, you’ll need to understand data structures and their performance and other properties even if you use library implementations. And often you’ll encounter situations where library implementations are not adequate for some reason and you’ll need to “roll your own”. 602 Views · View Upvotes
