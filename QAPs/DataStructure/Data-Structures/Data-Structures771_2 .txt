What are cool data structures?Allow me to nominate Fibonacci heap. I just came across it in an algorithms class, so I can’t say if it’s actually used in any large scale applications, but as far as the data structure itself is concerned, it’s pretty cool. It takes a binomial heap and adds a bunch of crazy ideas on it, resulting in a heap that achieves O(1) amortized decrease-key operation, without affecting the asymptotic performance of any other operations. Squeezing juice out of nowhere, “almost free” lunch. 358 Views · View Upvotes
