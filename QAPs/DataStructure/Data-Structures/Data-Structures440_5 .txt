What is the best data structures and algorithms book for a beginner?The content should be simple and precise. It should have more examples with step-by-step explanations with diagrams. It should be easy to understand.Algorithms and O(n), O(log n) (which I'm not much familiar about) should be expained in an unambiguous manner so that I can implement it on my ownData Structures and Other Objects Using C++ by Michael Main, Walter Savitch: Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++ takes a gentle approach to the data structures course in C++. Providing an early, self-contained review of object-oriented programming and C++, this text gives students a firm grasp of key concepts and allows those experienced in another language to adjust easily. Flexible by design, professors have the option of emphasizing object-oriented programming, covering recursion and sorting early, or accelerating the pace of the course. Finally, a solid foundation in building and using abstract data types is also provided, along with an assortment of advanced topics such as B-trees for project building and graphs. 40 Views  View Upvotes
