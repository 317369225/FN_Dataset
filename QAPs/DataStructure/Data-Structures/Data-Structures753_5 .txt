Are there good and high paying programmers who never implemented data structures in C?I am finding reasons to make a living without learning C and that too in the long run I want to jump into product management. Does C become inevitable to progress through this track? I have to learn programming though. I am asking it in view of getting through the interview for the likes of Amazon.Its more about knowing how the data structures work, and how algorithms work. Implementing them yourself will give you a better understanding than any book or tutorial. For example, if I ask you how you'll store an list of usernames and passwords, if you say "array" and "linear/binary search" in most cases, that's unacceptable. If you talk about hash maps on the other hand, that's promising. But could you then explain to me how and why in certain situations will I get an access time of O(1)? What would you do if then I have requirements of the system that fail on using the hash map implementation in your standard library, or any library for that matter? You need to be able to draw up an implementation/prototype! Reiterating, don't do it in C if you don't want to. Do it in Java, C++, Lisp, Brainfuck, or even Assembly for all I could care. Just be able to do it when you need to. 261 Views  View Upvotes
