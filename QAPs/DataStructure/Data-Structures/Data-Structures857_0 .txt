What are some beginner to intermediate project ideas that involve using (relatively) complex Data Structures and existing algorithms?I’d like ideas which would help me learn about something new, as well as something that demonstrates how the Data Structures and algorithms are used in real world software. Just as an example, I have worked on a text editor that uses a gap buffer. I’m comfortable with C++, Java, Python.Auto-complete/Word Correction for your text editor using Prefix Trees: Good for getting familiar with Trees View frustum culling is an interesting problem in Computer graphics which will help you learn divide and conquer, kd-trees and 3 dimensional thinking Decision Trees will be a good entry point to the world of machine learning and will make you familiar with recursion and trees. Ant colony optimization for Travelling Salesman problem will make you familiar with NP hard problems and AI. In terms of data structures you'll be dealing with graphs Some of the problems might seem too hard and require a bit of reading before you get down to working on them, but all of them should help you apply data structures algorithms to real-life problems, and you'll be learning tons of new things. 236 Views  View Upvotes
