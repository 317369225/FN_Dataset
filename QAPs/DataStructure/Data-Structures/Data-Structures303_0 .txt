I am an E&C graduate. But I have a decent knowledge in algorithms and data structures. Which IT company would be good for me to join in as a fresher?Google , facebook , spacex will be good . But are you getting placement in those companies? if yes then great; else try something that you really love to do (networking , c++ , shell , node js ) and decide you profile based on that competitive programming will be a great fun to you. endif; 19 Views
