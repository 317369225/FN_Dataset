How do I learn the Data Structure effectively?First learn the theoretical concepts of data structures. Choose any programming language of your choice like C, Java, etc. Try and implement whatever you have learnt with language you have choose. After you have learnt to implement the data structure, practice more and more. Keep looking for problems on data structures and solve them. After solving optimize your solution. Look around, everything around you will be an implementation of some data structure. For an instance people standing Queue, papers stacked up on each other, the wagons of trains, etc. Take inspiration from world you and create a virtual version of it.
