What is the advantage of keeping the next pointer as first element of structure in linked list?If the next pointer, of a linked list, is the first element in the structure, the you can have different sized elements, and still find the next pointer. Different sized elements can either contain an array with varying sizes (c), or a POD subclass (c++). I'm not up to date with the newest c standardâ€™s details, so the following might have changed in the newest revision, but it used to be OK: struct list_node { struct list_node *p_next; int size; char str[1]; /* The last element can contain more elements*/ }; Then you'd allocate and use it with: s = (struct list_node*)malloc( len + sizeof(struct list_node)+ strlen(str)); s->p_next=NULL; s->size = strlen(str); strcpy(&s->str[0], str); . 132 Views
