What are some interesting data structures and algorithms implemented in facebook?Well a famous data structure used by Facebook is its graph search. Here's an example of how Graph Search works. Say Jahnavi is moving to Bangalore City in a few weeks. She said it would be helpful for her to find which of his Facebook friends live there. The Graph Search process starts with nodes for her friends and then traverses her friend connections, or "edges." Those individuals are connected to her through the "via-friend" edge and "lives-in" edge for Bangalore city. Jahnavi expanded the query to "my friends who live in Bangalore and like Mr. Robot." From here, there was one individual that matched all three constraints: friend connection, lives in Bangalore and likes Mr.Robot. That’s how it works. A dead but famous algorithm was EdgeRank algorithm. EdgeRank is the name commonly given to the algorithm that Facebook uses to determine what articles should be displayed in a user's News Feed. As of 2011, Facebook has switched from using the EdgeRank system and uses a machine learning algorithm that, as of 2013, takes more than 100,000 factors into account. 540 Views · View Upvotes
