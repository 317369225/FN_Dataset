What is the deep web and how do you access it?Accessing the "Deep Web" is pretty easy. Here it is in two easy steps: Download and install TOR Browser Bundle: https://www.torproject.org/proje... TOR Browser Bundle is a browser configured to use the TOR relay network, which anonymizes your connection through a distributed set of relays to prevent someone from learning your physical location and allows you to use sites which are blocked. People use it to prevent websites from tracking their IP, or people in China use it get around the Great Firewall, for example. The browser component is actually built using the Firefox codebase, so if you have used Firefox you will find it pretty familiar. It comes properly configured and won't install any malware or cruft on your computer, as it is written and maintained by freedom fighters, not some large corporation. Once you have TOR installed, open up the TOR browser, and go here: http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page You'll probably want to bookmark that in your TOR browser, unless you want to type in that URL each time. That's it. You're there. That's "The Abyss," a sort of "Yahoo" (in the 1999 sense) to sites and points of interest around the Deep Web. Feel like you are discovering the internet for the first time again! Recommended: Read one of the links listed at the top of the page, entitled "How to Exit the Matrix." 1.7m Views  View Upvotes
