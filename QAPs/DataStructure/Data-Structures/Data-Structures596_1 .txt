Does it matter which programming language a data structures class is in?I am currently learning C, C# and Java. I really want to learn more about data structures and algorithms. It looks like the Data Structures class through IIT Bombay covers it in C++. If I learn this with the class in C++, Iâ€™ll be able to implement this knowledge to any language I learn, correct?Obviously the details will be different depending on the idiosyncrasies of your favorite language, but the fundamental ideas behind data structures and algorithms are the same across languages. 27 Views  View Upvotes
