What is linked list pointer?Just as a pointer to int contains the address of the integer, a pointer to a linked list contains the address of the linked list(in this case, the address of the head pointer of the linked list). A linked list is a data structure in C/C++ which can be constructed from pointers to struct, which is a data type in C/C++. Let’s see how to construct a linked list from struct pointers. struct node { int data; struct node *next; };   struct node *head, *tail; // declare two pointers   // allocate memory for head and tail head = malloc(sizeof(struct node)); tail = malloc(sizeof(struct node)); head->data = 4; tail->data = 5; head->next = tail; tail->next = NULL;   struct node **linked_list = &head; Now, we have a linked list whose head is a struct pointer head. The linked list looks like [4] → [5] → NULL head is the head of the linked list. struct node **linked_list is a variable which is the pointer to the linked list. Notice that linked_list is a double pointer which points to the head of the linked list. 48 Views
