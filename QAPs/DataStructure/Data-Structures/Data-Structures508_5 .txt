How do I understand the salary structure?I got an offer from top multinational company. This is what they sent in the mail about my salary details. I donâ€™t seem to understand how much in hand salary I would be taking home every month. What amount of salary is distributed as variables? someone please help me with this.Your Gross Annual Salary is 450010 Your Annual Deductions are 31098 ((7900 for Health insurance Premium) + (16560 for PF)+(6638 for Gratuity )) So your Annual Salary after deductions is 418912 (450010 - 31098) Your monthly salary is 418912/ 12 = 34909. I think you got clarity now. 37 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
