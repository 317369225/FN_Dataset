Is data structure and algorithm different for different languages?They differ only in the details of their implementation. You would come up with a basic idea, make a flow chart or some sort of pseudo-code then code it in the language of your choice. Fortunately, most high level languages are such that they can be substituted for pseudo-code so pseudo-code would only be needed if you were coding in assembly language or something. 60 Views  Answer requested by Ashmal Rahman
