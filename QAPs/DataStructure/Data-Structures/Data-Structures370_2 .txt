Why should I learn data structures and algorithms since there is a collection concept in Java?I would state 2 It improves your skills. Not everything comes with java collections. However, we learn algorithms to understand internal concepts to solve new problems not just to use the algorithm to solve a problem. If you are not interested to learn algorithms don’t even think about them. Don’t do it for profit do it for fun. You’ll enjoy the beauty in them. 105 Views · View Upvotes
