I would like to develop a new type of data structure, how should I go about this?I’d like for this data structure to have its own storage and search policy as well as operate as close to the memory as possible. (Alternatively, where could I find the documentation/code for existing data structures?) Thanks!Before you design / choose a data structure fir some purpose, you need to know what that purpose is - what are you going to be doing with the data structure, and roughly how much data you will be storing in it. E.g., “I want to store the name and email address of every member of the Democratic party. I will want to generate a list of the email addresses several times a week, and add a name/address several times an hour.” Alternatively, where could I find the documentation/code for existing data structures? There are many good books on Data Structures. At Rutgers we use “Data Structures Outside in in Java” by Sesh Venugopal in our Data Structures class. 115 Views
