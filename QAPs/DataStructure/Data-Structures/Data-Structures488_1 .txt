How does node fs.watch work?Is there a loop that constantly checks all files over and over? Or does it listen to HD events from the operation system? In other words: Is it possible to watch changes in all file systems (C:\) without eating all the CPU & HD in Node.JS?On Linux for sure it uses inotify(7): monitoring file system events apis which are kernel level syscalls that setup and tear down what are effectively event handlers which are called when file system events happen. I’m sure that on Windows it uses the Windows equivalent (which I don’t know what it is, as I don’t do any win32 programming). You can watch the file system root (/ in linux, C:\ in windows) without destroying your CPU but, there are a lot of changes that happen at the file system level, and most of them you’ll find you don’t want to watch (page events for example). So while you won’t have performance problems per se, you will definitely want to make sure that you have a really good algorithm to decide which events you actually care about. 79 Views · Answer requested by Aminadav Glickshtein
