Which book should I read to understand algorithms and data structures from basic to advanced If I know only python very well?I know python very well and a bit C/C++. I want to learn algorithms and data structures from the very basic so that I could improve my competitive programming skills.Which book should I refer which has simple way of writing so as to make my concepts of algorithms and data structures clear?Thanks for A2A These are one of the most popular books for Data structures and Algorithms: Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen & others (Covers both domains) Introduction to Algorithms - CLRS.pdf Algorithm Design by Tardos & Klienberg (Algorithms explained beautifully) Algorithm Design - Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos.pdf To get a good a good grip on Data structures and algorithms, use C++ instead of Python while practicing. Use STL in C++ to use the basic in-built data structures once you have implemented them yourself. You can find good material for STL on Learn C++, GeeksForGeeks and TopCoder. 341 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Aman Bhalla
