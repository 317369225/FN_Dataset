Which data structure could I use to store 3D (voxel) images in Pandas or NumPy?I think that DataFrame.to_panel() does not support 3-dimensional indexing. If Pandas is unable to accomodate, NumPy suggestions will also do..Checkout the sckit-image lib (Image processing in Python). It uses numpy arrays to store images. Iâ€™ve used it for 2D images but not 3D, although it claims to support 3D images, both grayscale and colour (multichannel). See A crash course on NumPy for images for the basics about the storage format 47 Views
