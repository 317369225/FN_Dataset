Is using 2-d arrays for problems that could be solved by Linked Lists or Hash Maps frowned upon in interviews? Does using 2-d arrays have cons?I use C, since Python’s not allowed in this target company’s interviews. I could solve 60% of the questions this company asked with 2-d arrays. (I saw previously asked questions by this company) These are the set of questions I solved with 2-d arrays : q5yws - Ghostbin.I will be frank. If you are using 2d array where a Map is used, and if another person is using using Maps, in interview, I would take the the other one, simply because Map is O(1) array is O(N). 60% is ok for the Interview, but again if other is 80% then I would take the other. In interview, its all comparison, assume you have a business, and knowing that O(N) is a lot slow than O(1), will you take the O(N) candidate? You won’t. But why? because money is involved, and business needs to be optimal otherwise it closes. All commercial company product/ services do business, so they choose the best candidate. Additionally, if a O(log N) developer might be a lot better than O(N), so will be taken depending on some urgency circumstances. Some companies only take O(1), else they wait like forever. I will further suggest you have plan, possibly after reading this: The best/quickest way to learn to Problem solving, excel in Competitive programming, excel in doing Projects, using a programming languages like C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, etc. by Manohar Poreddy on ManoharPoreddy All the best. 83 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
