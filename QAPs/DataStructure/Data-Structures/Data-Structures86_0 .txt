What should one prepare if data structure is my area of interest in an interview?Since you have interest towards it, learn everything under data structures. You should start array, etc. then map, set, etc. so on In the end, fenwick tree, segment tree, etc. To give a twist, also learn about bit packing in array. However, note that, if you applying for a tester role, then only DS might help, if dev position you need to learn algorithms too. Hope that helped. Best of luck. 306 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
