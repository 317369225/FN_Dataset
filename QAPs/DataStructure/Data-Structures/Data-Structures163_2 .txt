What is the use of the structure variable *start=NULL and *new_node in the below program?Basically you are initializing each node with NULL by default. The new_node is used to create a node which can be inserted in Linked List. Your insert code does this when given the head of the linked list and the node/value to be inserted. Checks if the node given to it is head or not. If it is head it will just return that. Else iterate till it finds end of linked list. Insert the node at the end. Return head. 65 Views  Answer requested by Gayatri. Ramasamy
