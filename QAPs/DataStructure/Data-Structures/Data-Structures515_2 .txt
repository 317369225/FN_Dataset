Should I learn how to design data structures before learning about algorithms?In CS undergraduate program, the first course is related to teach students “how to think algorithmically?” Then, some examples are given such as “How to bake a cake?”. This can be seem a basic question. An algorithm for this question would be a recipe. If you do not apply the steps in the recipe correct, you will probably not bake a cake. I advise you to learn about algorithms before data structures because we do not want you to be hungry. 93 Views · View Upvotes
