What should be the steps for a beginner to learn data structures?Please don't merge this Q. I didn't get my answer anywhere. Let I wanna learn BST,randomized BST, Hashing,UFDS,Segment tree,Fenwick tree,Treap,LCA,HLD,MO,Trie,Suffix array,AVL tree,Splay tree etc. What should be the step by step process?I mean will it be easier to learn seg tree if I learn BST first?If you’re into MOOCs I’d recommend Tim Roughgarden’s Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 - Stanford University | Coursera or Introduction to Algorithms on MIT’s OCW. If you’re into textbooks, the latter also follows Introduction to Algorithms (colloquially also known as CLRS). It’s dense but a great reference for quickly reviewing material prior to an interview. 386 Views · View Upvotes
