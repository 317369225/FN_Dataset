Do I need to be able to implement all data structures natively without libraries before starting competitive programming?I currently understand the theoretical aspects of most data structures, but I want to know if its required if me to be able to implement them natively or just learn how to use them before starting. And if I might be asked at job interviews to write them from scratchNo, that’s not necessary. I’ve never coded a red-black tree, but that doesn’t stop me from relying on std::map during contests. Of course, you should understand the principles, otherwise you won’t be able to reason about the performance characteristics and figure out how to use the data structures in algorithms. 5k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Alaran Moshood
