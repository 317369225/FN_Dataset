Which data structures should I at least know in general?I studied arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees (Search, AVL, splay and B-), hash tables, heaps and a few types of sorting. I heard of other structures such as leftist and skew heaps, red-black trees, disjoint sets and mroe. Is it essential to learn all data structures in general?Just knowing data structures is not enough, you should also know the algorithms to operate on them. Data structure just describes how data is stored and other important aspects are how to insert, remove and update them. So I would recommend reading about following data structures and related algos. Dictionary/Hashtable/map - hashing, collisions, data storage etc Standard Array vs. Linked list - learn differences and pros and cons between these two representations. Trees & Graphs - learn basic traversal algorithms like BFS, DFS and heuristic optimizatipns, partitioning trees to achieve specialised properties like AVL, Red n Black trees. I would also recommend buying a Data Structures & Algorithms book and read it. 259 Views  View Upvotes
