How much proficiency in data structure and algorithm is more than enough to get into Google/Facebook and what should be 4 month strategy to learn it?I would like to know of a proper strategy using various online judges like Topcoder, Codechef, SPOJ along with online tutorials/courses from udacity/coursera and some list of books(if needed, like Introduction to Algorithms (book), Cracking the Coding Interview (2011 book) ) etc. Detailed Plan pls..Regarding the book and the learning part, I would advise to stick to MIT-OCW course on data structures (it's by one of the authors of “Introduction to Algorithms” book). The video lecturers cover all topics and the book becomes a complementary material for further reading and attempting questions. At the very least you should be very comfortable with basic data structures. Pick a language and stick to it. Develop proficiency in one language rather than knowing something about all. It doesn't matter as long as your basics of programming are clear (there is a separate course for that too). And when aiming for companies like Google, you must know advanced programming concepts like dynamic programming etc. 3k Views · View Upvotes
