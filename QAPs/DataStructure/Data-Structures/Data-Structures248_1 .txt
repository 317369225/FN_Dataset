Is Boolean logic based only on binary transistor circuits or can it be applied to more complex physical systems?Where can I read about this stuff in more detail? (but oriented towards beginners)Boolean algebra predates the transistor by 100 years. George Boole developed it as a means of defining the fundamentals of mathematical logic. It was then recognized that mechanical computation would be well-served by following its precepts. So, Boolean algebra is not based on binary transistor circuits, rather it is the other was around.
