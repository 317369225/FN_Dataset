What is the difference between keys and values in binary search trees in Java?A binary search tree holds the property that each node's key is smaller than the key of all nodes in the right subtree and greater than the key of all nodes in the left subtree i.e. L < N < R. The data or value of each node is orthogonal to the keys. For instance, keys of a binary search tree could be ages of people where the data is their name, phone number, and address.
