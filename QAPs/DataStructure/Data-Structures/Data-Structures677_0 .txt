How do I break down a problem and solve it with the use of Java programming?"A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant." - Alan Perlis For the initial stages, the only programming language that doesn’t require attention to the irrelevant is drawings - circles and squares and arrows and scribbled text on a whiteboard. And I’m not even sure I mean (strictly) UML - yes, it’s a drawing, but I think it’s OK to be even less specific than that. Plans will change anyway - mostly because better ideas will pop up during development. So “leave something to the imagination” :) Of course, you can’t just draw anything - you have to already be proficient in the language that you’ll be writing this in, you have to know what’s possible and be able to at least roughly estimate what will be easy. Solving toy problems (that can be solved with no or almost no advance planning) can help with that. 780 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Arihant Bansal
