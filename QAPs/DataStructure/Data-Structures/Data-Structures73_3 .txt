Do functional programming languages produce much garbage as they favour immutable data structures?It depends on your programming style and the optimizations that are done by the compiler (if it is one, an interpreter may be able to do such optimizations as well, but it is unlikely). Most of the time the data is changed in between function calls and the original data isn’t needed anymore, and this is were the optimization can reduce the amount of garbage that is generated. 130 Views · View Upvotes
