What are data structures and algorithms in Java?Data Structures and Algorithms do not pertain to a specific language. They are independent of programming language. One need not know a programming language in order to learn data structures and algorithms. Data Structures from Wikipedia : In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. See, it does not mention a particular language associated with a data structure. You can implement a data structure in any programming language of your choice. Similarly, Algorithms from Wikipedia : In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. Again, no mention of a programming language! It is just a series of operations. You can implement an algorithm in any programming language of your choice. Algorithms generally use data structures as a means to perform those step by step operations. These step by step operations are generally written in pseudocode (A very loose way of expressing operations. Not much attention is paid to syntax. Only the semantics matter), whereas Java is a solid programming language with attention paid to both syntax and semantics. 139 Views
