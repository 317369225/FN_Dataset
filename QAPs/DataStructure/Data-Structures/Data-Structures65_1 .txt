If I am very good at data structure and algorithms, am I more valuable than someone with more software development experience?Being “good” at data structures and algorithms in your programming class or with competitive programming tasks is great (better than not being good) but real world jobs pay for results in real world scenarios. Legacy code can be ugly, might use broken data structures, might have bugs etc. and you need to make it work for the customers (whoever they are) while applying your knowledge of algorithms to make things better. These two skills are complementary and knowing one vs. the other does not inherently make you more valuable (until you use the knowledge to write some highly critical piece of code and enable your employer to see the benefit of that). 184 Views · View Upvotes
