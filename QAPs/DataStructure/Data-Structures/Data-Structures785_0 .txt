How could we implement queue using linklist?Tell me what defines a queue? You push an element at the back and pop from the front. So here you must use two pointer variables, let's call them head and tail which defines the head and tail of queue respectively. Initially Head points to front of linked list and as you keep popping, increment the head. Tail points to the end of linked list and as you add new nodes, increment the Tail pointer. During initialization, Head will be equal to Tail, the queue will be empty. You can also implement a queue using an array if you know the the maximum size of queue. Okay, now try to answer a follow up question, how will you implement two queues with a single linked list? 156 Views
