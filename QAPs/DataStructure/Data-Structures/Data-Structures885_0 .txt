How do you manage and structure your own application projects?I am interested in how those who work on their own applications/projects keep on top of things and stay motivated. I am always jumping from one idea to the next before I can really get anywhere productive.It helps me a lot to work it out on paper or a whiteboard before I start coding anything. Every now and then I discover that the tool I'm using won't actually work the way I modeled it, but the vast majority of the time I eradicate/avoid more problems than I create. It's the software equivalent of "measure twice, cut once." Model what's supposed to happen in detail first and then step away from it and later walk through it again. Shuffle things around until they're as simple as possible and they still make sense when you forgot the details and have to work it out again. I think that if you start writing code first you put the cart before the horse. Not only are you creating stuff that you only hope will work, you can't help but focus on the data structure instead of the interface. You should really design an app from the interface in, not from the data structure out, and you should work out what you want it to do before you start writing. If you do things in that order I think you'll find that a lot of the time you don't bother writing any code because you figure out that things won't/shouldn't work ahead of time. 157 Views  View Upvotes
