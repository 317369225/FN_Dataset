Which is the best way to learn data structures & algorithms from beginner to advanced level?Thanks for A2A. As I near Top 100, now at 116, I am finding more and more refined & better ways to learn DS & A, I will write a better one after I reach Top 100, may be couple of days from now. For now, all I can say is below, 3 simple steps: Learn C++ STL (not C language), or Java Collections I learnt C++ STL, from here: std::binary_search - cppreference.com For complex problem, divide into smaller sub problems, write 1 line code that solves 1 subproblem say using a function, so that in 1 page, you can see a full solution of the full problem, this way you can verify easily because u can read the code at 1 glance. 2 hours: Learn one more topic each day from ManoharPoreddy/HackerRank-Topics, and other places, where ever u can learn faster The more you learn, the better & swift you can reach to Top 100, that is topics help you write better code, as it gives unique & different ideas to do same problem but with possibly faster than naive methods. 2 hours: As you learn each of the above topic, apply them Find a question on competitive website, and solve it - or, ask other for similar questions where you can apply the topic this will ascertain your understanding on the topic, remove any incorrect assumptions you made while learning, and make you remember the topic for long time each time you solve 3 questions, your rank will jump 1000+ ranks or more initially until you reach a 10K, later 100+ ranks or so - this way you learn best and progress fast towards Top 100. best of luck if u have a doubt in above, ping me. 2.4k Views  View Upvotes
