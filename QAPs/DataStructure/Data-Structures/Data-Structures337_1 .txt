How can I overcome my struggle while solving Leetcode or any data structures & algorithms problems?I am a SDE with 3 years of work ex. I find it v v difficult to solve DS & algorithms problems. I just feel like giving up but I aspire to become an efficient programmer with good problem solving skills. I took 6 hours to solve this problem at Leetcode. Can someone please help me. How can I improve?I think as Winston Tang mentioned it, trick might be to start from easy to medium to difficult. Once I also tried to solve only the Difficult problems and was soon depressed as I wasn’t able to solve as many I wanted. But then I sorted the problems based on difficulty and tried to find soft point in the list i.e. where I was able to solve the problem but I was taking long time. From here on, I solved some 50 problems and regained the confidence. Another thing that might be helpful is taking this (and its advanced version) course in parallel. 148 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
