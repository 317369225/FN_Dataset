Why is it quicker (O1) to find an item in a list through hashing (hashmap), than it is do go directly to the item that you're looking for?For clarification: Why is accessing an item in a python3 list, by index slower than accessing one in a dictionary, by key?Hashing is what makes it possible to go directly to the item you are looking for (unless you know its index number in advance). Otherwise, you would have to search for it which takes at best O(log N) time or even O(N) time. 275 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Robert Lee
