Which data type should I use for storing n=10^14 in C?A larger type long long int was introduced to C in C99 and C++ in C++11 (this type is also often supported as an extension by compilers built for older standards that did not include it). The minimum range for this type, if your compiler supports it, is: long long int: -9,223,372,036,854,775,807 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 unsigned long long int: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 And if you wish to store values greater than that then you must consider reading this tutorial by codechef that covers the representation of big numbers in C/C++ using arrays and then multiplication Computing Factorials of a huge number in C/C++: A tutorial Maybe this can help you out! :) 57 Views
