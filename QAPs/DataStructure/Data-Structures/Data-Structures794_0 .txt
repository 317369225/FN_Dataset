Are Codechef's Long questions really helpful to to improve data structures and algorithms?Or should I better solve topicwise ds and algo problems of hackerearth,hackerrank etc?Thanks for the A2A. It depends! Do you find them challenging? Do you learn something when you solve those problems? If you do, then Codechef’s Long Questions are, by definition, very helpful. I hopped around online judges for a while until I realized that I learned the most when I solved problems on uVa. There isn’t any time constraints, so I feel relaxed and I can think freely about the solution. Topcoder is good, but I didn’t like the time pressure that I felt. Codeforces is okay, but I liked the “classical” problems (e.g. 8 Queens, Coin Denomination) problems I found on uVa. USACO Training Pages were too hard for me when I just started, but I recommend them to anyone who has some solid footing in competitive programming already. Codechef’s Long Questions can either be really helpful or not helpful at all. It depends on how much you get out of those problems. 77 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
