Which data structures should I at least know in general?I studied arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees (Search, AVL, splay and B-), hash tables, heaps and a few types of sorting. I heard of other structures such as leftist and skew heaps, red-black trees, disjoint sets and mroe. Is it essential to learn all data structures in general?Knowing data structures doesn't do you any good if you can't apply them. But data structures drive algorithms as the saying goes so imho learning about algorithms should be your goal if you want to know about data structures. There are very good books out there that explain in detail how algorithms rely on data structures. Your choice on reading material should maybe include your favourite prpgramming language. What I find most intriguing about data structures is when you start to take a basic structure like a tree and augment it. You could have complex objects as nodes in the tree, that are some other structure, say a doubly linked list of other objects. The nodes might represent clusters of your data, each cluster being a linked list of it''s members. As others have stated there are several data structures that one might consider to be familiar with. When it comes to applications most times the right question is "what data structure best supports the algorithms I aim to process my data with?". 41 Views
