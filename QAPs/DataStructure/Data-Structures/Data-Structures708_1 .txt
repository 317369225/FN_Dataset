How can I solve this problem?​Let's let S=∑∑ 1≤i≤j<n a i ⋅a j   S=∑∑1≤i≤j<nai⋅aj . There are a few problems with doing this summation; one obvious, one subtle, and one tempting. The obvious problem: the sum takes places over i≤j  i≤j . That will make it difficult to split the double summation into independent indices ∑ i ∑ j   ∑i∑j , which would be nicer. The subtle problem, so subtle it might appear like a typo. j<n  j<n . We'd be much happier if that sum included n  n , I'm sure. The tempting solution would be to see what happens for a specific value of n  n . If n=1  n=1 , the sum is degenerate and equal to zero... but that doesn't fit any of the options we're given - simply because it's not possible to choose 1  1 vector satisfying the constraints. For n=2  n=2 , the sum is just a 1 ⋅a 1 =1  a1⋅a1=1 , and at this point it certainly seems n/2  n/2 is the only answer that would work. Congratulations, this is a multiple choice question; circle this as the correct answer, then move on. Still here? Let's fix those two problems and see how we do. How would we make j≤n  j≤n in the sum? We would have to add terms 1≤i≤j=n  1≤i≤j=n to the sum. But ∑∑ 1≤i≤j=n a i ⋅a j =∑ 1≤i≤n a i ⋅a n =(∑ 1≤i≤n a i )⋅a n =0  ∑∑1≤i≤j=nai⋅aj=∑1≤i≤nai⋅an=(∑1≤i≤nai)⋅an=0 . In other words, we can extend the summation to include j=n  j=n , and the value doesn't change. From now on then, we may as well have S=∑∑ 1≤i≤j≤n a i ⋅a j   S=∑∑1≤i≤j≤nai⋅aj . What about that second problem, that i≤j  i≤j ? Well, we can make that issue vanish, too. Simply change the index variables, then S=∑∑ 1≤j≤i<n a j ⋅a i =∑∑ 1≤j≤i≤n a i ⋅a j   S=∑∑1≤j≤i<naj⋅ai=∑∑1≤j≤i≤nai⋅aj . Should we just add these two expressions together, then we'll cover all the combinations of a i   ai and a j   aj . However, we'll cover the ones where i=j  i=j twice, so we'd better make sure we count those the right number of times. Therefore 2S=∑ 1≤i≤n ∑ 1≤j≤n a i ⋅a j +∑ 1≤k≤n a k   2S=∑1≤i≤n∑1≤j≤nai⋅aj+∑1≤k≤nak . From here it's very easy to take the a i   ai out of the inner sum of the first term, and get zero, while the second term gives us n  n , and so S=n/2  S=n/2 - just as our multiple-choice guessing strategy suggested. 817 Views · View Upvotes
