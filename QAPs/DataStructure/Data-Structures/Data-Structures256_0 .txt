What's a good way to build a phone based login system with node?It needs to have persistent session details as well. I would normally use passport since it can handle sessions, however, I’m not sure how I would do so with a phone number.There are several good options out there. The newest is Account Kit by Facebook. I haven’t tried it yet but I’ve heard good things. Another excellent option is Two-factor Authentication by Twilio which I have tried and can say that it is great to work with. Finally there is Digits available through Fabric/Twitter. Good luck! 972 Views · View Upvotes
