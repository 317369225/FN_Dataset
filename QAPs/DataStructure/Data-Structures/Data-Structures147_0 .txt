How does node fs.watch work?Is there a loop that constantly checks all files over and over? Or does it listen to HD events from the operation system? In other words: Is it possible to watch changes in all file systems (C:\) without eating all the CPU & HD in Node.JS?With fs.watch, fs.watch, there's no loop polling for changes. Note that each operating system has its own event notification system that gets triggered when a file changes (among other events). At a high level, Mac uses FSEvents, Linux uses inotify, Windows uses FileSystemWatcher fs.watch fs.watch piggybacks onto these respective technologies, essentially using the native API. Specifically, it'll make use of kqueue (Mac), inotify (Linux), or ReadDirectoryChangesW (Windows) 195 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Aminadav Glickshtein
