Is it required that a person pursuing data analytics/data science/machine learning have a good knowledge of data structures? If yes, why?It depends on what problem you are looking to solve . If you are an analyst / data scientist and looking to get predictive model up and running , you just need a dataset and an Ml algorithm handy to solve your problem . If you have free time and looking to write a machine learning package which has one or several algorithms implemented , then knowledge of data structures is useful. All in all you can use pre existing packages as a tool to solve your analytical problems and no knowledge of D.S. is required as such . Hope it helps . 218 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sanil Ahuja
