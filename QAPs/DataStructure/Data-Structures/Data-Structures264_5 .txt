Do I need to be able to implement all data structures natively without libraries before starting competitive programming?I currently understand the theoretical aspects of most data structures, but I want to know if its required if me to be able to implement them natively or just learn how to use them before starting. And if I might be asked at job interviews to write them from scratchOriginally Answered: Should i learn all basic data structures and algorithms before starting competitive programming or do them parallelly?You should have basic knowledge like what are stacks, queues etc. then you can start programming and with the questions you will know what other things you need to learn and you can learn them. 120 Views  View Upvotes
