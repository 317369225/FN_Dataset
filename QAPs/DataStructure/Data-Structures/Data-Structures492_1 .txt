Is it worth paying $3,000 more just to take a Data Structures and Algorithms course?What kind of college course costs $3,000? Jeesh all these fancy fucking schools… Just go to Coursera or MIT Open Courseware. I think the Stanford Algorithms Part 1 and 2 are free, but there’s probably another one you can do to get a certificate or something in exchange from $80-$400 or something like that depending on the size. You said in the description that it won't count towards your degree, so it doesn't matter where it comes from, and the sources I recommended should have the same quality as a college class if you stick to them. 8.3k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
