Is there a data structure to find which data contain a certain string?in mysql there’s a query like: SELECT something WHERE myField LIKE “%myString%”; is it possible to filter the data without a full search on each data?If we talk about exact solution, any suffix structure will do the job: suffix tree, suffix automata, suffix array. You concatenate all of your data together, build a suffix tree/automata on it, and now you have a data structure which contains all suffixes of your data in compact manner allowing you to find suffix(es) which start with a specific substring (i.e. specific substring(s) of your data). 192 Views  View Upvotes
