Is data structure and algorithm different for different languages?Generally speaking, data structures and algorithms at a high level will be the same across all programming languages, although implementation will be slightly different between languages. For example, in C you may use pointers to node structs in order to implement a singly linked list and have to understand how dereferencing works in order to make it work. But, in Java, you would simply have to work with a Node private inner class inside of a SinglyLinkedList primary class. The importance of data structures and algorithms isn't to be able to only successfully implement one â€” the high level understanding of how the algorithm works is often more useful for interviews and your development as a computer scientist. I have found that learning and teaching data structures and algorithms is most efficient in Java since you obtain the high level context of the problem while foregoing the slightly more tedious implementation in C. 169 Views
