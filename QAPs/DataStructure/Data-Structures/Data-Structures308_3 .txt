Is it necessary to learn algorithm and datastructures when applying for a job as an application developer?The job I’m interested in require these knowledge: web technolgy (HTML, CSS, JS) Docker, AWS Java I want to take courses about Algo and DS on MIT OCW. Do I need knowledge about Algos and DS for the kind of job I’m interested in? Otherwise I could save myself time and learn more hands on skills.I went on being an application developer for years without knowing algorithms and data structures. Strange enough, when I picked up the Cracking the Coding Interview book, I realized somehow I already know the basics of these. If you stay curious, you probably will end up learning those as you work on real life problems. 37 Views
