Should l learn existing algorithms or try to reinvent them by myself?‘Reinvent’ wouldn’t be the word I’ll use. A better word would probably just be ‘try’. Try your level best to find a solution and then improvise/optimize your algorithm. When you are satisfied by your algorithm, compare it with an existing solution (if one exists). This will help you in many ways, like: You’ll develop/improve your problem solving ability. You’ll learn to think out of the box. Studying an existing algorithm would limit you by not allowing you to think by any other logic (This is not a hypothesis, but a fact). And, you never know; maybe the best solution is yet to be discovered :) So keep trying… Hope this helps. 133 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Sourabh Khandelwal
