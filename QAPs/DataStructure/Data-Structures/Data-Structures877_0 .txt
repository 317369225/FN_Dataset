Does C++ learn to program 9/e, by Deitel teach me anything about algorithms and/or data structures?Just bought the book and I am a newbie so I don’t quite know if it is typical for programming books to teach those (even at a basic level) or not, so does this book has algorithms and/or data structures taught in it or is it pure C++?The Deitel & Deitel books are great. The examples they have actually work. In addition they explain every line of code so that you know what that line is supposed to do. It isn’t easy to learn C++ because there are concepts such as OOP that need to be explained. Trying to learn them from a book is possible but not easy. It’s not as simple as just learning the language. 98 Views
