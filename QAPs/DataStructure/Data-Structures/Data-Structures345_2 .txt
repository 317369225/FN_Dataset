Does software engineering require the usage of dynamic data structures and pointers?Is dynamic data structures (e.g linked lists, binary trees) commonly used in software engineering? Also are pointer variables (like in C) used in software engineering as well?Yes, both the things you mention are very commonly used in software development. Pointers in C are pretty much the standard way to pass around information between functions. Data structures like linked lists are very commonly used too. Linked lists are handy to use sometimes rather than plain arrays because you can put something right in the middle of them without reallocating your whole array. If you’ve got an array of say, 10MB of data, if you want to put something in the middle of it, you’ve got to reallocate the array to the new size, move the latter 5MB over by a bit and insert your new data, that’s really an expensive operation. In a linked list, you just sort of unlink the chain the middle, and put your new item in there, between the two links in the chain. Linked lists make a lot of sense in a lot of circumstances, and pointers are just sort of the lifeblood of C, it’s hard to imagine writing much *without* pointers, unless you’re on an embedded system which lacks dynamic memory allocation maybe. 1k Views · View Upvotes
