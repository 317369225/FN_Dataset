What is the difference between keys and values in binary search trees in Java?If you're familiar with databases and the records within them, you will know that a key is used to uniquely identify a field within a record that contains other data. The case of keys and values within an entry in a tree is very similair. The key is used as the identifying property to order the entries appropriately as they are inserted within the tree so that a search in the binary tree can be achieved efficiently. They are usually integers but can also be custom data types and can still be compared to each other using transitive/asymmetric properties. The value can be any kind of data type, it could store a string which can be the text of a page of a book or a boolean value to be used in a finite state machine. A binary search tree is usually used to half the time taken to perform a search. Another application of keys and values are a priority queue where the keys are the priority level to be given to each entry and the value, the data to be processed. In a regular tree, the keys can be the page numbers and values the text of the pages. When you search for a page number, it can easily pull up the correct text. When you need to print this book, a pre-order traversal will visit all the parent nodes and print the text in the correct order. 223 Views  View Upvotes
