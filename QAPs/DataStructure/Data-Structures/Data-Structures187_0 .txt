What should I know as a computer science student?I am a freshman and aim at getting into Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Capegemini, TCS, Infosys, etc. However I don't know what all knowledge should I have to pass rounds I have a clear understanding of c++ and java. I am in a 3rd tier college. So have to apply off- campus. Provide a guideline. Thanks.As you mentioned, you have a clear understanding of c++ and java (object oriented programming languages). That’s good!! I am a B.tech CSE graduate student so I want to tell you some notes as my personal experience. First Thing: your aim is to get into big MNC’s so firstly you have to manage your percentage with 70% till 4th year. Second Thing: there are lots of code competition running online. Like Codechef - Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming HackerRank HackerEarth - Programming challenges and Developer jobs Big MNC’s hire developers or programmers through these sites. you can join these sites and improve your skills. Third Thing: to get success in above challenges, with c++ and java, you also have to learn data structures (will come in your 3rd or 4th sem.). Data Structure- The Most important thing to be learnt to get placed in Google , Microsoft like companies. Fourth Thing: with coding skills, you also have to work on your analytical and logical reasoning skills. Because these skills are also necessary to clear starting rounds. P.S. - my first answer on Quora. All the best for your future!! 1.5k Views · View Upvotes
