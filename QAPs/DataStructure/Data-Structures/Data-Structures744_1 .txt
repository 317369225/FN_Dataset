Can a Electronics Engineer get a job as a Software Developer if he knows C/C++, Java, Algorithms and Data Structures?Of course you can easily get the job. Even most of the computer science engineers are not aware of most of the algorithms. If you are good at programming, you will get a job easily. Just work hard, grab the opportunity.
