How does database indexing query the data efficiently?The same way that an index in a book helps. Imagine your manager comes to you and asks you to find every instance of the topic “Indexing” in a book. You can scan page by page. Or, go to the back and look in the index and find that the word “Indexing” appears on pages 16, 25, 149, 201, 467 and 534. Bam, now you know what pages to look on and that there’s only 7 pages out of 588 pages that contain the word. Which operation do you think will be faster? The book (table) scan, or the index lookup? Now obviously at SOME point a scan has to be done to find all those occurrences, but once done, all subsequent lookups will be faster. 159 Views · View Upvotes
