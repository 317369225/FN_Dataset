Given an array of integers find maximum pairwise product ie. ai*aj (iâ‰ j) but ai=aj is possible. What is wrong in the following solution?Answer is present in your question itself. Sometimes a[i] = a[j] where i != j. In your program you are not considering this situation. Instead of storing the value of a[i] as max1 store its index. That is maxindex = i, it will solve your problem. It will never go to last if condition. You always find a max2 value that less than max1 even if two max1 presents. 94 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
