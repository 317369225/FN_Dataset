Is it worth paying $3,000 more just to take a Data Structures and Algorithms course?Okay, here’s a free alternative, http://nptel.ac.in/courses/10610.... The videos are great, you can learn at your own pace and it’s one of the best. I would definitely not suggest spending $3000 on something that is practically free. As for the second part of your question, Will mentioning an Algorithms course on my resume make a huge impact? No. There are millions of people out there who have taken an algorithms course in college. That wouldn’t set you apart even a bit. What sets you apart is you doing something. Only you can figure out what that is. 57 Views · View Upvotes
