What is the best sorting technique in data structures?In general, the technique having less average case complexity is considered to be better. So out of the popular techniques used, Merge Sort - GeeksQuiz is considered to be better because itsâ€™s performance is O(nlogn) even in the worst case. But depending on the structure the data is stored and the type of data, there could be some other algorithm performing better(e.g. Tree sort ). Quicksort is also a very good technique which is based on the pivot selection and partioning of the dataset which performs in O(log n) in average case. But in the worst case, it has performance of O(n^2). Some other good sorting algorithms are : Heap Sort - GeeksQuiz ShellSort - GeeksQuiz Radix Sort - GeeksforGeeks Counting Sort - GeeksforGeeks. A comparison is provided at http://www.ijcset.com/docs/IJCSE... In the modern evolving world, there are various algorithms being developed by the researchers in the field. To get a better understanding, I would recommend Data Structures With C (Sie) (Sos) by Seymour Lipschutz. If even more understanding is required about the performance evaluation of various algorithms, Introduction to Algorithms is suggested which is the most widely studied book in the domain and is usually referred to as The Bible to the algorithms domain. 130 Views
