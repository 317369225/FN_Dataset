If I read the entire CLRS Introduction to Algorithms book and implement all the exercises in it, how much better will I get at Computer programming?I asked one of my lecturers and he said that it will help a lot if you can actually retain most of it to a decent level. Implementing data structures and algorithms are a massive part of programming, doing them will recalibrate the way you program entirely and completely unpollute your thought process and give you direction. It will probably take months to years to master but if you make a start and commit, you will start to become excellent programmer ! I intend to do the same but I'm waiting until 2017 in case the 4th edition comes out. Good luck and please let us know how it's going ! 393 Views  View Upvotes
