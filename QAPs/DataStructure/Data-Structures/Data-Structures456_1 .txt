How is set data structure implemented in C?[Step 1] To define a set, you need to define the Universal Set U. This can usually be implemented as an array of X where X is the datatype of the set members. [Step 2] Next, every set can be defined by identifying which elements belong to the set and which do not. For this, we need an array of boolean values OR an array of int values in a simple implementation. [Alternative] If the number of elements in the Universal Set U is small and less than the number of bits in some unsigned integer type of your C compiler, say 40 or 64 etc, we can use a bitmapped representation for the sets (here a single integer variable will represent an entire set!). A bit value of 0 representing “element not in set” and 1 representing “element belongs to set”. When we can do this, we get a highly efficient representation where we can perform “set operations” using the “bitwise operators” of C. For example, a set union is simple a bitwise OR. 203 Views · View Upvotes
