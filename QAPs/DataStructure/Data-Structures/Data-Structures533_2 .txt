Which is the best book for data structure (DS) which is very easy to understand for beginners?If you want the algorithms to be implemented specifically in Java then there is Mitchell Waite's Series book "Data Structures & Algorithms in Java". It starts from basic data structures like linked lists, stacks and queues, and the basic algorithms for sorting and searching. Working your way through it you will eventually get to Tree data structures, Red-Black trees, 2-3 trees and Graphs. All-in-all its not an extremely theoretical book, but if you just want an introduction in a language you are familiar with then its a good book. At the end of the day, if you want a deeper understanding of algorithms you're going to have to learn some of the more theoretical concepts, and read one of the classics, like Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest/Stein's Introduction to Algorithms. 48 Views  Answer requested by Shubham Biswas
