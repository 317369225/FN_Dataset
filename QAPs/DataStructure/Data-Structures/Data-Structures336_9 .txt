A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?The correct answer to this question depends on where you are in your education. If you are a freshman, this is fine advice. But if you don’t learn at least 3 languages by graduation, you’ve missed a pretty core bit of education. Learning multiple languages is (IMO) essential to understanding the relationship between software and hardware (i’ve seen literally zero cases in my career of someone who really gets that while knowing a single programming language). 126 Views · View Upvotes
