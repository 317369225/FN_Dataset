I'm 16 years old and know Java, PHP, JS, Python and Ruby. I know almost nothing about data structures and algorithms. Where should I start?Well if CS engineering is what you want to do then I would suggest you learn Data structures and Algorithms and start doing competitive coding. You can just go to www.geeksforgeeks.org to learn the basics of data structures like sorting, linked lists, trees etc.. Then I would suggest you log onto some competitive coding website and start coding in whatever language you prefer. These challenges are stacked up from very easy to very hard questions and they also provide you with a bit of knowledge about whatever logic you are supposed to use to solve these questions. I m telling you this as IT engineer, if you get good really good with Algorithms and are participate in these challenges it'll help you a long way in college Some competitive coding websites are - www.codechef.com www.hackerrank.comHope this helps!! 158 Views  View Upvotes
