What are the preconditions of binary search and what role do they carry out?The prime precondition is that the data in the structure, whether it be a tree (binary, red-black, Kd, etc) or an array, is that the data is ordered. So that if you have a search space, and you look in the middle of it, and find say that what you look for is bigger than the value where you are looking, then you can completely ignore everything to the left and shrink your search space in half. This means each iteration of the search you cut your space in half and you either find your result or the search terminates in failure in, worst case, time proportional to the log of the size of the data set. If the data is not so sorted, you have to go through, worst case, the whole set to find what you want or see it's not there. 320 Views  View Upvotes
