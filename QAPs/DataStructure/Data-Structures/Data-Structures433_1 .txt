Where is knowledge of data structures useful in Swift?I have been a Swift developer for less than a year now, but I have never came across a problem set that required knowledge of data structures. I occasionally read about it yet with no practical use case. Also people recommend this book which I haven’t read. Can anyone share examples of DS use case?Well, don’t you use sets or dictionaries in your Swift programs ? They are an implementation of some basic Data Structures in the Swift SDK, so you might be unknowing still using these basic data structures, but not directly. When you want to scale the application that you are working on, then you will need to use Algorithms and Data Structures. If you are not dealing with scale in the application you are working on, then you will never feel the need to optimize your code and hence will never need to learn or use Data Structures. For eg, say if you are having data like say, social network connections. So, to be able to quickly look up friends for a user account you will need to organize your social network users data in such way where this kind of operation is not very time consuming. So, if you organize your social network say in a Graph, which is a specialization of the Tree Data Structure, then the operation of searching of all the friends of friends for say Mr X on the social network will not be as time consuming as searching for the same, inside a flat sequence of user data. 78 Views · View Upvotes
