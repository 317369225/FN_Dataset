What are some of the data structures and algorithms I must know as beginner C# developer?Basically what I mean to say is that, what are some of the data structures and algorithms that will help me in my programming career.I have the feeling that the question is formulated in the wrong way. No doubt, the usefulness of specific data structures and algorithms might vary with the programming language you are using, but I have the feeling you are more interested in basic data structures and algorithms and obtaining a solid basis for your development career. In that case I would recommend the book Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein. Algorithms are always deeply linked to data structures and apart from that the book contains a whole part called “data structures”. 243 Views · View Upvotes
