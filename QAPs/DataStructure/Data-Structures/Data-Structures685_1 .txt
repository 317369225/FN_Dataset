How does Pokmon GO correlate image processing and GPS data in algorithm?If there is any real-time processes, does pokemongo collect any gps or image data to use in next versions ?I have only played the game 2–3 times so I do not know the entire game story as such but based on what I have observed I believe this could be the algorithm on a very high level: Initial Data Setup: Create different Pokemon classes with attributes like type, evolution hierarchy, default CP, max CP etc, image, sound etc Create a list of geolocations based on the type Eg: waterbody, park, mall etc and associate a point based system on how famous that place is possibly which may later become PokeStops. In a table or collection, load various instances of these Pokemons into different geolocation area type along with the direction which will be used to overlay the pokemon in the camera. Eg: Water Type Pokemons near water body, several differnt kind of pokemons in Pokestops. GamePlay: Game Init: Get user's geocoordinates and add an event to it to constantly trigger the associated actions if geolocation changes Based on nearest neighbour algorithm, query the table/ collection and get the geolocations along with the associated objected containing the pokemons, pokestops and gyms etc. if a Pokemon is found in the same geocoordinate with some minor offset value determined by the accuracy received by the user’s current geolocation get the attributes of the pokemon(s) along with the direction stored in the server get the direction of user's phone if the direction of found pokemon is within the bounds of direction of the phone +/- some predetermined offset value construct the pokemon on the phone by overlaying its image with the pokemon's default animation in the camera view. Based on the distance of the pokemon's geocoordinate with the user's coordinate, set the image scale of the pokemon to give a sense of near/ far. Pokeball: Determine the user's touch velocity, gesture end time and the direction and based on some more in built factors, calculate if the pokeball hit or miss the pokemon. 466 Views · View Upvotes
