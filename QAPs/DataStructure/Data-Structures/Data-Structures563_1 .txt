What skills in terms of programming, data structures and algorithms should you have before you can hope to solve coding interview questions?I’m having difficulties solving coding interview questions, problems on topcoder and problems classified as “easy” on codechef. What am I missing? What books should I study and can I hope to land a job in a good tech company in the next 3 years (I am a cs graduate)?There are no additional skills you require to solve coding questions. What you do need is finesse. What I’ve learned is that we tend to run after major concepts in programming, while we ignore the most basic things, like operations on pointer to pointer, etc. The other thing you require is good logic skills. Your programming may be horrible, but if you can explain the logic behind it, there are chances you still might land a good job. Interview coding questions are nothing but complex operations combined with algorithms to obtain a certain goal. So what you are missing is not additional skills, but instead a good solid base. And without that, your whole building is crumbling. 298 Views · View Upvotes
