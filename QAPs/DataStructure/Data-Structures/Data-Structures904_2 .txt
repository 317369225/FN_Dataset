Is there a theory of data structures?When learning data structures, most topics seem very specific, independent and unique. Are there any efforts to create a general theory, a framework for thinking about data structures?The various data structures that exist are blueprints used to solve individual problems. There are many ways to implement each blueprint dependant on the type of problem. These methods vary the computational time and space used while the data structure operates in mostly the same manner. You could use the same blueprint used to construct a multi-floor hospital to build a veterinary clinic but not to build a house or clothing store. With that in mind, you could use an array or linked-list (nodes) to implement a binary search tree or hash table but not a graph. 291 Views  View Upvotes
