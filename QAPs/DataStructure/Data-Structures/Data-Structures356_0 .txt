You are given an array of infinite length containing zeros followed by ones. How fast can you locate the first one in the array?Traverse the array at 2X speed. The moment you get a 1, check if the element at previous index was 1. Return appropriate index Let me know if you have a better approach… Edit: Keep on generating a random index, if the value at index is a 1, search for the 1 in range arr(0 to index-1). Use a 2X counter now :) 36 Views · View Upvotes
