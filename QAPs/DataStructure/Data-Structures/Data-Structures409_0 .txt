What are some simple programs that explicitly use different data structures?There are lots of examples where arrays and linked lists or trees are used in the same program. A couple of examples: Hashing can use a “bucket” array where each element is a pointer to a linked list of data whose keys hash to the same value. A tree may have nodes that use an array or linked list of pointers to their child nodes. The latter case allows a variable number of children for each node. 65 Views
