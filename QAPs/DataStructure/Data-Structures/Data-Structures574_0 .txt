What are some of the algorithms/data structures that software engineers use at work? How often do they use them?Well, arrays are among the most important when data is small. Linked lists are used when data magnitude is unknown and datatype not specified. For bigger data applications databases are used, but they aren’t actually data structures and certain libraries need to be imported before they can be accessed from a program. Now these data structures have certain formats of access and usage, like LIFO(stack) and FIFO(queue). 93 Views · View Upvotes
