If you have a pretty intense day job, how do you find time to improve the data structure and algorithms skill?I worked two jobs last summer. During the day, I interned and remember doing a mild amount of DSP, Matlab programming, and data-collection. After work (9–5), around 6 pm, I’d drive to work in retail at a big-box-store (in the ‘lumber’ department) until 10 pm, drove home by 11 pm and my day was pretty much over. Retail doesn’t pay much but I like the extra income and it was refreshing to step away from the technical stuff. Unfortunately, being on the sales floor doesn’t give you many opportunities to hop on a CPU. So I did the best thing I could — just go over stuff I’d learn in algorithms that I had read that day. I remember trying to sort and organize lumber using radix sort except instead of digit-position and numerical comparison, I compared knots and sort them by where they were on a 2x4. I’d also think about how I’d implement solutions to problems I had either memorized or jotted down on my phone. There were some tasks which required me to suspend my thoughts (driving a forklift, for instance, where you had to be vigilant) but for those moments where it was ok to go on ‘autopilot’, I felt like I spent most of it doing stuff I would have otherwise done at a desk in front of a CPU. The moral of the story is:   Work the ‘exercise’ part of algorithms into your day-job. Learn a new concept or pick an interesting problem when you can sit down and set aside time to study. Then, at your job - when it’s safe to do so - either go over the concept as a ‘recall’ exercise, play with it (as I did with the 2x4’s), or break the problem down (if it’s a particularly difficult problem or multi-step) and try to solve it in your head while you work. Be safe. Have fun. 777 Views · View Upvotes
