What are the real life applications of graph data structure?Few important real life applications of graph data structures are: Facebook: Each user is represented as a vertex and two people are friends when there is an edge between two vertices. Similarly friend suggestion also uses graph theory concept. Google Maps: Various locations are represented as vertices and the roads are represented as edges and graph theory is used to find shortest path between two nodes. Recommendations on e-commerce websites: The “Recommendations for you” section on various e-commerce websites uses graph theory to recommend items of similar type to user’s choice. Graph theory is also used to study molecules in chemistry and physics. 84 Views · View Upvotes
