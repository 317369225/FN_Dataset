What is the difference between node* next & node *next?I am working on linked list and I got stuck with this ……If there is a difference between the two could someone just explain it to me.(if possible diagrammatically to understand in a better way.)None. It’s just a programmer’s style of writing, either node* next or node *next. Technically speaking, node* next is appropriate as the asterisk should denote that it is a pointer of type node, the reason it should be with node and not with next. 179 Views · View Upvotes
