What language is best for the Google interview based on built-in methods and data structures that do the work for me?Python has alot of methods I like but Java has LinkedList built in, etc. Please explain why.I used to wonder the same thing. Like, Python has such support for list manipulation, it can more or less trivialize a lot of toy programming problems with its use. However, leaving aside the fact that this leaves it open for the interviewer to give you harder problems, if you use built-in features of a language to trivializes the problem, he/she can use the magic words that'll destroy you if you rely too much on them: "Okay, implement that feature in your own way." For example, I was working on a problem and I said, "I know this language has a method that lets me do this, but I forget what it is." The interviewer told me to go ahead and assume it's there and use it. After the problem was solved he said, "Now go back and implement that method you forgot." 281 Views
