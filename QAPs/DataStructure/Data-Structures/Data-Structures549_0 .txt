What are the best and easy to read books for algorithms and data structure?In JavaI edited this short, free book on algorithms and data structures, designed to be as approachable as possible for beginners. It is an adaptation of an already great algorithms book, with some clearer examples in idiomatic Python. After that I would recommend Skiena’s Algorithm Design Manual which has a more practical focus than the typically recommended algorithms intro books. 250 Views · View Upvotes
