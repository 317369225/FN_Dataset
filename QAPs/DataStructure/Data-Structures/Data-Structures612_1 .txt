How do I create a program that generates sudoku puzzles in Java?I am struggling with this question and would really appreciate it if someone could give insight into the problem.Here is one way (a really inefficient one though): Generate every valid 3 cells by 3 cells grids (brute force it by trying every possibilities, testing each time if it is a valid one). You might want to store these grids in a file to reuse them. Likewise, generate every valid 3 grids by 3 grids, testing if it's a valid sudoku completed grid. This program could run for a long time, so make sure you can save your partial results somewhere when you find a valid one. Take a sudoku grid and randomly remove numbers in it. You will want to tweak the randomness on this. (Optional) Create a solver to make sure your generated sudoku can be solved. You can tweak your solver to also output how hard the sudoku is.I'm pretty sure there is a better way, but my first attempt would look like this. EDIT ------ You could optimize step one by generating every permutations of numbers from 1 to 9 instead of trying a brute force technique. 801 Views
