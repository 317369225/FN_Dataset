Will data structures and algorithms be needed for Analog or EDA design engineers?EDA requires programming knowledge , but at what level depends on the following cases: Tool Design and Development : If you want to be part Tool design, then you should have exceptional computer concepts/programming skills (equivalent to a CSE student) along with VLSI knowledge. Since this is the heart of the Tool design, one should know how to write a precise,compact yet powerful algorithm to increase throughput with low design cost. That means you must think like a top notch programmer.Synopsys,Cadence & Mentor Graphics etc.. are the companies whose primary focus is in this area Tool Automation or Support : Once you have right tools to do the task, there comes for defining methodology/flow to use these tools. These teams create flows that make use of the tools to do the required job. Vlsi automation engineers need to be expert in Perl, Tcl and specific tool usage of the interest. Every VLSI company has the engineers of this second category (including EDA companies) 147 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
