Are there good and high paying programmers who never implemented data structures in C?I am finding reasons to make a living without learning C and that too in the long run I want to jump into product management. Does C become inevitable to progress through this track? I have to learn programming though. I am asking it in view of getting through the interview for the likes of Amazon.Basically, C is not the only one language for writing programs. There are really a lot of them. You may well be a product manager - a good one - without practical programming knowledge. Of course, you should be familiar with programming at least enough to tell possible requirements apart from impossible requirement! In fact, creating a product is like F###ing to have babies. It’s quick, it’s fun, it’s rewarding. Pitching it in market and managing it through long times and selling it successfully is like raising that kid. It’s painful, It’s slow. But it’s even more rewarding. Both tasks are two different things. If you want, however, to write ANY real-life scale program, data structures are inevitable. In fact, there’s an entire book - and a very famous one in late 70’s - called Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs !! I guess that sums it all up :) 194 Views · View Upvotes
