What is the interview process of Infosys InStep Internship for someone who knows Data Structures?I have been placed in a reputed company, but I still have 8 months to join. I’m interested in iOS and Android dev, although I haven’t built any app. What can I then be asked in the interview?First of all this would be a wrong decision if you know the DS well and going to join company like Infosys, TCS, Accenture and Wipro etc. Just try to find something in small startup type of organization where you will learn “how to design, develop and deploy and many more things”. 83 Views · View Upvotes
