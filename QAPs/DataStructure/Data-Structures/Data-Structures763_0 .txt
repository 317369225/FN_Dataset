What is the difference between keys and values in binary search trees in Java?Often, a binary search tree has only keys. You can look a key up to see if it is present in the tree, and you can change the tree by adding or removing keys. The values come in when it’s convenient to store some additional data with each key. They are not used in any of the tree algorithms, but when a new key is stored in the tree, so is the associated value. The result is that the tree does not represent a set of distinct keys anymore, but a map from keys to values: if you have a key, you can look it up in the tree to find out not only if it is present in the tree, but also, what the associated value is. 134 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
