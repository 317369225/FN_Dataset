Why do some programmers ignore algorithmic efficiency and rather focus on just making a program work?I am an Aerospace Engineer and I enjoy coding. To me, one of the most important part of an efficient program is an Algorithm but then I met developers who have no clue about time complexity or space complexity. I am just curious as to why algorithmic efficiency is ignored when it’s so important?As a programmer, your job is to create value for the business that employs you. Sometimes when you’re working with really big datasets or hard computation deadlines, that involves selecting an efficient algorithm and very carefully implementing it so that it runs as quickly as possible. Other times, when you’re trying to get a feature out quickly or working on something that’s limited by the network or human interaction, having something that works now is much more valuable than having a more efficient solution later. Most programmers tend to operate in that second world most of the time. The jobs that involve big data and real time computations are actually pretty few and far between. For pretty obvious reasons, that tends not to be mentioned so much by people trying to sell candidates on jobs. 162 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Surajit Das
