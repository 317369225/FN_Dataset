What's the best way to teach "Algorithms and data structures"?Next year I will be teaching course named “Algorithms and data structures” for two groups of students in my university. I was given the possibility to change the way this course is taught.Sir, I have no tips on what you should do. But I’ll just share the things I wouldn't want in a particular teacher. If he writes code on the board and expects us the note it down in our notebooks, and later memorise it, without ever needing to thoroughly understand it. The one who doesn't provide deep insight into the algorithms, how and why they are used, and how to recognise where they must be applied to real world problems. Not allowing laptops in class. At least those interested could code as they go along. Sure some would just play games, but hey, those won't listen in the class anyway. No versatility on students’ code. Sometimes a teacher might not make enough effort to see what a particular student is trying to do. For example, on Quora, I read the story of a student who received 30/50 in his exams because he took the pivot in quick sort from the right side, instead of the left like it was by his teacher. Sad. Making the tests theoretical. Courses like data structures and algorithms shouldn't be all about the theory. And there shouldn't be questions exactly same as those that have been done in class. There should be an incentive for the students to think and apply their knowledge, not their memory skills. Almost no attention on the errors that a student could encounter, and how he should pinpoint and debug those errors. I personally feel that these points make a course less interesting for students who are genuinely interested in the course. While I cannot comprehend how much effort and time goes into being a teacher, I do feel that one could always keep these little things in mind. Although I have no clue about the practical limitations to these, if any. 1.8k Views · View Upvotes
