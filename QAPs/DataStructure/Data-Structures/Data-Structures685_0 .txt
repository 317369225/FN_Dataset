How does Pokmon GO correlate image processing and GPS data in algorithm?If there is any real-time processes, does pokemongo collect any gps or image data to use in next versions ?Mayand’s answer is quite good and covers the (possible) high level design of the app. In my opinion, the Computer Vision tools used are very basic. The only notable challenge I see, is that of pixel stick - the ability of the rendered Pokemon illusion to maintain it’s relative position. If you move your phone, rotate it, move it closer to the Pokemon, the rendered illusion’s position should remain stationary within the real world, with respect to your location. Picking a “patch” from the camera stream is easy, but estimating the camera’s pose is not. This paper describes a neat method to estimate a monocular camera’s pose on a near real time basis: http://www6.in.tum.de/Main/Publi... Note: I mention that picking the patch is easy, but tracking it is not. Low cost, robust and accurate algorithms have been developed for the exact same purpose. I believe the same algorithm has been implemented for Android phones. Here , I’m sure you’ll enjoy watching this video: http://kahlan.eps.surrey.ac.uk/f... Once the patch is fixed and the relative pose of the camera / camera motion (using Optic flow, Gyro information and Inertial information) is known, the relative shape / size of the rendered Pokemon can be changed (20 fps can be considered acceptable for a mobile AR app) to maintain an illusion of constancy. 447 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Burak Berber
