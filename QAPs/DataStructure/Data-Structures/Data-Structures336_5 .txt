A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?It really depends on what you want to achieve in the programing world or career, but for any new person to computer programing, learning c++, data structures n algorithms can be all u need. c++ is the best language for learning fundamental data structures (data-types), and algorithms really are very fundamental in the field of computers, programing, AI, ML, data science… etc! great field to specialize in! Ur professor is most definitely right! 466 Views · View Upvotes
