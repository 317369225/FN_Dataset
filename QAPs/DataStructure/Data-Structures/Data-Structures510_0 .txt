What is the error in my program that implements a Linked List with insertion and printing modules?Code in : soe8p - Ghostbin Also, I think it has to do with pointers. EDIT : Fixed the error. (line 23). I assigned a variable to another variable of different type. i.e; assigned pointer2pointer to pointerâ€¦ Can u explain why it printed 1,2,3 and garbage values even when using wrong assignment?There is a mistake in your insertLL function, for position=1 you were inserting at beginning make sure to write *(head) instead of (head) since you are passing pointer to head pointer . hope it helped you :) 34 Views  View Upvotes
