What is the difference between node* next & node *next?I am working on linked list and I got stuck with this ……If there is a difference between the two could someone just explain it to me.(if possible diagrammatically to understand in a better way.)There is no difference, but you should avoid node* next because of a bad catch in the language: node* next, prev; …creates one variable that is a node pointer (next) and one that is just node (prev). The star is not part of the type, it only affects the identifier after it. If instead you write: node *next, prev; …the bug is a little bit more obvious. It should have been: node *next, *prev; 676 Views · View Upvotes
