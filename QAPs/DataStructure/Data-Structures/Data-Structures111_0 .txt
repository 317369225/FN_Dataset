How do I get master in data structures and algorithms?Start reading the Books and implement each and every algorithm . Try to find real time implement/application of an Algorithm . Also you can try systematic approach i.e. start online courses like i am currently enrolled for Algorithm and Data structure online course. Different Data structure have different roles to play and can be used to implement real time problem . try to find that. Finally try to discuss on online forum , more you discuss , more you learn. 170 Views
