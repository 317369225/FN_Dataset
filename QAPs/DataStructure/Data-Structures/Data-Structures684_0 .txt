What are some problem statements which need to use a binary tree or a binary search tree in the solution?I am still a beginner, having solved a few problems on hackerearth etc. So far, I have not found even a single problem which needs a tree or a heap to solve. I would appreciate some nice tutorial videos.There are no problems that can only be solved with a binary tree or binary search tree. B Trees, hash tables, skip lists or any of a number of different types of data structures might be employed instead depending on the relative merits of the structure. Data structures like BSTs are best employed in situations where you have a lot of data stored in memory and want an efficient method of accessing individual elements. 223 Views  Answer requested by Arihant Bansal
