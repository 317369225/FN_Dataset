What data produces a SHA256 hash of all zero bits?I know only 1/(2^256) pieces of data can produce this value, but it would be interesting to see what does, if it has ever happened. Likewise, what interesting hex values have come out of SHA? anything like 0x314159â€¦ Pi?I don't think anyone tracks special numbers. What I would probably do is unroll the function. For each bit in each intermediate state, you want the Boolean function that represents it thus far. You'd have to start at the end and work forwards, though, as you'll run into steps where you need either the start value or the end value to continue. You only have the value at the very end. Now, there are an infinite number of start values that will produce all zeroes at the end and you're not guaranteed a start length that would include such a value. If you assume a 260-bit value, that's probably ok. So what you should end up with is a set of 256 260-variable equations where all those equations produce the same value and that value is zero, where aspects of those equations are only true because they all produce zeroes. Unless the hash is broken, nothing in any of those equations should be true for any other case. Because it's a lot of work that's only valid in a very special case at a specific length of input, it would take a solid enthusiast to work it out. The result would not be interesting enough to justify the work needed, for anyone else. If more than one all-zero solution exists, unrolling should hit points where something might be one way or another. There should only be 16 such cases, give or take three standard deviations, and you should be able to try each in turn until you find one that works. I'd suggest using automated tools, Coq or Isabelle might work. If it could be done by hand, cryptologists would have examined all zeroes and all ones for interesting pointers. I've never seen any such analysis. 116 Views
