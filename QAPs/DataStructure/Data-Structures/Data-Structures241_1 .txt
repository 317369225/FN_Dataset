What language is best for the Google interview based on built-in methods and data structures that do the work for me?Python has alot of methods I like but Java has LinkedList built in, etc. Please explain why.There is a lot of questions around this theme. If you look into Google’s career site you’ll see most of the time: Python, Java, C and C++ in the job descriptions section. If you are going to work with heavy numerical computations: C / C++ Normally Python has process applications for data structures better. However it is always fighting with R for leader role in data analysis (this role is most of the time played by R, however Python flexibility makes it a good fit in some cases). Always upvote answers that you find useful. Everyone can be wrong so be respectful and polite.Please endorse/recommend my Linked-in if you followed me. 399 Views · View Upvotes
