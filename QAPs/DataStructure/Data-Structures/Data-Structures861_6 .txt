Do I need to be able to implement all data structures natively without libraries before starting competitive programming?I currently understand the theoretical aspects of most data structures, but I want to know if its required if me to be able to implement them natively or just learn how to use them before starting. And if I might be asked at job interviews to write them from scratchThe more you understand, data structures and algorithms, more it will help for creative implementations. it is good to implement natively to be able to modify them if required. 64 Views  View Upvotes
