Do I need to be able to implement all data structures natively without libraries before starting competitive programming?I currently understand the theoretical aspects of most data structures, but I want to know if its required if me to be able to implement them natively or just learn how to use them before starting. And if I might be asked at job interviews to write them from scratchNo, definitely no! The vast majority of languages provide a standard library that will implement quite a few of them for you. In particular, I never implemented a balanced binary search tree of any type in my life. Implementing your own heap is sometimes useful, but most of the time using a priority queue will be good enough. What you probably should know how to implement at some point - but not not start, just to get good - are a) some sort of range tree, and b) a Find-Union structure (with path compression and merging towards the larger). But to start competitive programming, understanding them is definitely enough. 329 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Alaran Moshood and Ronald Munodawafa
