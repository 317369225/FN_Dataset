Why do we use a struct pointer inside a structure definition in C?Suppose consider linked list example. For linked list, we need head pointer and head pointer should know the next item in the list. The same applicable to remaining items in the list. Please find below the declaration of linkedlist struct linkedlist { int value; struct linkedlist* nextPointer; } The nextPointer is used to point to next item in the linked list. Hope you understand. 190 Views  View Upvotes
