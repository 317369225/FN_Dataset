What's a good way to build a phone based login system with node?It needs to have persistent session details as well. I would normally use passport since it can handle sessions, however, Iâ€™m not sure how I would do so with a phone number.Passport.js and Twilio (or any other sms provider). So you need registration verification creation In passport.js, it would be the the same as email login however the username and password passed from the client would be the mobile number and password. Passport.js authenticate leaves the implementation of checking the database for matches of the passed username and password. If there is a match (user registered then verified then created), login him in. The persistence part can be either the default in memory passport.session (it uses connect.sid in cookie), or you can use passport remember me strategy and create custom cookie key value which in server side can be persisted in database. 742 Views
