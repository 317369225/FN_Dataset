Why do we need an AVL tree in computer science?Normal Binary Search Tree ( non self balancing tree) : if I insert following array of elements into BST, 10 20 30 The Binary Search Tree will look like this , the complexity of finding 30 (worst case) is O(n). AVL Tree (self balancing tree) : if I insert following array of elements into AVL tree, 10 20 30 The AVL tree look like this (self balance based on left , right height difference) , In worst case also I can find a element in O(logn) because of self balancing property. Pros: Better running time for searching. Cons: Longer running time for insert and remove. Thanks. 221 Views  View Upvotes
