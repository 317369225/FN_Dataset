How do you convert a given binary tree to an undirected graph in C?To get the (minimum) spanning tree from a given graph, we can use e.g. Prim’s, Kruskal’s, or DFS algorithm. Is there an algorithm that creates a graph from a binary tree? For example, if binary tree is traversed in In-order, then how to create an undirected graph from it?All you have to do is traverse the tree (in any order) and, replace the parent-child links between nodes with links going in both directions. When visiting a node N, keep a reference to it's parent (the node you came from) P. Then, add N to P's list of neighbors, and add P to N's list of neighbors. You will end up with an undirected graph in which each node has at most 3 neighbors. That being said, the tree you started with is itself a minimum spanning tree of the undirected graph. I'm not sure why you're trying to convert it back to a graph in order to run Prim's algo on it. Posted on mobile. Please excuse the typos. 149 Views
