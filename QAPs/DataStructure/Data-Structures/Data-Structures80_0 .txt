How can a node that appears later in a traceroute program have a smaller delay than an earlier node?There can be many reasons (temporary congestions and the like), but -with all the variants- you can think that getting a response from a router is not the same than forward a packet. Routers that are designed to be efficient in forwarding high volume traffic - especially on emulated circuits, forwards packets by swapping labels, without the need to deconstruct / reconstruct packets. That makes them very fast in forwarding, but to send back an “answer” from itself the router has to make up the answer, and circuit for itself (as it is an host) towards the sender, and then send through it. All those operations take time. More peripheral routers, by converse, tend to work on physical links, without any need to emulate circuits. They can be slower in forward, but can answer without set up a low level circuit for it. In essence you are comparing these two graphs: A--R... A--R--R... | | | x | x A is the sender, the destination is supposed to be on the far right, R is the router switching engine, and X the process into the router, that have to respond to A when a TTL from A is exceeded. The back-path from X to A is not necessary longer in the second graph, that it is on the first. 75 Views · View Upvotes
