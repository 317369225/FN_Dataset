Are there quadtree implementations that are dimension agnostic?Whenever I’ve seen a quadtree example, it always uses 2 dimensions, x and y. Are there quadtree implementations that can work with an arbitrary number of dimensions (guessing by iterating over which axis to split on), and what are they called?Welcome to the world of spatial indexes! Quadtrees are generally used in 2d as you mention, I’ve seen some papers on the use of multidimensional Quadtrees but after a quick review those might be very specific cases. If you want a spatial index for “n” dimensions there are a lot of options. Kd-Trees are the most classical structure but in my humble experience Ball-Trees and VP-Trees perform better. So my recommendation would be to study Vantage-point tree. There’s a nice post about VP-Trees here: Similarity search 101 - Part 2 (search with vp-trees) Keep in mind that the “curse of dimensionality” affects spatial indexes, meaning those indexes usually work well if you only have a few dimensions but scale very badly to high dimensional spaces. At some point the spatial index will behave equal or worst than a brute force linear search, that point depends on your data and the spatial index you choose. Luis 258 Views · View Upvotes
