I am a 16 year old self taught programmer. What are the best books to go all the way from data structures, algorithms to complex programming topics?I am planning to go through this list, step by step down the list: Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou. Introduction to algorithms by CLSR The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie. any other books to clear off my concepts on data structures? And if so, where should I put it in the list?As you are a self taught programmer it means you are good in tackling the items and other coding logic with their mind set … normally people learn data structure and algorithm in “C”,because it is very easy and they are completely familiar with this programming language ,if you have some problem regarding “C” language then first i would like to suggest you LET US -C by Y . karnithkar further for algorithm i would like to suggest you Introduction to algorithm by -Thomas H. Cormen. before going through algorithm you should read discret math, Discrete Math, a textbook like Ken Rosen's Discrete Mathematics and its Applications. and for rest there are many video lectures by many of the reputed professor’s are available on YOUTUBE go there and watch them . i think it will surely help you… 86 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Saundarya Jain
