What is the best data structures and algorithms book for a beginner?The content should be simple and precise. It should have more examples with step-by-step explanations with diagrams. It should be easy to understand.Algorithms and O(n), O(log n) (which I'm not much familiar about) should be expained in an unambiguous manner so that I can implement it on my ownEasy book for you - Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structure and Algorithmic Puzzles: Narasimha Karumanchi: 9788192107547: Amazon.com: Books Please follow GeeksforGeeks | A computer science portal for geeks for any topic of DS or algo, if you find anything difficult in book. When I started with algorithms I followed geeksforgeeks, and after 2–3 Algorithms was introduced in college, then I started following CLRS too. It is a very essential book for algorithms. You can start with basic topics like : Analysis of Algorithms | Set 3 (Asymptotic Notations) - GeeksforGeeks Binary Search - GeeksQuiz Compute sum of digits in all numbers from 1 to n - GeeksforGeeks But I still suggest CLRS book. You don't need to read all the topics of it. 153 Views · View Upvotes
