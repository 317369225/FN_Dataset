How can I add nodes to a binary search tree using a text file?I implemented a dictionary using a binary search tree in java. I have to use a text file which is already contained word and the meaning of some words. I used buffered reader to read the file and it seems readLine() never become null. Any help would be appriciated. Thank youFirstly separate every node in your text file line by line( not necessary though). Read the file line by line. Consider the first line in your file as root node. And then similarly read the nodes line by line compare it with root node and add them to left or right accordingly. 57 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sandunika Hansinie Dissanayake
