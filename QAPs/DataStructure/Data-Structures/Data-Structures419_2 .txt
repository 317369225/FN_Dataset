How can I master coding in a year?Coding data structures algorithms etc.In short, you won’t master it in one year, unless you are already pretty darn close. You can learn a lot by spending 14+ hours a day learning and practising with a plan tailored for you, with access to good tutors. Other answers to this question can direct you to good resources. Maybe we have a different meaning of mastering, but to me it means that you are at least in the 99,9th percentile in the world. Most people who graduate the university after learning and practising programming for 3 long years are mere amateurs, unless they have comprehensive skills to start with. They ger junior job positions, since their performance is very limited. To expect to do it in 1 year is unrealistic. Just like you won’t be M.D specializing in brain surgery in 1 year without any previous medical training and knowledge. Don’t let this put you off. Invest the time and you will be a lot better in 1 year than you are today, but you won’t master it. 165 Views · View Upvotes
