Why do we need to learn data structures before learning algorithms?Since algorithms operate on data, which algorithms you employ will depend on how the data is structured. For instance, whether you pass by value or pass by reference will depend on the data structure and the amount of data in question. The performance/runtime differences may be minor or great, depending on the data structure. How your algorithm stores information is also a matter of data structures. A binary tree is typically represented via a doubly linked list data structure, which allows for traversal up and down the branches of the tree. If the information was stored in an array instead, then traversal and reference methods would also be different. 131 Views  View Upvotes
