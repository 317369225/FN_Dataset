What does temp->next->data refers to in linked list c programing?Linked list is a linear data structure, they have nodes which contain address of the next (and sometimes previous) node and some data. They are similar to arrays except that any index can’t be accessed directly, you have a head node which is the starting node of the list and you iterate to the index using address of next node stored in the current node. (node->next) In your case (assuming that node is defined such that next contains address of next node and data contains data in the current node) temp is the current node, temp->next refers to the next node of the linked list, temp->next->data refers to the data in the next node of the linked list. This may change if the node is defined 27 Views · Answer requested by Gautam Pruthi
