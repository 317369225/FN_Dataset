What is steel structure's design life?It is what you design it to be. Designs can be fatigue based (i.e. design parts such that the loads they bear are below the steels fatigue limit). Some designs are based on fracture toughness (designed such that a crack will not grow to a catastrophic length between planned inspections). All designers must choose a method and many industries specify the method based on years of historic experience (i.e Aerospace Industry) 18 Views
