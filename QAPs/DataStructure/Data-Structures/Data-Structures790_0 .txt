How can I achieve Union data type facility in java?Java does not support "union" data type like as c++ due to its complexity. And union data type has a nature of sharing a block of memory(of variable of biggest data type) with its defined variables. So to how to achieve this??Use a class with many "setter" and "getter" methods.... While "getting", just see what was the latest "set" and how you can cast and convert it to the "current get". Well - that's very weird way to do things. Unless, you are writing a device-driver in Java - why would you need a "union" ? 32 Views  View Upvotes
