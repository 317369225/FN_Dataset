How do I break down a problem and solve it with the use of Java programming?1.) Understand the Problem a.) Identify all the constraints. b.) Identify the data size. c.) Make basic decisions on complexity. 2.) Solve the Problem. a.) If the problem is too difficult, then solve an easier related problem. b.) If a.) is not feasible/possible, Try removing the constraint that is hindering your progress. c.) Try applying a brute-force solution and then improve from there. 13 Views
