Which is the best book for learning programming in data structures and algorithms from beginning?You can take my word for it. There is no book better than ‘DATA STRUCTURE MADE EASY BY NARSIMHA KARUMANCHI’ for Data Structure. There are 2 versions of this book available (a) with C language (b) with Java language. Once You complete this book and Confident in data structures Then It will be very Easy to start with Algorithms. And Its really important to get your hands on Coding. For this, Start Coding on HackerRank. The reason i prefer HackerRank is they provide topic wise Questions So you can immediatly start which ever topic you study. Its not like you need to wait till you Complete the book. All the best. Happy Coding :) 50 Views · View Upvotes
