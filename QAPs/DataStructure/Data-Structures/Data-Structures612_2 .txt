How do I create a program that generates sudoku puzzles in Java?I am struggling with this question and would really appreciate it if someone could give insight into the problem.More or less the same way you go about doing it in another language. First, you need to know how to generate sudoku puzzles. My first stab at the problem would be to generate solved puzzles and then "hide" a number of squares depending on the difficulty level. My guess is that the sudoku generation algorithm is a google search away. You will need a data structure that holds 81 elements. It might make sense to use two data structures- a 3x3 grid of squares and a 3x3 grid of the previous data structure. These container structures will be simple classes in Java. They will basically get and set data. It might make sense to have methods to validate the data as well. 914 Views  View Upvotes
