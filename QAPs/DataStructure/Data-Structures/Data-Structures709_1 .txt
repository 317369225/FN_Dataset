As a beginner programmer, should I start learning algorithms and data structures?Even if you do not have a solid foundation in any of the programming languages, if you can follow a flowchart / pseudo-code, and have a decent understanding of basic mathematics, you can start learning algorithms and data structures, no problem. While, as a beginner programmer if you have a decent foundation of at least one programming language then you can start implementing some of the data structures and algorithms that you read about, but it is not necessary to understanding the working of any algorithm or data structure. 125 Views  View Upvotes
