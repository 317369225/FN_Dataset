Are structures in C-language similar to objects in Java?C struct is a static data type that offers a handy way to manipulate datatypes that have a composite structure, similar to a record. Objects in java have fields, that are somehow similar to fields in a record, but offer methods that give life to objects. It is anyway possible to create something that resembles objects using function pointers as fields in struct's and some form of “syntactic sugar” with macros but the result, even at its best with C is a pale resemblance of objects in Java. It should be anyhow considered that C++, at least in the very first version, was a preprocessor or a “transpiler” as it would be defined nowadays, that translated code in C++, that has first class objects, into C and objects were implemented with structs and methods with function pointers, so C offers the basic tools to create an OOP language but do it by hand is rather clumsy. 137 Views · View Upvotes
