How can I gain an in-depth knowledge about data structures algorithms and the corresponding programming methodologies?How can I learn DSA in a continuously motivated way (without getting frustrated or depressed)?You can refer geeksforgeeks.org for the study part which I guess will be more than enough if you thoroughly study the data structure,algorithms and programming contents on the website. The most important thing is the amount of time you invest in coding yourself which I feel is the best method to learn things quickly. For this you can create accounts on the coding platforms like Hackerrank, codechef and solve the various problem statements given there side by side with your learning process. 38 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Seshadri Kesavan
