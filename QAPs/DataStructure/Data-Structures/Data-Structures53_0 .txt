How could an ArrayList be turned into a fifo data structure?Have two factors in my program, keywords and a text document. I want to search the text document identifying each keyword I find & then finally identify the section of the document which has the shortest section while maintaining every keyword. I want to use a FIFO DS for this, could AL work? ThanksI haven’t fully analyzed your general algorithm idea, but for a FIFO data structure, you are looking for an implementation of the java.util.Queue or java.util.Deque interface (extending the java.util.Queue interface). Queue (Java Platform SE 8 ) Deque (Java Platform SE 8 ) For example LinkedList implements both these interfaces. An ArrayList doesn’t implement any of these interfaces, so it won’t help you much for a FIFO datastructure. (Deque interface not shown in this image) For further information you might want to check out my article (including a pdf) and video LinkedList vs ArrayList Video Tutorial 133 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Joshua Borland
