Should I learn how to design data structures before learning about algorithms?As far as my experience goes, both from school and from work, algorithms and data structures are kind of linked. You apply algorithms (known solutions to problems) on data. You shouldn’t care if the data is of a primitive type (number, string) or a complex type (objects, hash maps, arrays) as long as your algorithm works for inputs of that data type and after running, you get a valid solution. For example, you will learn a lot about tree-like data structures when working with depth-first and breadth-first search algorithms. In conclusion, they go hand-in-hand and should be learned together. 195 Views · View Upvotes
