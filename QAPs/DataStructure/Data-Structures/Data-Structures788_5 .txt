Is coding not for me if I take long hours to learn to implement a basic Data Structures in C?Should I give up coding?That is not the case. Its fine if you are taking a long time in solving problems but make sure that you understand the basic concept and logic of each nd every problem. So that next time you get a similar problem you will be able to solve fast and very easily. Do hard work and stay dedicated, things will work out for you soon. 67 Views  View Upvotes
