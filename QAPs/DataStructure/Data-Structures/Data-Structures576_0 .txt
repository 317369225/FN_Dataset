Do we need to use any data structure while designing database?Yes, of course, data structures are necessary for designing databases. A B-tree is the most popular choice since in this data structure, nodes can be packed into blocks, unlike in data structures like AVL trees. B-trees can have variable sized nodes within a predefined range and multiple pointers to child nodes are permitted. A slight variant is the B+ tree in which copies of keys are stored in internal nodes and pointers may be introduced in leaf nodes to allow sequential access. Several others such variations of B trees exist. Other data structures that contribute to database design are ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method), flat files, heap files and hash buckets. 50 Views  View Upvotes
