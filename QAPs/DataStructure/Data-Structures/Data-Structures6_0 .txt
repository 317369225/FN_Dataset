I want to be an embedded systems programmer, working in the field of IoT, do I require a knowledge of data structures?Hi, Sorry to say, but your question doesn’t sense to me, first of all, the data structure is used where we want to manage heterogeneous data and access using single variable along with its member. So it doesn't have to deal with any technology like IoT, its programming concept, it's up to you that how efficiently you want to use/manage it in your program. And always make the practice of using data structure it makes the program better and professional. So I recommend you to learn data structure. Hope you understand the idea. 134 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Agnus Selvaraj
