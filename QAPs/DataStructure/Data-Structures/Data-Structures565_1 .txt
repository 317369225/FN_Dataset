Why are most of HackerRank's hard problems based only on Segment Trees and Graphs?True. However, it’s as good as asking, why most are based on Binary Search for less-than-hard problems. Below I will add a view of mine, may not true for all or all cases. Interesting note is, both Binary Search & Segment Tree are very closely related. As Segment Tree is only a data structure, the algorithm questions would require more modifications to be done to fit or use the Segment Tree for those problems, and that’s why its hard, and categorized so. The answer is probably due to O(log N) complexity, which is better than O(N). May be some day they will have more problems on O(1)/constant complexity too. Regarding Graph problems, obviously they are one of the important problems in CS, that companies like Facebook or Google would like the candidate have. Both the Segment Tree (having Binary Search) and other Graphs are very important in Algorithms and so many problems exist & is its majorly good for us, though difficult to begin with. May be, some day we can solve all problems in O(log N) as a naive algorithm instead of O(N^2) or O(N) and there will be more green ticks easily. Also there are very important unsolved problems in Graphs that could be very useful to mankind if someone helps in solving them in future, this is possible if we learn Graphs as common as Binary search. Not sure if Hackerrank thought this way exactly, but its clearly for some good for everyone, though difficult to start even as of today. 1k Views · View Upvotes
