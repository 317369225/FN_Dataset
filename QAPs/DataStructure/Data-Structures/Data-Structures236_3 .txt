What is the difference between keys and values in binary search trees in Java?Keys and values are neither limited to binary search trees nor Java. These words are most readily associated with dictionary entries where the key would be a word and value would be the meaning of the word. In more general terms, a key is the information on which a record can be sorted. It may be part of the record (such as record number, name or date) or it may be separate information about the record. B+ Trees store only the keys in the internal nodes while the leaf nodes store the keys and the values. 37 Views  Answer requested by Madawa Maduranga
