What should I study first, Data structure or object oriented programming?In my opinion, neither one is a prerequisite to the other. Of course, you need to have a basic understanding of the language which you choose for studying data structures. If you have a basic knowledge, then you can go for data structures first and then study the object oriented programming concepts in detail later. So, both can go in parallel. For your convenience you can just choose the same language to study for studying data structures as the object oriented programming language that you choose/ have chosen. Iâ€™d suggest you study both the subjects separately and master them one at a time in order to boost your skills. Let me know if you want book suggestions. 193 Views
