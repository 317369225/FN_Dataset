What is the difference between local spacetime structure and global spacetime structure?Can I say like for general relativity, it can describe curvature due to a mass/energy, which is local spacetime structure while for global spacetime structure, it will be like for the FRW metric?No, not mass/energy, but the density of energy E, momentum p and angular momentum J. This is why rotating black holes have a different geometric structure. The formula is that the gravitational tensor G is a constant multiple of the Maxwell stress tensor T. The cosmological constant Lambda slightly modifies the coefficient of one term in G. I suggest that everyone buy or borrow a copy of Misner, Thorne and Wheeler’s “Gravitation”. 137 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
