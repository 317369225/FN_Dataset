If I have to find number of p letters in a document what would be the best data structure to find it?To find what ? the count of the total number of times P is written ? or the position ? The word ? in any case : To represent the Count a simple integer would suffice: int count = 0; ... if( c == 'p' ) count++; For indexes a simple vector of type index would suffice: typedef unsigned int index; std::vector<index> indexes; ... if( *idx == 'p' ) indexes.push_back(idx); for a word a vector is also enough: std::vector<std::string> words; ... std::string currentWord =""; bool addWord = false;  if ( c == 'p' ) addWord = true;  if( c == ' ' && !addWord ) currentWord = "" ; else if( c== ' ' && addWord ) { words.push_back( curentWord ); currentWord = ""; addWord = false; } else currentWord += c; 173 Views  View Upvotes
