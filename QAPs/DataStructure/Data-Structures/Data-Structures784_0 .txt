What should be the value of k and tablesize of hashtable whose hash function is ((1st char) + k * (2nd char) + k^2 * (3rd char) + …) % tablesize?why many use k=31 ? and if tablesize and k both have value 31?Michal Forišek's answer to Why do some hash functions use a prime number as base? This should give you the answer to your first question. Regarding the second question. If you choose both k and tablesize to be of the same value, then the only character that would matter in the hash code generation would be the 1st_char. This is because the other chars are multiplied by some power of k and, because k was taken the same as tablesize, the modulus would give zero for all those elements. Your hash function would, thus, disintegrate into ((1st_char) % tablesize). 180 Views
