What are the advantages of linked implementation of lists over contiguous list implementation?In modern systems, there are generally only a few advantages of a linked list implementation, and many disadvantages. The advantages are related to the flexibility of allocation, insertion, deletion, and re-ordering. The disadvantages are generally a significantly increased memory footprint, a significantly decreased CPU cache hit ratio (higher latencies leading to lower performance), and a significantly increased load on the dynamic memory management system.
