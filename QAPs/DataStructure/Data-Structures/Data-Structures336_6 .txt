A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?C++ (and really, C) is closer to the hardware than most programming languages. It will give you more control and give you a better feel of how the computer actually works. Algorithms and data structures are language-agnostic, and they are the fundamental building blocks of computer science. Once you understand those you can write efficient programs in any language, and that’s more powerful than knowing the syntax of many different languages. Your professor is indirectly telling you the best advice I got from mine; focus on the fundamentals and you will go far. This is true in many tech fields. 95 Views · View Upvotes
