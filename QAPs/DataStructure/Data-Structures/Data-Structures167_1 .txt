What's the best way to teach "Algorithms and data structures"?Next year I will be teaching course named “Algorithms and data structures” for two groups of students in my university. I was given the possibility to change the way this course is taught.IMHO. Refer prof Sedgwick lectures on coursera, Eric demaine on ocw.mit and combine. The only additional thought, consider each lecture as a research paper, start by thinking about a hands-on killer motivating example, then build introduction, then details and finally code. 168 Views  View Upvotes
