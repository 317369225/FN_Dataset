What exactly should a beginner do to master algorithms and data structures?First of all in order to master a subject you need all the prerequisites mastered. The list of subjects you will need in order to perfectly understand , analyse and create new algorithms are :- 1) Discrete Mathematics. 2) Single Variable Calculus and Probability. 3) Combinatorial Mathematics So, what you should be doing before starting to study data structures and algorithms is to master these subjects and atleast have an intermediate level skill in all these three. Now you can start reading the algorithm bible, i.e Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS After you have done this, you can start studying the Algorithms. A background knowledge of the prerequisites will help you learn it at a fast rate and also understand the stuff at a higher level and be able to reason that why it is written. In this book I would say that you read and try to work out every example and Don’t skip the exercises.!!!!! Read from Part-1 to Part-6. Part 7 contains very advanced topics. After going through this book, you need to brush up your skills by solving question. You can find these types of questions online on sites like HackerRank topcoder.com Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming But, I would recommend you to solve Elements of Programming Interview and Cracking the Coding Interview on paper at first end to end by analyzing and optimizing your approach for every question.After you have finished once do it again this time all through coding.(in you favorite language). After this you can go online and compete. I guarantee if you follow all this you will be at a very high level in Algorithms. 250 Views · View Upvotes
