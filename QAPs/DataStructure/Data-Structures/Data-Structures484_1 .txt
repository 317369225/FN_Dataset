Which data structure in java can be used to search latest entry of .txt file having duplicate entries for an id (along with income and tax)?You can use a TreeMap inside a HashMap. The key inside the TreeMap can be the timestamp in seconds when you insert the record into the tree map, or it can be a counter which you will get by doing ‘last inserted records counter value + 1’, while inserting a new entry into the tree map. For the outer HashMap the key will be the Id. Something like : HashMap<Integer, TreeMap<Integer, Record> 64 Views
