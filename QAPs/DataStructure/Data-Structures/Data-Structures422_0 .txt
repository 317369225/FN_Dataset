Why do some programmers ignore algorithmic efficiency and rather focus on just making a program work?I am an Aerospace Engineer and I enjoy coding. To me, one of the most important part of an efficient program is an Algorithm but then I met developers who have no clue about time complexity or space complexity. I am just curious as to why algorithmic efficiency is ignored when itâ€™s so important?Think of this example. You have an inventory application that downloads a list of 1000 items unordered. You need to sort the list by part number. The generic List<Item>.Sort takes 100 msec. If you spent a few hours optimizing it you could get it down to 1 msec. Now, think of how this is going to be used. Your end user is going to have to wait either 100 msec or 1 msec. Do you think it makes a difference in user experience? Not in the slightest. So, you invested hours of programming, and cost to the project, with no payback. 175 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Surajit Das
