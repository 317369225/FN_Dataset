What does temp->next->data refers to in linked list c programing?Basic: Linked-list is a list of ordered nodes, a node stores data and successor node address(in some cases predecessor node address too). Singly-Linked-List : Node->Node->Node->null. Node : [(data)|(next)] From above code inside question gives information about three things: Temp(a node), next(a successor node address) and data(data information) We can now derive from temp->next->data, which implies that: First we go to address of ‘temp’ node and from there we fetch the successor node address(using ‘next’) and jumps to successor address where we are fetching the data information stored in it(using ‘data’). 75 Views
