When should I use a binary search tree over a hash map?When you care about the order of the keys and want to use it for some operations. When you need the worst-case guarantee on the running time. Especially when the requests are coming from outside, and you don’t control or restrict them in any way, an adversary could potentially make your service respond very slowly if you use a hash table. When you want some tricky operations to work fast, like cutting a segment from a string and then inserting it back at another position. 236 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Joel De La Cruz
