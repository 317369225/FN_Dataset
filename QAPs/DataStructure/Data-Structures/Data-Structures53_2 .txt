How could an ArrayList be turned into a fifo data structure?Have two factors in my program, keywords and a text document. I want to search the text document identifying each keyword I find & then finally identify the section of the document which has the shortest section while maintaining every keyword. I want to use a FIFO DS for this, could AL work? ThanksUse Queue<Stuff> queue = new ArrayDeque<>(). That's the JCF way of making a FIFO data structure. If you insist on (or have a hard requirement for) using an ArrayList you can create a facade around the ArrayList with push() calling list.add(), pop() calling list.remove(0) and peek() calling list.get(0). 135 Views  Answer requested by Joshua Borland
