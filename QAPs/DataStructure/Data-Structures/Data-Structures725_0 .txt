Why in almost all the books and online tutorials of the data structures and algorithms are not implemented in C#?This is simply because not many people know C#. On the other hand, almost everyone has gone through an introductory course in C/C++ or Java. So, the tutorials would be helpful to a wider range of audience if the data structures and the algorithms therein were implemented in one of those languages. An even better option is to just provide the pseudo-code which can then be translated to any language depending on the reader’s choice. 173 Views · View Upvotes
