Does the Universe have an underlying Data Structure?I am not sure what you mean by Data Structure but I shall attempt to address this regardless. Yes it actually has three that I can immediately think of including one that is not very obvious to most people but is right in their face. Our DNA is a data structure created by the universe. What physicists call information. It is the arrangement, attributes, characteristics, paths taken, collisions accounted for, energy transfer, and exact position and behavior of all particles in a system at a given moment of time having well defined environmental factors like energy density, temperature, em fields, gravitational forces, etc. This is commonly discussed within the context of black holes. For example famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking says that black holes do not destroy information. Therefore if information is conserved it should be possible that if matter were removed we could somehow reconstruct it to the state it had before entering a black hole — if we had the technology and resources to do such an ambitious experiment. There is only one thing puzzling to me. What would this mean for the Second Law of Thermodynamics (law of increasing entropy)? Humans are a product of nature and the universe. Therefore all the data and information we generate especially within the context of information technology and computer science are all data structures of the universe. All three data structures can be reduced to a common fundamental binary code. 241 Views · View Upvotes
