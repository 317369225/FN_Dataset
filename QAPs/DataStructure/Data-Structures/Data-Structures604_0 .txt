Should I practice data structures and algorithms with Python or C++?If you are preparing for ACM ICPC, You should practice in C++ as the only allowed programming languages for solving problems are C, C++, Java. Otherwise, there is no right answer, both Python and C++ have their upsides and downsides, and almost every online judge support them both. Python’s syntax is fairly straight forward and your code in Python would be a lot shorter most of the time than in C++, But C++ is faster and more powerful, that would help you with the limited-time problems, and also there are a lot of libraries that might increase your skills like the STL. TL;DR : Pick the language that you are comfortable with, it doesn’t make a huge difference except in ACM ICPC. Edit: According to Anup Kalbalia’s answer, it was proposed to allow Python at the next ACM ICPC World Finals (2016). But there is no official announcement yet. 221 Views · View Upvotes
