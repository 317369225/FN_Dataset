How can I begin with Codechef if I do not have any knowledge of data structures and algorithms?Is it even possible to do that ?Go to the beginner section. Try the most solved problems. The first 20 or so wouldn’t require any algorithmic knowledge. The next 20 would be a bit harder, but similar. You can solve many more problems if you know sorting ;) Obviously, you should learn data structures and algorithms as soon as possible 669 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Vishal Rohila
