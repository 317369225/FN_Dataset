How relevant are data structures and complex CS algorithms for front end developers?In my opinion, it depends on the level of abstraction and the type of projects you’re doing. Writing APIs requires a strong background in algorithms and data structures most of the times. If you’re working on a large project, then it’s very likely to need to write your own APIs regardless the language/framework you’re using. On the other hand, working on small projects which requires nothing more than writing some for loops, calling APIs and storing/retrieving data has nothing in common with complex CS concepts. 290 Views · View Upvotes
