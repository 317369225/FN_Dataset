Why do we need to learn data structures before learning algorithms?Why do we need to learn data structures before learning algorithms? “I want you to sort this array.” “Sure thing. Just one question: what’s an array?” Some data structures are so basic that you learn them super early. Algorithms are ways to do things that might use those data structures. Other times, a data structure may not make sense without a matching algorithm, and vice-versa. Red-black trees are supposed to be self-balancing — but they only “balance themselves” if someone has written the code to make it do that. And again, if you don’t count those as being learned at the same time, the data structure has to come first. You can’t write the code that uses the data structure until you have the data structure. 271 Views · View Upvotes
