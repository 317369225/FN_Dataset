How do I design a data structure to store sets, efficiently add new sets and, given any set, check if we have already stored any of its subsets?Let me tell you something .I don't know if you are doing the question of "Merging community " on hakerrank but this is the exact question that I faced when solving this question . The DS you are looking for is Disjoint sets with weighted edges. If you implement it as per the algorithm ,you will get complexity of :- O(1) for insertion O(log n) for finding if two objects are in same or different set . I would recommend you watch first week of lectures on disjoint set from here for clearly understanding it . Algorithms, Part I - Princeton University | Coursera 157 Views  View Upvotes
