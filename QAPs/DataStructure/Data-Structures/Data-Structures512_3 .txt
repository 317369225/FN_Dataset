How much emphasis should I place on studying data structures and algorithms if my goal is a job in Data Science/Machine Learning?I’m interested in an expert’s opinion on how much focus should I give to getting a good understanding of the various algorithms that are usually tested at tech companies interview processes vs. getting hands-on experience through data science competitions, focusing on learning statistics, etc.Hi and thanks for the question. I will give you my honest answer. You’ll need to know algorithms & data structures (A&DS) enough to pass interview questions. That’s it. I have never used anything more advance than linked list, binary trees and hash maps. For example, in the LibSVM library (written in C and C++) what is the most “advance” data structure you find there? Single linked lists. Everything else are arrays. Not sexy. You, as data scientist, should focus mainly on machine learning concepts and applications. The subtle nuances of what is a good training sample for this particular prediction problem, how much imbalance is affecting the result, how can I fine tune this algorithm without overfitting it, do I know any heuristics to best solve this regression problem. How about the optimisation algorithms? SMO, quadratic programming? These algorithms are more relevant for machine learning and the developing of learning algorithms, and thus for a data scientist, than to know how to implement a red-black tree or something of that sort. If you need to implement an algorithm for industrial purposes, you’d be amazed how over-engineered solutions often fail on real world trials. Don’t get me wrong, A&DS is a very important subject, but for a data scientist I reckon not that much. This is my honest opinion.
