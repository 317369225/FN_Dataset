What is the difference between local spacetime structure and global spacetime structure?Can I say like for general relativity, it can describe curvature due to a mass/energy, which is local spacetime structure while for global spacetime structure, it will be like for the FRW metric?Global spacetime structure usually means toplology of spacetime and things like that. As in does the spacetime go on forever or is it closed (like a ball)? Is it like a mobius strip? These are not questions you can answer sitting at some point in the ball or a mobius strip, you have to travel around the whole thing to know. In other words they are not local, but global properties. The metric on the other hand is a local property. It just tells you what a spacetime looks like at a point. For example, a cylinder and a plane both have flat metrics - the difference is in the global structure. 124 Views  View Upvotes
