I'm trying to be a self taught programmer. What should be the correct flow of online courses I should take or books I should read?Be clear about which programming language to learn, based on interest choose a language to learn.Stay focused on that programming language for a while before learning multiple languages at a time . It will be effective to learn a single language at a time . If you want to learn object oriented language then you may start with C++ then move on with java later,if you want to learn about website development you can start with html and then move on with php later. Based on which language you choose to learn you can find good books and tutorials online. Practice interactively using websites like codeacademy. Watch Newboston Youtube tutorials. Take up daily and weekly code challenges from codechef , hackerrank to get to know where you stand. Practice while you learn and try to go through open source projects done by developers in github and try to understand the code.Try taking up projects and contribute to the open source community.
