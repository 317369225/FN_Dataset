How do you print the inorder traversal of a BST?“Give a non recursive algorithm that performs an inorder tree walk”. Wouldn’t this just be a standard depth first search? None of the non-recursive solutions I saw online for this problem did anything that really resembled DFS (even though they all used stacks)…is my reasoning incorrect?I think there is a basic difference between in-order traversal and DFS : 1.> In in-order traversal you deal with the left child node first (smallest), then the root node (middle) and after that you deal with with right child node. This is in-order traversal of BST, which results in a sorted order iteration of the nodes (values) in a BST. 2.> In DFS, you deal with all the child nodes of the root node first one at a time going down a particular chain till you reach an empty node and then backtrack, and after you are done dealing with all the child nodes of a root node, then you deal with the root node itself. So, there is a fundamental difference between DFS and in-order traversal, I would say DFS would be somewhat like post-order traversal, in-terms of the order of handling of nodes in the Tree / Graph. 158 Views  View Upvotes
