How do you represent a matrix as array of linked lists in C?Assume that integer matrix is implemented with linked list such that every node has two pointers, one aligned by x axis, and the other by y axis. mat points to the current bottom list. How to add a new row of a matrix to the bottom, with node values initialized to zero?Create a list of elements N long where N is the count of columns. Initialize the element values to zero. Then walk this new list and link the n’th element in this list to the n’th element of the list of elements pointed to by mat. Then finally make mat point to the 0′th element of the new list. 72 Views
