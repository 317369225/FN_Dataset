What language is best for the Google interview based on built-in methods and data structures that do the work for me?Python has alot of methods I like but Java has LinkedList built in, etc. Please explain why.It doesn’t really matter. I wouldn’t advise picking plain C, or Assembly, of course, because that just makes things more complicated, but otherwise it makes very little difference. You have to know the language well, and if for some reason you need some data structure it lacks, you tell your interviewer that you need a LinkedList class or whatever, and either they tell you, “assume there is one”, or they tell you, “implement one”. If it’s the former, write out an interface you want and proceed, and if it’s the latter, you get to show an interviewer that you know how to implement it. First, the latter isn’t likely, because the interviewer usually wants you to solve the original problem and not get bogged down. Second, maybe they actually want you to not solve the original problem, but to see that you can implement a linked list. They get data either way, you see, it doesn’t matter if you solve the original problem or demonstrate competence some other way. 1.4k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Joel De La Cruz
