How are directed acyclic graphs different from trees?Jamin Ohmoto Frederick has put it very well. There is a theorem on Graph as given on Trees Theorem: An undirected graph is a tree iff there is exactly one simple path between each pair of vertices. It means if in a DAG, there is more than one path between a pair of node, then it is not tree. This implies that a node can only have zero or one parent. Rest, there is no cycle, connectedness. 3.6k Views  View Upvotes
