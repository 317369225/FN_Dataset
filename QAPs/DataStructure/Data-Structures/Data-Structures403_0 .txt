What are the strengths and weaknesses of each collection/container in Python?Some of the containers are: Dict A key-value data structure Strengths Access the value using keys in a constant time i.e. complexity of accessing a value is O(1) Weakness The larger the dictionary, the higher the memory consumption. Takes a tremendous amount of memory to build the hash for a larger dictionary because it has to build a tree structure for the hasing. List An array Strengths Add/remove any objects/items to/from it Mutable i.e. you can change the items anytime you like Weakness You cannot use a list as a key to a dictoinary because it is mutable which refers to the fact that we want a key to be a constant (non-changing entity). Tuple In general sense it is an ordered pair. Strengths Is immutable that is once tuple is created you cannot alter the items in it. You can use the tuple as key to a dict because of its immutability. There is a nampedtuple in python which you can use for an alternative to read-only objects Weakness Strength is the weakness (that is being immutable). So, you don’t want to have a general usecase for tuples in my opinion.` 215 Views · View Upvotes
