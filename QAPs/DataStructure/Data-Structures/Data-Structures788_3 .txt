Is coding not for me if I take long hours to learn to implement a basic Data Structures in C?Should I give up coding?Coding is not about grasping things(Data Structure),but its all about implementing them at the correct place. A slow learner can all start coding as a profession, there is no restriction on that, but if a person is good at implementing his/her program for a specify problem statement. Programming is distributed in various fields - -> 1.Dynamic Programming 2.Data Structure 3.Database implementation 4. Mathematics and many more…. So one opting for programming should be quiet efficient at one of these topics. At last i would suggest u to go ahead and you will subsequently learn and implement the concept quickly.. 199 Views · View Upvotes
