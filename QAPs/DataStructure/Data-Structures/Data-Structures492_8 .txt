Is it worth paying $3,000 more just to take a Data Structures and Algorithms course?How about making a Data Structure and Algorithms course instead? It could take many forms: a series of blog posts, a tutorial with code samples, a series of videos, a survey paper… This would teach you not only data structures and algorithms, but also to research, learn by yourself, and explain. In computer science we do this all the time on the job. 215 Views · View Upvotes
