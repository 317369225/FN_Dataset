Which algorithms and data structures are encountered in most software jobs?I personally encounter tons and tons of arrays of various kinds of stuff (often one-dimensional) and more rarely some hash tables when you need something looked up quickly and often. Most data is in SQL tables. I don’t really remember any time I ran into something which really called for a linked list or such, but in truth I did not do all that much, built a web spider + search engine at a previous job and some business (accounting) applications on the current one plus maintaining old business applications. There are many other fields which I have had no contact with at all, so I can’t speak of what “most” are in contact with. In truth, accounting and similar business applications are really very mundane. For all the stuff you learn in algorithms there is a reason and situations where xyz is applicable, so don’t blow it off as not important, if you are thinking along those lines. 309 Views · View Upvotes
