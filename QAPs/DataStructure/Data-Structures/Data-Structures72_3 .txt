Why should I learn data structures and algorithms since there is a collection concept in Java?Collections classes are based on data structures. If you want to understand collections well, You need to understand the underlying structure too. For example - ArrayList Resizing problem, The problem occurs as the underlying structure is Array and would have been no such problem with underlying structure as Linked List. When you read Collections , you are indirectly reading about the underlying structures. 776 Views  View Upvotes
