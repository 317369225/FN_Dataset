In tree construction which is the suitable efficient data structures?It depends on the type of tree,you want to create.There are many trees possible depending upon the orientation of nodes Like 1.Complete Binary Tree-All Levels are filled except possibly the last level and the nodes are towards left,So if you see for a node i,left child=2*i+1 and right child=2*i+2;So If you use Array data structure ,you could efficiently utilize it,You dont have to waste links. 2.Full Binary Tree- All Levels are filled ,Consequently Array Again For the Same Reasons. 3.Others-Here Nodes are not likely to be oriented Like they used to be in CBT and FBT.Skew Trees and other comes under this category so Use Linked List instead. 158 Views  View Upvotes
