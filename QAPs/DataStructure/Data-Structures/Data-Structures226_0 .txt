How do we know which data structure is best for the problem by just carefully observing the problem ?Lets say I have some prob. The only DS that comes to mind while solving is array, or at most queue. Simply saying not even good use of stack i see , while solving problems. Then how can graphs and trees comes to rescue ? Means how i can train myself so that seeing a prob i can tell which DS to use.What you need to keep in mind while selecting a data structure is: Which of the operation are you going to perform the most ie insertion,deletion,search,access,max,min or any other operation. What type of limitations you face while running your program ie Processing power or RAM Check the Space and time complexity for your DataStructure. Example: For stack insertion and deletion has AVERAGE case O (1) while accessing and searching has AVG case O (n). For binary search tree every operation has average case O (log (n)) [base 2]. Thus if accessing and searching is the main task I would use BST instead of Stack. You can find complexities for other DSs here Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet If you are not familiar with Algorithm analysis I'd recommend you to learn it carefully from online resources or a book. 26 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
