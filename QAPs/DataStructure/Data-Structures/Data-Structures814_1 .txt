How can I detect cycles in undirected graph using BFS?I always see code for DFS not BFS. so can i have a code or pseudocode for BFS? Thanks.BFS means a breadth first traversal. It means that you have to visit all the surrounding nodes of a particular node which are unvisited till then and then move on to the next node. continue the process till all the nodes are visited once. Algorithm: Rule 1 − Visit adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it visited. Display it. Insert it in a queue. Rule 2 − If no adjacent vertex found, remove the first vertex from queue. Rule 3 − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until queue is empty. If it is not a connected graph, then maintain a count variable and check for each and check whether count of visited nodes= total count of nodes in graph or not. If not and no adjacent vertex present, add to code if(!visited(vertex)) bfs(vertex); something like this, so that for the next vertex the same procedure continues. for coding part of bfs go through this link: Breadth First Traversal for a Graph - GeeksforGeeks If the adjacent node of currect vertex has already been visited, then there is a loop hope this answers helps you. 268 Views
