What is an efficient way to get the maximum node value from binary search tree? Present your optimized algorithm.Assuming that a node had three fields: Value, LeftChild, RightChild. The logic would be to find the Right Most node in the tree which does not have a right child. So Algorithm would be int findMax(node) If( node.rightChild == null) Return node Else Return findMax( node.rightChild ) Explanation: Any node can have a larger node in its right sub tree only. Hence, if the right sub tree is not present, node is the largest in its tree. 32 Views
