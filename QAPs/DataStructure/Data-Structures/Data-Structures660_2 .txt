How do I get the number represented as nodes of a LinkedList?Suppose My Linked list is of the form 7->4->3->5->1 Where 7 is the most significant digit and 1 is the least significant digit. I want to write a function which takes this linked list and returns 74351 as the result. Is it possible to implement the solution using LinkedList Thanksthink of 74351 = 70000 + 4000 + 300 + 50 + 1. which is like = ((((7*10 + 4)*10 + 3)*10 + 5)*10 + 1) It is like accessing nodes from head to last and first adding this node data to ans and then multiplying 10 except the last. For recursion solution you can use global variable or reference variable. code is like: void getValue(ListNode *node, int *val) { if(node == NULL) return ;  *val = ((*val)*10 + node->data); if(node->next == NULL) { return ; } getValue(node->next, val); }  //call getValue function like int val = 0; getValue(head, &val); Hope it will help !! 68 Views
