What are the sources of imformation used to design structural elements?Start with your text books. Good books can always be referred to and make a very handy and useful resource. Home link to concrete centre: good resource for concrete related knowledge. Steelbiz Home Page link to steel biz, good for steel design Eng-Tips Engineering Forums - forum to discuss engineering issues NPTEL - look for civil engineering lectures that interest you. These are quite detailed lectures by IITs and very helpful and informative. Actually internet offers almost infinite resources but I don’t recommend jumping to using software (either free or paid) as they make you an “Operator” not a “Designer”. Build your fundamentals first, then work your way up in using software. Software are tools, you are the user. A tool is as good as the one of is using it. Hope it helps. 189 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Supun Sanaka
