Why do we find the height of a binary tree?It's necessary to know the height of the tree when it is stored as an array or indexed list. The height must be known when inserting new elements into the array. Without knowing the height it would be impossible to calculate the new node's initial index. It is also imperative when restructuring the tree or heap (aka. "heapify") to know the limits of the heapify operation. 97 Views  View Upvotes
