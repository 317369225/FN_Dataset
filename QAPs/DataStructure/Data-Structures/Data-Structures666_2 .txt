Which algorithms and data structures are encountered in most software jobs?Programming languages often have an influence over the programmers’ data structures. E.g. in some languages lists doesn’t even exist. But in Lisp, reversing a linked list is as simple as writing (reverse list) because the language has full support for lists. If a programmer only knows one language, they may easily adapt their thinking to the available constructs, hence the symptoms you mention. And some programming languages can be easily transformed to support new constructs, others are not that forgiving. 227 Views
