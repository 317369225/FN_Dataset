How many ways are there to solve this quant problem?The concept of this question is that No. of factors of a perfect square are odd and no. of factors of a any other no. are always even. So here, for a door to be closed it must have no. marked which has even no. of factors. Therefore all the doors except for door no.- 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100 will be in closed state. So 90 doors are closed. I think it’s the least time consuming way to solve this question. 35 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Rajat Chauhan
