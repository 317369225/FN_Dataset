Does software engineering require the usage of dynamic data structures and pointers?Is dynamic data structures (e.g linked lists, binary trees) commonly used in software engineering? Also are pointer variables (like in C) used in software engineering as well?Yes. You cannot do anything nontrivial without dynamic data structures. Those require pointers, although your language may limit operations on them and rename them references. Libraries usually provide popular data structures for common applications, although you need to chose the right one and may find that insuffucient. 252 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Durga Devi
