Should I focus on learning more languages or Algorithms and Data Structures?What is more important if I want to pursue a career as a Computer Programmer?It very much depends on which area you want to specialize in. You have not speficied this, so I will just go ahead and assume it is a career of a software engineer primarily focusing on delivering high-level software products. Here come two important statements: Deep understanding of the language requires understanding of the algorithms and data structures implemented internally for language feature support. Understanding of the algorithms does not require you to know any of the existing languages. So on a fundamental level the concept of data structure/algorithms is more important for a complete and experienced software engineer. Ironically, if you were to ask me if it is possible to be a good programmer without knowing algorithms (however knowing computer architecture, operating system, language specification, team work, development methodologies) - I would say hell yes, It is definitely possible. Neither of the knowledge alone is sufficient, but both are required if you strive to be on top of the game. So learn whichever area you are lacking in. 158 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Danish Ajaib
