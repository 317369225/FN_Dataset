What are Data Structures and Algorithms? Do I need to learn them?I am a complete newbie to programming… I don’t know anything at all. I came across it… What are they actually? I can’t seem to understand them at all. Do I need to learn them? When do I need to learn them - Before learning any programming language or after? Can you share any links for learning them?Data structures and algorithms are like base of programming no matter what language you use . If you want to be good at programming then learning data structures and algorithms will be a good idea. Learning these subjects will help you to solve new problems . Now coming to part one of your question. Algorithms are the set of instructions that you need to follow to solve a problem. Now there are many ways to solve a problem . So studying algorithm will give you an insight on which solution is best to solve the problem. Basically you will get to know how to write a program that will take least possible time and memory. Data structure is the way in which we store data in memory or the way in which we give input to an algorithm. So the execution time an algorithm depends on the format in which the input is given to the algorithm. So i think now you got it, in the long run it’s not about solving a problem (any one can do that) , it’s about how fast you can solve it . Same applies for programming.
