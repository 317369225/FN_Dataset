What are some tips for self-studying Data Structures and Algorithms?Try to visualize them. Use whiteboards and copies to draw diagrams. Make more and more diagrams. Whether you are trying to learn or you are trying to solve a problem. Try to know what they are for? What problems different Data Structures solved. Like Linked Lists solved the shifting and fixed size problem of arrays while insertion and deletion. Implement them. You cannot skip this step. This will help you to boost your confidence and also will improve your coding skills. Too much reading will lead you nowhere. Find a mentor, practice daily. If you’re a beginner, head towards HackerRank & GeeksforGeeks Choice of language is upto you but the best languages for learning DS and Algorithms are C++ and Java because of the STL and Collection Framework respectively. Book recommendation : Data Structures and Algorithms in C++/Java by Adam Drozdek Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis in C++/Java by Mark. A. Weiss Robin Thomas has given a great road map for learning Data Structures and Algorithms, it’s a must read : Robin Thomas' answer to How can I learn algorithms and data structures from scratch?
