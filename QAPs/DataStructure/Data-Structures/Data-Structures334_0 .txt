How can I become an expert in data structure and algorithms?Learn the basics of the data structure and algorithm from a good book. You have to ensure that you implement what ever you learned in actual code. Choose any Object Oriented programming language and implement what you have learned. Understand how to measure the complexity of each algorithm. Understand the Big-O Complexity of the algorithm. (Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet) Write an application that uses your data structure implementation. Some of the ideas may be to implement an XML parser or to implement a language parser. Start looking in to how C++/Java implements Algorithms( STL and Collections. ) All the above steps will give you a strong foot hold on data structures and algorithms. 341 Views  View Upvotes
