Where can I find someone willing to teach me data structure and algorithms for free or in very cheap cost?I always want to become a software developer but the only barriers for me is the technical interview, I can’t pass it, I want to find someone to teach me the data structure and algorithms.Now if you want a person. I would vote for your friends. Because the thing about strangers who are good at programming algorithms is that they are making at minimum about $40 an hour at work, so they probably won’t teach you for cheap. Although some great options to get minor help for cheap is meet ups. There are a lot of office hours type meet ups for programmers and these tend to be a great place to get some tips and advice. (Hacker Hours example in New York). Programmers also tend to be nice people so if you email some people on linkedin someone maybe willing to help you for an hour or two for a couple beers. But asking for any long term commitment for little to no pay is a bit disrespectful to someone unless they are a friend.
