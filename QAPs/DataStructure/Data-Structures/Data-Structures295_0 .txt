Which is better among binary search and binary search tree for searching?It Depends on the Application You have. So To say Both Binary Search And Binary Search Tree have the same Searching time. But the main Problem with Binary Search Is You need to sort the list in Ascending/Descending order first. Which Adds a time complexity of O(n log n) to your code. Where Balanced Binary Search tree Will always take O( log n) time for searching. But you have got a problem here too. Implementation of a perfect Binary Search Tree like Red-Black Tree or AVL tree can be tricky. You Are lucky enough if you use c++. There is C++ “Set”. It is a Balanced binary search tree implementation where Insertion takes O( log n ) time Deletion also takes O( log n ) time and finding an element takes the same as well. I Hope This Helps. 105 Views · View Upvotes
