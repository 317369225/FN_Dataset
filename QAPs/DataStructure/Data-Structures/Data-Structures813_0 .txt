Where can I find a good tutorial on Data structures and Algorithms in C#?First learn the basic algorithms and data structures and try implementing on your own. Once that is done you can pick up pretty much any book that shows you how to implement data structures in object oriented language. Data structures and algorithms are language agnostic.
