I am a 16 year old self taught programmer. What are the best books to go all the way from data structures, algorithms to complex programming topics?I am planning to go through this list, step by step down the list: Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou. Introduction to algorithms by CLSR The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie. any other books to clear off my concepts on data structures? And if so, where should I put it in the list?Check this website TECH CRASH COURSE . I personally find this website very useful for new programmers as it contains lots of fundamental C programs with explanations and sample input and output. 44 Views
