Why is linked list a data structure whereas bags, stacks, queues are data types? Aren't they data structures in general?They are all data structures. A data structure is a theoretical concept, a data type is a specific implementation of a data structure in a particular programming language. Every data structure can be implemented as a data type. Not every data type is an implementation of a data structur. For example an int in c++ is not really an implementation of a data structure. 32 Views
