How does inserting a new link works in linked lists?Note that first is not declared inside the function insert. In fact its declaration isn’t shown. insert is (hopefully) an inline member function of an object class which defines the linked list. The first variable is presumably a member of the class. It would be nice to indicate that in the name - m_first or something. Wherever the hell first comes from, it’s must have some value - it points to the top of the list (null if empty). So this function does two things - it inserts a new element at the top and it also redirects the first pointer to the newly added top. In other words first -> [original-top-element] newlink -> [original top-element] first -> newlink -> original-top-element first now points to the top of the list again. 301 Views · View Upvotes
