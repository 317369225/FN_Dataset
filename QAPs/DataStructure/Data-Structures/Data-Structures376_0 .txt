Why is the LSD Radix sort algorithm not comparison-based?The name comparison-based sort is a technical term with a very specific meaning. It denotes an algorithm that has only one way of obtaining information, which is by comparing two elements to see which of them is the smaller one. Comparison-based sorts are important because they are the most general sorting algorithms: anything you can compare you can sort using a comparison-based sort. (In more mathematical terms, all you need to sort a collection of objects using a comparison-based sort is the ability to evaluate the relation < < for those objects.) This is not true for radix sort. Radix sort makes an additional assumption that the objects we are sorting have digits, and then accesses individual digits in order to speed up the sorting. 557 Views  View Upvotes
