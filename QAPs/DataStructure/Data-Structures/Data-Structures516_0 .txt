What are the uses of self referential structures in C++?A self referential structure is used to create data structures like linked lists, stacks, etc. Following is an example of this kind of structure: struct struct_name { datatype datatypename; struct_name * pointer_name; }; A self-referential structure is one of the data structures which refer to the pointer to (points) to another structure of the same type. For example, a linked list is supposed to be a self-referential data structure. The next node of a node is being pointed, which is of the same struct type. For example, typedef struct listnode { void *data; struct listnode *next; } linked_list; 45 Views
