Is the govt trying to implement any privacy policy around the use of consumer data or the implementation of specific algorithms?Yes and no. In a broad sense, for example, European and US are trying to regulate the rights of the citizens concerning this, where European legislation has more emphasis on the rights of the citizens and US has little bit less focus on this and more emphasis on business opportunities. There is no “right” answer to this question since society changes, for example, the kind of monitoring imposed by social media actors would not have been accepted a few decades ago. The new directive from the european union is that, for example, you have the right to get all data a company stores about you sent to you (even printed, guess how many pages that can turn into ….) as well as being allowed to be removed completely and be able to migrate to another service (e.g., take your FB account and move into Google+ instead). No, since we do not know what is around the corner, it is hard to control the specifics. There are laws governing citizens rights marking the boundaries of what is acceptable. Inside the boundaries, you can do whatever. If something turns out to be harmful, new legislation is added to the old. In the article in the Communication of the ACM, the various forms of inverse privacy are addressed. All in all, it is complex issue in societies/cultures that are changing (as has always been the case, albeit the fact that the speed is not particularly fast except when there are disruptions). 194 Views
