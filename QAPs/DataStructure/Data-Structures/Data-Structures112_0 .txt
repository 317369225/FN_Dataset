How can I animate a data structure with HTML and JavaScript?I need to develop data structures like stack, queue, binary search tree and have to make a user interactive interface through which user will operate on the data structures like applying insertion, deletion etc. I almost don’t have any knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. Please guide me how to start.I think “ Data Visualization” is the term you are looking for and we are very lucky to have d3.JS in this world! D3 charts library provides a very vast pool of visualization methods to project our data ranging from few plots to huge big data visualizations. Following is the description about d3 on it's official website: D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction. D3 provides a very easy to implement charts apis and you can write complex charts in couple of hours! All you need to do is to finalise your Visualization format and arrange your data accordingly. It accepts data in json and allowe easy transfers between various flavours of js!
