I am currently doing M tech structural engg and I landed an analyst role with 10 lpa package. Should I go for that job?Analyst means analyst role in a top financial firmif you are passionate about structural engineering , stay back and create wonders….otherwise Go grab it. As in India , standard package for structural engineering beginners is 5 lpa and it will take atleast 4 years to reach 10 lpa provided u r on right track with appraisals 20 Views · View Upvotes
