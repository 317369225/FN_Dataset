I take nearly a month to understand what a binary tree is, am I learning too slow and how could I improve?Nothing wrong with taking your time. Binary trees can be confusing. Don’t get discouraged and keep going. In fact, I would recommend you do take extra time to truly understand the concepts. This, IMHO, is the number one fallacy of many educational systems in that they teach you to memorize instead of teaching you to reason things out. I was always the guy everyone hated in College because I kept delaying the class with questions and requests to go over it again. Let’s just say I am in a much better place than most of them nowadays… :-) 653 Views · View Upvotes
