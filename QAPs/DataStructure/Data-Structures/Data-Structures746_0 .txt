How can I learn algorithms and data structures as a high-schooler?Hi!! Learning Data Structure does not require to be an Engineering student, trust me. Learning data structures require patience and enthusiasm to solve a problem. I would suggest you to first have basic programming knowledge about C language(as it is easier to begin with) and then switch to data structures and algorithms. I would recommend you to study Let us c by Yashwant Kanetkar. The pdf link to Let us C is given below. https://www.cluster2.hostgator.c... After you have some basic understanding about C language then switch on to data structures part. According to me, Data Structures using C by Reema Thareja is the best book I have encountered with. I have even got its pdf link below. Check this out “data-structures-using-c-2nd.rar ” . The given file is a .rar file, kindly download the given file and extract the file using 7-Zip, Winzip or any other software. To Download 7 zip visit “ Download ”. I would strongly recommend you to purchase DATA STRUCTURES IN C BY REEMA THAREJA as it would be very helpful in understanding the concepts of Data Structures. Hope that helps. Happy Coding! 191 Views
