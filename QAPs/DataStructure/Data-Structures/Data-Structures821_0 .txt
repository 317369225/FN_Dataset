What is the difference between an ARRAY and a LIST?array and linked list are both meant for storing information in parts . the difference majorly lies in their method of using m/y to store info and their way of access ARRAY the information is stored in form of continuous memory allocations. each part follows other just after it in the m/y. there is no randomness in allocation. they provide random access like arr[0],arr[6] etc there is static allocation of memory . n this may lead to wastage of memory there can be only one type of data in each cell of an array insertion and deletion are bit more time consuming LINKED LIST the information are stored RANDOMLY in parts. n each part is connected to other via a pointer to next cell (n to previous cell in case of doubly linked list) they are to be accessed sequentially because of the dependency of each part it is dynamically allocated that is m/y is allocated to each cell after processing request for it. hence thereâ€™s no m/y wastage a single cell can be divided into many parts each having info of different data type. but the last necessarily needs to be the pointer to the next cell insertion and deletion are lot more easier and faster. searching too is simpler. so overall linked list are better choice to use. but there are cases where arrays are used to avoid unnecessary pointers and lengthy code if not much manipulation of the information is required 176 Views
