How do I say on my resume that I know data structures and algorithms if I haven't taken the course?Well if you havenâ€™t taken Algorithm and Data structures coursed then you can mention them in under your Technical skills like this. you should be good at Algorithms and Data structures then only add them else during interview if you are unable to answer or solve the problem then interviewer will think you are lying to him/her. so learn and add the skills ! 164 Views
