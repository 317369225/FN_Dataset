Which is best site to learn data strucure with c?All answers are well written with proper references. But I would like to point out one thing. Data Structures are conceptual topics. You need to understand the data structure and its implementation well. The primary objective should be understanding the data structure and writing a proper pseudo-code. Why you should not depend on language? I have seen people who learn the code instead of the concept behind the data structure. The explain the data structure like there has to be a for loop for such task and a function call for some other task. They usually have literally no idea of what to do if you are asked to use while loop instead of for. Or asked to do some other methods instead of functions. Do not depend on a particular language for a data structure. You should be able to implement a given data structure in any language you feel like (given that you know programming in that language). If you try implementing simple data structures in C/C++/Python/Java, you will find everything is nearly the same, except the syntax. 299 Views  View Upvotes
