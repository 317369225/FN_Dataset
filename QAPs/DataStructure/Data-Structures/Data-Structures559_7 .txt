When should I use a binary search tree over a hash map?Thanks for the A2A. The main advantage of BSTs over hash tables is that BSTs are more memory-efficient. As others have noted, BSTs only reserve memory when it’s necessary. As an example, if a hash table has a range of 100 elements, then we would need to allocate an array of 100 elements, even if we’re only hashing 10. If we were to use a BST to store the same information, we would only allocate as much space as needed. Note, however, that hash tables are typically more efficient to retrieve items than search trees. 244 Views · Answer requested by Joel De La Cruz
