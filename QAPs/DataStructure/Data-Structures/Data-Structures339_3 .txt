Is it possible for someone to master at least 20 programming languages, 100 frameworks, and all data structures and algorithms in their career?There’s an infinite number of data structures (how did that even creep into your question?) and an even infiniter :) number of algorithms, so I’m going to say “no.” Also, it’s difficult to think of 20 useful programming languages. And mastering a hundred frameworks is as useless as mastering a thousand, if all you ever need in your career is three of them. A programmer’s career has never ever ever been about quantity. (Unless it’s the quantity of dollars we earn.) 211 Views · View Upvotes
