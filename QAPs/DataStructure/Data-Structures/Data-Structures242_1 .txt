Which data structures should I at least know in general?I studied arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees (Search, AVL, splay and B-), hash tables, heaps and a few types of sorting. I heard of other structures such as leftist and skew heaps, red-black trees, disjoint sets and mroe. Is it essential to learn all data structures in general?No it is certainly not important to know all of the data structures, what is more important is understanding where each data structure would fit in. A good programmer should be able to look at the documentation and be able to decide if it would be appropriate to use it. Hash tables vs maps? vectors vs arrays? lists vs trees (b-trees, red black trees, avl trees)? stacks vs quenes? tuples? merge sort/quick sort/radix sort? do note that using the right data structure will greatly assist you in reducing the complexity of what you are trying to achieve. I would encourage you to try and think of a few examples where each data structure/algorithm would fit in 216 Views  View Upvotes
