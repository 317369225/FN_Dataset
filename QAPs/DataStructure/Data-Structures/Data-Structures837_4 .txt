Are data structures and algorithms really worth learning?Eventually Yes! Data structure(DS) and Algorithms(Algo) play a huge role not only programming but other fields of compter science as well. Be it a simple problem like selecting a minimum value from a set or Hard problem like Traveling Salesman Problem or Max/Min Flow every problem can be solved by using appropriate Algorithm. Algorithms are the driving Force behind every software. To implement Algorithms you need to have a fair idea of Data Structures. Without prior knowledge of Data Structure you canâ€™t implement Algorithms. DS and Algo Go Hand-in-Hand. If you have good knowledge of DS and Algo then any problem can be solved in Optimal Time. 81 Views
