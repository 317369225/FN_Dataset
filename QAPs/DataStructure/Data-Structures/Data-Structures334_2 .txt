How can I become an expert in data structure and algorithms?Remember that “Data Structure + Algorithm = Program”. Your ultimate goal is to master writing programs in a language and for that you have to learn data structures and algorithms. So, firstly select your language. To learn Data Structures, you have to understand each data structure and its advantages/disadvantages, its basic operations and how disadvantages in one data structure is removed using data structure. e.g., deletion in array takes O(n) time whereas in linked list it takes O(1) time. To learn algorithms, you should be able to analyse time complexities of each algorithm and compare one algorithm is better than other for a particular problem. There are some techniques to learn in designing algorithms like Iteration Recursion(more than one recursions in a function) Divide and Conquer Dynamic Programming(counting, finding paths, etc..) Greedy(There is no choice but to remember these….although if a problem has matroid property then there will be a greedy solution…ref:CRLS) Backtracking 398 Views · View Upvotes
