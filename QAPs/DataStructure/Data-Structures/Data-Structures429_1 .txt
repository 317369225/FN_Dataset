What is the address of father/parent node in a tree as a link list?In a tree as link list if the father/parent has the address of its son node how does the son node comes to know who is the parent and what is its address.?Well that depends on the kind of linked list you are using . If you are using singly linked list then it is not possible for the son node to know who is the parent and what is its address. But if you are using doubly linked list then you can traverse from son node to parent node . 30 Views  View Upvotes
