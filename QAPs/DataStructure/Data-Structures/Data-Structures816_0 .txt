Why in hashing! = is used to check if the element is there or not in table instead of = =?Find the largest subarray with 0 sum - GeeksforGeeks go to hashing section in c++. Why != is used to check if the value is present in hash table or not.Usually we use == to check if its present.Give me some more info. Not able to understand. Are you asking about the search in the hash-table? For that even if the element is not found at an index, we can still search in the subsequent indices by applying probing. But when we come across an empty cell, we declare the element as not found. So just the condition that the element is not there is not sufficient. 71 Views
