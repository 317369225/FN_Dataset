Do I need to be able to implement all data structures natively without libraries before starting competitive programming?I currently understand the theoretical aspects of most data structures, but I want to know if its required if me to be able to implement them natively or just learn how to use them before starting. And if I might be asked at job interviews to write them from scratchNo and Yes. No, you don’t need to do that before beginning Competitive Programming. I’d suggest you to start solving problems and you will learn how to implement them. You can begin here Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) Yes, they can be asked in interviews and for that you should be able to implement different data structures using C++ STL (You can choose any language you are comfortable with, C, C++, JAVA, Python but most Competitive programmers prefer C++ largely because of its simplicity and STL) as most companies allow using STL. STL (Standard Template Library) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provides general-purpose templatized classes and functions that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.
