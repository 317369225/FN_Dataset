Is it worthwhile for embedded systems engineers to learn data structures and alogorithms?In some aspects it’s even more important to design as efficient as possible data structures and algorithms when resources are low. So yes, I’d say it’s very important for embedded system engineers to understand data structures and algorithms. It may be that they’d never use a linked list, it may even be that they’d never need to sort. But I can guarantee you there will be times when some form of lookup needs to happen, and since hardware is at a premium - doing a simple linear search is going to be even worse than it would have been in more capable hardware. Not to mention, there is no single program, system, embedded, distributed, etc. etc. etc. which does not perform some algorithm on some data. That is what a program is, an algorithm of calculations performed on data. So asking if you could omit learning DS & Algo is asking if you could omit learning to program. The answer is self evident. 193 Views · View Upvotes
