What's the best way to teach "Algorithms and data structures"?Next year I will be teaching course named “Algorithms and data structures” for two groups of students in my university. I was given the possibility to change the way this course is taught.I would highly recommend following the structure of a course put together by somebody else. There has been a lot of thoughtful work here by some brilliant teachers of this content… it is highly unlikely that mortals like you or I can improve on it without teaching the stuff for a long time. My favorites approaches are those by Tim Rougharden or Steven Skiena, but you should work through some other books and courseware yourself to see what you like most. 203 Views · View Upvotes
