When converting an expression from infix to prefix what do you do if the incoming operator has the same precedence as that on top of the stack?Say the expression is a*b*c. One line of thinking is to pop the present operator in the stack and then push the incoming operator into the stack in its place. The other line of thinking is to just push the incoming operator on the stack. Choosing the former gives: *a*bc and latter **abc.One way to evaluate infix to prefix is that u reverse the complete infix notation and then do normal infix to postfix conversion only considering that fact to pop only if u have a lower precedence 33 Views
