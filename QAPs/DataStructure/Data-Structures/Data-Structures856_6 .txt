How can one be well prepared to answer data structure/algorithm questions in interviews?Do TopCoder, GCJ, Hacker Cup, or ACM contests. It doesn't require you to be particularly smart, but you need to be able to improvise solutions on the fly. Eventually, you'll sort of have an intuition which points you towards the correct way to solving the problem. You'll immediately sort of "know" what data structure to use, or whether its a dynamic programming problem, and you'll have to use memoization. As for your specific case? It seems like you already manage to get the solution, just not the most optimal one. When you encounter a solution that you suspect isn't the most optimal, look for a few things: Am I doing repeated work? Can I save subresults? If so, use memoization/dynamic programming. Am I searching for something in an array? If so, use a hashtable and take advantage of constant time lookups. Make sure your data structures are the correct ones, and learn which ones are the best for any given situation. Are you doing alot of key:value lookups? Use a hashtable. Are you trying to represent a set? Use a HashSet or Bloom Filter. Are you trying to implement some kind of Queue? Use a Doubly Linked List. In the end though - you just need more practice, and eventually you'll be able to do this extremely fast without consciously thinking through it. 20.2k Views  View Upvotes
