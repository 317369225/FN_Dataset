Where can I find someone willing to teach me data structure and algorithms for free or in very cheap cost?I always want to become a software developer but the only barriers for me is the technical interview, I can’t pass it, I want to find someone to teach me the data structure and algorithms.A really great book for learning and thoroughly understanding how algorithms work is The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena. Examples of algorithms are written in C or pseudo code, so you should have some knowledge of the language. As other’s have said, hiring someone to teach you algorithm design will be a waste of money, and could potentially be a waste of your time. If you insist on someone else teaching you, then you should check out this Coursera course on Algorithms created by Stanford or this Udacity course. 281 Views
