Given a string, search it in a set of strings (say among 1000).What data structure would you use to store those 1000 strings and get the results faster?If searching is the main objective, and there is not going to be too many inserts/deletes, then a Balanced Binary Tree will give you a O(log n) lookup time. However, if you have frequent inserts/deletes, the overhead of balancing/re-balancing the tree will be significant. You can use a Hash also, and it can give you a O(1) lookup time. However, you have to design your hashing function really well. Otherwise, there will be lots of conflicts and you can end up with as bad as O(n) lookup time. Edit 1: In the answer above, it would be a balanced binary search tree, and not a simple balanced binary tree. And the answer assumes the string comparison itself can be done in constant time. 90 Views
