Do I need to be able to implement all data structures natively without libraries before starting competitive programming?I currently understand the theoretical aspects of most data structures, but I want to know if its required if me to be able to implement them natively or just learn how to use them before starting. And if I might be asked at job interviews to write them from scratchNo, you don’t do it. I’m pretty sure you cannot implement all data structures and related algorithms as efficient as standard library does. Check out std::map in C++ STL and you can see how many tricks are used in a conceptually simple binary search tree(usually RBTree), no mention std::sort, you’ll be shocked by the implementation of quick sort algorithm without suffering O(n^2) cases. PS. the official name of the sorting algorithm used in STL is introsort, it’s a hybrid of multiple sorting algorithms, check out Introsort for details. 396 Views · View Upvotes
