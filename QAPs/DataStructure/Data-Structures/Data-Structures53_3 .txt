How could an ArrayList be turned into a fifo data structure?Have two factors in my program, keywords and a text document. I want to search the text document identifying each keyword I find & then finally identify the section of the document which has the shortest section while maintaining every keyword. I want to use a FIFO DS for this, could AL work? ThanksSo you would be implementing a Queue using an ArrayList. Yes you can do it but it wouldn’t really be a nice solution. Every dequeue operation would need O(n) time since all the indices will need to be shifted by 1 to the left. Simply extend the ArrayList class and add a public method .enqueue(T t) and .dequeue(). The enqueue() method will use the ArrayList method .insert() or .add() to add an element to the end of the list. The .dequeue() method will remove the first element of the list and return it. If speed is a concern then in the .dequeue() method you can set the first element to null instead of removing it but you would need to ensure you will ignore the nulls for the next .dequeue operation. The more common implementation of a Queue is using a LinkedList 89 Views · View Upvotes
