Can a binary tree node have multiple parents?The short and standard answer is: No. But it depends on how you define some words etc. For example if you look at your family: Dad, mum, grandmas, grandpas,. you can see that everyone had mother and father, so this mostly looks like a binary tree with two parents per child where you are the root. But in compsci we usually turn the tree upside down, and define the parent as the end of an edge closer to the root. Another no obvious answer is for the case of immutable data structures where sharing of subtrees is a common technique. In particular two snapshots of one tree can have a pointer to the same node as their child. 141 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
