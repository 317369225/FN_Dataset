Changes should be local in effect meaning in data structure?Changes should be local in effect meaning in data structure? It’s…bad analogy time! Let’s say you want to change the sink in your upstairs bathroom. So you do. And as a result your basement lights are dimmer. That would indicate that something went horribly, horribly wrong. When you change your sink, the only time you should be at all affected is when you’re using the sink. You want your programs to kind of work the same way. Making a small change in file X shouldn’t cause you to make any changes at all to file Y unless it directly deals with the thing in X (and often not even then). Classes should expose behavior, and not have weird side effects. A call to a method called SortStudents should have the effect that the students are sorted. That’s all. It shouldn’t print the students in a sorted order. It shouldn’t write the students to a database. And it should definitely not do anything with any other data than the students that you give it. 162 Views
