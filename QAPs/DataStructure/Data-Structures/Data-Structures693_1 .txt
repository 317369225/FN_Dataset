If I intend to become a software/(back-end) web developer, what are the CS courses other than Data Structures and Algorithms that I have to take?What are the CS courses that I can afford to not take (Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Computer Vision????)? Please rank the courses that helped you on your job or in finding your job.My two suggestions: Databases: You'll need to be comfortable storing and accessing large amounts of data (user data etc) for back end web development. Computer Security: It's definitely a good idea to have an understanding of the basics of security so that you'll at least be able to understand what people are talking about (and if your site is vulnerable) when the next big security problem like heartbleed comes around. 33 Views
