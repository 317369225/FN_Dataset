Find the index when slow and fast pointer meet in terms of n (length of list before cycle) and p (length of loop in linked list)?Thank you very much for A2A. I believe this question can be solved with little bit of imagination. better with some diagrams. Assuming n= no of elements that comes before the loop and p= no of elements that are part of loop. and index of linklist begins from zero. then the index where both of them will meet equals the length of loop. Explaination : I used simple speed ,distance formula to come up with the solution. Distance traveled by slow pointer : n + k [some constant]. Distance traveled by fast pointer : n + p + k [some constant]. now both will require equal time to reach some index. hence, d1/v1=d2/v2. (n+k)/1=(n+k+p)/2. and index of meeting =n+k=p. use an example to confirm this. :) 139 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
