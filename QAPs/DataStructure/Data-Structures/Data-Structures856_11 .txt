How can one be well prepared to answer data structure/algorithm questions in interviews?Based on my experience, I have felt that, rather then arbitrarily searching web for various algorithms & concepts, organizing your study by following a book helps a lot . Do yourself a favor, get a good book & organize your study based on different chapters which might be relevant to you. I referred The Algorithm Design Manual: Steven S Skiena: 9781848000698: Amazon.com: Books which is amazing specially war stories in it. Once you are ready try to solve as much problems as possible, there is no replacement for practice. Sites like HackerRank & CodeEval - Evaluations Made Easy provide great platform for practice. Having said this, I believe that understanding basic data structures, their relevance & visualizing those is of utmost importance. Without that you will be lost in this maze of various problems you might encounter on web. I have tried to answer this as part of question here, I suggest you refer to it: Pawan Bhadauria's answer to How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? 9.6k Views  View Upvotes
