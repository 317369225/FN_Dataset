Is coding not for me if I take long hours to learn to implement a basic Data Structures in C?Should I give up coding?If you're just starting out, it's supposed to take your a long duration to understand what the hell is going on! Especially with C and its pointers and dynamic memory constructs. The fact that you're learning this data structure means youre investing a good amount of time to learn the basics, later on in life that'll help you when you're making your own modifications and implementations. But mostly, you'll get the data structures to use in C++ STL, pre-made, or in whatever language you choose, there might be an implementation you can directly use. So, learning the internals of the DS will strengthen your concepts, but in the future it won't take you hours to code them, you'll probably be using pre build code anyway, and even if you implement the DS yourself, you'll eventually get much better at it. Everyone goes through this at the beginning, don't give up :) 230 Views  View Upvotes
