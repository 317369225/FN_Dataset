How much emphasis should I place on studying data structures and algorithms if my goal is a job in Data Science/Machine Learning?I’m interested in an expert’s opinion on how much focus should I give to getting a good understanding of the various algorithms that are usually tested at tech companies interview processes vs. getting hands-on experience through data science competitions, focusing on learning statistics, etc.You should take them seriously. Although they have become the butt of many jokes due to the incompetent questions asked in a lot of interviews, data structures and algorithms remain the basis of programming skills. Even in ML / DA these things help you out. I would put it up as knowing your tools better. 565 Views  View Upvotes
