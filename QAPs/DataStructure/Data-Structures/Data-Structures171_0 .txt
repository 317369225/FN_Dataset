What are practical applications of doubly ended queues?A doubly ended queue is an abstract data structure that supports insertion and deletion at both the ends. One practical application of deque is to handle data that needs to be pruned after some time. Eg- a browser's history. The recently visited sites are added at one end, say the rear. Now we obviously want a limit on the number of sites which are stored in our history deque. So when that limit is reached, the elements at the front are removed from the deque, to accommodate new insertions. This is where a deque is useful over a stack. But we may also want to remove the newly visited sites at the rear of our history deque. This is where a deque is useful over a queue. So you see, a deque provides the functionality of both a stack and a queue, and is useful where both of them can't provide efficient solution on their own. There are some other applications too like job sceduling, which use a deque. Read about them. Hope it helps! :) 112 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Jitendra Kumhar
