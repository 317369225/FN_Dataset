Is it worthwhile for embedded systems engineers to learn data structures and alogorithms?From this post on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5... Algorithm & Data Processing Vs System Control A software program generally revolves around 2 aspects, ALGORITHM and DATA. Take any program, it would either be computing something (numerically or logically), which is what i refer as Algorithm or it would be working on data. It could be storing data, moving data, processing data or simply presenting or deleting data. Any software .. right from banking, insurance, retail, logistics to simple PC based software like Word, PowerPoint, etc., all of them work on the aforementioned principles. An embedded software is more focused towards controlling and managing the system (or hardware). It is developed to exploit the full potential of the hardware and manage it for the benefit of the user. Though there would be data and algorithm in embedded software, it would be there only to control and manage the hardware in a better fashion. 202 Views  View Upvotes
