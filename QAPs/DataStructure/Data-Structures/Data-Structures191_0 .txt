What is the ratio of read/writes that will make you use an AVL tree instead of a Red Black tree?That’s the wrong question. You would be more interested in the ratio of insertions and deletions to mere lookups because insertions/deletions take longer in an AVL tree while lookups are a little quicker. Even then, I couldn’t give a precise figure. More likely than not, you would have a fairly static structure where insertions and deletions are relatively rare or it is dynamic with nodes being added and remove quite frequently. 167 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
