Are there any algorithms and data structures tutorials where you learn through games?I have googled about sources to teach algorithms and data structures through games but i canâ€™t find , i think it would be more fun and easier if there is. for example : game A with steps a, b, c and when u finish playing it , it describes the actual algorithm behind itIt's meant primarily for kids and I think that it's technically only available in the UK, but The Doctor and the Dalek is a game for tablets and PCs that is supposed to teach CS skills while playing. Link is here: Doctor Who - The Doctor and the Dalek Game - BBC One 246 Views
