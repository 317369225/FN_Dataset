Should a CTO be very good in data structure and algorithms?Nope, not necessarily. If it’s a biotech startup, that would be kinda pointless. And if it’s a large, well established firm where the job of CTO is to be a mouthpiece, then that’s kinda pointless. But yes, if we’re talking about a software startup, that would be a good thing. The CTO should be a technical leader, preferably the strongest technical person in the company. 524 Views · View Upvotes
