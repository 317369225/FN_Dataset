I want to learn algorithms and data structures from scratch. Can I do it all with a book, pencil and a paper?Actually Yes, I don’t know how others learnt but I always had a scrabble pad and a pen or a pencil around when I learnt algorithms and data structure, and the best part is to learn it from the books. I will tell you why when you go over the internet you will find many resources and many good explanation to many good concepts but it will vary from sources to sources which may confuse you. When it comes to Algorithms there are some classic book which are being followed form ages which must have got some great concepts with explanation for which the books are popular. The most famous of them is Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. corman. It has the best of ways in which an algorithm can be explained and the best way to learn it is by trying it out in a paper then try to implement it in your computer. Now coming to data structure, this is one of my best topics as a computer science grad, and its is considered to be the backbone of programming because no problems are solved without using any data structure and when it comes to learning it, pen and paper is must and the best book which I have read so far is “Data Structures using C by Reema Thareja”. It comes with best of logic and varied range of example which will guide you through scratch to being a pro. The best part of this book is that it also holds the pre-requisite lessons which we need to know before digging into data structure. So before jumping into this big sea called “Internet” just give it a try and yes with a pen and a scrabble pad. You can find these books easily in your college’s library.
