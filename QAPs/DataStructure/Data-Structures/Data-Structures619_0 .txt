How do you write a program to implement a queue using array?You can keep two indexes, head and tail to point to the current head and tail of the queue. You have to update them when you insert an element in the queue or take an element out. Please note, there are certain disadvantages of implementing an array as queue. Deleting an element from the head of the array has serious overhead and should not be recommended. So, the other alternative would be to let the array grow and keep updating the head and tail. This can lead to the array growing too large if there are many insertions. Given a choice, I would prefer using a list to implement a queue. If you have a fair idea of how much memory you would require initially, the best approach would be have the list itself allocated in a array. This reduces the overhead of dynamic memory allocation that you would otherwise require. 200 Views  View Upvotes
