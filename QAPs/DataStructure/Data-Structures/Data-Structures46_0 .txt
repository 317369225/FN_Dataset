How do I learn the Data Structure effectively?Thanks for A2A. If you are a beginner then- Find a book with good explanation (Like- Data Structures by S K Shrivastav in C) . Read one Data Structure thoroughly. Code it (keeping book with you) and try to understand the code. Now code it without book. Then find simple problems solvable using that Data Structure and try to solve them.Firstly it will be hard for you,see editorials and solutions and then code the same. After some time you will start developing your logics. http://geeksforgeeks.com is a good platform to try problems related to data structures and good editorials are also given there. Solve as many problems as you can related to that DS. Keep calm,Have patience (Remember we are programmers,patience is the key to success). According to me you should learn Data Structures in following order- Stack Linked List (Singly,Doubly,Circular) Queue(along with DEQUE) Binary Tree Binary Search Tree Heap Graph Advanced Data Structures (Segment Tree,Binary Indexed Tree,Trie….etc) If you basic understanding of all the Data Structures then try to solve practice problems on online coding platforms like- Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming http://geeksforgeeks.com #AllTheBest #HappyCoding 170 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Ajay Kumar Dubasi
