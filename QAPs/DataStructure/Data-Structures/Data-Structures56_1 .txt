Why is it quicker (O1) to find an item in a list through hashing (hashmap), than it is do go directly to the item that you're looking for?For clarification: Why is accessing an item in a python3 list, by index slower than accessing one in a dictionary, by key?Your question is not very clear. What do you mean by “go directly”? If you already have a reference to the thing you are looking for, which is the only way you can go directly, then you can reach it in O(0), so why are you using a hash map? On the other hand, if you are using a linear search, the difference is between looking someone up in a telephone directory and searching through the telephone directory starting at page 1. A hash map is effectively a telephone directory indexed by nickname. The hash is a unique nickname you derive for each Object, and you do a standard dictionary lookup using the nickname. Without the nickname, you have an unsorted list of Objects and you have to go through one by one until you find the one you want. 411 Views · View Upvotes
