What is a "forest data structure"?A forest is a (potentially empty) set of trees. A tree (T) is a special type of graph that satisfies the following conditions: - T is connected and has no cycles - T contains no cycles, and adding any edge to T would create a cycle - T is connected and has n - 1 edges - â€¦ among many other sufficient conditions. If we take the union of a collection of trees (assuming disjoint vertex sets), we form a graph for which each connected component is a tree. That graph is a forest. 114 Views
