What is the difference between node* next & node *next?I am working on linked list and I got stuck with this ……If there is a difference between the two could someone just explain it to me.(if possible diagrammatically to understand in a better way.)Both are same mate. The statement node* next was used by Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementor of C++. int* p and int *p always works same. Both works absolutely similar. It’s a general convention used by programmers. 143 Views · View Upvotes
