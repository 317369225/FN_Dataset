What is the role of heap memory?I want to mess around with my PC by writing infinite looping “for” on my code, said that it will run forever until it runs out of heap, I don’t understand how it works. all I know that it display message like exception handling (out of bound, mismatch etc)There are two basic forms of memory used for temporary data storage: stack and heap. Stack memory is allocated for variables when a function commences and is reclaimed when the function returns. Additional stack memory can be allocated during the running of the function. Heap memory is a little more permanent. It can be allocated from anywhere in the program and when the memory allocation function is called, it returns an address which is stored in a pointer variable. This memory is available for the program as long as the programmer wants. However, if the pointer variable gets overwritten or the address is otherwise lost then that bit of memory can’t be used anymore. It is either reclaimed by the “garbage collector” (if the program has one) or it forms a “memory leak” (lost memory). When memory from the heap is no longer required, it should be properly disposed of if there is no garbage collector. 247 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Mario Saputra
