Where can I find really easy and fast understanding of all data structures and algorithms?Umm, if you can find the book, “Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 2nd edition” by Robert Lafore is good, It has all the data structures I know of: basic + heaps, priority queues, graphs, graph traversal (weighted and non weighted), binary search trees, Balanced trees, (red black, 234 trees), B-trees for external storage, hash tables, also having recursion algorithms and sorting algorithms (all the standard ones atleast) Fulfills the points given in the question details: Has good explanation, mostly with real examples too. You must read fast though, it has 600-odd useful pages! (including 70+ pages of Java code) Less time: start from the 60th or so page if you know Java, or read chapter 1 if you don’t. Yes, there are coding examples in there. Tips for coding interview: It does have some points where it says that you should make sure to (xyz) or NOT to (abcd), that might be helpful in quite a few places! Approaches: For the practice problems they will be given, not for the exercises at the end of the book. If you do wish to follow the book as mentioned above, details: The version i used for DSA during that semester was only 5 MB in size. If you cannot find it, do PM me. Foo, bar, and Have fun! 91 Views
