When is the use of a break statement unavoidable within a loop?While trying to prove my Programming III teacher wrong I realized that breaks can be substituted by properly thought while and do while control structures, Is there any instance where the situation calls for a For loop and the use of the break statement is unavoidable?You can always structure the loop so that a break statement is avoided. In fact the Pascal language was designed according to the principle that “all code blocks have exactly one exit”. There was no break, continue, or return statement in Pascal. (Oddly, there was a goto). Suppose you had a while or for loop with a break in it. Create an additional boolean variable shouldBreak set to false. Now add “or shouldBreak” to the loop condition. At the point where you want to break, set shouldBreak to true, and put everything after it in a conditional that only runs if shouldBreak is false. The result is code that does the exact same thing, but without the break. This structure may be less intuitive, or more difficult to read than a version with break in it, which is the exact opposite of the Pascal intent. So, you are correct, break statements are not a necessary part of a language. At the same time, used judiciously, they can make the code simpler and more intuitive. 388 Views · View Upvotes
