What's the best way to teach "Algorithms and data structures"?Next year I will be teaching course named “Algorithms and data structures” for two groups of students in my university. I was given the possibility to change the way this course is taught.Accompany theory with current implementations at known organizations after well research. For example, associating the menu or back buttons of browser with some DS. It helps, its funny and it will make each class interesting. My faculties opened theories and I did not learn a single thing from them. Having presence of mind, knowledge of industry implementations and good communication skills with visualization will help any one, even noobs. This advise and request is from me. May all teachers be like this I pray. And I completely agree with Sai Krishna Srigiriraju on his response. 32 Views
