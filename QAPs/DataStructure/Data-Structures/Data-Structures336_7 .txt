A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?If you Google “Programming Language Popularity” you will see that C++ trails far behind Java. Having learned both (and many others), My recommendation has two parts: 1) Start with Java rather than C++ and learn it well. It is strongly typed and can do pretty much everything that C++ can do and it is in far higher demand. 2) Then learn JavaScript which has similar roots (Java, C++ and JavaScript all are C derivatives), but JavaScript is very weakly typed and runs in the browser. Java doesn’t (or at least not well). By learning the strengths and weaknesses of two similar but very different languages, you will position yourself well to learn other languages when the time comes. Bottom line, your knowledge of any single language or technology is not nearly as important as your ability to learn-to-learn. Technology changes rapidly. What will keep your head above water is learning how to develop a life-long habit of continuous learning. 316 Views · View Upvotes
