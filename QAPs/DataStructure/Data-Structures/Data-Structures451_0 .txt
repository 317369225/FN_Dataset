Which structure of protein is responsible for enzyme activity and structure?For enzymes to function they need to have the correct structure on all 4 levels of organization, the primary secondary and tertiary levels. Generally, enzymes have a specific binding pocket in which the side chains weaken bonds or position substrated in order to react. The structure is extremely imprtant for this, and conformational changes are sometimes used in enzyme inhibiting drugs or self regulation systems to prevent enzyme activity 30 Views  Answer requested by Usama Nasir
