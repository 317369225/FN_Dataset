What language is best for the Google interview based on built-in methods and data structures that do the work for me?Python has alot of methods I like but Java has LinkedList built in, etc. Please explain why.You can’t depend on that. If you do, the interviewer will vary the problem in such a way as to remove the safety net. I personally did this in interviews, when I thought the candidate was relying too much on people who had already solved the problem. In my personal opinion, this is a variant on the question of “If I can look it up, why do I have to know it?”. Original work comes from knowing what went before well enough to know that it’s not a great fit for the problem at hand, and that something better is possible. If you don’t know what won’t work well, you can’t invent what will. Be a problem solver, not a parrot. 1.5k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Joel De La Cruz
