What is the Best book for data structures consisting of solved examples?Thanks for A2A. But remember there is no best book exists on anything. Considering a simple program of Java i.e. Hello World, you will see how the same program has been explained by different authors. You should read different books on Java not for program but for explanation of logic with unearthing the concept in several different ways. Coming back to question, this question has been answered several times on Qu0ra and internet forums. So here, I will go with my favorite book, Data Structures and Algorithms in Java by Robert Lafore. Why this one? Totally easy to understand explanation of each mentioned concept. For steps or logic, no need to refer to other books while studying from this unlike CLRS. No pseudocode. All full and runnable programs are present in the book. Also applets are there in CD. That’s why I love this book. Hope this helps ! 163 Views · Answer requested by Yusuf Jamil
