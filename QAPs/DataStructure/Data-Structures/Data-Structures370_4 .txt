Why should I learn data structures and algorithms since there is a collection concept in Java?Even if you have collections in Java, you will have to have some idea about how the collections are implemented inside so that you can use the correct collection /algorithm for a particular problem. Some solutions may require you to use a hashmap while some other problem may need you to use an array list. It is always better to know the pros and cons of each algorithms so that you can make the correct decision. 68 Views
