Why are the candidates not evaluated on frameworks like Spring, Hibernate along with problem solving skills using Algorithms and Data Structures?Based on the interview testimonials, the technology leaders like Google, Facebook and Amazon generally evaluate candidates solely on problem solving using Algorithms and Data structures. Do they use frameworks like Spring, Hibernate and other Java EE solutions?It depends purely on the need of recruiter. I they feel testing your skills just on Algorithms is enough they may not go framework and technology related questions. Interviewers have always surprised me . They ask core java when i prepare for Spring . And ask spring when i prepare core java. And some interviewers surprise with puzzles and performance tuning questions. So its purely their mood and their need. Just be prepared for the worst to come. Best of Luck!! 67 Views
