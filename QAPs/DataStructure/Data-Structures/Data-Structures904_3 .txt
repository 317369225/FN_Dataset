Is there a theory of data structures?When learning data structures, most topics seem very specific, independent and unique. Are there any efforts to create a general theory, a framework for thinking about data structures?Data structures are critical for algorithm design. I would recommend studying algorithms, and classifying which data structures work best for which algorithm technique. When you are done with sequential algorithms. You can move to parallel algorithms. 78 Views
