What should I learn in data structure in 100 hours?These are the list of basic data structures and algorithms to start with 1.Array: insertion, deletion, merging, shifting etc. 2.Linked list: create, insert, delete, traversal, reverse, doubly linked list etc. 3.Sorting algorithms : bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, radix sort, count sort etc. 4.Searching algorithms : binary search, linear search, ternary search 5.String Matching algorithms: kmp, booye-moore , robinkarp technique etc. 6.Greedy algorithms: activity selection , scheduling train time etc. 7.Dynamic Programing : LCS, fibonacci, knapsack, matrix multiplication, bellman-ford, coin change problem, state space problems etc. 8.Tree : binary tree create insert delete, inorder preorder postorder levelorder traversal, height etc. 9.Graph: creat , adjecency list , adjecency matrix , BFS ,DFS, flow algorithms(if you want) etc. 10.Hashing techniques: linear and non-linear 11.Advanced : segment tree, RMQ, lazy propagation, binary indexed tree, bit masking(dp) etc. 12.Number theory: gcd, euler totent, sieve of eratosthinis, modular arithmatic, nCr mod p etc. Last but not the least analysis of algorithms that is compexity. I think 100 hours will be enough for this Happy coding :p . 933 Views  View Upvotes
