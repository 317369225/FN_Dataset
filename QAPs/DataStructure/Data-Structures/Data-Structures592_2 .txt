What is the role of heap memory?I want to mess around with my PC by writing infinite looping “for” on my code, said that it will run forever until it runs out of heap, I don’t understand how it works. all I know that it display message like exception handling (out of bound, mismatch etc)int main() { for (int i=0;i<100;) { void *ptr = malloc(16000); } } That should do it.
