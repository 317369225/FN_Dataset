Can I convert a singly linklist to any form (i.e doubly or triple) linklist while the program is running?Can doubly link-list’s node dynamically be created from defined singly link-list structure (i.e can such a structure be made which will make any kind of link-list’s node as per our wish during run-time) simplified answers requested answers related to C++ is helpfulYes you can . About 2 years ago I created a data structure which was analogous to a linked star network. Now the node structure I used was… typedef struct node { int info; struct node **p; }dataNode; All the end nodes needed only three pointers one to center and other two for adjacent nodes while the center node needed 7 pointers 6 for all end nodes and 1 for next hexagon. so you can dynamically allocate number of pointers you need. Use the above structure and and following code for creating double or triple or N linked list . dataNode *n; n=(dataNode*)malloc(sizeof(dataNode)); if(n==NULL){ // create some logic for Allocation Errors } //for N Linked List n->p=(dataNode**)malloc(N*sizeof(dataNode*)); Example: Triple Linked List n->p=(dataNode**)malloc(3*sizeof(dataNode*)); This will create p[3] of type dataNode*; so you can save pointer to 3 nodes here. Now to create a N Linked list from single Linked List all you have to do is create a function that takes a pointer to the head node of the single linked list and a number indicating the ’N’ of N linked list. Rest is your work. 35 Views
