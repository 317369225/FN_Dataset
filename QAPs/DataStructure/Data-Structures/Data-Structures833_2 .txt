Which trie data structures must one learn while learning programming, given there are so many?There are so many tries! - R-tries, ternary tries, PATRICIA tries, suffix tries, X-tries, Y-tries, and many more! Which are the most modern ones that are heavily used in the industry, and are asked in SDE interviews?Probably none of them. If there are so many, it means that there is essentially an infinite set to keep from, and a new variant happens to pop out every day someone wakes up hight. (I wonder who Patricia is… ahah…) Industries will be interested on the concept (that’s one and only one), and on the fact you are aware there are variants and know some (2, 3 ??) of them. Everything else you can learn as needed. 108 Views
