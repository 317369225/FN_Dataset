How do I design a data structure to store sets, efficiently add new sets and, given any set, check if we have already stored any of its subsets?I can think of two data structures: hash table and a bloom filter. A bloom filter is implemented using hashing functions similar to a hash table. They also have similar running times; best case they run in constant time for all operations. however, whereas a hash table stores the elements in the data structure a bloom filter does not; the purpose of a bloom filter is to check if an element is probably in a set or definitely not. Now the fact your problem lies with each element in or data structure being a set makes little difference. In fact, it's a frequently dealt with problem in SE. You can try for yourself. Java already has implementations for hash tables you can use and I'm sure there is a bloom filter implementation in the Google core libraries for Java. 206 Views  View Upvotes
