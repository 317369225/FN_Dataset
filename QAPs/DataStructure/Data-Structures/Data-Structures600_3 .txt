What should I know as a computer science student?I am a freshman and aim at getting into Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Capegemini, TCS, Infosys, etc. However I don't know what all knowledge should I have to pass rounds I have a clear understanding of c++ and java. I am in a 3rd tier college. So have to apply off- campus. Provide a guideline. Thanks.Hello there, First of all freshman means 10th std and not college 1st year. Please correct that. Coming to your question, you face the same dilemma many thousands of young bloods face. So calm down. Knowing all the semantics of a language or two doesn't mean that the person is a great programmer. But those top tier companies like Google Microsoft Apple hire only the best and the best are great problem solvers not memorizing maniacs. Psuedo code can get you selected in those interviews because the approach to the problem matters more than the implementation in an interview. So to get this kind of knowledge you must stumble upon problems that make you think like that. They won't knock your door so go find them in hundreds of free competitive programming portals. Euler's project is my favorite although it's not really competitive programming. Later on you achieve mastery by going deep into stuff. So for the love of God, Just code. PS: please remove the service companies like tcs, CTS from the list because you don't need to do anything mentioned here to be a sheep in that group. PPS: I was a sheep too. 222 Views  View Upvotes
