Is there any data modeling pattern for versioning changes on data (not schema) of 50GB database with 300 tables?Some databases modify record only logically. In reality record is not updated but inserted anew. Deleted record is marked for delete and later garbage collected. My point is multivertioning can be implemented by keeping old versions of records and synching them in realtime with hostory db. 62 Views  Answer requested by Samur Ara
