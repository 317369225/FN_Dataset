Are structures in C-language similar to objects in Java?Structures in C wraps only the attributes of the objects only , ignoring the methods or behaviour . Also there is no concept of access modifier in it. So its the POD (Plain Old Data) and its used for light weight objects or simply structures. In Java , objects have both attributes and behaviour wrapped in it. It a pure object and since C is not OO , it offers only structure as a compound type. 62 Views  View Upvotes
