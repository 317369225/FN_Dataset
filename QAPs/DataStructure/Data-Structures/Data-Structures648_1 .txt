What should be the steps for a beginner to learn data structures?Please don't merge this Q. I didn't get my answer anywhere. Let I wanna learn BST,randomized BST, Hashing,UFDS,Segment tree,Fenwick tree,Treap,LCA,HLD,MO,Trie,Suffix array,AVL tree,Splay tree etc. What should be the step by step process?I mean will it be easier to learn seg tree if I learn BST first?Here are some great resources to learn the basics of data structure and algorithms - CLRS Book - Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition: Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein: 9780262033848: Amazon.com: Books Online Course by Stanford University - https://www.coursera.org/course/... andhttps://www.coursera.org/course/... MIT OCW - Lecture Videos and Slides - Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503) These resources will lay a great theoretical foundation and explain the underlying concept of each data structure. These sources do not involve any implementation which is why I recommend them. You can learn from here and then implement them by yourself. Geekforgeeks and many other blogs discuss only the code and mentions the time complexity. The underlying theory and derivation of time complexity is often missing in most cases. As such I wouldn't recommend them to a noob. People who are already comfortable with the basics can directly jump to codes and learn topics quickly from these online blogs. 102 Views
