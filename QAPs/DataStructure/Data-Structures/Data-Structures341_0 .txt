What is the best language to implement data structures quickly in a coding interview?Just pick up a language that you are most comfortable with, in terms of the syntax, and practice the implementation of the data structures in it. Dont try to show off that you know XYZ cool programming language, you might not be entirely comfortable using it, especially on a white board. So, save yourself the embarrassment and go with the language you are most comfortable with. Try to show off your knowledge of the data structure, which is more important in an interview, most of the time i think, rather than your knowledge about some cool programming language. 106 Views
