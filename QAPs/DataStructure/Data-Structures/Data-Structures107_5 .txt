Why is a lookup in a hash data structure so fast (O(1))?Look-up and insertion into hash tables is fast because the hash data structure has been designed to be that way. That being said, collisions may occur in hash tables. These collisions may make either the Look-up or insertion non-constant, so constant lookup time for hash tables is not guaranteed. I believe that the ins and outs of the hash table data structure have been explained best on the Hash table Wikipedia page: Hash table. Also if you want to learn about hash tables, you should look up some youtube videos on them as well as Corman’s Introduction to Algorithms book that is available in pdf online. 95 Views · View Upvotes
