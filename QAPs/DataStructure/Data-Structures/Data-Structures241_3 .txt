What language is best for the Google interview based on built-in methods and data structures that do the work for me?Python has alot of methods I like but Java has LinkedList built in, etc. Please explain why.I think Python is a really good language for interviews. It’s simple, fairly expressive, and most people know it. I have had issues where interviewers asked me not to use built-in methods and data structures to solve certain interview questions, but for the most part it greatly speeds up solutions. As a fairly regular interviewer myself, I don’t really gain anything from watching someone deal with more ungainly hashmap APIs in languages like Java. That said, you might want to have another popular language or two in your back pocket. I’ve been asked during an interview to use Java instead of Python. No one really cares if you get the syntax exactly right in that situation, so it’s fine as long as you’re somewhat familiar with it. 362 Views
