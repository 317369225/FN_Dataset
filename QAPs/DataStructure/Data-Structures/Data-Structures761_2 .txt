Should l learn existing algorithms or try to reinvent them by myself?Thanks for the A2A. Existing algorithms are like the english alphabets. Only if you learn them you can think of how to make a better optimal algorithm than them. What if your reinvention algo is already present? So if your really keen to make one, i better suggest you to go for specialisation / higher studies on DS & Algorithms where you can have an R&D on each categories very deeply & you will finally make one. 162 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sourabh Khandelwal
