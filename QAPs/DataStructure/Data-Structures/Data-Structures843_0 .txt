Is the heap size all the remaining nodes connected to the root node down to the leaves?The length of an array is the number of elements in the array and the heap-size is how many elements are stored within A. I’m trying to understand this. In my example, if i is the current index which is at 2, then the heap-size are the elements within the red? I’m not sure here can some one helpThe heap size is the number of things in the heap. In the drawing, that would be all 10 items. However, a heap is a recursive structure. The subtree rooted at index 2 is itself a heap, too. The size of that heap would be 6 (all items in the red circle). 182 Views
