How can I learn algorithms and data structures from scratch?How to master data structures and algorithms from scratch - It's a three step process really. 1. Study- Pretty simple right? To learn something, you need to study it first. Get a book that you feel comfortable with, and start studying it smartly. Studying smartly involves focusing on certain aspects that the book won't emphasize for you. While studying a data structure, also study what benefits it may provide in a scenario and where it may not prove to be efficient enough. Same with the algorithms. The books i suggest are Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen for algorithms and some advanced data structures. For data structures, i read Data Structures with C by Seymour Lipschutz. It was good. You should also try GeeksforGeeks website. It has a large amount of quality content related to algorithms and data structures. 2. Practice- This one requires some work. After you have studied a topic, you need to practice on it to further your understanding of it. Try competitive coding websites like Codechef, Topcoder, Hackerrank or the others and try to solve as many problems as you can of a domain. 3. Repeat See the third step is so easy! All the best! :) 2k Views  View Upvotes
