Where is knowledge of data structures useful in Swift?I have been a Swift developer for less than a year now, but I have never came across a problem set that required knowledge of data structures. I occasionally read about it yet with no practical use case. Also people recommend this book which I haven’t read. Can anyone share examples of DS use case?Data structures that are most useful in Swift would be your basic types - “Lists” and “Maps”. In Swift, that would be your basic “Array” and “Dictionary” (HashMap) types. It is in general unlikely that you would be using more advanced data structures than this in Swift since Swift is mostly a front-end client that takes data from a server and displays it. There is also NSHashTable (now just HashTable) that is like a HashMap where the key and the value stored are the same. You might use it to find/remove duplicates from in array or something like that. I actually got asked that question and couldn’t give the answer. That being said, Swift is just a programming language, and so you can use it for anything you want, so all data structures are as useful (or not useful) there as anywhere else, depending on your purposes. Some people who know swift might want to take a data-structures and algorithms course in a language that they already know - ie. Swift. That seems to be the origin of this website you have linked. Also, it doesn’t seem that you need to buy that book. Looks like all the topics are available online: Learn Hash Table Algorithms with Swift 180 Views · View Upvotes
