Is one year enough to prepare well for ACM ICPC?I’ m mediocre programmer so far, I can solve easy and sometimes medium level questions on OJs. I know to implement simple algos and DS like Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees. Would one year(assuming I start from now) be enough to learn all algos and DS(of CLRS) & crack atleast the ICPC regionals?Hi. I'm a mediocre programmer too, aspiring for acm icpc. I too still have only one year left. Always remeber “ITS NEVER TOOO LATE TO START ANYTHING” ..Don't loose confidence in yourself. Check out the answer to below question by Anudeep Nekkanti himself who made it to the world finals of acm icpc from a 3-tier college.
