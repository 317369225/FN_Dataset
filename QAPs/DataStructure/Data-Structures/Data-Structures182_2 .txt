When should a binary search tree be used in an algorithm/problem?BSTs are used for associative lookups. The alternative data structure for associative lookups is a hash table. Exact key lookup, insertion, and deletion are faster with a hash table. Looking up the least upper bound or greatest lower bound of a key is faster with a BST. The memory used by a BST is proportionate to the number of elements it contains in a typical implementation. Not generally so with a hash table. 166 Views  View Upvotes
