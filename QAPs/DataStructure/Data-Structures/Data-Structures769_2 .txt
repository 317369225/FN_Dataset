I'm trying to be a self taught programmer. What should be the correct flow of online courses I should take or books I should read?It totally depends on what kind of a programmer you want to be. Others here have given some valuable and detailed information for you to read up on, so I’ll cut my answer short. However, my advice would be to take it slowly. Just remember these things :- DON’T TRY TO LEARN ALL LANGUAGES AT ONCE. No one becomes a programmer overnight. That happens only in movies. Motivation is an important factor when it comes to learning anything. Remember why you want to do this, make sure its a valid reason. Learn by doing. Build stuff. Watching tutorials isn’t going to get you anywhere. Develop the ability to grasp the mechanisms and concepts. Knowing syntax is good, but don’t depend on it. Identify what 20% of a language you need to learn and get going. You can master it later. Finally contribute to open source. Don’t be content with being a big fish in a little pond.
