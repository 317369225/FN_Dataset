To place within top 3 in the next ICPC regional, what would you suggest a medium level coder who has enough knowledge?I am answering this question based on my experience in ACM-ICPC Dhaka regional. If you are not trying from Dhaka Regional, then this answer is probably not for you. First of all, do you really want to be in top 3 of ICPC regional? Do you really want to go through all that trouble and hard work. Before you say yes, bear in mind that many great programmers in our country didn’t make it to world finals only because of bad luck. Anything can and will go wrong in the contest and one silly mistake may destroy your whole day. I don’t have many things to suggest, as stated in the question, that the coder has enough knowledge. So i would suggest that practice hard, and when i say hard i mean practice like your life depends on it. Try to emulate as close to contest as possible. Join a team, try to be in the best team for you(Not the best overall, the best team is where you would be able to give your best). Make up a team strategy. Figure out your weakness and find a strategy to guard it. Divide the topics among the team-members such that each topic has a specialist in your team. Then take part in a lot of contests. Use only one pc for coding. Make a team reference document. Upsolve the contest after it is finished(Suppose a member has solved some problem. The others should upsolve it after contest). If a contest went bad then discuss what went wrong and how to develop from there. Try against other senior teams not only from your university but from the whole country. Run some collaborative contests and invite them, it is good practice for both of you. Take part in online contests like TC/CF/HR/CC. They give high quality problems and be sure to upsolve the unsolved. And finally have a winning strategy. If you don’t have any you will probably lose. 2.8k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
