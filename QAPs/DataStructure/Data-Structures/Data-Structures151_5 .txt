Is it worth paying $3,000 more just to take a Data Structures and Algorithms course?$3000 for a course that won’t count towards your degree?? Both maths and logic seems to be taking a hit today! You like learning from books. You have been reading CLRS. You are able to understand and use algorithms. We call that self-learning. Most good programmers are self-taught. Do not restrict yourselves within the walls of your classrooms. Mentioning an Algorithms course on your resume is going to have next-to-zero impact. Especially when one can take an online course from MIT or Stanford for free. Instead, take that knowledge, build something impressive, and put that in the resume. 4.6k Views · View Upvotes
