Should l learn existing algorithms or try to reinvent them by myself?I would suggest you to learn as much existing algorithms as you can first, so that you will have an understanding of factors to consider while developing your own algorithm like constraints . And also there are many algorithms already developed, so better you don’t waste your time to re-invent them. Also you can get a new idea from each of the algorithms, so first analyse them. Good Luck..:) 203 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Sourabh Khandelwal
