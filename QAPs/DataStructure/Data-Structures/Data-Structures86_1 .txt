What should one prepare if data structure is my area of interest in an interview?I think you need to focus on : -> Structure,enum and Union -> Stack and Queue -> Trees -> Linked List (Different types) -> Arrays -> Pointers -> Sorting Algorithms -> Searching Algorithms -> Memory Allocation functions You need to prepare programs(examples/implementation) for these concepts. Few of the questions could be w.r.t: -> Best Sorting Algo -its Time Efficiency [ Learn to trace it by taking an example ] -> Differences between Stack and Queue -> Differences between Structure and Union -> Differences between Queue and LinkedList -> Advantages,Disadvantages and Applications of Pointers, Linked List -> Applications of stack and Queue -> Implementation of Linked List using Stack/Queue -> Infix,Prefix and Postfix concepts with examples -> Differences between the memory allocation functions -> Types in Linked List [ know the code to implement it ] 125 Views  Answer requested by 1 person
