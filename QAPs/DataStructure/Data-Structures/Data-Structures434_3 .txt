What coding exercises and language build strong programming skills, adaptability and increased mental acuity?Just like learning scales and tablature on a piano develops strong musical skill and leads to highly transferable skill what is the best excercises and language for programmers.There are “coding katas” in many languages (you can find them via search or youtube), or books of the series "cookbook" from oreilly, but I think that approach exercize just some of tricks in the bag of a professional. I think the premise that practicing piano(piano comes to mind) and computer programming are the same thing or even close, sounds not that much correct/useful to me. The point for me is that efficient/fast writing is not the same as good program architecture. Programming, or better, developing software, is more like composing music, but we don’t program for theoretical/abstract people needs, we solve real problems, usually on the business or technical domain(knowing the domain is a real plus, worth investing your time and is “transferable”). I argue that strong people skills are more advantageous because people needs to trust the developer to collaborate at the problem solution(giving good requirements and positive feedback), and I argue that sales skills are more “transferable” than the syntax of algebraic data types of OCaml. To level up as a developer one needs to understand underlying principles, like algorithms, networking, functional and OO programming, actual implementations of servers and clients, architecture of real software and so on and that is just the technical part, there is a business part and a relational part. So, my conclusion is that while that kind of training may be useful, is just a small part of what one needs in real life. 246 Views
