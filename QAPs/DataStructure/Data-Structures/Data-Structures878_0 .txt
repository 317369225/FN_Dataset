Do we need to study Data Structures before taking MIT 6.006 "Introduction to Algorithms"?In 4th lecture "Heaps and Heap Sort" the instructor taught about heap without telling about Trees.Looking at the syllabus, I would say you're expected to know how to program and know basics such as stacks, queues, arrays, and linked lists. Other data structures such as trees and hash tables are explained in the course, so you wouldn't have to know them ahead of time. 596 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Abhishek Shukla
