How much proficiency in data structure and algorithm is more than enough to get into Google/Facebook and what should be 4 month strategy to learn it?I would like to know of a proper strategy using various online judges like Topcoder, Codechef, SPOJ along with online tutorials/courses from udacity/coursera and some list of books(if needed, like Introduction to Algorithms (book), Cracking the Coding Interview (2011 book) ) etc. Detailed Plan pls..You need to perform at 1200+ rating level on Topcoder. Or 1700+ at codeforces (back when Div1 started at 1700. Consistently. That typically requires you to solve 500+ problems on online judges. Obviously, that number depends on the difficulty of problems. Anecdotally, more than 50% of algorithmic problems in Google interviews have an element of Dynamic Programming. Most counting/optimization problems do. You should read CLRS extensively. Programming Pearls as well. I’ve heard great things about InterviewBit. It’s supposed to cover the basics of all topics that you need to know. Interviews are notoriously unpredictable. A lot of people that work at Google failed their FB interviews and vice versa. Interview with as many companies as possible to level out the noise. 810 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Abhishek Raj
