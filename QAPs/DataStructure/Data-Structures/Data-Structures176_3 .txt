Why is the time complexity of Insertion and Deletion in Singly Linked List Big O(1)?Because the insertion and deletion operation in a singly linked list takes constant time. that is the running time to these two operations does not depend on the input size. (to insert and delete couple of operations including changes in the pointer values is to be done , time taken by which is independent of the input size). (it takes O(1) only when the pointer is given to where the insertion or deletion is to be made in the linked list otherwise first the location where insertion or deletion has to be done is to be found out which might take O(n) time) 75 Views
