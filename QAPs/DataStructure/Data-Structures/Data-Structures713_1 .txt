What is data structures?The programs or applications always use/access data. In simple words data structure refers to how the data is being stored in the program. The ideal scenario is to store the data in such a way that it takes minimum memory and minimum access time. Data consuming less memory reduces the memory requirements (space complexity) and fast access to them makes the overall application run fast. Data structure is a way to model the data so that they can be efficiently used in the program and improve the efficiency of the program at the same time making life easier for the programmer. One more thing is that while choosing a data structure the access time is a bigger concern then the memory consumed by them so a data structure which takes more memory but gives a faster access is preferred over the one which takes less memory but more access time. 226 Views  View Upvotes
