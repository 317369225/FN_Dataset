Is there any data modeling pattern for versioning changes on data (not schema) of 50GB database with 300 tables?ANSI SQL 2011 provides support for ‘Temporal Databases’ MS SQL Server supports this, as does DB2 for IBM i, as of the recent IBM i 7.3 release. A temporal database allows you to query the database ‘as it was’ at a previous point in time. When ever a row is inserted, updated or deleted, the content of each version of the record is retained and has a start and end time (end time may be unbounded) until the record is updated or deleted in the future, which then sets the end time. You can then add a time element to a query or set the time for your entire connection to the database. This allows applications that are not aware of temporal support to see an historical view of the database. See Temporal database and google SQL Temporal Database for more information. Alternatively, it may be sufficient to have an audit trail of prior changes to the database. Most RDBMS’s have a logging function whose purpose is to assure data recovery. In the case of IBM i (and perhaps others) this logging function (known as ‘Journaling’) also can be used as an audit trail and changes made in the past can be interrogated, although not in as direct a fashion as using SQL with Temporal databases. 130 Views
