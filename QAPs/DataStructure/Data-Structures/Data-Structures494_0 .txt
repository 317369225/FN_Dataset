Should I first learn data structures and algorithms and then c++, or the other way round?I want to learn C++ fully and do competitive programming, I have some knowledge of C++, good enough to solve basic problems on Code forces.Full C++ means objective programming, which is not useful in competitive programming, for CP you’ll be using only “C-like” part of C++. So, “learning C++ fully” are two separate cases: 1. Getting proficient in coding, exercising in order to write faster, make less bugs, be able to write more complicated code etc. This is what you need for competitive programming and probably the best way to learn it is to learn by the by when you learn algorithms, by implementing new algorithms you’ve learned and solving the problems on Spoj, Codeforces and the likes. 2. Learning objective paradigm features of C++ and the principles of object oriented design. This is independent either from CP or from learning algorithms, you can do that before, after or however you like. 166 Views · View Upvotes
