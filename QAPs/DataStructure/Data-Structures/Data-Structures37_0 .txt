How can I structure a new React project?I have a lot of experience with Angular, Grunt, CoffeeScript, npm, bower, etc. Given that it’s a pure front end project, what’s the best way to get started?The best way to get started, especially for someone who has a lot of experience in other technologies, is to simply pick a boilerplate (or yeoman generator) and to start from there. This will give you a fully workable skeleton of a project, including the relevant structure. Here are some good ones to start: kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate - Boilerplate to create react projects that ‘compile’ to a single distributed JS file. kriasoft/react-starter-kit - Boilerplate to create react projects that are isomorphic (ie. contains server side rendering as well). react-webpack-generators/generator-react-webpack - This is my favourite. It’s not as popular is the previous two, but I feel it is much easier to understand. Bonus - it comes with a yeoman generator to create new components. 18 Views · View Upvotes
