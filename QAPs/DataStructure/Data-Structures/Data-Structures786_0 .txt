Am I a bad programmer if I can't implement a Binary Tree using loops?I only can with Recursion. Is that bad?What do you mean you can’t do it? The bar for programming isn’t generating a perfect solution off the top of your head without looking anything up. Try to break the problem down. Write out a few test cases in your language of choice to make sure that a binary tree implementation would have the correct behavior. Think about what should happen when you an add element to an empty tree. Think about what should happen when you try to an add an element that is already in the tree. Think about the invariant that a binary tree is supposed to preserve. The elements should be in order after every operation you perform (e.g. insertion) Add explicit invariant checks to the unit tests you wrote above. If you go through that exercise you’ll have a decent understanding of what insertion is supposed to do and a way to check that your binary search tree does what it’s supposed to do. 34 Views
