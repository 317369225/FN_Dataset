I don't know how to implement data structures like graphs, trees etc. Can I take the Stanford course on Analysis of Algorithm without this knowledge?Stanford’s Analysis of Algorithms course focuses more on theoretical part of Algorithms. You can understand the material(to a good extent) even without ever implementing any of them. Having implemented them is a boost to your learning curve. 61 Views · View Upvotes
