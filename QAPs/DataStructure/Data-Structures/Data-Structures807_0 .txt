What is the best tool to make animations for data structures and algorithms?The Java "Abstract Window Toolkit" (AWT) provides the capability to create platform-independent, graphical user interface program. It provides a vast number of useful components, controls and events to build the interactive user interface. The Java Utility and java.lang packages provide useful utilities and data types to implement the various parsing algorithms and exercises. Moreover, the java.lang Thread class or Runnable interface, the AWT Graphics and Image classes make the animation system easy to build. The Thread class or Runnable interface can be implemented to create thread object to control and run animation whereas the Graphics and Image classes provide functions and background images for drawing animated objects.
