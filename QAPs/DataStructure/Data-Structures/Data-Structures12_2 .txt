What is the difference between local spacetime structure and global spacetime structure?Can I say like for general relativity, it can describe curvature due to a mass/energy, which is local spacetime structure while for global spacetime structure, it will be like for the FRW metric?Mostly. The global structure is also a function of mass/energy. Think about a black hole. That is well described by the Kerr-Newman metric, which is asymptotically flat far away from the black hole. But that shouldn’t be right since the real universe we live in is asymptotically FRW. The local structure around the black hole is overwhelming dominated by the local energy distribution of the black hole. But that is a negligible drop in the bucket for determining the overall global structure of the universe, which depends on the way all energy is distributed. Most of that is irrelevant for the area around the black hole. You can make metrics that are Kerr-Newman locally and FRW asymptotically. They’re actually kind of interesting thermodynamically. 137 Views · Answer requested by 1 person
