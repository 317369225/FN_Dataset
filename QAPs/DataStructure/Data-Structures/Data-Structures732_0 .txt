Would learning data structures/algorithms in spring be too late for applying to internships?Currently a 2nd year student in college. I am aiming to secure an internship next summer, would learning data structures and algorithms in spring be too late?It is about algorithmic skills not specific data structures and algorithms. That is, you can study many things and don’t see them in interviews. In addition, studying algorithms don’t equal gaining algorithmic thinking skills. In 3–6 months one can be ready to such interviews. Either participate in programming competitions (e.g. codeforces site) or directly search for books about interviews questions. In all cases sure some basics algorithms (e.g. DFS) and data structures (e.g. Binary Search tree) must be studied, but not whole DS/Algorithms courses at all. 315 Views
