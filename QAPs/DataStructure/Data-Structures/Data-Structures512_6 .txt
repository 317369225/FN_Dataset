How much emphasis should I place on studying data structures and algorithms if my goal is a job in Data Science/Machine Learning?I’m interested in an expert’s opinion on how much focus should I give to getting a good understanding of the various algorithms that are usually tested at tech companies interview processes vs. getting hands-on experience through data science competitions, focusing on learning statistics, etc.I may not be an expert, but I would suggest you to concentrate on competitions, hands-on experience than data structures or algorithms. If you know the basics of data structures that should do. All this is theory and nothing can beat real-time hands-on experience through hackthons and competitions. 330 Views
