My branch is electrical and electronics. I have to opt for an open elective course this semester. What should I choose, Data Structure or OOP?If you are interested in computer science branch or coding then you should go with data structure as it will help you a lot in future and will strong your coding skills otherwise choose oops. Oops is also important but for passing it will better to choose!! 94 Views  View Upvotes
