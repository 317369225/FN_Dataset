Given a point (x,y), how can you find the number of unique ways of getting to that point from your current position?What algorithm would you use and how? I came across this question on glassdoor asked in an interview at a company with no other information. I was just curious to understand how to proceed with the problem. Any specific constraints that would make sense, please consider them in your answer.Unless you specify some constraints, there are an infinite number of "ways" to travel from one point to another. What constitutes a "way"? Can the traveller move in any direction or only in certain directions? Can the traveller move any number of units per move? Is travel constrained to integral coordinates only? Is backtracking allowed? Can you circle the destination point? Etc, etc, etc... 79 Views  View Upvotes
