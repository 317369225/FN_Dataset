Which are some good books for learning and practice data structures and algorithms?Hello ! I hope you know programming basics well, if you don’t know “C” much then refer this book. 1.The C Programming Language Book by– Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie and Brian Kernighan this book is more than enough to understand “C” Data Structure: 1. Ellis Horowitz and Sartaj Sahni 2. Mark Allen Weiss 3. Data structure Made easy by Narasimha karumanchi. Algorithms: 1. Thomas H Cormen 2. Alfred V.Aho,Hopcroft and Jeffrey Ullman 3. Algorithms By S. Dasgupta, C.H. Papadimitriou, and U.V. Vazirani 4. How to solve it by computers ~R G Dromey if you want to learn DS and Algorithms then you need to solve programs and practice them on compiler like dev c++ or some other compiler ! All the Best :-) 175 Views · View Upvotes
