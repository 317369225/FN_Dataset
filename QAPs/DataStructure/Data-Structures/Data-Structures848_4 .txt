What is the difference between node* next & node *next?I am working on linked list and I got stuck with this ……If there is a difference between the two could someone just explain it to me.(if possible diagrammatically to understand in a better way.)I’ve not yet come across any declaration of the first kind i.e node* next. Rather, such a statement is used while returning a pointer the type of a data structure . Example: struct node* deleteFirst() { //save reference to first link struct node *tempLink = head; //mark next to first link as first head = head->next; //return the deleted link return tempLink; } Here you see the function returns the pointer of the type node. In the context of latter declaration, node *next, a pointer of the type node is being declared which can be used to refer to data structures of that type. Example: struct node *ptr = head; printf("\n[ "); //start from the beginning while(ptr != NULL) { printf("(%d,%d) ",ptr->key,ptr->data); ptr = ptr->next; } printf(" ]"); There is no difference in both the statements as such. If there is a problem further, care to share the link/reference of the problem. 414 Views · View Upvotes
