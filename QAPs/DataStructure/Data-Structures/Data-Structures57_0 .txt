How do HashMaps work?Basic A hash table or hash map stores values using a given key. Storing When you put a new element in the table it generates a specific hash code for the given key. For every hash code a new slot in the table is being generated. Internally the table assigns the value to the slot with the hash code. Access When acessing a certain element within the table it generates the hash code once again and returns the value in this slot. Collision If multiple keys generate the same hash code the internal collision detection has to distinguish the two objects. In order to do that the key, or at least the reference to it, is stored with the value in the slot. Note This is only a short introduction into this topic from a Java point of view, I hope I could answer your question. 155 Views  View Upvotes
