Is there a theory of data structures?When learning data structures, most topics seem very specific, independent and unique. Are there any efforts to create a general theory, a framework for thinking about data structures?Data structures are indeed very diverse, so I don’t think it would be particularly fruitful to try to examine all of them under a single framework. However, there are certainly many common themes in the design of data structures. For example, the principle of hierarchically organizing data shows up in BSTs, other kinds of search trees, segment trees, range trees, skip lists, and more. The principle of caching recently-used data comes up in several contexts such as splay trees, data structure combinations such as LinkedHashMap that are used for implementing LRU caches, and optimizations to other data structures (e.g. get min/max of a BST in O(1)). The idea of partitioning data into buckets comes up in radix trees, quadtrees, hash tables, and van Emde Boas trees. Many data structures are inspired by ideas from other data structures or algorithms. For example, we could see the BST as a dynamic version of quicksort, the radix tree as a dynamic version of radix sort, the range tree as a type of segment tree, and the B-tree as a generalization of 2–3–4 trees. Another point to consider is that there are sometimes general statements we can prove, within a particular model of computation, about all data structures. Results about lower bounds would be an example of this. So, while there might not be one grand unifying theory of data structures, the topics are certainly interconnected. 351 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Shauli Ravfogel
