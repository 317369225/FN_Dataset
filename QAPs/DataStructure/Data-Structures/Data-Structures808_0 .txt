Are these two implementations for binary search right?Binary Search - GeeksQuiz Binary Search - topcoder I copied the code (but the main bug I feel is that both assume the values to be coming in increasing sorted order, here is my implementation(search.java) of the code which both explain, clearly am at some confusion, or is there a genuine mistake?Binary search works only on sorted array. It could be sorted decreasingly or increasingly sorted. The codes which you have referred, both of them assume the array to be increasing order sorted. Slight modification needs to be done on the less than operator to make it working. Both of the implementations are absolutely correct. 243 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Mohit Ahuja
