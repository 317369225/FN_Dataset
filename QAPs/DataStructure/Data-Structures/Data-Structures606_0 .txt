What is the best book to learn data structures using Java?I took Kevin Wayne's Data Structures and Algorithms course this year and I think his (and Sedgewick's) book is really quite excellent. There's also a relevant course site (full of lecture slides, demos, etc.) that accompanies the book brilliantly. Can find the book and course site linked from here: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/ Apparently, it will also be on Coursera in the Fall, so if you're interested, check it out. 32.5k Views  View Upvotes
