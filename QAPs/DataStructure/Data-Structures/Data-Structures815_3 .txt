I'm 16 years old and know Java, PHP, JS, Python and Ruby. I know almost nothing about data structures and algorithms. Where should I start?I would start by practicing implementation problems. It was much easier for me to start learning data structures and problem solving paradigms (e.g. dp, greedy, divide & conquer) after I was exposed to what kinds of problems I would be solving. Plus, you already know Java, a programming language that should be supported on every online judge, and practicing implementation is an easy way for you to get your feet wet with algorithmic thinking. 402 Views  View Upvotes
