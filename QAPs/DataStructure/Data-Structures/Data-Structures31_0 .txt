What data produces a SHA256 hash of all zero bits?I know only 1/(2^256) pieces of data can produce this value, but it would be interesting to see what does, if it has ever happened. Likewise, what interesting hex values have come out of SHA? anything like 0x314159… Pi?Even if you had all the computing power and time enough to be able to theoretically find a digest with all 0 bits (or any specific digest for that matter—the whole point is to make it near-impossible to do this) there is no guarantee that particular digest will be reachable.
