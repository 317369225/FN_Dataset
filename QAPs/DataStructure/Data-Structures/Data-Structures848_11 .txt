What is the difference between node* next & node *next?I am working on linked list and I got stuck with this ……If there is a difference between the two could someone just explain it to me.(if possible diagrammatically to understand in a better way.)Both are same declaring next as pointer of type Node. These two are different type of coding styles. 52 Views
