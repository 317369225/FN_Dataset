If I read the entire CLRS Introduction to Algorithms book and implement all the exercises in it, how much better will I get at Computer programming?You won’t get any better at computer programming per se. You’ll get better at understanding and implementing algorithms. It’s sort of like music. You can know every scale and mode and all the recommendations and best practices for applying them. But that doesn’t make you a musician. I know guys that can rattle off every alg in the book, and show you how to implement them; trees, matrices and grid search and sort operations, you name it. But you try to get them to build an application that really works well for users and they can’t do it. It’s like giving somebody a box of the top notch paints; they can tell you the properties of them, exactly what color they are, and when it is typically best to use one vs. another. But you hand them the brush and say, “paint a sunset,” and they can’t. However, somebody that can do all that AND paint…now you’re talking. Algorithms are tools used by computer programmers. Creating tools in and of itself is an exercise sure, but there’s a lot more to get good at. 403 Views · View Upvotes
