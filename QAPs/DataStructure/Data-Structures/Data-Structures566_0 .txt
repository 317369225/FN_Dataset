How algorithm and data structure work when we process any request in a website ?I mean how they work in a particular website? Is data already arranged and structured before clicking any 'search' or 'sort' button in sites like amazon? Or they get arranged after clicking it and then displays it on web page ? Can someone please correct me and explain how actually ds and algowork ?Algorithms are generally a set of instructions which solve a particular problem or the business logic that is executed when an event occurs. The most important thing is to find an algorithm that solves the problem including all edge cases in the shortest possible time period with the least possible memory utilisation. Data Structures are used to store manipulable data so that the algorithm can work correctly. It is just how data is structured to get to the result of a problem in acceptable time utilising acceptable memory. Now for the algorithm to trigger, you need an event - because the systems are reactive and do not have a mind of their own. Whether you create a data structure after the even occurs or have a manipulable data structure with which the user interacts is really up to the programmer. [1] What are algorithms used for?
