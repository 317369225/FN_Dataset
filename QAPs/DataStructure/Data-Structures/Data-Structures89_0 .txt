I am a 16 year old self taught programmer. What are the best books to go all the way from data structures, algorithms to complex programming topics?I am planning to go through this list, step by step down the list: Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou. Introduction to algorithms by CLSR The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie. any other books to clear off my concepts on data structures? And if so, where should I put it in the list?Try starting with geeksforgeeks. This should be enough to get you going and simultaneously do go through HackerRank easy problems. Do take part in TCS: CodeVita - Home. The problems are easy I feel, and once you solve some problems, it does a great work by boosting your confidence(and motivation too). Once you are familiar with the basics try to take part in contests and see where you stand. Tushar Roy has some of the problems nicely explained. And lastly the books that you mentioned are great but I guess you will find it boring after a certain period of time, the above mentioned points are from my perspective for being productive, a small step towards a better problem solver. 330 Views  View Upvotes
