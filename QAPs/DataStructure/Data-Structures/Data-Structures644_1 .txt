How can I learn data structure in 1 month in hostel?The simplest way i could suggest is that just stick to the one resource, cause there are thousands of resources online.. i would highly suggest to learn it in C (programming language ),as you have to implement it by yourself and there is nothing readymade for you. i would suggest this book : Data Structures Using C.. it is great book for data structure head start, (i have topped using this book only nothing else ).. after this book i would suggest to go for any online course that will be more than enough, and you actually can finish it in 15 days of a monthâ€¦ :) Happy Reading.. :) and Best Of luck.. ! 164 Views
