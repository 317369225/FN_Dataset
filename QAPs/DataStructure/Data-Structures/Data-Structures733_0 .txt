What are the applications of disjoint set data structure?Disjoint-set data structures are one of the most useful data structures for its simplicity and amazing running time. One of the most well-known applications is its use in Kruskal’s Minimal Spanning Tree algorithm, which has a lot of applications in many ways. Using a graph with random weights, Kruskal’s algorithm generates nice random trees, and in particular, this can be used to easily generate mazes of all kinds! But disjoint-set data structures are even more general than that. They are a good solution to the partial dynamic connectivity problem, which is also how they’re used in Kruskal’s case. Furthermore, Tarjan found a clever way to use these data structures to compute LCA’s. Tarjan’s offline LCA algorithm calculates the LCA’s of Q pairs of nodes in a tree in just O((N+Q)⋅α(N))  O((N+Q)⋅α(N)) time, which is a great time complexity for its simplicity. The disjoint-set data structure is a useful data structure to know because of its applications in many non-obvious ways. If you want some practice with this data structure, this is a simple problem to get started, and you can find a couple more problems here. 354 Views · View Upvotes
