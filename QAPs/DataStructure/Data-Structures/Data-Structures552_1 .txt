Should I learn DS and Algo in JavaScript itself instead of a compiled/VM language, as being a MEAN stack dev, I will be implementing them in JS only?I know JS fairly well, and am seeking a job as a MEAN stack developer. However, I am starting to seriously learn DS and Algorithms too. Since the most probable platform where I will be implementing them is JavaScript / Node, should I learn DS and algos in JS itself or go with Java?Algorithmz is a kinda thing which which you won't be implementing in JavaScript instead it will be useful in any other side language kinda PHP so it's better to learn algorithms independently because it will make your core concepts clear and also you will learn all algorithms and how to use them in a code. Violin JavaScript you will play with all HTML elements and kind of doing some dynamic thing like if else condition so it's better if you are a full stack developer learn both things independently after all you won't be using any algorithms in JavaScript itself as I have already told you above. 148 Views  View Upvotes
