I'm trying to be a self taught programmer. What should be the correct flow of online courses I should take or books I should read?As there have been enough answers already and discussion regarding the flow of your execution I won’t focus on that. But I would like to mention two things I thought was lacking in the answers (I could read) are as following : The Art of Computer Programming is very good book to follow. The standard reference for C++ should be www.cplusplus.com. All the programs and techniques used there are pretty standard. And ever if you would like to get into System Programming or Open Source involving the C/C++ the documentation there is one among of the standards. Also get along with the in-built functions of all languages but at least once try to understand how they are implemented and what were the technical intricacies involved. 206 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Sahil Jain
