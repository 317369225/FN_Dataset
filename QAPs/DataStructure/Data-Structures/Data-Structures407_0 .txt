Are the Art of Computer Science by D. Knuth books suitable for self studying?Yes. That’s pretty good book. You must read it. I spent most of my time for about two months reading through volume 1 (while in graduate school), I still remembered that I was amazed by the power and elegance of assembly code in the master's hand. Though V1 only covers some basic stuff, you could not find any other books matching its comprehensiveness and depth. It was a bit too overwhelming, it often took a couple of hours just reading 1 or 2 page. I knew his argument against using high level language, but I definitely enjoyed more his later book "The Stanford GraphBase" which he illustrated algorithms in cweb (literate programming) and sample data. Knuth is very thorough and his rigor cannot be put into question. It is very hard to fault him for anything and also in case of any questions just post it but self reading will help you and you will pretty good concepts. 190 Views · View Upvotes
