Finding difficulty in learning data structures and algorithms. What should I do?Learning data structures and algorithms is easy, but appying them in a problem is not that easy. Begin with solving a classical problems like searching and sorting. Step1: Understand the problem. Step 2: TRY solving the problem manually. This will help in identifying an algorithm for the given problem. (May not be an efficient one) Step 3: Try to write the steps involved on a paper. Step 4: Prove your algorithm. (Learn to prove an algorithm) Step 5: Analyse it. Represent them in Big-O notation. (Learn this as well) Step 6: Think of much better algorithm and optimizations. Repeat from step 2. Step 7: write the pseudocode (if u don't know learn how to write a pseudocode). Step 8: Now look at the solution. (Your textbook). Step 9: probably, u will be surprised how elegantly algorithms and data structures are developed For the given problem. This way you can develop algorithmic thinking and can never forget the data structures and algorithms that were used in the problem. You can always practice on websites like hackerrank and codechef. Do online courses on websites like coursera and edx. Happy coding! :) 244 Views  View Upvotes
