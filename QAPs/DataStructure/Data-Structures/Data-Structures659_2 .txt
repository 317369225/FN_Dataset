Is data structure and algorithm different for different languages?They are the same if the different languages are based on the same principles (or as someone would say, they follow the same paradigm). However they would be completely different if the languages are not based on the same “paradigms”. You are going to be in troubles if you insist in trying to use a data type or algorithm designed for Haskell when you are programming in C or Java or Prolog. And vice versa your typical imperative algorithm or object oriented data will be hard/impossible to use, or extremely inefficient at best, in Haskell or in Prolog. Nor are your Prolog rules and facts going to be very useful in a language that is not based on the logic programming “paradigm”. 189 Views · View Upvotes
