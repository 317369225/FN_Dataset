What are some comprehensive resources on algorithms/data structures for competitive programming such as USACO? (Especially Books)I am preparing for the USACO competition at the start of ninth grade in the next few days. I already know the basics of C++ and programming, so what are some good resources that students have used to learn/practice algorithms. I am looking at more textbook-like instruction and books.Thanks for the A2A. The USACO training pages are ideal for you because you know the basics of a programming language, are interested in competitive programming, and are going to compete in the USACO monthly contests. The training pages will prepare you very well for contests, and they are fairly comprehensive of algorithms and data structures. Other resources include various algorithm books (Sedgewick, CLRS, Steven and Felix Halim). You can use those books to supplement your practice. Online judges for you to practice on include Codeforces, Topcoder, UVA, and SPOJ. There are millions of online problems for you to practice. 378 Views  Answer requested by Ryan Yang
