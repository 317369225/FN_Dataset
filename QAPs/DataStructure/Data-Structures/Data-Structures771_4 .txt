What are cool data structures?I like the binomial heap, which supports all normal heap operations as well as merging in logarithmic time. The really cool thing about the binomial heap is that the merging operation is modelled after addition of binary numbers. A binomial heap with N  N elements is a forest of trees of sizes 2 k 1  ,2 k 2  ,…  2k1,2k2,… which add up to N  N . When two binomial heaps are merged, if there is a given tree size in both binomial heaps, they are merged to give a tree of size equal to the next power of two in the resulting binomial heap. 5.8k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Abhijit Shandilya
