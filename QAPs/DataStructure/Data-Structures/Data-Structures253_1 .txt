Should I take data structures in C++ or Java? I am studying chemical engineering and often have to get outdated hardware to work with newer computers.Technically it doesn't matter because you can learn data structures in either language (or other languages). That being said, I was always of the opinion that you should learn it (and other things) in C or C++ simply because it teaches you about pointers and memory management. But either way you'll be fine. 91 Views
