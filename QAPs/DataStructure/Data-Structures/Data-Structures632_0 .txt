What are some hidden secrets of C language?Bit field! A bit field is a term used to store multiple, logical, neighbouring bits, where each of the sets of bits, and single bits can be addressed. Example struct DISK_REGISTER { unsigned ready:1; unsigned error_occured:1; unsigned disk_spinning:1; unsigned write_protect:1; unsigned head_loaded:1; unsigned error_code:8; unsigned track:9; unsigned sector:5; unsigned command:5; }; The size of the class will be 4 bytes sized instead of 24~36 bytes (if you had used only integer, or integer and boolean). Uses Flags are a common used of bit field. It’s true that in a lot of programming environment you don’t care if your integer will take one, two or four bytes, but for some platform it is great to used them as you saved some space.
