A professor told me not to bother to learn many programming languages but focus only on C++, data structures and algorithms, is he right?Others have answered this question quite extensively. I would simply like to think that his choice of C++ is simply because it’s not the kind of language where your learning path reaches a dead-end. For example, if you were learning about storage allocation, then having chosen python as your main language would mean that you’d have to learn a new language before embarking on learning about storage allocation. Unfortunately, as you’ll learn more about this industry and this science as well, you’ll most likely realize the need for multiple languages under your belt is simply a matter of thought complexity(what is inevitable) added to computational complexity(what you’re after). Somewhere along a project that you’re doing, you’ll want to implement an algorithm or a data structure where the language difference is negligible relative to the runtime constraints that you have(some monster machine) and sometimes it will be the opposite situation(a weak tiny computer). The thing is, learning C++ is good because it enables you to work on both ends of the spectrum, but learning other languages, *that are relevant to you*, allows you to be efficient along both ends(whatever they may be to you) 215 Views · View Upvotes
