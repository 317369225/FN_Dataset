How can we build balanced binary search tree in linear time?If the data is initially unsorted then you can’t. For each element, you would need to find the spot in the tree where it belongs (log N time) and since there are N elements, the total build time is N log N. If you sorted the elements first then it might be possible to insert them into a tree in linear time but sorting still takes N log N time. 94 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person
