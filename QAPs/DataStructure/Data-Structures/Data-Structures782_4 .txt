Which data structures should I at least know in general?I studied arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees (Search, AVL, splay and B-), hash tables, heaps and a few types of sorting. I heard of other structures such as leftist and skew heaps, red-black trees, disjoint sets and mroe. Is it essential to learn all data structures in general?I think it won’t take more than a few minutes to understand the purpose and implementation of each of the structure you have mentioned. So you should know all of them. As someone who occasionally does embedded programming - the only place I still use C, I have had to use circular queues (blocking and non blocking) and hash tables the most. Linked-list is also useful when used as a back end for a circular queue instead of an array. Irrespective of what the textbook says, I don’t see arrays as data structure. They are a language feature. 51 Views
