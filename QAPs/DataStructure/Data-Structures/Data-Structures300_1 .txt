Should I focus on learning more languages or Algorithms and Data Structures?What is more important if I want to pursue a career as a Computer Programmer?Definitely algorithms and data structures if you have command over a particular language. New language call be learned when in your job, you will be assigned a project specific to a particular language. But algorithms and data structures are the most basic thing. The algorithm remains same irrespective of programming language and the common data structures’ concept also remains the same in all languages, only implementation changes. So focus on learning algorithms and data structures as they are the most important thing in career as a computer programmer. 109 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Danish Ajaib
