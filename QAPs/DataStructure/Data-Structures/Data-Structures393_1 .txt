How do I become a full stack developer in next 5–10 years with no experience in J2EE and experience in Frontend technologies ?I work in an IT company for the past two years. I am having experience in Front end technologies such as AngularJS, ReactJS Know only Core Java and no experience in Enterprise JAVA technologies.I am having experience in Front end technologies such as AngularJS, ReactJS Since you already have experience with angularJs ,I would suggest you to learn Node.js It is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript run-time for easily building fast and scalable network applications. My personal favorite place to learn Node.js is NodeSchool ,and for database there are some pretty cool and well documented ORM like The Node.js / io.js ORM for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and MSSQL How do I become a full stack developer in next 5–10 years I personally think you wont need 10 years to become full stack developer just spent 3–4 hours on learning and you will be proud enough to call yourself full stack developer in less than 5 years. If you are determined to learn, No one can stop you. You hold the key to your education. 216 Views · View Upvotes
