How can I add nodes to a binary search tree using a text file?I implemented a dictionary using a binary search tree in java. I have to use a text file which is already contained word and the meaning of some words. I used buffered reader to read the file and it seems readLine() never become null. Any help would be appriciated. Thank youIf you are doing a loop like for (String l= buf.readLine()); l != null; l = but.readLine()) { // insert line into tree } That should work according to the Java API 45 Views  Answer requested by Sandunika Hansinie Dissanayake
