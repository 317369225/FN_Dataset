Are there good and high paying programmers who never implemented data structures in C?I am finding reasons to make a living without learning C and that too in the long run I want to jump into product management. Does C become inevitable to progress through this track? I have to learn programming though. I am asking it in view of getting through the interview for the likes of Amazon.In C? Sure. Look for Java or Python programmers. Many of them have never touched C. Or some COBOL programmers minting money at banks. Or .. You get the idea. C is not the end of the world. But to find a highly paid programmer (assuming a software developer) who has never implemented a single data structure in any language might be NP-hard! Not that they won’t exist, but the chances of running into one is minute. Choose a language you prefer. C++, Java or Python. Stick to it. And for God’s sake, start implementing data structures!
