What are the best ways you would suggest to learn data structures and algorithms (online and offline mode)?First main point to be considered is to have command on anyone of the programming language such as c/c++/java/python The data structures and algorithms is a part of coding so as to minimize the memory utilization and time complexity... etc Firstly get basic idea about stack , queue,linked lists,trees. What they really mean and what they do. Then go thorugh the geeks for geeks website and start solving the questions as many as u can.... if you dont get an idea just check on the algorithm they gave and proceed to code. Never look at the solution they give. Apart from geeks for geeks website programming go thrpugh geeks quiz and get command on multiple choice questions.check out hackerrank website and crack the coding interview book. 34 Views
