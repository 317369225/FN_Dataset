Why are the candidates not evaluated on frameworks like Spring, Hibernate along with problem solving skills using Algorithms and Data Structures?Based on the interview testimonials, the technology leaders like Google, Facebook and Amazon generally evaluate candidates solely on problem solving using Algorithms and Data structures. Do they use frameworks like Spring, Hibernate and other Java EE solutions?These big companies want a guy who is quick leaner , and a good programer. You can ask a person to write something if he or she is smart enough to write. Also these companies have many areas to work so it does’t matter which framework you know. Data structure and algorithms are basic knowledge every technical (Computer science) person must have. They use many technologies and frameworks altogether in a team to build something great so its good to get good candidates by testing algorithm design and problem solving skills.
