What is the best book for DBMS and data structure?Database System Concepts is the book that I’d suggest !!. The first several chapters focus on describing relational algebra and developing a solid foundation for the next several to build on as they introduce SQL and discuss the kinds of tradeoffs you might make in schema design and query optimization. It's a solid intro text in that if you approach it without any prior database knowledge and stick with it, by the end you'll not only know syntactically how to define a schema and write complex queries, you'll also have a good mental framework for normalizing your schemas, optimizing queries, and defining the right indices. That said, it is a bit denser than other intro texts, and it will take you a bit longer to get to actually working with a real database, as the first several chapters stick strictly to operations in relational algebra. And when it comes to learning Data Structures I’d suggest DSA Made Easy by Narasimha Karumanchi. It’s easily available on amazon. This book starts from a novice level and ends up at the pro gradually. It concerns C language which most of the institutions teach in the classes of Data Structures. But if you want your building block as Java then prefer Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. 227 Views · View Upvotes
