Given a point (x,y), how can you find the number of unique ways of getting to that point from your current position?What algorithm would you use and how? I came across this question on glassdoor asked in an interview at a company with no other information. I was just curious to understand how to proceed with the problem. Any specific constraints that would make sense, please consider them in your answer.If only directions permitted are right and down, this can be solved using dynamic programming. Create 2d array of grid size. Fill first row and column with 1. Fill rest of the matrix indices as summation from its adjacent last column and last row. Get answer using (x-1, y-1). Note: assuming current position is top left. 66 Views  View Upvotes
