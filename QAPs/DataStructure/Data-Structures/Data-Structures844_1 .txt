Is using 2-d arrays for problems that could be solved by Linked Lists or Hash Maps frowned upon in interviews? Does using 2-d arrays have cons?I use C, since Python’s not allowed in this target company’s interviews. I could solve 60% of the questions this company asked with 2-d arrays. (I saw previously asked questions by this company) These are the set of questions I solved with 2-d arrays : q5yws - Ghostbin.Generally, and especially in competitions, unless you use an array in some remarkably inefficient way boosting complexity from some O(N) or O(N * logN) to some O(N^2), 2D arrays would often be a preferred implementation technique. The major practical consideration against 2D arrays is sparsity and memory usage. In competitions, for the vast majority of problems, it should be clear early on whether certain 2D array would or would not fit into memory. A related point has to do with caching and performance, but in case of Python this aspect should not bug you much. 222 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
