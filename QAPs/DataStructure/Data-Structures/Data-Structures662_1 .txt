Which data structure would be best to find the number of students within a given height range in a scalable way?Given, the heights (in cm), of the primary school children in India (in millions), which data structure would you use, for supporting the following use cases and functionalities - remove data when students get un-registered from school. How will you return number of students within a range?I would use a hash table using chaining as you have mentioned that there will be frequent deletions when the student gets unregistered from the school because if we use open addressing then the deletions might take lot of time. Now each element of the hash table contains a 1) a pointer to a linked list that contains students info with a particular height 2)the number of elements in the linked list. now when we want to retrieve the info we apply the hash function on the upper bound and lower bound and then add up the info in indices that fall within the range . 345 Views
