How do I create a program that generates sudoku puzzles in Java?I am struggling with this question and would really appreciate it if someone could give insight into the problem.Somehow, I think you need to first think about the algorithms you'll bring to the problem, and then maybe use a language (or library) aimed at logic solving. (Does anybody use Prolog anymore?) Somehow pushing this into Java seems a bit too low level. 544 Views
