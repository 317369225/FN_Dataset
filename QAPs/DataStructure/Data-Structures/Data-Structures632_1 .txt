What are some hidden secrets of C language?You may call some other function before main in C. For example in GCC, the following program on execution will first display “Inside first()” followed by “Inside main()”: #include <stdio.h>   void first (void) __attribute__((constructor));   void first (void){ printf ("\nInside first ()"); }   int main (void){ printf ("\nInside main ()"); } You may use the constants __LINE__ and __FILE__ in most C/C++ compilers to display the line and the file respectively. This is useful in debugging/logging when one is displaying the same variable from multiple points in a program and one wants to identify the line and file from which the particular print was initiated. printf("a=%d in file %s and at line %d", a, __FILE__, __LINE__); 227 Views · View Upvotes
