What are open ended learning structures? How are they used and what are some examples?Open ended learning structures do not have a conclusive statement by the author. There is no end that the author pre-decides, it is left on the reader to make assumptions with logic, and information given in the entire text. an open ended story or novel keeps room for the sequel. An open ended structure nurtures your mind, and helps you think better, and develops your brain to be effective in analysis and interpretation. There is no win or loss, it is a narrative pathway which comes to a question-mark end. e.g. The Lady Or the Tiger by Frank Stockton.
