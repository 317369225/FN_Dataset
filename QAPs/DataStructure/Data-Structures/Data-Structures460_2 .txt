Is it required that a person pursuing data analytics/data science/machine learning have a good knowledge of data structures? If yes, why?I hope it is indeed required especially for machine learning and analytics . Basically i too had an opinion that data structures may not be essential. But the hardest part that i realized gradually was every subject uses data structure and database internally. For instance consider that you are analyzing the data relating to a social networking site say face book, for which you need to know the data that you are dealing with, design of the data base i.e. the data type of the fields, the format in which it is used , the structure to use for efficient storage and retrieval. I can give one more such example consider that a prediction software is created and that might internally use many algorithms, so for the comparison of the algorithms and knowing its performance (complexity) it is preferable to have a basic knowledge on data structure. Data structure forms the pillar for multiple fields. 86 Views
