I'm 16 years old and know Java, PHP, JS, Python and Ruby. I know almost nothing about data structures and algorithms. Where should I start?Start with search tree. Search tree Genetic algorithm Genetic algorithm Here is a simple task for you: You have 8x8 maze, a robot that can move left, right, forward or backward (doesn't turn or rotate; it slides left or right instead). Let's assume you have 11 steps from start to end. You can write a program to find the set of steps from beginning to end using different types of search algorithms or genetic algorithm. In the following example the solution is: Fffrrfflflf Xxxxxxxx Xxxxexxx Xxxxaaxx Xxaaaaax Xxxxxxax Xxxaaaax Xxxxaxxx Xxxxsxxx A: available X: wall S: start E: end F: forward L: left R: right I am assuming here that we have a “blind” robot. It will fell there is a wall when it bumps into it. 316 Views · View Upvotes
