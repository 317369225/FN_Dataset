What was the significance of the Hirsch conjecture?
In mathematical programming and polyhedral combinatorics, the Hirsch conjecture states  that the edge-vertex graph of an n-facet polytope in d-dimensional Euclidean space has diameter no more than n − d. That is, any two vertices of the polytope must be connected to each other by a path of length at most n − d. This conjecture was motivated by the analysis of the simplex method in linear programming, as the diameter of a polytope provides a lower bound on the number of steps needed by the simplex method. The Hirsch conjecture was proven for d < 4 and for various special cases.  The best known upper bounds showed only that polytopes have sub-exponential diameter as a function of n and d. But, after more than fifty years, an example was announced in 2010 by Francisco Santos that disproves the Hirsch Conjecture (But this counterexample has no direct impact for the analysis of the  simplex method, as it does not rule out the possibility of a larger but  still linear or polynomial number of steps.)
