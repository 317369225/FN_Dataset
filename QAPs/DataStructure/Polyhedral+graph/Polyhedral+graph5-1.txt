What are some good active blogs of student pursuing CS Major in top tier college?
Tess Rinearson blogs Bio from the site: "I'm Tess Rinearson, a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science. In the past, I attended the University of Pennsylvania (for a year) and worked at Microsoft (for a summer) and Valve Software. (for a different summer). Somewhere in between all of this, I worked at CloudMine (for a semester) and went to a lot of hackathons. I like to write about a lot of things. I write especially regularly on tech and feminism--sometimes at the same time."
