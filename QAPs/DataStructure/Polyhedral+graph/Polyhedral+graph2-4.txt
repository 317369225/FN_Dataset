Mathematics: How did these 17 equations change the world?
Explaining to a 5 year old is a stretch. My son is 8, and there are exactly 2 things on the list that he knows - Polyhedra Rule, and the Gravity Law. If you asked him, he would most certainly brag about E=mc^2, but of course he hasn't got a clue. Neither do I. Pythagorus. It is of some importance in the tile business. Logarithms. The ability to discern very small and very large numbers in the same scale. Decibels, pH, Richter... Multiplication via addition, and the slide rule. Gravity. ​ Calculus. "I know velocity X time is distance, but what if gravity is causing my velocity to change?" "you'll need calculus for that. What are you working on? ICBM or satellites? " "A pendulum." "Hmm. Calculus looks good. differentials. integrals. If you mix them in an equation it is a nightmare though." "We got Fourier Transform for that" Normal distribution. "Great shooting!  If the target was twice the size, your hit rate would have changed to.." "Shut up." "distributions are wonderful. But with mean, variance and other moments to keep track of, it can get messy. Luckily, we got Fourier Transform for that." Information theory. "How much can you compress a file, a speech, an image, in a computer, in wireless systems, .. What do you lose, and what you don't lose..." "but how do you actually compress?" "We got Fourier Transform for that" Black-Scholes. ​ Fourier transform. I think it is used somewhere. ;-) Square Root of -1. In the tile business, not much. But it helps with Fourier Transform (and the related Laplace Transform) which is of some use. Updated 20h ago • View Upvotes
