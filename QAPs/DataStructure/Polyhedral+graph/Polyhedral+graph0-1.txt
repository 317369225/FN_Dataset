What are the most advanced mathematics that apply to architecture?
From statistics, to differential equations.  Optics, acoustics, waveform/field synthesis, hydrodynamics, thermodynamics.  Platonic solid nesting and DNA structure mapping for proportional studies and shape analysis.  Kinetic energy matrices, (Tautochrone curves, Catenary curves, Cycloids, Hyperboloids)  Harmonic proportions and subdivision of visual aesthetics.  Certain mathematics of psychology; spatial recognition and reaction-diffusion models for social and ecological systems.  Certain mathematics dealing with geology, weather systems (chaos theory), movement patterns.  Light reflection and refraction.  Curvilinear perspectives.  Euclidean geometry.  Brode's equation, isentropic expansion, isothermal expansion and thermodynamic availability to calculate explosion safety factors.  Then all the basic statics and structural stuff too.  Plus, we have to be able to measure length and height.  And square footage is important too.  :) Oh yeah, and our fee should be understood as follows: if; x = Overall project budget  y = Contractor's fee z = Fee for all other non-Architect subs/consultants, then y  will always equal x - z.
