Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
The answer is strictly and surely yes, you can program the greatest and most complex game in C. You could make incredible games even in assembler, if you would be such a great wizard capable of mastering complexity without mistakes. However, it happens that the knowledge required to achieve your target is actually better achieved through exposure to multiple programming languages, programming styles, algorithm experience, architectures and coding conventions too: nobody chose a road without a reason,  and most  choices (right or wrong) are actually  based on field experience that's right and relevant. Without this experience, I am afraid  your dream of great games will not come true. So, go ahead and learn C++ if you want to be a great C programmer. For every feature,  think yourself how you would implement it in the two languages,  and ask yourself why great programmers designed the specific language features in that way. You will be teleported in few weeks through many decades of knowledge generated by the most brilliant minds of the digital era. Updated 23 Aug
