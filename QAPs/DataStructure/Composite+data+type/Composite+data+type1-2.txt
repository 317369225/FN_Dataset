What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
A few apparently lesser known PostgreSQL features: PostgreSQL has multi-value fields (aka arrays, aka nested tables) which can reduce the need for joins and dramatically increase the performance of storing and retrieving "multi-dimensional" data structures. (you probably do this a lot) www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/interactive/arrays.html PostgreSQL also has class based inheritance between tables so that for example "customers" and "suppliers" tables could both inherit common properties such as triggers, columns etc from an "organisations" table. A select on customers would return customers, obviously, and a select on organisations would return customers and suppliers. www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/tutorial-inheritance.html Cool, huh ? PostgreSQL has a very rich data type system and allows user-defined data types and composite data types. www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/rowtypes.html PostgreSQL has loadable modules with makes it possible to write stored procedures in other programming languages (C, Perl, Python and even the JavaScript V8 engine code.google.com/p/plv8js/wiki/PLV8) PostgreSQL is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than MySQL (and it's no more difficult to use)
