What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
The beginning - Making a "Hello, World !" Program, best feeling in the world when your code runs for the first time. The road ahead - You start working on more complex things like loops, data structures, etc. The denial - This is the most crucial stage in a programmer's life when he chooses whether he should continue programming or not. The passion - If the programmer continues to code, eventually, he starts understanding and things get better. The confidence - Throw any language at me and I'll learn it in a month.
