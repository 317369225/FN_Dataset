Why is there so much hype about functional programming?I believe every OO programmer has definetly started coding using a functional programming language. For example you start with C and then move to C++ or Java... Why is there so much hype about functional programming nowadays. I mean if everyone has used one at some point and then decided that OO is the way to go?
Two reasons: 1) there is some portion of practitioners who are more interested in the tools of the trade rather than the trade. Meaning you always have a bunch of people who say that things would be so much better if they could use different tools while ignoring that most programmers won't learn those tools properly. 2) functional programming styles promote correctness to a greater degree and they tend to make concurrent programming easier due to reduction in mutable state in code. Note that I said "functional style" rather than language.  Because you can adopt functional programming concepts in most languages.  Sadly, a lot of people who claim to be proponents of functional languages don't. Which I find puzzling.  (I've seen people argue for use of functional languages and then defend heavily stateful objects that are mutated concurrently in the same meeting.  Because that was supposedly "how OO is supposed to be done") Updated 17 Jul • View Upvotes
