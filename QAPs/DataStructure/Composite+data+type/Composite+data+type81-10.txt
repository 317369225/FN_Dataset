What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
I am part of a team that decided to introduce NodeJS as part of the company stack. I think that the NPM ecosystem improves code reusability due to the micro-modules approach, testing is really easy with javascript (grunt-mocha-chai-sinon) and code organisation is fine thanks to CommonJS. Not to mention the bright sides of async approach without bothering with multithreading! The only really "disadvantage" that I see is a lack in people knowledge around enterprise Javascript programming. Many many people still think of Javascript as a "jQuery plugin language" and they don't really study it, but this is not NodeJS problem, is people. We are addressing this "disadvantage" by running internal courses in the company and I see that people who didn't knew the real power of async js they really enjoy a lot to learn it. They turn to be really active in the learning process, thankful to the company for providing new knowledge and, eventually, better resources than before (before === java).
