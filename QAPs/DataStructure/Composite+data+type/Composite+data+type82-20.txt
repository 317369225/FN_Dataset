How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
The truth is that it doesn't matter. You're assuming quantity is a measure of quality or effectiveness, where it can be seen as a measure of lack of quality. A poor programmer will write - or more likely clone & modify - a few dozen lines of code an hour for half a day and maybe solve the problem. A good programmer will not waste any time on reinventing the wheel, nor clutter your software with reams of junk code. He will produce exactly as much LOCs as required, and  leverage components and techniques that are already available - perhaps even a pre-existing solution if there is one. Usually, less code means less instructions to execute, less chance of bugs, and cleaner code for future development / fixes / maintenance. Updated 14 Aug • View Upvotes
