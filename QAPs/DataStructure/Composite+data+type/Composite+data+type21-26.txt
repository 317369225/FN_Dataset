What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
Reading what others have written, my career experience has been a little different. First, my skill level progressed in a steady, predictable progression: learn new languages, learn more about data structures, learn about databases, learn new domains, etc etc. My career followed the same steady, predictable progression, too. On the other hand, I had a very profound singular moment in my first comp sci class. I was working on my first assignment and just did not get the idea of an algorithm. That whole "it's a recipe" metaphor just didn't explain it for me. I went to the teacher for some help and he was showing me how to write the first line of code, then the second, and then while he was in the middle of writing the third line I exclaimed "Aha!!!!". Eureka!! I ran out of his office and easily completed the assignment quickly on my own. After that, I admittedly did not know much of anything, but I never really had any fundamental problems understanding.
