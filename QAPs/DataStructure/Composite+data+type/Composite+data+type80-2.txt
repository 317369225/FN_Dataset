How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.Â  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
How many you can expect to learn depends on good motivation and good instruction. But I can answer how many you should aim to learn for 99% comprehension. This is based on my analysis regarding printed materials that only takes into account recent, common usage (data is also available for your own analysis): How Many Chinese Characters and Words Are in Use? To be able to recognize 99% of characters (to just read the abstract characters themselves), you should learn about 1572 characters. To be able to recognize 99% of full words (to know what is actually meant), you should learn about 12,054 words. The above numbers are by frequency. That means, at 1572 characters and 12,054 words you actually only know 1572/3848 ~= 41% of characters and 12054/26767= 45% of words, but because some characters and words are much more common than others, your effective reading rate is much, much higher.
