How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
I consider myself a good programmer.  In the previous two days I wrote about 25 lines of code, and removed about 900 lines of code.   I consider that a fair example of my work when updating existing code.   Writing from scratch, it really varies.   I have had days when I've written thousands of lines of code, but that is pretty rare.   More often it is a case of writing smarter code, not more code. One project I we were rewritting code in Java from another language.   The estimates made before I was hired it is would be 2 million lines of code and a year to complete.   At the end of my first month were code complete with about 20,000 lines of code total.
