Why do some people not like OOP and prefer functional programming?Is it just a matter of taste, or are there some other reasons behind it?
OOP tries to emulate real world objects. Functional Programming tries to emulate real world processes, like thinking. Parallel processing programs are better written in functional programming, since it simply involves a bunch of function, each performing a specific action on a memory location. For a function in FP, one input ideally should have only one output. If one were to program a flow-chart, one would prefer OOP. For programming say, a program which calculates mathematical functions, FP is more intuitive. It doesn't mean that their roles cannot be interchanged. So, its pretty much just a matter of preference.
