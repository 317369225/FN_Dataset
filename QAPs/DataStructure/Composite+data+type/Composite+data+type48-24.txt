Originally Answered: How do I crack the VA&LR section in CAT 2016 (99th percentile)?Let me tell you VA section isn't single section. It consists of 3 divisions. They are: 1. Logical Reasoning (LR) 2. Reading Comprehension (RC) 3. Verbal Aptitude (Critical Reasoning, Grammar, Vocab) So, you need to prepare all 3 to make your VA section strong. To get better score, you need to ensure your score in VA shouldn't be less than 95 percentile. You will require to be best in at least two divisions and good in the remaining division, then you will able to crack this section. To prepare for it, you can 1. Practice and prepare for this section daily with an equivalent focus on all 3 sub-sections. 2. Create a word lists and by the end of preparation you will be armoured with advanced vocabulary. 3. Read newspapers, books, articles, journals. It will help you to increase your speed for comprehension and increase the vocabulary. 4. Solve as many questions as possible 5. Revise and analyse regularly. 6. Keep yourself positive with a thought you are the only one who can do it. All the best! Hope it helps. Thank you!
