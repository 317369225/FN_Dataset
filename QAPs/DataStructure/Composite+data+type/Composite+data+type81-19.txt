What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
I oppose to other answers I wouldn't say single thread asynchronous programming is a disadvantage. As a mater of fact it is a huge advantage. Bear in mind that Node.js wasn't build as intention to replace everything else. It was built mainly for IO bound application and it shines in it and it is highly scalable. Javascript as a language is in my opinion an advantage as well. Fast learning curve and seamless transition for many front end devs. However should I mention any disadvantages it would be lack of maturity. A lot of APIs are still marked as unstable and could change in the future. ES6 support. The community is still somehow divided about a lot of parts of ES6 not to mention ES7... Node.js is in my opinion quite slow to adopt all the new ES6 features and many of them still suffer from performance issues. Last but not least Node.js is still mainly a domain of open source projects and javascript enthusiasts. The demand in corporate environment is right now more less limited to front end build scripting with few pioneer companies realising it's potential.
