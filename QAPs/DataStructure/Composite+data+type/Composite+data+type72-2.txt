What are some limitations/disadvantages of functional programming?
Functional languages fundamentally don't model how your computer works. Your computer is imperative. It has state, and every instruction alters that state. For this reason, purely functional languages are unsuitable for low-level programming. This conceptual mismatch also makes optimization much more difficult. While in principle the dependencies between variables is explicit and thus more amenable to analysis and optimization in functional languages, in practice we can't do this yet. Imperative languages give the programmer the ability to make optimizations compilers can't and write code that's easier to optimize.
