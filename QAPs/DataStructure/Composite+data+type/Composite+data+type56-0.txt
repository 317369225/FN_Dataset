Why would someone use an SQL query when everything is available on GUI?
Even if everything that SQL can do was available via a GUI (presumably the "GUI" doesn't include an interface that allows the user to type SQL text), the vast majority of database accesses are done by client programs operating in a non-interactive fashion. These clients need a query language to access the database and an API for fetching data back to the client.Â  So, developers coding these client apps need to know SQL so they can test their database interactions and implement them in their code. Even if developers primarily use ORMs or other query generators, the ORM itself needs to produce SQL, and it is rare for a nontrivial project to completely use an ORM successfully. Also, SQL is extremely complicated, and having a query composition GUI that was as feature-rich as the language itself would be harder to use than simply learning SQL.
