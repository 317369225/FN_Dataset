What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
I would say that Node's biggest problem at the moment is the amount of duplication of effort taking place when it comes to the ecosystem of packages & the amount of effort spent finding the best package to use for any given task that stems from this. Fortunately this is the area that Isaac Zimmitti Schlueter and other core team members will be focusing on next. The issues associated with Node's asynchronous programming style mentioned in the other answers are less of a concern for two reasons: For certain types of problems where one deals primarily with events and maintains little state the async model is an ideal fit When you do need to maintain a lot of state and prefer a synchronous programming style, one can use the node-fibers (https://github.com/laverdet/node...) coroutine library or my common-node (https://github.com/olegp/common-...) package which provides a higher level synchronous abstraction layer Edit based on experience of using Node for two years after the original answer: At StartHQ we found that a major issue with Node that isn't easy to fix is stability. A misbehaving or poorly implemented package you depend on can easily crash your server, so in practice one needs to run all node processes with an additional watchdog process, like node-supervisor.
