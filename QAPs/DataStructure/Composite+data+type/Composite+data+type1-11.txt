What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
Rough comparison of featuresMySQL Pros Somewhat lighter-weight Has commercial support if you want it, like Redhat Enterprise Linux Widespread, plenty of apps that target it Blazing  fast performance, particularly when predominantly SELECT queries,  especially on MyISAM tables (this is somewhat anecdotal though, and will  be highly dependent on the environment and workload) "Enterprise-grade"  clustering and some degree of replication is available - this is a very  different product from the MySQL Server that most people will be  familiar with, so it's not just a drop-in replacement Cons MyISAM tables don't  support transactions and have little idea about ACID properties. If a  MyISAM table breaks (frequent), you need to run myisamchk. This will  take multiple aeons on a large table You do have the option of using the InnoDB engine however, which is is transactional and ACIDic MyISAM tables only do table-level locking, so concurrency is bollocks The InnoDB engine uses multi-version concurrency, which is much better This  noted, MyISAM is the default if you don't specify an engine at  table-creation time, so it's easy for an inexperienced developer to go  down the MyISAM path Last I checked, subquery performance in MySQL was pretty awful Triggers are perverse, see Triggers in MySQL for the gory details PostgreSQL Pros Very feature rich GIS add-on functionality Flexible full-text search (brought into mainline in 8.2) Multiple replication options to suit your environment and requirements Powerful  server-side procedural languages are available, and can be extended  (PL/pgSQL is installed by default, but others like Perl, Python, Ruby,  TCL, etc are available) Writing your own extensions is pretty easy Uses multi-version concurrency control, so concurrent performance rocks Fully ACID compliant Commercial support through multiple third-parties is available Well-documented Strong access-control framework Cons Less-mature replication software This  may not be quite accurate, it's more that there's no single de-facto  method that's recommended, widely-appropriate and widely-known by  admins/users Read more here: MySQL vs PostgreSQL comparison
