Is there a tendency of functional programming languages becoming a major force in programming technologies?1. C# -> Functional elements added 2. Python -> Functional elements 3. JS 4. C++
Definitely. The industry is beginning to recognize the value of functional programming as an immensely useful and easy to work with tool that speeds development and makes for clearer, more maintainable code. However, there's definitely a difference between languages like the ones you've listed - which have functional elements to them that have been added in response to the increasing pressure from developers wanting access to powerful functional primitives - and languages like Haskell, OCaml, or Lisp which are built directly for use as functional languages. I see less of a push towards using those purely functional languages, but they are definitely gaining - according to the latest from TIOBE, Functional Languages gained 0.4% of the market from other languages, while OO languages saw a 1.5% decrease. See my answer here for more on why I think functional programming is the bomb.
