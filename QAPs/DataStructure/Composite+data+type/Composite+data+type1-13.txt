What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
I think PostgreSQL is easer to learn, because it has no multiple storage engines. When doing something with MySQL you need to check if the storage supports with. Errors messages are much clearer with PostgreSQL. Performance I just know Firebird is much slower than both. We have picked some open source PHP/MySQL websites for intranet use. It is difficult to find a PostgreSQL one.
