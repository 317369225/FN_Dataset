You will be on quicker pace to learn python considering your background(duh...). [if your first OOP language was java] You will have to unlearn some bad habits of java taught subconsciously as OOP principles. You will understand that once you program in Python. You will find it difficult going back to Java considering how verbose it is compared to Python. In industry, technologies come and go. What remains is the underlying principles.
