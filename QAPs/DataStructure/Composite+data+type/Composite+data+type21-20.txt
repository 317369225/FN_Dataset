What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
I would view my growth path in programming very differently from the other answers I see here. The first step would be learning primitive programming in an interpreted language. Second would probably be learning about compilers, linkers and assembly. Third would be learning about databases and other data storage mechanisms. Fourth would be acquiring understanding of hardware drivers, operating systems and networks. Fifth would be acquiring analytical skills, starting to understand how software reaches and interacts with humans - and vice versa. Sixth would be understanding the appropriate place for software and other computer systems in the business (or other) process - systems analysis.
