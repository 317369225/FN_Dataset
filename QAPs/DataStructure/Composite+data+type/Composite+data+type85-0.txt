What features do you find most valuable in Presentation Software?Is mobile capability taking precedence over the ability to present information clearly and keep your audience engaged?
Mobile capability meaning the ability to present from a smartphone? In my experience, few serious presentations are made on the fly with only a smart phone. As a professional presenter, however, the features of presentation software I find most valuable include (in no particular order): Special presenter's view for multiple monitors Both PowerPoint and Keynote have this, although both only work with a single external display. The ideal software package for me would allow me to use multiple prompt monitors, displaying different content (the current slide, the next slide, the notes, a timer, the current time, stage manager notes, a composite view, a slide sorter view, etc.) "Magic Move" slide transitions Keynote has this, PowerPoint doesn't: the ability to smoothly maintain and move objects from one slide to another. Custom Shows PowerPoint has this, Keynote doesn't: the ability to create and store multiple variations of specific shows from a single large deck, changing which slides are shown, and in which order. Powerful, smooth, 3D slide transitions Keynote is better at this than PowerPoint: the ability to choose from many high-production value, yet non-flashy, transition animations. Path animation PowerPoint has this, Keynote doesn't: the ability to move an arbitrary object around the screen on command. Slide load completion indicator Keynote has this, PowerPoint doesn't: an indication during the show that the next slide/animation has loaded and is ready to go. Show pacing indicator Neither PowerPoint nor Keynote have this, but Ovation from Adobe (discontinued last year) does: a progress bar showing your actual timing in the show compared to your rehearsed timings. Background fill PowerPoint has this, Keynote doesn't: the ability to fill an object with the slide's background image. VERY powerful for certain types of effects. Random slide jump during the presentation Powerpoint has and Ovation had this, Keynote doesn't. It comes in very handy during interactive presentations. Flying workspace views This is the Prezi paradigm, and works great for certain applications. I'm not quite sure how one could integrate it into a slide-based application, but I'd like to see someone try. Object Inspector It takes a slight bit of getting used to for a long-time PowerPoint user, but Keynote's Inspector is a very powerful interface for designing a presentation. Strong ready-to-go templates/themes PowerPoint is making strong strides here, but Keynote still wins hands-down. Not only are the Apple-included templates really classy, but an independent company called KeyNotePro.com offers a simply stunning collection of super-professional templates. Interactive animations Adobe Presenter has a marvelous set, designed for elearning, quizzes, etc. Used appropriately, they can liven up a lengthy presentation, academic or otherwise. Live data inclusion SlideRocket (but none of the others without special add-ins) allows you to pull in real-time data feeds and display them with in-slide formatting during the presentation. Built-in Teleprompter Ovation had this (PowerPoint and Keynote don't), and while I don't use it myself, I'm sure this would be of great value in certain circumstances (especially in conjunction with the multi-prompt monitor display capability described above.) Multiple projector support ProPresenter has the ability to deliver multiple versions of the presentation simultaneously to multiple outputs Professional staging support, including multi-projector masking ProPresenter does a simply amazing job of this, and can be used to run sophisticated live performances. Live integration with smartphone control/display apps Keynote has the ability to use an iPhone as a smart remote, but ProPresenter and StageTimer both allow the presentation computer to broadcast slides, timers, cues and changes to an unlimited number of mobile units. Mobile viewing and presentations Whether native or HTML5 cloud-based, the ability to present anywhere, anytime is a nice-to-have feature, although not the most important. Web viewing and analytics SlideRocket shines here, giving you the ability to see who viewed which slides, for how long, etc. Multi-user real time collaboration on editing Google Presentations (within Google Apps) excels at this, and PowerPoint includes collaboration features, although not real time. Motion backgrounds Ovation had, and ProPresenter has, this; PowerPoint and Keynote don't. Used carefully and in small doses, it can add incredible production value. Built-in Presentation broadcasting PowerPoint has this, using the PowerPoint Broadcast Service, as do applications such as Knoodle and LiveStream. Ability to package with a standalone viewer PowerPoint for Windows has this, but it was dropped from the latest Mac Version, and Keynote never had it. Prezi does, along with the wonderful ability to run from the cloud (along with SlideRocket). This is really needed for distributing self-running copies of the presentation. _______________________________________________________________ I could go on at a great length and fill several more pages, but the bottom line is that I am incredibly greedy (not to mention being a professional presenter who pushes every application to its limits), and I would love to see the ultimate presentation application combining 100% of the best features from: PowerPoint (http://office.microsoft.com/en-u...)
