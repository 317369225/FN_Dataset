What are the differences between Adobe PS Type 0, 1, 2 and 3 fonts?The most widely known fonts in the last decade are Adobe Type 1 and Apple/Microsoft TrueType fonts. But I always wonder, were there Type 0, Type 2 and Type 3 fonts for ATM? If there existed such things, why weren’t they used as widely as Type 1?
PostScript font types: Type 0 was an early composite font format: a virtual font that references multiple component fonts. Type 1, as you know, was the primary end-user PostScript font format. There are different packagings of Type 1 data for Mac, Windows and Unix/Linux. This was the dominant digital font format for graphic design and professional publishing from the mid-1980s onwards, phasing out from about 2000–2010. Although few new fonts are issued in this format, many long-standing users, especially those in graphics and publishing, have extensive libraries of Type 1 fonts. Type 1 fonts were made WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) on screen by Adobe Type Manager circa 1990, for native imaging of the fonts on screen, and to any device—no longer only PostScript printers. Later that capability was added to computer operating systems. Type 2 is a format for representing glyph charstrings that is used in conjunction with CFF (Compact Font Format). CFF with Type 2 charstrings is a lossless compaction of Type 1. This format is used in many places, notably: in the OpenType format CFF table to store font outlines (OpenType fonts may have either CFF or TrueType outlines) for embedding Type 1 fonts in PDF (Adobe Acrobat/Reader format) in PostScript printers for fonts embedded in ROM Type 3 was a font format that basically allowed the full richness of the PostScript language, inside the font. You could do anything in a Type 3 font, including color, gradients, or truly random effects. The problem was, except on a NeXT cube or some obscure device with Display PostScript, you wouldn’t see a reasonable preview on screen (although a matching bitmap font could be displayed, in classic Mac OS). Also, the Type 1 format had a standard hinting language that was lacking in Type 3, so output would not be ideal on lower-resolution devices. In the earliest days (before 1990) the PostScript Type 1 format was proprietary, and other vendors could only make Type 3 fonts, not Type 1 fonts, unless they paid Adobe big bucks to license the format. Type 3 fonts mostly died in the 1990s, so they are all but forgotten now. They were killed by the combination of (1) the desire to reliably image fonts on screen, and (2) the publication of the Type 1 spec. There are actually many other PostScript font types, most of them quite obscure except Type 42, which is a TrueType font inside a PostScript wrapper, invented as a way of sending TT fonts to PS devices which had native TT rendering capabilities. (And yes, the name is a Hitchikers’ Guide reference. Type 42 was “the answer” to the thorny problem of TrueType compatibility with PostScript devices, after those devices added native TrueType rasterization.)
