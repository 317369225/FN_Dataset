What data structures should I know to become a great programmer?
Basics: #1 - 32-bit integer #2 - Byte #3 - 16-bit integer #4 - Array #5 - Pointers / References #6 - Value vs Reference types #7 - String Typical: #8 - Hash table or dictionary #9 - Composite types (structures & classes) #10 - Delegates & events #11 - Xml Less Frequent: #12 - Stack #13 - Queue Advanced: #14 - Lambda expressions Honestly, there are a lot more data structures with which you could familiarize yourself, but they are rarely used (at least by me). I think the vast majority of the coding I do relies mostly on understanding the above data structures. Also, I don't know if the notion of a "state machine" would be considered a data structure, but it also is helpful to understand especially in regards to parsing text.
