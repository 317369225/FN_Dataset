What is the major difference between ISRO's MOM mission and NASA's MAVEN mission that makes the latter cost almost 9 times the former?
The basic mission objectives of MOM and MAVEN are significantly different from each other. In case of MOM, being ISRO’s first interplanetary mission, learning and developing the technologies required for planning and organizing an interplanetary mission was the primary aim. But in case of NASA since they have conducted many interplanetary missions before MAVEN, the objectives seem to be mature and the scientific instruments on board are totally different form that of MOM. These are some of the reasons for the MOM's lean budget 1. Adapting the software and hardware modules for the PSLV launch vehicle which were already available, 2. Following an innovative trajectory to launch the spacecraft at a reduced cost, 3. Involving a huge number of public and private industries (In some of the cases like development of Vikas engine, ISRO has transferred the technology to the local manufacturers and they in turn have built the engine according to ISRO's specification. Totally 170 industries were involved for the Mars orbiter mission. The public private partnership seems to be quiet high. This high level of public private partnership could possibly be a reason for lowering the mission cost, 4. Obtaining the assistance from space agencies like NASA to track the space-craft once they are in deep space, 5. Building only one physical model as against three which is normally done by NASA and ESA, 6. Strictly sticking to the time schedule!!!! Updated 13 Sep 2014 • View Upvotes
