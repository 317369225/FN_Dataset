What are the differences between a Graph database and a Triple store ?
A graph database describes an interface model for interacting with the underlying storage engine, which generally implements a relational algebra internally whether graph, relational, or NoSQL. A triple store is an edge-centric storage model, as opposed to the common entity-centric storage model for many database applications. Graph-like operations are usually more efficient on edge-centric storage models.
