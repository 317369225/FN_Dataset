What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
The most comprehensive wiki I've ever encountered that deals with MySQl vs PostgreSQL comparison: http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/MySQL... On my opinion, if you need to start getting the SQL way of doing you'll better start with PostgreSQL, in this case you'll learn more standard SQL techniques and solutions to the problems so after you'll comprehend any relational database, but the inverse passage from MySQL to standard SQL is quite painful.
