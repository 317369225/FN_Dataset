Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
I found each of C++, Lisp & Haskell to contain genuine ideas that I could not relate to in any other mainstream programming language. C++ has cheap abstractions and value semantics, Lisp has homoiconicity (programs = data) and Haskell has countless little elegant ideas (lazy evaluation, currying, function composition & point-free notation, algebraic data types, pattern matching, type inference, type classes and many more). Moreover, these 3 languages will probably cover every programming language feature you might encounter in any mainstream programming language.
