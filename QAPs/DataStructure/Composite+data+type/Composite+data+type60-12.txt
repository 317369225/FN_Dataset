What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
I answered this question for Data Science but I think it is very relevant for Machine learning folks. http://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-are-some-software-and-skills-that-every-Data-Scientist-should-know/answer/Murthy-Kolluru-3
