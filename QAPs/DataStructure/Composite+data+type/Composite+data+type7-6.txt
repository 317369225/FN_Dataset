Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
I would recommend that you look at you look into the Wolfram Language I am just starting to look at it and it's amazing what it can do. see: The Wolfram Language, the programming language of Mathematica[1] and the Wolfram Programming Cloud, is a general multi-paradigm programming language[2] developed by Wolfram Research. It is designed to be as general as possible, with emphasis on symbolic computation, functional programming, and rule-based programming.[3] It is built to represent arbitrary structures and data.[3] If you want to play with Hardware control then take a look at the Arduino and derivatives including How-To: Shrinkify Your Arduino Projects   If you want to play with graphics I like Processing.org Updated 16 Nov • View Upvotes
