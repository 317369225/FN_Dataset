Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Christian Winter already addressed the language part. The other rather important thing would be graphics and gameplay. And by that I mean artistic elements. Some games can be very simple, requiring no artistic mastey, but most professional games development would need some artists in the team as well.
