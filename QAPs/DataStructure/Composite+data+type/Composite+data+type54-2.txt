Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Yes, many games are written in C today. Check out the so awesome, for free videos were Casey Muratori, a veteran of the game industry writes a game engine (and a game), makes music, sprites, animation and everything else, from scratch. No libraries at all, just bare bones. He even shows you in easy steps how to make a windows app in just few lines, get a controller up and running. Check out Handmade Hero (handmadehero . org) But don't be afraid of things. Just because someone said something is difficult, doesn't make it so, it just says that this person struggled with it. I have rolled my eyes many times and decided something is just too complex, then finding out that isn't so, not even close. So, C++ is not huge, it is not very complicated. C++ has 32 keywords (shared mostly with C) and you can say it has 30 more that C++ only has, so 62 words in total, that is not huge by any means, you can get familiar with those in a few hours. When I was in tech school, we learnt Turbo Pascal instead of C++, thats just the way things were done. But everyone loved it because everyone knows C++ is just so complicated. Everyone was scared of C++, everyone knows a joke or 2 about C++. But the biggest secret in the industry is this, C++ is not hard, not at all. There is just a whole lot of bad code written in it. C++ is easy. It would be like blaming english for bad grammar. I do not use C++ today, but that is mostly because I am an Apple programmer and Web programmer, but I know C++ is there if I ever would do an Linux or Windows GUI app.
