Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Here is a 3D engine (id Tech 3) used in some decent games and was written in C: id Tech 3 But as others have said, the current default is C++ and a scripting language.
