Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Writing a big project with C is theoretically possible. But a game is more than an Operation System. C++ is very powerful tool and nobody force you to use all its features in your project. If you have difficulties with C++ start learning the OO Paradigm before the language. You can learn it from Java introductory tutorials at Oracle website. Lesson: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts And than switch to C++. My advice in short: Start with C++, refactor your code as you learn OO concepts and become confortable with their C++ syntax.Â  You'll need these a lot as your code grows. And do not forget that C++ also supports Generic programming. It is a huge hybrid paradigm language but plenty is no plague.
