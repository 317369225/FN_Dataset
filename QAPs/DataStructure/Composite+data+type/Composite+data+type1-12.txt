What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
One issue not stated here is licensing. Postgres has an extremely flexible license, including allowing you to bundle it into a closed-source commercial product. MySQL Community Edition is free for most purposes, but in certain commercial situations, you might have to buy a commercial license. If nothing else, it might cost you lawyer fees to find out.
