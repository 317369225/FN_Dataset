What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
In addition to Yang's great answer, you may found useful to learn the reasons why Lanyrd's team move from MySQL to PostgreSQL last year [1]. Specifically this: The reasoning for this move was mostly for database features - MySQL lacks a full transaction model, fast column addition, and it's quite bad at using multiple CPU cores, whereas PostgreSQL has all of these - allowing us to make changes to the site in the future with no downtime or read-only mode at all.
