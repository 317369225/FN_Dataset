Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
A great many games were written in C.  (And a handful still are) The Japanese game industry was less keen on C++, and quite a number of recent games used C-based technology. But pretty much all games, whether they use an object oriented language or not, make use of object-oriented representations. Even the simplest game of asteroids has individual items, represented by packets of data, which do things according to their type.    So if you want to code that, you end up with structs, type identifiers and functions which are called based on the identity on structs. And while you certainly can do all this in C with function pointers etc.  It's actually easier to read in C++ (Or Java or Objective C or Swift or....) In other words, games are practically an ideal use case for object oriented languages.    (Although quite a lot of game programmers prefer to use composition rather than inheritance.)
