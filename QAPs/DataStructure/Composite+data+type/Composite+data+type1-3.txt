What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
Technically: Postgres is "better SQL" -- more standardsy, with better query planning so you can follow the relational model more closely if it suits you. Postgres offers a rich variety of data types -- JSON, UUIDs, IP addresses -- and flexible indexing thereof. MySQL's replication solutions are well-tested and well understood, relatively speaking. MySQL's pluggable storage engines and general tune-ability, and acceptance of very large numbers of connections, allow one a fair amount of flexibility in adapting to load.Socially: MySQL has been popular for a long time and many more people are familiar with it. Postgres is neither owned by a major conglomerate with a questionable track record nor forked into half a dozen broadly similar projects.
