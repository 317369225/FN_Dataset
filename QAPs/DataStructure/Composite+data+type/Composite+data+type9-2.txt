Is there a tendency of functional programming languages becoming a major force in programming technologies?1. C# -> Functional elements added 2. Python -> Functional elements 3. JS 4. C++
I'm not a functional language person, but, if not already said: Functional Languages are already a major force in the software industry. Once you dig in, it just makes sense (like so many other things). But the syntax and core functionality is more elusive to most people, thus purely functional languages remain unpopular except for mostly scientific (production) uses. For purely functional languages to be adopted along side predominantly procedural programming, I think that we would need to see a shift in early STEM education geared toward implication, less rote memorization of math formulas and facts ('what follows' versus procedural 'this does this, and means that'). And this wouldn't be a bad thing since the facts would still end-up having to be learned implicitly along the way (such as rote memorization of basic math steps, multiplication tables up to ...).
