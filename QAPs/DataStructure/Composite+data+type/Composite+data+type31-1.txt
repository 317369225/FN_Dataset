Is there an advantage to currying other than concise partial application?Conversations like this one on StackExchange mention several cases where partial application is useful, but is there another reason? Otherwise, one could imagine that a light partial application syntax for, say, records might lead to equally nice- or nicer-looking programs, given the asymmetry curried functions have between taking multiple arguments and returning multiple values.
