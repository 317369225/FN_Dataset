Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Depends on the genre and quality you want. The closer you get to modern AAA quality games, the harder it gets. Developing platformer in C is trivial. In general, as long as you stick with 2D, most likely you can get away with C. Many older 3d games were written in C as well (Q3 engine was a mix of C and C++, as far as I can tell), but the thing is the closer you get to modern requirements - where you have physics, complex animation, the harder it gets to use C, because OOP approach is very natural in this scenario and because languages like C++ have more power. Doom 3 - that was released almost ten years ago - was written in C++. So, instead of stubbornly trying to use your favorite language, I would advise to learn more powerful tools for the job.
