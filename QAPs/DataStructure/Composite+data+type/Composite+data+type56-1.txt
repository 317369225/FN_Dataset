Why would someone use an SQL query when everything is available on GUI?
Ther  are 3 reasons to prefer queries over guide commands. Performance   performance  and performance. Try deleting some records using a nested query for a table which contains approximately 30 million records.  And you need to choose 17 lakh records from this table based on the result that the sub query returns from another table which contain approximately 10 million records (of which 20 thousand records meet your requirements). Now imagine you need to  delete such kind of data from 15 different tables Execute this using any standard GUI like toad or from browser based database UIs. It will take some time.  Maybe around 40 minutes for each query to give the results(if you are lucky). Then try executing the same in our plain old server interfacing tool like putty (sqlplus  installed on it).  It will take maximum of 10 min. Most of the databases in real world are on servers with huge amount of data. So you cannot rely on performance metrics on your basic " employee", the  in built table that Oracle provides for express edition. The numbers I gave in the answer are not random numbers but the number of records  I have recently deleted from a database.  I have observed the difference (actually a huge difference) in performance when executing then on server using queries and tied using same query.  Forget about using GUI options for this operation. I am sure they would have invented  time travel by the time I would have completed my task using GUI tools.
