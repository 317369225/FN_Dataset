How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
There are around 800 commonly used characters. You just need to keep writing to know them well. Or you can start with 千字文 (Thousand Character Classic). It used to be the main Chinese characters "textbook" (written in poem form) for children for more than a thousand years.
