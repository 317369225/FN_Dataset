What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
Machine learning has been one of the hot topic to learn who want to pursue data science, big data, etc. The base point for learning this skills is to learn more about data, experimenting on it, etc. In real world, the simple solution may be enough if you can present your question/request right. Data is a reflection of real world. Without knowing data, data science has no meaning at all. You need to have good knowledge about following skills: Understanding of a broad set of Algorithms and Applied Math Problem Solving Skills Probability and Statistics Programming lanuagesÂ  - Python/C++/R/Java Distributed Computing Analytical skills Knowledge of Big Data and many other advanced skills. Also there are many available courses online that you can checkout. You can checkout their syllabus section to understand more about the skills that you need to learn. Recently I saw opening from one of the analytics companies.
