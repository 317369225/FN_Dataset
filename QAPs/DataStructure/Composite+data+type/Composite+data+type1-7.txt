What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
I will speak to using both with RMySQL and RPostgreSQL from the R programming language. MySQL pros 1) MySQL is simpler to approach as a new user IMO 2) MySQL has more examples in the R and general database world 3) I like the MySQL online documentation better 4) I really like that so many free and paid management user interfaces work with MySQL (especially HeidiSQL) 5) MariaDB drop in engine is a good improvement for analytic speed PostgreSQL pros 1) Cleaner adherence to SQL standards (useful when frequently moving across multiple databases) 2) I like their downloadable documentation 3) Their management console is acceptable 4) Advanced features for business analytics and location analytics 5) Speed out of the box is great, especially for complex queries
