Honest Opinion :- you have to work extremely hard to save your "percentile" how to do it :- get your hands on Time AIMCAT MOCK test. and solve 4-5 of them on daily basis , see how do dey solve the problem. Memorize the way they solve it, the logic they put it. Write down all the logic they use somewhere and revise it on 21. This was my tactic in the last days . And it helped me to save 4-5 question in both section. those question can make a spectular difference in your CAT percentile.
