What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
Over the past a few years, I have interviewed many candidates with machine learning on their resume, got disappointed by 90+% of candidates. Good candidates should have a deep understanding of a broad set of algorithms and math; hands on (familiar with common tools/utilities, could or have efficiently implemented dozens of advanced algorithms before); practical and love tweaking until it works (good sign if s/he had experiences of shipping a few  machine learning components to production before).
