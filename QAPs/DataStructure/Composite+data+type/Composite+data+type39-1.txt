How did famous companies get their names?
Intel Intel was earlier going to be named "Moore-Noyce" (after its founders). That, however, is a homophone for "more noise" - a very bad name for an electronics company. So they named it NM electronics for some time, which was later changed to Intel (Integrated Electronics). HP Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard are the founders of HP. They decided to name the company Packard-Hewlett or Hewlett-Packard based on the outcome of a coin toss. Hewlett won, and thus you have HP.
