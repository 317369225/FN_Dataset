What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
I think the node community is not as helpful as other solutions, like ruby on rails. I site in three node-related channels, and virtually nobody speaks. It takes days to get an answer and researching. It's new, and it is becoming easier. There are mature solutions at this point, but it takes some time to find them. You might think you found something, spend time implementing it, then realize it isn't supported anymore or something else is better, or just is broken. I'm a front-end programming and if you've done any ajax with javascript, then the event-based model isn't too difficult to get your head around. I like node for two reasons, it is fun -- and it will impress employers in a job interview. I would not want to be responsble for an developing an enterprise application under these conditions though.
