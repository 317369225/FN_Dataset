Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Theoretically yes. But the concept of a purely procedural programming language like C will make it exponentially more difficult to keep the software stable the bigger it gets. And professional games usually are pretty big. I would advice against it. Learning C++ first and using it to make the game is probably faster and less painful.
