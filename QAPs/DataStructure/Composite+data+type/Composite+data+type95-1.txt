How do Bayesian algorithms work for the identification of spam?Please provide an example or two.
For Naive Bayes classifier: For every word in your training set of emails, you separately find the fraction of times it occurs in spam and ham emails out of all emails: the spamminess and hamminess. Then given a new email, you get spamminess of all words and multiply them all together, and you get the hamminess of all words and multiply them all together. Whichever number is larger, that's the prediction. ps: we refer to ham as normal emails :) ps2: alright i'll give example too: 'Buy viagra now!' words and their statistics based on how often they tend to occur in spam and ham buy (hamminess: 0.2 spamminess: 0.8) viagra (hamminess: 0.001 spamminess: 0.999) now (hamminess: 0.47 spamminess: 0.53) total ham score: 0.2*0.001*0.47 = 0.000094 total spam score: 0.8*0.999*0.53= 0.423576 spam score > ham score => SPAM!
