How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
First, there is a lot of ambiguity about what it means to learn a character. Can you recognize it when you see it? Can you enter it into a computer? Can you write it by hand? Can you use appropriately in a sentence? I have spent about fifteen hours a week self-studying Chinese for the past twelve years.  After the first year, or so, I realized that characters have a structure and started to recognize them by what components they contained.  So, the recognition rate wasn't constant for me.  It accelerated after the first year, or two. I tried to learn 3 characters a day, but my memory is a leaky basket.  So, a lot of characters I memorized once, sneak out of my brain when I am not looking. I've often heard that one needs to know about 2500 characters to read a newspaper.  Place names and things on restaurant menus seem to a greater vocabulary.  My guess is that if you know 6000 characters, you'll seldom be flummoxed by written Chinese., Because I can read emails, instant messages and newspaper articles with occasional recourse to a dictionary, I think I am roughly at the 2500 level, or I have learned about one character for every four hours of study.
