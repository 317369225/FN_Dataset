Is it best practice to write functional or object orientated JavaScript?I have been programming in JavaScript, mainly node.js, for about 6 months now and am still unsure if it is best to write my code with an object orientated approach or a functional approach. Is there a standard way, the go to when unsure as to which to choose. I wish to further develop my skills beyond beginner/intermediate and believe I should develop my skills in one of these paradigms.
