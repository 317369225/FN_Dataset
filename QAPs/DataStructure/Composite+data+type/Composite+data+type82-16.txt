How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
This question is akin to asking: "How many gallons of gas can a good driver burn through in one day?" or "How many pages can a good author write in one hour?" If you're asking for the typical range, there are too many variables (programming language, coding style, type of program, phase of development, etc.) to give a meaningful estimate. If you're asking for the theoretical maximum for a specific language, it's still a meaningless measurement. In most languages, it's trivial to inflate your source code by simply adding as many line breaks as you want or writing a ton of meaningless code for the sole purpose of increasing your line count. No sane developer would measure productivity or skill by LOCs per hour, just as no one would equate fuel consumption with driving ability or typing speed with being a good novelist. In fact, it's often inexperienced and unskilled developers who write the most code or spend the most time actively writing code (as opposed to researching or considering the problem and planning out their implementation).
