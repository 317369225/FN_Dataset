Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
These days, I'd say C++ and JavaScript. They're both incredibly powerful languages in different ways. C++ is the defacto standard of low level programming, OS development, game development, and other computationally expensive programs. And if you want to extend another programming language, chances are you're writing a C binding. It can compile to probably every machine in existence. C++ also has classic imperative style as well as classes for object oriented style. JavaScript is the defacto language of the web, by virtue of being the only language browser's directly support. But it's also gained popularity on the server side with node.js, and has a far reach into desktop applications using node webkit or node-webgl. You can even run node.js on embedded devices now with raspberry pi. It also is an imperative language, but it has many ways to operate like a functional language as well. It can do OO, but unlike C, does it using prototype based inheritance. Where C's power comes from its ability to access any low-level functionality, JavaScript is powerful in that it provides many more language constructs that can make programming easier. Closures, first class functions, object literals, typeless variables (and soon, optional typing), etc. The only major thing i can think of that JavaScript can't do is lisp-style macros unless you use strings as tokens. Taking JavaScript and C together, you can do anything. Any low level thing could be introduced into node.js via a c extension. Any high level thing can be done in JavaScript. It's somewhat of a power combination. Updated 17 Oct â€¢ View Upvotes
