Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Well of course you can develop games in pure C if you want. Me and a friend built this C3N PLAY | BEYOND LISTENING  in pure C (some objective-c scaffolding is necessary to tie into the iOS operating system but 95% C in the codebase). But for a game with lots of different behaviours you would probably want to integrate some kind of scripting such as LUA. We like C a lot but if we started over today i would probably pick C++. What do you mean by intensive ?  if i where to make a game that fits into a genera that does not contain extraordinary gameplay features i would use an existing engine such as Unity or Cocos 2d or sprite kit etc. And focus on getting the gameplay and feel of the game right.
