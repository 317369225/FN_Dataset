What should a new reporter know about investigating income tax information?
More information please. The last time I checked, the release of tax information by government officials is illegal.  Which is not to say that it doesn't happen all the time.... You can ask the IRS a tax question.  They might give you an answer, but they won't certify its accuracy.
