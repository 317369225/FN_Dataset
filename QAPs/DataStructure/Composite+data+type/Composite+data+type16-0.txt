It is always good to move to Python. I don't see the downsides of it. However, it's also about what you want to achieve. Java is a very strong language (as in strongly-typed) and being a compiled language, it is more performant than Python. The only caveat I think is the fact that you have to think of everything in very strict object-oriented ways (classes and inheritances) which is not very efficient nowadays (trend in newer languages is going more toward compositions/mixins). Python has the benefits of being very flexible and easy to understand. It is used tremendously in the data-intensive fields alongside R and Matlab as well as in web development. It is object-oriented by nature, but you can adopt compositions pretty easily. And not having to think about your data types is a major productivity plus.
