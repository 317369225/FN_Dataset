Is it best practice to write functional or object orientated JavaScript?I have been programming in JavaScript, mainly node.js, for about 6 months now and am still unsure if it is best to write my code with an object orientated approach or a functional approach. Is there a standard way, the go to when unsure as to which to choose. I wish to further develop my skills beyond beginner/intermediate and believe I should develop my skills in one of these paradigms.
There is no "best" practice between these two, no. The most common is the object oriented apporach, but that is mostly for the same reasons Coke is more popular than Pepsi - i.e. habits.
