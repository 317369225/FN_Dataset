What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
1. Callback spaghetti. Colleagues tell me that I should not do too many callbacks to other callbacks, "if you're doing it, you're doing smth wrong". I have come to conclusion that it's like saying "you should drive home to work on the road that is short, straight and does not have many traffic lights". Well, life has different ideas on what we need and should be doing. The very reason to use programming language and code is ability to implement complex logic, and with growing systems that have proven themselves working that's pretty much inevitable. Nobody has any problem debugging 50-level deep stack traces in Java or Python: it's a non-issue, the complexity of the problem and particular input data set is a problem. For some reasons, brains of too many people are not well suited to async callback programming model. This limits it. Erlang, D or even Go language concurrency combined with high performance seem so much more straightforward in terms of brain cycles. And the brain cycles are what's expensive today. 2. Illusion of Javascript being common ground for front end and back end. Front end and back end require different knowledge, focus and interests. The two shall not mingle much. Common language will not help significantly. Choosing common language is almost a solution in search of a problem.
