How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
If you look at the statistics on professional programmers, the numbers of lines added to production by a programmer per day is very low. There are many factors that go into this. For example, how large is the existing code base? How mature is it? How well architected is it? What is the context of the task you are trying to do? How many dependencies are there? What are the goals for service availability and reliability? How big is the team? Earlier in my career I designed and implemented a trading engine. I was writing a lot of code each day. At the end of the effort, I had written nearly 100,000 lines of code over a span of 2 years. But now if I am making a change to an existing system that touches the entire enterprise. Most of the time is spent on the requirements, talking to people to get them on the same page, and coming up with the right design. The coding aspect is maybe 10% of the effort. I may make a 50 line change in this case.
