What should everyone know about making good charts and graphs to represent data?I've seen so many charts and graphs that are misleading.
Rule 1: Avoid 3D Versions of 2D Graphs Sure, they look prettier and any presentation software will give you a whole range of them, but depth distorts any graph where area and position matter. If done unknowingly, this is misleading. If done purposefully, this is a deceitful and shameful practice. See this slide from one of Steve Job's 2008 Macworld Expo keynotes: ​ Notice how the "Apple" segment is at the very bottom, where the 3D effect distorts the size of the pie slice to make it look larger than it actually is. We see that Apple's 19.5% share actually looks larger than the purple slice, and almost as large as the blue slice. Jobs is misrepresenting Apple's market share by adding depth to his pie chart. This is a much better version of the same pie chart: ​ Aesthetically, you should never be doing this anyway since "flat" designs are all the rage nowadays. Rule 2: Avoid Pie Charts Pie charts are actually terrible since you can't compare the areas between sectors efficiently. They represent data that can be expressed in 1-dimension in 2-dimensions, and as a result adds an additional layer of complexity when you're trying to interpret the proportions. Instead, use stacked bar charts. They might be more boring, but all the statisticians out there will thank you. Here's a more compelling presentation of the same data from comScore / Forbes. This representation is lovely as you can easily compare the sizes of the rectangles. Additionally, you can put stacked bar charts side by side to compare how a proportion or value changes across time, or across variants. You can watch Android and iOS duke it out, while lamenting the death of BlackBerry. This is the only pie chart I'll support!
