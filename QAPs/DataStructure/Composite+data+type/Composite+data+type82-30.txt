How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
A good programmer can write anywhere between 0 and 1000 lines of code in an hour, if not more. However, this is a completely meaningless answer because the question is not well formed, or I should say is meaningless. Lines of code have zero correlation with productivity, quality, or anything else for that matter - except perhaps the potential for bugs. And the number of lines is dependent on the language, comments, problem domain, formatting, the degree of copy/paste, and many other factors that contribute to making this answer pretty much meaningless.
