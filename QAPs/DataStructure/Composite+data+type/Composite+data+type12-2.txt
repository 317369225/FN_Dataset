Why is there so much hype about functional programming?I believe every OO programmer has definetly started coding using a functional programming language. For example you start with C and then move to C++ or Java... Why is there so much hype about functional programming nowadays. I mean if everyone has used one at some point and then decided that OO is the way to go?
First off, C isn't a functional programming language. In fact, majority of developers don't learn functional programming. So functional programming is actually a novelty. Like any novelty, it does tend to have a strong cult following. Second, functional programming is a different way of thinking. Even learning a different way of thinking is useful as it gives programmers new perspective. Third, functional programming is actually pretty cool. Most of them are built by the smartest folks in the field.
