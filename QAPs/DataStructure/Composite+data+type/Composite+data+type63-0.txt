What are the compositional differences between the mitochondrial membrane and the cell membrane?
There aren't many differences, eukaryotic plasma membrane is made of more types of lipids. Mitochondrial membranes are largely made of phospholipids and cardiolipin. The difference between the two membranes is also not much, in terms of lipid composition. Here is the data from : Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) database Figure 1 : Distributions of different types of lipids, PC=phosphatidylcholine, PE=phosphatidylethanolamine, PI=phosphatidylinositol, PS=phosphatidylserine, PA=Phosphatidic acids, CL=cardiolipin, Sph=sphingomyelin, Ch=cholesterol, CB=cerebroside, SL=sulfatide, LPE=lysoPE, LPC=lysoPC, PG=phosphatidylglycerol; from : Membrane Protein Lipid Composition Atlas Figure 2 : Distribution of lipids in the outer mitochondrial membrane; from Membrane Protein Lipid Composition Atlas Figure 3 : Distribution of lipids in the inner mitochondrial membrane, from : Membrane Protein Lipid Composition Atlas
