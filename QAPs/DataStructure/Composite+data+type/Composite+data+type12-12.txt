Why is there so much hype about functional programming?I believe every OO programmer has definetly started coding using a functional programming language. For example you start with C and then move to C++ or Java... Why is there so much hype about functional programming nowadays. I mean if everyone has used one at some point and then decided that OO is the way to go?
I personally think the better approach is to support both flavors in the same language. That way you can use either one when it makes sense. C# is a good example. It's object oriented, but also supports some useful functional programming aspects like list handling in Linq. A pure functional approach seems too limiting to me and I don't see how you can build a full application through pure functional concepts. However, I really like it in Linq when querying and working with lists.
