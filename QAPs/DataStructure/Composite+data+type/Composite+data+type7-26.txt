Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
It's hard to answer this well without more context on what you mean by 'field'. If you mean by the broadest set of use cases, I would probably go with C and Javascript. As mentioned in other answers, C is basically the backbone of most of the software you interact with, ranging from OSes to embedded devices. Javascript drives the UX side of the web. That would tick off the boxes for UI/UX and web programming, which C does not do well. If you mean the broadest set of programming methodologies/paradigms, I would suggest Haskell and Smalltalk. Neither are used very broadly, but the echos of those two languages can be seen in nearly every language developed/expanded in the last 20 years or so. Haskell is a strongly-typed pure functional language, and Smalltalk is a dynamically typed language that inspired most of the object oriented language developments since. Both expand your understanding of what is possible in programming languages and give you new patterns to recognize in many other languages.
