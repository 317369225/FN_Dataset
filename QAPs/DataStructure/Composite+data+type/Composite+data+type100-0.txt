What should a new reporter know about investigating income tax information?
I'm not sure what you're going to report on?  Individual income tax records are not available except to an IRS agent auditing them our the individual themselves or there authorized representative.  SOI (statement of income) - composite type data is released by the IRS annually.  Usually, a couple of years old.  I think they are just releasing 2011 days now.  Takes time to compile.
