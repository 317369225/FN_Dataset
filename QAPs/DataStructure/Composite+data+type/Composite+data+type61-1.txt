What is the connection between immutable data and first class (or higher order) functions?
Immutable values have referential transparency. A pure function does not have side effects. These properties work together and are enforced in a pure functional language like Haskell. In impure languages you can still benefit from immutable values and functions phrased as pure functions. These properties enable a great deal more confidence in reasoning about your program. Many people have written about this, including Rúnar Óli Bjarnason at Higher Order. Updated 27 Jun 2014 • View Upvotes
