What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
A good introductory course in Machine Learning is the one offerd by Andrew Ng on coursera. Once done with that you should either go through Andrew's stanford course (all of it is available on youtube) or go through the machine learning course from caltech by Prof. Abu Mustafa (that's my favourite). These courses will give you a good breadth of knowledge. Pursue your interest from there on. There are plenty of resources/lectures on VideoLectures.NET - VideoLectures.NET and youtube. You should also develop some skills in python/c++/java and a stat package like octave/matlab/R. It is also good to know a little about data bases like MySql. A very good introduction to python is at Â  It is also good to have a basic knowledge about Hadoop.
