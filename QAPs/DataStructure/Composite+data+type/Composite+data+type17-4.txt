Why do some people not like OOP and prefer functional programming?Is it just a matter of taste, or are there some other reasons behind it?
For the data processing type of programming I do, mostly transforming and analyzing data the more capable and powerful the language the better. A couple of times I used class definitions to create separate name spaces for sets of similar data. But I'm switching from Python which I love & have used since last century for Racket which has exceptional pattern matching and a pattern based macro system. Greater expressiveness comes from a higher degree of abstractions. Racket has them in abundance and will not only be more fun but allow me to be very much more productive including putting my apps on browser pages or in a window for users.
