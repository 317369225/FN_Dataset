What is the most efficient way to sort 4TB on a single machine with 4GB of RAM?
I think you should read my answer to the following question: What would be an efficient algorithm to sort millions of lines of strings/integers in a file? In any case, as part of that answer, if you only have one data type, I believe that the best suited algorithm is external mergesort, using Two-way replacement selection as the run sorting algorithm. This has proven to be the most efficient in terms of creating the largest runs, no matter the data characteristics, reducing the fan in for merge sort.
