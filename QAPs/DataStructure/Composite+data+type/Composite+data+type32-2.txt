Why are C# and Java not considered as Object Oriented Language compared to the original concept by Alan Kay?Today I just learned that C# and Java don't support Object Oriented Programming (OOP) if judged by the standard of the original concept coined by Alan Kay.  Does that mean that all the things we've been learning about OOP and reading in books are a complete non-sense? Could anybody explain to me why?
As I understand it, the intent was to focus on the peer-to-peer architecture and communications (hence "Smalltalk"), not class hierarchies and data organization.  All existing languages, as far as I know, are designed and operate under the assumption that you're really just going to write an imperative program with structured data and function calls, and the objects are really just "set dressing."
