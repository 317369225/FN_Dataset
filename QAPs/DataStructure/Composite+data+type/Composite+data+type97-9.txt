What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if every programmer went through some sort of natural progression, first perhaps as a larval programmer, moving through "instars" on the way to becoming a pupa, and then finally emerging as a beautiful butterfly? From this analogy, you can see how silly it is to coerce the complex development of a skilled programmer into artificial stages. Of course if you _believe_ enough in such stages, you'll see them all around you. But life's not usually like that (unless you're an insect). A better suggestion than trying to identify larval stages is to ask questions like "How can I grow?" I'd commend Clive Thomas' answer to your attention here. Learn a variety of languages, apply them practically, and embrace your failures as learning experiences through which you can grow. Above all else, abandon ontologies --- artificial classifications that stultify your growth. Become familiar with the context, which is usually a multi-dimensional vector space, and not a nested hierarchy of artificial boxes! My 2c, Jo.
