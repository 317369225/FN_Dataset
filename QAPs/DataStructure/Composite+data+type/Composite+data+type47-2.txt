What are good ways to answer interview design questions?I am going to have a software interview in couple of days. I want to ask about answering design questions like designing twitter, designing a class for a game which reward the player according to his level/score etc. What I want to ask is what is the basic approach/ thought process while answering this kind of questions. Providing examples and resources for further read will be added excellence. Thanks
It all depends on your presentation, that how well you understand the problem and convert into the design so that later it can convert to the implementation items. Here is one of the example where I have written such stuff in detail : Object Oriented Design Interview For Parking Lot Or Elevator
