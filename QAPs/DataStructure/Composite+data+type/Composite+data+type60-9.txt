What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
In my views, the first and foremost criteria is your problem solving and analytical skills. Once you have done enough data structures, the next thing is your knowledge of machine learning: how to apply various machine learning algorithms to solve problems on data; and what algorithms to apply to predict the most consistent value. Programming in Machine Learning involves the knowledge of various machine learning algorithms Supervised and Unsupervised like k-nearest neighbor , Naive Bayes, artificial neural networks, Support Vector Machine, etc. The programming of machine learning can be done in any language you prefer like Java, Python, MATLAB. Knowledge of "Big Data" storage and analysis will also help you in acing the interview. If you are looking for Python, you should have an idea of Scikit Learn, and Numpy.
