How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
If I've got a clear idea of what I'm writing, suitable libraries at hand, a good pattern to follow, little sub routines that I know always work in the particular use case at hand -- I can probably write ~100 lines of code in an hour. Those are the great hours. PS: So many answers given are not to the questioner's point. They simply want to know how many lines of code a programmer can write in an hour -- not whether it's a good idea to ask this question. Now if they turn around and do something foolish with the information, hopefully they will come back and ask us another question. Why so much judgment, advice and editorializing?
