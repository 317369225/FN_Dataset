What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
1) Break the "thinking as programmer" barrier. It takes A LOT OF TIME and some people are unable to do that.  If you can't then its time to rethink your strategy. 2) Pick a technology : C++, Java, .Net or PHP.  Forget about the rest (unless you want to pick the hipster way).   But you should pick only ONE (later you can pick the rest).  The University is not for teaching you anything about those technologies and personally, i think that the University is most a waste of time, you can learn MORE working in a weekend (because some deadline) rather in years of university.   University is about the diploma. 3) Start working, EXPERIENCE IS EVERYTHING. the quicker you start working then the better.   4) Start earning certifications/post degree while you are working. 5) Learn more, learn how the business moves, how you spend more time in reunion, meeting, brainstorming rather in programming.   At this step, you will be able to learn a computer language in a week. 6) Finally, its time to move ahead and sooner or later, you will stop programming at all.
