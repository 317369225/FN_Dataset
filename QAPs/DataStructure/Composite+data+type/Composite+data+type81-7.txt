What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
I realize this is an old question. Many of the answers are old too. My "answer" here is more a comment on all the answers that say "node.js is single threaded" as a disadvantage. A couple of points. As some say, this can be an advantage in some ways by keeping you away from deadlock bugs. But more important, the node.js ecosystem does not force you to program in a single thread when you are writing libraries and modules. You can use native C++ code to handle your multi-threaded needs. This is especially relevant when writing an embedded system or a super high performance server app. The better way to state this attribute of node.js is that the primary event loop is single threaded. If you've done native code or V8 programming you already know that it is possible to create other event loops or do threads in your native code. The magic is that these functions jump back into the single event loop when they emit an event. Frankly this is so incredibly powerful that I think many people are missing some of the capabilities of it as an entire system. Node.js is more than just the JavaScript event loop deep down inside. It has a very powerful engine from Google's browser world at it's core. If you look at the source code to any of node's standard modules, you'll see they exploit threading quite a bit in modules like fs (file system). I love it that they included a provision to use this in a relatively well documented way (if you can handle systems level documentation). Coming back around to the original question: you could say that having to write native addons in C++ is a disadvantage. I personally don't see it that way. C++ is the one constant throughout my 3 decades as a professional developer. It is powerful. It is dangerous. You have to know what you're doing. It can be hell to debug. There's a reason the V8 engine and so many other systems are written it it.
