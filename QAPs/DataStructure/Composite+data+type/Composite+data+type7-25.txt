Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
I am assuming that you are planning for a career, hence from a medium perspective. Rust is a wonderful intro to: low level control of memory, correctness, using language features to serve safety and performance etc. Its library is small but fast growing, and the language is still growing also, but you can too. Smalltalk (today probably the pharo implementation, I had this experience with squeak) is simultaneously a wonderfully productive and malleable environment/language, which makes everything seem possible and fast to prototype, and a world full of new and old ideas not yet well enough known. Two elaborations: If you absolutely need to earn a salary soon, use python instead of Smalltalk, but come back for it asap. As soon as you are starting to feel too comfortable, learn Haskell, that seems to be a permanent cure to "think I more or less know it all now".
