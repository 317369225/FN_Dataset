What are the best online big data courses for people with no programming background whatsoever?I am an Engineer with an MBA in Finance and currently working in the fraud detection industry as an auditor. I am looking for a big data course that will help me with analytics. I do not have any prior programming experience or knowledge and looking for something that provides solution from scratch. Thanks in advance!
It is undeniable that you don't have any programming skills. There is a website called eduCBA, that provides online course on Big Data. The best thing about this site is they provide online technical and non-technical support in case necessary during and after the course. They also provide certificate on completion of the course.
