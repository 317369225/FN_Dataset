Is there really any fundamental difference between earth science and astronomy?They're basically both the study of radiative transfer, fluid flows, gravity, and the like.
Though the physics is the same, the data type and quality is different. One of the major differences is the existence of "ground truth" in earth science. For many earth science satellites, their measurements can be accurately calibrated using measured quantities. For example, in determinations of water temperatures from LANDSAT, the calibration is periodically checked by physically measuring the water temperature. This ensures (verifiability) accurate measurements of physical quantities which are then used as inputs for models and studies. In astronomy there is generally no way to obtain this "ground truth" (perhaps with the exception of objects in our solar system which have active probes/rovers), so physical quantities must be inferred and/or checked via consistency with other observations. Related to "ground truth" is the physical accessibility of the objects of study. In earth science, researchers can often physically interact with the system being studied, which enables one to directly measure more quantities (temperatures, compositions, etc.). With limited exception (again, robotic probes on planets), astronomical data is limited to electromagnetic (light) observations, and physical properties must be deduced from these observations. That places limits on the detail and precision of determination of physical quantities. Another difference is the resolution of available data. Earth science data will generally be of much higher spatial and temporal resolution. This should improve the ability of scientists to discriminate between competing models.
