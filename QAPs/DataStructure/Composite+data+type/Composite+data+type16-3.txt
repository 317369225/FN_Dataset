In field of programming, Its alwasy good to learn different languages if you are not only interested to earn money, but also interested to explore field of programming. I have also worked on many different programming languages , Initially I was also worried a lot because Java/J2ee was my primary skills. Gradually I have realized that learning different languages have actually helped a lot to understand inside of each lagauges, It would certainly help you when You will every get chance to design software from scratch. So, Dont be afraid, Learning anything new will never be wasted.. Cheers.
