What are the advantages of Scala over C++ and Haskell?http://www.theregister.co.uk/201...
Hello Berk D. Demir. I have long experience in C++. Let me comment on your comments. - GC in Scala. You say it is worse not to have, but it's a fact that a GC is a feature that the runtime must support. This would violate the zero-overhead principle C++ targets. In some kind of apps, you cannot afford a GC either, not even dynamic memory allocation. C++ lets you control this. - Type system: C++ type system, for its age, is really good, new techniques have appeared that can eliminate the type for (visible) dynamic memory allocation, such as boost::any or std::function type-erasure, which is really powerful. This is still hairy to implement, though, compared to traditional inheritance. I hope that when static type reflection and code generation is added, this can be done in an easier way, or as a language feature. That said, if I had to choose 3 languages to learn, Scala would be one of them, together with Rust. I really like it.
