What is the difference between SimpleDB and DynamoDB?
There are a lot of underlyng technical differences but, as a user, the important feature differences are: SimpleDB indexes all columns, DynamoDB indexes only the primary key (which can actually be a combination of two columns for ranged queries).Â  This makes DynamoDB much faster although less capable. DynamoDB is priced according to "allowed reads and writes per second" measured in "Read / Write Capacity," SimpleDB is priced according to the "computational expense of performing your queries on our servers", measured in "Machine Hours" (which can be extremely hard to gauge preemptively). DynamoDB automatically distributes data so you can incrementally scale instead of provisioning large chunks (in "SimpleDB Domains" of 10GB a piece) at a time and manually partitioning the data yourself.
