What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
I generally love Node. But one thing that I find really, really annoying is how it handles modules. Specifically how many modules seem to be nested rather than stored under some root level directory and accessed as dependencies from there. I've had a couple projects break because the path was too long. The path was too long. What? As in it would look like: blah/node_modules/blah.0/node_modules/blah/node_modules/blah/node_modules/blah Or something like that... On and on and on. It broke my git on Windows. I tried long path, but eventually I had to delete plugins just because their path was too long. That's just stupid. It's also ugly and unnecessary. It would be so easy to fix, too. With an index of modules, or module directories, or even just picking a shorter path name as a crude solution (e.g. nm instead of node_modules). EDIT: The just released Node 5 has NPM 3.3 which supposedly now supports a fix for this. Kudos Team Node! Updated 16 Nov • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Igor Silva
