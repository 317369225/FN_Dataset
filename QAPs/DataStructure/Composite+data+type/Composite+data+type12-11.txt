Why is there so much hype about functional programming?I believe every OO programmer has definetly started coding using a functional programming language. For example you start with C and then move to C++ or Java... Why is there so much hype about functional programming nowadays. I mean if everyone has used one at some point and then decided that OO is the way to go?
End of Moore's Law => Distributed systems and parallelization are no longer academic topics. Programmer productivity > System performance. Better compilers and runtimes => "Intent = Code" is reality. Correctness, Performance analysis of parallel code is difficult, if not infeasible with state. Strong statically typed languages play well with functional programming and catch elementary errors earlier. Large scale data processing platforms are built on stateless functional paradigms driving adoption of functional languages.
