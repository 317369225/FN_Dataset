What is database refactoring?Any practical example to understand it?
Refactoring your database is just like refactoring your code, but for your data. After a program has been used for a few years, the uses for it will usually have drifted from how it was originally specced. Or possibly it has undergone a series of small code changes that have been implemented with an eye to speed of implementation, instead of looking at the impact of those changes on the overall program. Refactoring involves looking at the data you have now, deciding in which ways the current data structure is no longer suitable to the data, and modifying it into something more suitable. A simple example might be if you the program had a "favourite products" field to hold 1 or 2 words, and you expected the staff would only ever search on just one of them. And let’s say this table was set to use the InnoDB engine. Over time, people found it useful to use the field for dozens of that customer’s favourite products and they now want to be able to search for multiple items, regardless of what order they appear in. You might refactor the table by switching it to use the MyISAM engine, which supports “full text” search, modify the indexes on that field, and update the code to “match / against” when people search. Now staff can enter any number of keywords and find customers that most closely match that search. (e.g., find all customers who like tomatoes, parsnips and beets so the staff can let them know they are having a special this week when those products are all bought as part of the same order.)
