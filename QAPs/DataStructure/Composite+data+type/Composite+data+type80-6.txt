How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
Let's try the divide and concur way: 10 words a week, you will do about 500 in a year.  which needs you to have about 250 study hours in a year, about 2 words in one hour. If you are a fast learner and have a great memory, you might be able to double it to 1,000 with about 1 1/2 hrs daily study (not including the time you have to do other related writing, reading, and etc.)
