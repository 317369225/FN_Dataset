How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?Please provide your complete/exhaustive preparation details, if possible.
A very good friend of mine scored 99.5 percentile. She made sure to study regularly(never stay out of touch) i.e. hardly 2 hrs a day Complete all your assignments in time. Attend all the test at your coaching institute. Make teacher's go crazy with your doubts(Of which many are shy of) Towards the end she took time off for about 2 weeks and put in her maximum efforts. For the last two weeks all she did was give tests and analyze where she went wrong, and then revise topics in which were troubling her.Its no rocket science mate. "Fast and consistent wins the race"
