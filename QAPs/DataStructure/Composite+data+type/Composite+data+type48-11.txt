How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?Please provide your complete/exhaustive preparation details, if possible.
I started my serious preparations for CAT around July 2013. I prepared well in those 3 months. I was good in section 1 and LR but average in VA. I used to run out of time in section 1 and had time remaining in section 2. Unfortunately I didn't have a good day on Nov 10,2013, the D day that year and I didn't perform as expected. Long story short: I managed 98.93 and with my abysmal academic scores, I got nowhere. After I graduated in May 2014, I was jobless. (You might like to read Chandresh Kakliya's answer to What should I do when I feel shattered upon seeing students from IIT's get placed at whopping packages of which one can only dream of?). Till June end I was rejected by FMS. Now after being depressed for few days, I knew I had to do well this year. I had put all my eggs in one basket, CAT. This year there was a change in pattern of CAT. Last year we were allotted 70 minutes for each section with 30 questions each and section 2 breakup was generally 20/21 VA-RC and 10/9 LR respectively. But this year they increased the total time to 170 minutes and 50 questions in each section. Breakup for Section 2 was 34/35 VA-RC and 16/15 LR respectively. The best part was you were allowed to navigate between sections. This line changed the whole experience of writing CAT. Earlier I was worried a lot about VA. But not so much now. I had 50 questions in QADI, 15/16 questions in LR. Now these were my top priority. I never neglected these 65/66 questions. My calculation was if I can attempt even 50 of these questions and 10/34 questions in VA, I will have a decent mock. One of the most important part of my preparation was planning. I laid out a 2-2.5 month plan covering details of each day's work. I spent around 2-3 hrs coming up with a schedule to follow till CAT. Now I didn't have to think everyday what to study. I had done that job once and for all. I had a target to complete everyday. It consisted of mock, analysis, some brushing up of topics. It's not like I completed my targets but I came close to 90 percent. I was enrolled with CL and had access to TIME's material from a friend. I wrote 21 CL mocks(10 proctored, 10 unproctored, 1 proctored old pattern), 19 AIMCATs new pattern and 5 AIMCATs old pattern. I had good days as well as bad days, but the schedule was maintained. I saw abysmal scores of 93 percentile as well as dream scores of 99.9 in mocks. On November 15, one day before my CAT, I practiced staring at a computer screen for 30 minutes before taking a mock. On the D-day, I started my paper with QA-DI. I found it unbelievably easy. DI's were a little tricky but I did them too. I had attempted 49 questions and was not sure of 1 question in QA. I generally don't take chances in QA-DI and LR but since there was a chance to get all 50 correct, I took an educated guess. The best part was I had completed that section in 85 minutes, exact half time. I didn't need to spend extra time on this section. Then I went to LR. They were little difficult but since LR is my bread and butter of this section, I spent more than necessary time on them, even rechecked them and made sure all 16 were correct. Now I had 66 attempts. In the 45 mocks I had given, I used to be satisfied at 65-70 attempts. My highest attempt was 74. So, I got a little complacent. This is where I went wrong. I attempted only 16 out of 34 VA-RC questions. Mine was the first day, first slot. I had no idea paper was going to be so easy. I had gone with a made up mind and this is where I made a little mistake. But nevertheless, I got an okay percentile. Overall:99.79 QA-DI:99.96(My guess 3 incorrect) VA-LR:96.61(My guess 3 incorrect) My advice on your CAT 2015 preparation is Chandresh Kakliya's answer to Which is the best way to prepare for CAT 2015? Thanks for A2A. Also, I am pleased to inform that admissions to FMS are currently open and registrations close on Nov 15, 2015. For any queries join Log into Facebook | Facebook group.
