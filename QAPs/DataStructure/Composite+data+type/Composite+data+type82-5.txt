How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
The industry average is about one or two. If this sounds absurd, it is!   But there is also some truth in it. On large completed tasks, if you take the code size of the final project, then divide by the number of developers and the number of man days spend on the project, the "average lines per day number" often turns out to be around ten or twelve lines of finished code per day per programmer. So massively productive shops which beat that figure by tenfold, still means a production rate of only ten or twenty lines per hour. I think smaller shops can work faster. I checked a recent project I worked on singlehanded. (and was published) I wrote 12,000 lines of Objective C in 10 weeks. I make that 30 lines per hour Updated 20 Oct • View Upvotes
