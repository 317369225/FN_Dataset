What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
Here is my personal experience Stage 1: Watching a lot of videos and downloading a hell lot of books but never getting into them and then one day you decide that you have had enough of procrastination and start watching those damn videos and start following the exercises. You begin to understand the whole scheme of things but aren't able to reproduce the same piece of code without looking at the examples again Stage 2: You can finally start building something, but decide to use an Angular or an Express because its cool and much much easier to use than coding in the core language. Stage 3: You being to realize that your code is utterly unreadable and unmaintainable and you are always on stackoverflow and google trying to find out solutions to your problems. You also start seeing the work of pro developers on Github and start to admire their code and buy their books, reading them is another story but you start to realize what are the many things that you can do to improve your code. Stage 4: You start exploring the language and how things work at a lower level and start reading about design patterns and architecture. Right now that's where I am at. I guess the next stage would be start building up on Stage 4 and do something awesome.
