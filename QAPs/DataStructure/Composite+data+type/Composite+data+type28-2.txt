What was the greatest challenge you faced as a software engineer?
I have faced 3 kinds of challenges: Technical challenge - Learning intricacies of a new software within the stipulated time of a project. Often times you are put on a project where you have, say, 6 months to execute it but the technology you'll be working on is not your area of expertise and then you have to spend time learning it within a month or so. This is particularly tough, especially when you are dealing with several unique concepts all at once. Management challenge - Working with teams spread out globally. Working with such teams (that work in different time zones) involves hand-offs at the end of your shift and beginning of their shift. You have to explain things ranging from business requirements, design decisions and development decisions to details of coding, modularization, unit test cases within a short couple of hours. If you are not working with an experienced team (both onsite and offsite), then this communication will most likely be of poor quality resulting in the exchange being meaningless and ultimately wasting one full offsite working day and one full onsite working day. Social challenge - From an extrovert to an introvert. I used to be an extrovert when I was studying in college but then I became a "software engineer". This led me to learn that you must not speak until you have researched all your facts. Unfortunately, that's not how it works with girlfriends and wives, especially when they ask if they are looking pretty or not. You got to learn to turn off your analytic mode at the end of your work and turn on your cheerful, carefree, party mode when you get back home. The greatest challenge for me is the social challenge.
