What are some limitations/disadvantages of functional programming?
I tried recently to rewrite my C implementation of the optimal disjoint-set data structure [Page on princeton.edu] in Clojure, a functional language. And I was astonished by the difficulty involved in getting an efficient implementation using its purely functional part. My C code was under 50 lines, and was easy to write. I suppose that I should read the paper [Page on www.lri.fr] first. I ended up using "ref" type in Clojure to represent each set, thus introduced destructive updates. The code is under 30 lines. Not bad:) Updated 26 Apr â€¢ View Upvotes
