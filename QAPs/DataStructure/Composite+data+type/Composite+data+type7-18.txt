Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
Scala: Scala meets the two most used paradigms in the programming field: Imperative and Functional. In Scala you can use both with a correct balance of use. I believe the programming world is focusing in two emergent technologies: BigData and IoT. The JVM is a great engineer inventory because of the support of concurrency and portability (two important factors for computation today) Scala runs over the JVM which allows to process big data concurrently in an easy way, but in Scala you can also teach programming, build business applications, network applications, general purpose, Reactive Applications, etc. Javascript: Basically because all the web world is written in Javascript. Is a very simple and powerful language. And today I believe all the software world is running in the web. The Go language could be another important player in this scenario.
