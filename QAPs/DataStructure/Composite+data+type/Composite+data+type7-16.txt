Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
ScalaFunctional & Object-Oriented. Declartive, immutable, concise, excellent concurrency & collection libraries. Functional, but not fanatic about it - you can still do side-effects when you need them without any hassle. Can do both small simple apps, and huge scale apps, and does it really fast. Static typing with type inference makes it very comfortable to use, especially with IDEs with autocomplete etc. As well as being interoperable with everyÂ  java-.jar out there, it can also be used anywhere javascript is used today thanks to scala.js. So it has web covered as well. C or RustWe need to go low-level whenever we want to squeeze out every little drop of performance out there. Crunching numbers, calculating light-reflections in video games, drivers for devices, every tiny embedded system out there cannot realistically have the entire JVM in it. Scala is not optimal for your microwave-machine. And Scala has absolutely no concept of the low-level internals of machines like memory. So we need either C or Rust in addition to Scala to do the "wet-work" that makes higher-level applications possible. We simply cannot do without. (Rust looks like a very promising successor to C, but is not quite production ready yet afaik, so we need C as substitute for a few more years.)
