Biochemistry: What are some of the most controversial topics in biochemistry?
To add to Sai Janani Ganesan's point about lipid composition: There are some studies which show spontaneous formation of budding structures in mixed bilayers, caused by the mismatch in the lipid composition. For example, three structures are suggested: budded, dimpled and flat states: There are some calculations that been done using the 'similarity index' (a unoriginal name made by me!), which takes into account both the curvature and the mixture itself. Hence, as this phenomena is not seen in cell membrane, it can be argued that cholestrol might be 'plugging' in the gaps to prevent such local phase separation. The properties of liquid, and following that, bilayer interfaces in mixed bilayers is a rather unknown field, and the prevention of the above phenomena may give a hint to the real composition of membranes. The maths behind each is quite complicated though, so I'll possibly elaborate on this in a future answer with greater clarity. ------------------------------------------------------------------ [1] http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3789 [2] Page on arxiv.org [3] http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5123v1...
