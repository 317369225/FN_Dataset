What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
Transactional DDL is a pretty big win for postgres vs mysql. Useful in rails migrations where failed migrations without TDDL force you to restore a backup where as postgres simply undoes the changes leaving you in clean state. It is often noted that Innodb has transaction support but its my understanding that it doesn't offer transaction support at the level of table drops and column editing. http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/...
