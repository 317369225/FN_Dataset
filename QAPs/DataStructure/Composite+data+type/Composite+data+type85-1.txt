What features do you find most valuable in Presentation Software?Is mobile capability taking precedence over the ability to present information clearly and keep your audience engaged?
The ability to easily make images line up in consecutive slides. This empowers me to create faux-animations on the fly. Of course I would much rather be empowered to make actual animations easily... but it's all about baby steps.
