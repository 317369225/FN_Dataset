In Hadoop MapReduce, is it possible to support multiple reduce methods for the same Mapper input?
my short answer - you can do it , and it is often a good idea. long answer - I think the case Joydeep mentions - map output being much smaller than input is a common case. The common metrics that you compute (such as count, sum, avg etc) can benefit from use of combiner. If you use combiner, the time spent in sort+shuffle is likely to be much smaller than time spent in reading the input.Â  (In large clusters I often see that reads from hdfs are not happening from local disk.) Pig combines the query into single map reduce script in such cases. See example in slide 16 - http://www.slideshare.net/thejas...
