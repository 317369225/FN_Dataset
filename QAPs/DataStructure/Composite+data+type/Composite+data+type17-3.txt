Why do some people not like OOP and prefer functional programming?Is it just a matter of taste, or are there some other reasons behind it?
Some tasks can be implemented more succinctly using functional programming. FP also has some advantage in parallel programming. But overall it does seem like a matter of educational background and personal taste.
