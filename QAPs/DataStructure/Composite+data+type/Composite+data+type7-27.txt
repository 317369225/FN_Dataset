Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
It really depends how you define the largest field. In terms of market share it's probably hard to beat Java alone by any other two languages, let alone Java + JS as mentioned by Carlos Matias La Borde. That said Java and JS don't really work together outside of web applications (not the main application of Java in the first place). Basically it's like asking which two foods feed the most people? The answer is probably rice and wheat, but the two mostly don't go together. In terms of coupled functionality C++ and Python are by far the most powerful pair. C++ allows you to do everything from extremely low level operations, to powerful OOP development. Python is extremely versatile, cross platform and has tremendous library support. If you use boost python you can effectively wrap your C++ libraries and use them from python (which a lot of smart companies are doing right now). This gives you the best of both worlds at very little cost.
