What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
Originally Answered: What are the Growing stages of programmer?No. I know people desperately want to live in a D&D world where there are linear "levels" that you can achieve and write on your chara--I mean resume--to explain to people how wonderful you are. But no, there's no such thing.  Everybody struggles (unless they're at a boring job) and everybody's always learning.  The industry is still young enough that it fits comfortably within a human lifetime, so it's not even like civil engineering (a career that has existed, at least informally, for thousands of years) in that we don't even know what "good" looks like. Or maybe the "growing stages" are "try things, work hard, screw up, learn something, go home for the night, and come back to try the next things"...
