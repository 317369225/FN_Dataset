How are images displayed on screen by code?My dad has always had this fascination with images on the internet and how they are put onto the screen by code. As a beginner programmer who has just recently gotten into the magical land of print functions and class files, he asked me how images are displayed on a screen by code. He always thought that it was binary code, however I'm not a hundred percent sure, and I wanted to find out for him.
