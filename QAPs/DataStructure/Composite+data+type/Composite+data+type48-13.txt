Originally Answered: What should I do for a good percentile for the CAT?As Sanjay Anand Mishra has rightly put you need to start solving mock test papers with a through analysis of approach. I would like to add one more point, get to know the trick of eliminating the wrong choices from the provided multiple choice answers. Since you have a limited number of options as answer its easy to work backwards by eliminating the non probable options. The best reference (link below) I can provide is this video from CL by Gejo as to how to use Substitution, Approximation and Axioms for solving algebra, arithmetic and geometry questions respectively. Hope this helps. Best of Luck for D-Day!!!
