What is the strongest argument for functional programming?Or is this paradigm completely obsolete in front of OOP.
Extracting and reusing common patterns is an important principle in programming, and many aspects of the functional paradigm support that. E.g. the ability to use (pass / return) functions as values supports composition of algorithms, while algebraic data types support composition of data structures.
