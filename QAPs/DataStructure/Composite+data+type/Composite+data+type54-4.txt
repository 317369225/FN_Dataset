Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Theoretically yes. You can theoretically write an entire operating system in C as well. UNIX did. However, if you are thinking about things like Unreal, please do note that even Unreal Engine itself is written in C++. At least start by saving your work in .cpp and try some simple shorthands. You don't have to go full objective yet if you can't grasp the idea. This StackOverflow user has a question that may help you: C++ tutorial for experienced C programmer
