What data structures should I know to become a great programmer?
Arrays, Expandable Arrays, Associative Arrays, Heaps, and if you're in a language without objects, Structs or Records. As someone who specializes in data structures, I am continually amazed in the sparse frequency of utility that the advanced data structures give. Some very advanced and interesting projects, the game Braid comes to mind, use only Arrays. I've noted in other quora posts the sparsity of how often my colleagues use anything outside of Expandable Arrays and Associative Arrays. And they are an incredible asortment of individuals that are humbling to work with. Data structures don't solve you're problems, you solve them. Data structures just reduces the code's complexity (ignoring the complexity of the data structure), alter its memory footprints, and hopefully reduces run/operation time. Since many of us have billions of extra bytes of memory and are processing toy-sized datasets or streams, the latter two benefits of choosing a better data structure are often moot. (I define toy-sized dataset as under a terabyte or under 1000 items per second)
