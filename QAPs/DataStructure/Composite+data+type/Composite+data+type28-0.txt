What was the greatest challenge you faced as a software engineer?
One thing I struggle with is finishing things. I've started lots of side-projects; I've finished very few. For example, I'll get the basic infrastructure for my project down, and then get bored filling in all the necessary components for it to be usable. Sometimes I'll work out in my head how everything should go together but won't feel like coding it all up. Sometimes I start a new project based around learning a new tool (language or framework or whatever) and get bored of the project once the excitement from the novelty wears off.
