How did dinosaur arms evolve into bird wings?
Some dinosaurs, for example the microraptors, had wings before they became full blown birds as we know them now. Birds are considered to be "avian dinosaurs" by many paleontologists (Dinosaur-Bird Relationships). There was a recent discovery of a fossil microraptor, Changyuraptor yangi, that had wings and also a long feathered tailed and feathered legs, looked like a "four winged" creature because of that (Four-winged dinosaur found in China). The original article is here: Page on nature.com Flight has evolved independently more than once in vertebrates, think of pterosaurs, and bats. It's not too difficult to evolve wings.
