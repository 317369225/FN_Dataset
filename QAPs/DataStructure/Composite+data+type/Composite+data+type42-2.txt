What should everyone know about making good charts and graphs to represent data?I've seen so many charts and graphs that are misleading.
I recently came across an excellent talk on visualization, given during 2013 version of CS109 of Harvard Extension School It was more or less based  on Tufte's Design principles 1) Clear, detailed and thorough labeling and appropriate scales As  seen in below example, the difference between "Now" and "Jan 1 2013"  looks huge. But, if we look closely, the scale does not start with zero. Ideally, in such cases, it should be mentioned that it is "non zero based" scale. If it has zero scale, it looks like Reference :- http://flowingdata.com/2012/08/0... Another example of Scale distortion On  first look it seems like, it is increasing sequentially till 2012. But  on closer look you observe that year (x axis) is not in sequence 2) Size of the graphic effect should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities The difference between the different doctor sizes does not relate to actual difference in the numbers. Same is the case with Barrels. Another thing to avoid is, 3D graphs as explained in another answer. 3) Maximize Data-ink ratio Does 3D effect or Shadow really help? The Image below looks much better and simpler. 4) Avoid Chart Junk Avoid un-necessary details that distracts from visual elements. Below chart has many details which could be easily removed Grid lines, background color and borders could be removed. It looks much clearer afterwards Another important points to consider is Which chart to use to indicate what, explained nicely at @Page on typepad.com Avoid using Rainbow color schemes which is usually the default scheme in many plotting libraries. @Subtleties of Color (Part 1 of 6) Answers are based upon Lecture 3 of the course.
