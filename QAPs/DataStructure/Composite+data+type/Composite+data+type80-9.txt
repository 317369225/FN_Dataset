How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
I am currently using Tuttle: Learning Chinese Characters - The First 800, (http://www.amazon.com/Tuttle-Lea...), and I am having a lot of fun with it. I have learned 250 characters in about 6 weeks by studying a few hours a day for 5 days a week. Unfortunately, I imagine there are diminishing returns to a certain extent. After all, the beginner characters are fairly easy to remember (e.g. 一，二，三), and I will need to keep refreshing my memory to ensure I don't forget the old ones. I think 1,000 characters in a year is perfectly achievable, but maybe I am speaking too soon.
