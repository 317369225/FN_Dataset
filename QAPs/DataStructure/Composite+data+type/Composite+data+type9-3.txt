Is there a tendency of functional programming languages becoming a major force in programming technologies?1. C# -> Functional elements added 2. Python -> Functional elements 3. JS 4. C++
Functional Programming Languages are going to be a major force in next 1-2 decades. You can see that all major languages like C#, C++, Python has functional programming concepts. Even Java 8 is going to have many functional programming concepts derived from Scala. The major force behind functional programming acceptance is the support writing concurrent applications more easily than imperative programming languages. And as more and more cores are being added to a processor we are going to need something so that we can develop concurrent applications easily. In current Imperative Programming world, all variables mutable. This makes the programs written in them difficult to work in a multithreaded environment. We would have to use Locks and other synchronization techniques to synchronize the access of multiple threads on same data. These synchronization techniques are a big overhead and decrease the performance gains due to multithreading. In Functional Programming world, all variables by default are immutable. With this there is no need of synchronization between multithreaded applications. Although, we are still not there yet. But we will hopefully see something in coming years. And then we would be able to completely use the power of multiple processors.
