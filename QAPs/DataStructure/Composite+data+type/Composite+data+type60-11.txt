What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
Let's start small here. Do this one thing: attend Machine Learning class by Andrew NG on Coursera. It will give you a broad understanding and practical experience about the field. During the course you would learn the basics of Octave/Matlab which are good tools to prototype ML algorithms.
