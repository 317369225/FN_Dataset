Why is there so much hype about functional programming?I believe every OO programmer has definetly started coding using a functional programming language. For example you start with C and then move to C++ or Java... Why is there so much hype about functional programming nowadays. I mean if everyone has used one at some point and then decided that OO is the way to go?
Functional programming is useful in tandem with OO programming.  Embed functional expressions for results which change frequently inside your classes, so that instead of calling a variable from the class, you call a function from the class and get; set; the updated value.  Functional programming's strength lies in being able to pipe the result of one function into another, saving you lines of code and unnecessary consumption of resources.
