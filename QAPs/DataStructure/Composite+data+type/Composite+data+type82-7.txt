How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
Some of my favorite days are when someone shows up with a really nasty bug. Looking at the code, there's no apparent way it could be doing what you observe. You insert print-lines and assertions, write tests and eliminate one theory after another. Finally, the truth comes out and you drop in a line or two and - bang - works like a charm. Those couple of lines may be trivial, but diagnosing the problem and pinpointing the fix make a very satisfying day's work. Some of my most productive days have resulted in 1 line of code.
