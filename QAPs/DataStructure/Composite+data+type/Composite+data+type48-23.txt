How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?Please provide your complete/exhaustive preparation details, if possible.
I've been ATA'd so check this link for my answer. Karan Singh Arora's answer to Can an average non IITian make it into IIM Ahmedabad in the first attempt with three months preparation? However please note that I wasn't targeting IIM or 99%ile or anything. I was expecting (and would have been happy with) something in the high 70s/low 80s.
