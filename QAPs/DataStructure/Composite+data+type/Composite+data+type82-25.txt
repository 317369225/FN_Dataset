How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
Hahahaha,  Do the lines have to be good? Seriously though, line count is probably one of the most worthless metrics in programming.  It's really the complexity of the problem being solved. For example: I've written a complete win32 and POSIX validation test suite (don't ask) where basically I was taking specifications and converting them into test case code.  I was averaging about 5K lines a day for awhile.  How tough is it to read a specification and convert it into code -- not too rough.  Your brain basically goes to autopilot (as it has to to remain sane). On the other hand I've spent a month making sure 1000 lines of really difficult and complex code did it's job properly... not too many lines per hour during that phase. As programmers mature you typically see the line count question completely goes out the window.  Metrics that perhaps make more sense is how simply and efficiently you can solve complex problems.
