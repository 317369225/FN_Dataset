Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
I would recommend C and JavaScript. As C language can be used to build any software with minimum or no need of external libraries, and few bugs or no bug. And once you think of modern web applications , you should think of browser friendly language that is JavaScript. JavaScript has been extended and given more capabilities to build a software, as nowadays JavaScript can play both client/ frontend and server side/backend programming language, and Node.js can approve my argument.
