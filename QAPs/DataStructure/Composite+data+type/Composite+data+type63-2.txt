What are the compositional differences between the mitochondrial membrane and the cell membrane?
The notifiable compositional differences are in relation to the membrane proteins rather than the lipid or carbohydrate constituents.   Classes of proteins constituting the cell membrane is mainly related to translaminal transport for maintaining electrochemical balance; for ingestion of nutrients and excretion of metabolites; and receptors for various ligands. While that in case of mitochondrial is related to Electron transport chain (ETC), apoptosis (bcl class), transport of metabolites to and fro that are metabolised in the mitochondrion.   Cell membrane is a single lipid bilayer membrane, while that of mitochondria is a double layer, viz., inner and outer membrane.
