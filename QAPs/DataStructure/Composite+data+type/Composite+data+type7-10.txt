Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
Oh! Did the question mention "powerful and cover the largest field in programming?" Then Java and C/C++ can not be mistaken. C/C++ pair are individually and collectively the most powerful programming languages in computer ecosystem. They give you the power to do and undo, you just have to be careful not to shoot yourself on the foot. Because, to whom much is given much is expected, and you can only expect great responsibility when you have much power. In terms of ubiquity, they are just every where. Nearly every operating system, every game engine is built on C/C++. They are almost what transistor is to digital electronic. Java, almost did not make this list, but this is not yet the time. Java is just everywhere and has proven to be truly write once run many (worm) - thanks to the JVM. Java has successfully deployed in more than 3 billion devices ranging from Desktop, laptop, Smart card, Digital Set top boxes, Servers, web browsers, mobile phones, Smart meters, Digital TV, Micro wave devices, anywhere... When it comes to power java can not be compared to C/C++ because java is annoyingly restrictive, always trying to be like "Hey dude, hope you know what you'r doing. If you f**k with me, I will make sure you never proceed to the next stage ".Other languages that are next to this list are Javascript (Finally, fought its way out of the browser), Python a dynamically easy and ubiquitous language, PHP.
