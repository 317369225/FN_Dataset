What is the difference between SimpleDB and DynamoDB?
As a long time power user of SimpleDB (i.e. a top user), here is my list: 1. SSDs are an option - this solves a problem that SimpleDB had in that it could not provide strict response time bounds. There were many cases when requests would go to spinning media (i.e. disk) instead of memory. The response time would therefore be a mix of memory and disk IO response times, leading to a huge variation in response times for the end user. As you know, memory and disk access times differ by 6 orders of magnitude. 2. Key lookup only - no SQL Select and hence no need to index attributes for secondary index-based lookup. For composite keys, they do offer range scan on the trailing part of the composite key. 3.Â  Automatic Data Partitioning - previously, users of SimpleDB needed to partition their data so that the data could comfortably fit within the 10GB and 1 Billion attribute per domain allotment. Now, DDB, removes the 10GB and 1B attribute limits and automatically partitions the data 4. Provisioned R/W Throughput - This helps multi-tenancy and finally provides something that SimpleDB could not -- SLA guarantees. SImpleDB could not provide SLA guarantees for a few reasons. Disk I/O, complex request types, multi-tenancy were 3 of the main reasons. 5. Lower Cost and Better Cost Model - SimpleDB charged by how long your query took, If it went to disk, the query would be slow, and the cost would be high. As a user of SImpleDB, this was a double penalty. DDB has a much better pay-for-what-you-provision model.
