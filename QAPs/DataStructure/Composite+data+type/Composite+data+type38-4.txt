What are some really interesting machine learning projects for beginners?Preferably written using python. Any other languages is welcomed though :) Please do mention if you are using third party library or any reference regarding the project etc
Dan Klein's Introduction to AI course at Berkeley (CS 188: Artificial Intelligence) has some great introductory ML projects, all in python.  It's now an edX course, but the pre-MOOC course projects are still online.  Some of the course is about AI, not specifically ML, but projects 3, 4, and 5 from the linked year are ML topics.
