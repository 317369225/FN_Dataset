What are the key differences between NASA's MAVEN and ISRO's Mangalyaan Mars Orbiter mission?
Thanks for the A2A Mangalyan is meant to establish the capability of ISRO to undertake design and realization of a Mars orbiter with a capability to perform Earth-bound manoeuvres, cruise phase of 300 days, Mars orbit insertion / capture, and on-orbit phase around Mars. There are some payloads attached to study the martian atmosphere for its Methane content and take photographs of the martian surface. In the other hand MAVEN is a first dedicated satellite to study the upper atmosphere of Mars. Details of the objective can be easily googled. This fundamental difference between the objectives of the two missions makes it impractical to draw up comparison between the two. India is also going to test its deep space network with the mangalyan Mission which will be very useful for it's future missions. In the current mission we are using NASA's deep space network for communication with MOM. If the mission succeeds, India will become the first nation to Reach martian Orbit successfully in the first attempt. :) Updated 26 Sep 2014 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Gaurav Thakur
