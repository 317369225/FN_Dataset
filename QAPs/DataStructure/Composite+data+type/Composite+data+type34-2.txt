What language is better for a B2B-focused digital healthcare product: ASP.NET or Ruby on Rails?
I cannot comment on Ruby because I have no experience of it. I'm sure Ruby fans will fill the breach. What I can tell you is that ASP-NET is certainly very suitable for this application. Visual Studio provides MVC project templates with support for both Web API and Web API2 that import all the core dependencies. You can control serialisation over the wire using configuration: whether data is encoded as JSON or XML is a separate problem from correct logic in your services. ASP is not a language. Out of the box you can use C# or VB in the expectation of full IDE support (elaborate editors with auto-completion, interactive and remote debugging, conditional breakpoints, variable inspection and modification) and you can use any language for which a .NET compiler exists, such as http://ironruby.net/. Marshalling of data from wire encodings to object graphs is completely automated for C# and VB but I don't know whether this support would extend to other languages. It might, since data types and composite structure representations are defined by the .NET framework and are necessarily compatible. Visual Studio Community (a free download) brings with it built-in support for version control with a cloud hosted repository. Both private users and commercial teams up to five developers can use these facilities at no charge. You won't have any trouble finding developers familiar with this tooling.
