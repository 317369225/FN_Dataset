What are pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL?With respect to reliability, speed, scalability, and features. I've heard a lot about how Postgres is superior to MySQL in a number of ways, but I only have a loose understanding of the differences.
Incremental backups. When your database gets to the size where you can't just dump it whole, if you're on MySQL, your confidence is going to be shaken. The open source solutions for incremental backup for MySQL are just now coming to life. They are not terribly well documented, and you're going to be alone in backing up MySQL in this way, whereas... PostgreSQL does incremental backups by default. Which means cheap backups that are easy to move off site using rsync. Updated 26 Nov 2010 â€¢ View Upvotes
