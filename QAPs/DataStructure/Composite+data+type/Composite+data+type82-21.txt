How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
In movies, you see those so called 'programmers' and 'hackers' typing away at 500 words per minute. In real life it is completely the opposite. Let me tell you a funny thing: (Amount of code written in unit time)=1(Quality of Code)   Yup. The more code one writes in a given time, the lesser the quality of work is. Good programmers spend more time thinking what to write instead of jumping to code straight away! More programming happens in showers, coffee rooms, while staring out from window and while you're away from your system than when you are actually in front of your screen. On any particular day it's not how many lines I wrote but what I achieved from those lines of code that matters. For example, yesterday, I was trying to optimize a certain piece of code and at the same time I had three new business requirements to program. After the entire day of thinking, guess how many lines of code I changed - Just one. I added just one word to the code and it miraculously solved all three of my problems. The entire day went on to figure out what the one word was. (For the curious people - I changed a JOIN to a LEFT JOIN, that's it!)
