Are there any useful recursive functions that do not contain a base case?This is a follow-up question to What does "base case" mean in the context of recursion?.
If you define "base case" as "the instance that doesn't recurse", then only functions intended to execute forever could omit a base case. If you define "base case" as a hardcoded special case that doesn't recurse, then there are definitely some useful recursive functions that lack them: function walk(node) { console.log(node); for (var i = 0; i < node.children.length; i++) { walk(node.children[i]); } } No special base case here, but recursion will naturally stop when we reach leaf nodes.
