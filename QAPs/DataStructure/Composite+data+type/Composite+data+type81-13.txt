What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
Okay, just realizing how old this question and some of the answers are... I'll state a few disadvantages. # The event loop.  While the event loop is one of its' largest advantages, not understanding how this works is one of its' biggest disadvantages as well.  Do *NOT* do long running, synchronous, cpu bound logic in Node.js.  Spin it off to a worker queue, another thread/process (use a pool), or any number of other ways to remove the heavy lifting from your main event loop. # Not understanding functional programming techniques.  Many people come into node.js and JavaScript in general and try to bring an OOP mindset with them.  You *can* use OOP style hierarchy with JS, but it's not considered a best practice.  Highly decoupled, well tested modules with plain objects, and functional style tends to work better for larger projects. # npm - another best/worst advantage situation.  Get your own caching npm setup for internal use, especially if you are setting up a CI/CD process.  This is critical.  Some say to check in your dependencies (node_modules) into source control, I disagree... especially if your deployment and development platforms don't match and you have native modules.  Checking in binary dependencies doesn't give you much when you are developing on windows or mac, and deploying to linux.  Having an npm module/version hickup when you need to deploy a bug fix is painful. I absolutely love the freedom and flexibility that node offers, and sometimes you are re-inventing the wheel.  I feel at this point, the biggest issues come down to technique and experience in the platform.  It's become popular faster than the community can inform those new to the environment.
