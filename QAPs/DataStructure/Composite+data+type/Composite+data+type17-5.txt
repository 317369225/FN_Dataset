Why do some people not like OOP and prefer functional programming?Is it just a matter of taste, or are there some other reasons behind it?
Depending on the "view" upon the problem, one might choose OOP or functional programming (FP). For example, when describing a complex physical system, say a tank of fluid. One might look as if the fluid is composed of a (very large) number of small particles which interact with each other. Then he can define a class of Particles and each particle instance has specific size, weight, and interaction behaviour (methods) with others. But if the fluid tank is very large then too many particle objects are needed! So one might choose functional programming style and look the fluid as a whole with exact rules governing its behaviour: will the fluid stay still, flow, or oscillate under external forces. In the latter case, FP might be preferred over OOP.
