Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
There are two ends of programming: hardware/stepwise end  and abstraction/function end.  All programming languages fall into a gradient between these two categories.    machine code, assembly, C and all the C derivatives come from the hardware end.  Lisp and schemes and their progeny derive from the functional/abstract end.    learn C and you will always find work and will be able to work with all kinds of hardware. Learn Lisp(or scheme) and your writing will be be durable and expressive and agnotic to hardware and you will be able to express ideas with code.    If you want to get started quickly and easily in the lisp category, I recommend Racket.  Follow the tutorials.  If you want to get started with C, try the book "C programming Success in a Day".  If you want to sort of split the baby, learn Python.  Python essential Reference, chapter 1 by David Beazley is the best single chapter of any programming book ever. It will show you how the language works in short number of pages.  Try the examples and vary them on your own to figure out how the language works. Python is available for so many diverse platforms it is a great candidate to get started. But what is most important isn't the language per se, it's just to start programming.  Get started learning a language that works for you.  At the end of the day, the two approaches to understand programming are simple: the iterative approach of instructions and commands and the abstraction approach of functions.  Almost all languages make use of these two approaches to varying degrees, so what you learn in one language will transfer to learning another language in that same model.
