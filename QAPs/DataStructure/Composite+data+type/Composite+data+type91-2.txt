What are the frequently asked basic and complex queries ( SQL) during a tech interview?
I hate interview questions.  All of them are almost certainly wrong or useless in trying to figure out if you should hire someone.  I interview and give interviews all the time and I do not believe there is a guaranteed set of questions that help the interviewer understand the interviewee. I know a few great developers who will never interview well.  I know many more developers who have passed very tough tech interviews and should never be allowed to check code into source control.  With the above rant out of the way, my particular flavor of wrong questions for SQL currently look something like: Not Platform Specific Questions Give examples of when you last used analytic functions and why Give examples of when you last used recursive queries and why How do you use SQL to check for data quality? How do you know that your SQL performs well? How do you measure your SQL performance? When your SQL does not perform well what do you think about and what do you do to improve performance? How do you feel about joins in your SQL How often do you use sub queries When do you think your SQL has too many lines of code? What kinds of data models have you written SQL against How much does your SQL change across different data models There are no correct answers to the above questions  There are a few wrong answers.  The goal of these questions are to get the person talking in a way that I can try and "smell" if they will be a good fit or not. Note: I have platform specific SQL questions that I am leaving out.
