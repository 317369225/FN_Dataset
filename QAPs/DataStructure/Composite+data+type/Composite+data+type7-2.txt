Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
I am a Java fanboy all the way. But my vote will go to C++ and Python. C++: It's available on almost all Unix machines. It gives you a lot of control that Java wouldn't give you (although, you don't always really need that level of control. Python: Python is good for quick and dirty programs. But the performance isn't good if its a computationally demanding task. I use Python as a scripting language in Linux to do batch processing. For example, I would write a program in C++, and then use Python to run that C++ program over and over with different parameters. Python is usually available on all Unix systems. The the availability on Unix is important comes from the fact that sometimes we log-on to different machines and run our code on those machines. I personally run C++ programs on a high-performance cluster to which I don't have administrative privileges.
