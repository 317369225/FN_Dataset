What are the compositional differences between the mitochondrial membrane and the cell membrane?
Sai's answer is already very good for the level of detail I think you were going for. Besides differences in lipid type and abundance, however, I think one could say the transport machinery of the mitochondrial translocase of the outer and inner membranes (TOM and TIM complexes, respectively) are the most strikingly different membrane proteins. An incredible majority of the proteins found in the mitochondria are actually encoded in the nucleus. As such, some system of correctly recognizing these proteins and facilitating their passage into the mitochondrion is necessary. The membrane of the eukaryotic cell, itself, is a little more partial to what it allows in. So, without going into great detail of each aspect of the two membranes, the mitochondrial membrane has evolved to allow many things to travel back and forth across its membrane(s) (particularly in the case of respiration and delivery of ATP to the cell), while the cell's membrane has evolved to maintain a tighter wall (more commonly transporting ions, rather than large molecules like proteins) to separate itself from much of the exterior milieu.
