What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
I like Javascript and node.js, but there's one disadvantage: its asynchronous programming model. People told me: "asynchronous programming is the way to the future, it's the right way to achieve semi-concurrency". And to be honest, I believed them. I got used to using callbacks, three-level deep anonymous function callbacks. I got used to it. I was happy. Until I used Python for a server-side project and remembered how much simpler the synchronous programming style is. How cleaner your code looks. I suppose I had the Stockhold syndrome for a while there. But seriously, while asynchronous programming may be a good solution to the concurrency problem, it comes at a cost: a life filled with callbacks. Updated 28 Jul 2012 â€¢ View Upvotes
