Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Regardless of what you want to accomplish, in general, it comes down to acquiring knowledge(theory), practicing, and refining your skills. So, if you want to learn how to build, say, 3D games, you need to learn the basics, at least, practice what you have learned, and continue refining your skills (practice works miracles). Also, this is 2k15, you have access to so much information, from blog posts, to articles, to source code, to tools and assets, to everything. Just make sure you take it easy - don't dive in straight to hard-core concepts, start with the basics. As for C++, you may want to rethink your decision. You don't need or have to use any features or semantics of C++ that you don't need - you can write CÂ  and only use whichever C++ features you need.
