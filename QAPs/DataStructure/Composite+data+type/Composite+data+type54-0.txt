Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
As Glyn Williams points out, any decent game architecture is going to rely heavily on object concepts and is going to have a lot of "moving parts". This can all be coded in C, but it gets crufty, error prone, verbose, and hard to maintain pretty quickly. You really want to have good abstractions if you want to get anything done that is innovative and scales you as a programmer. Objects and classes turn out to be a pretty great abstraction. That said, think of C++ this way: You don't have to absorb the endless sprawling class libraries, and you don't need to use all the bulky features like templates or even virtual functions. But if you're going to do basic "OO" in C, you might as well use a decent syntax, and the class feature of C++ does that nicely.... so just limit yourself to that. What you will find is that you will add abstraction after abstraction in order to make yourself efficient, and then you will find that hundreds of programmers before you came across these same issues and created language features for them. They you will realize you are re-inventing the wheel and so you might as well use a wheel that is already debugged by someone else. Objective C is a simpler OO extension to C than is C++, so that is always an option.
