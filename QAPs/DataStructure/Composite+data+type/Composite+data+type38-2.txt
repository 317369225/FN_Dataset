What are some really interesting machine learning projects for beginners?Preferably written using python. Any other languages is welcomed though :) Please do mention if you are using third party library or any reference regarding the project etc
I am working on an ML project, in which I predict the performance of the Indian Cricket Team at the World Cup 2015. For this, I have been crawling data from some top cricket sites like cricbuzz, cricinfo, etc. Then, the data is analyzed and the type of batsman, bowler, pitch, position of batting/bowling, venue, opposition, etc are taken as predictors. In this analysis, the best team composition against a particular opposition, venue, the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition team is also determined, by selecting the best pool of players. Ex: Rohit and Dhawan would be the best opening pair on sub-continent like pitches,but would they be as effective if the opposition is Sri Lanka? I've written the scraper in Python, and planning toÂ  use multi-layered neural networks (or deep learning) for the problem. I would really love to have collaborators in this project.
