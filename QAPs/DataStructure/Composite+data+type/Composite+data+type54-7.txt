Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Reall Good Game Programming == Really Huge x Very Complicated. Perhaps you should reconsider either your reasons to defer learning C++ or your lofty goals? Seriously, if porn is the industry that brings most new technologies to the mass market, computer games are the industry which push the latest computer tech to its performance and capacity limits first. If you can't create incredibly strong abstractions while simultaneously optimizing every last cycle and bus bandwidth schedule slot, then you won't be able to keep up in the major games industry. You must use a language that supports these constructs automatically and C is not designed for this purpose. Turns out that this is exactly what C++ is designed to do. If you decide to set your sights lower (different) and make simpler (but still very playable abd marketable games) then C is still not your answer but something like Python or Haskell are probably more ideal. Whatever you do, start with a good story/game mechanics and build/test the high level abstractions first. Then optimize later. Plan on writing it at least twice before it's "done". Good luck.
