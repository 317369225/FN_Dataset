How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
Depends on how fast they can type, the language they're using, and whether they've got autocomplete turned on. But really, it's like asking how fast a racing car driver can apply a coat of wax to his car, it's a meaningless figure. Sometimes good programming will end up being long and verbose, not all problems can be packed down into one little function or class. Sometimes good programming will be a short little program which most people never would have thought of. If I show my latest project to a very good programmer I know, he's never once asked 'how many lines?', if I showed it to non programmer, they might ask 'how long did it take you?', they probably wouldn't ask 'how many lines' because it's not a concept they're familiar with, but you get the idea. Neither long, nor short programs are necessarily good ones, the good ones are the good ones.
