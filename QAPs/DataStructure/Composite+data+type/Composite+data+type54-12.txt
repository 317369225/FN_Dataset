Can I make a professional game in the C language?I'm a novice C programmer. As part of my future goals, I want to develop really good games. I declined to learn C++ for many reasons, including it being really huge, and very complicated. So can anyone please tell me, how to develop intensive games in C?
Much easier to learn a better language for the task. Â  In practice, almost all games are graphics intensive, and most graphics libraries are implemented in class libraries. So writing in C won't save you having to understand Object Oriented programming. Just learn a C derived language (Java and C# are much easier than C++) and make the OO graphics calls within an OO language. Much quicker than trying to do anything decent in C alone.
