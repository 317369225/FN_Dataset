How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
I was in a hackathon a couple weeks ago, and worked for 24 hours. So I figured, hey, let me see how much code I wrote. It came out to around 320 lines. And about 100 of those were commented out. So a bit over 200 actual lines of code. I went through the other main coders' pieces and it was all about 200 lines, maybe a bit more. So I'd say that's about 10 an hour. Most of my time was spent setting up a database and debugging queries and connections, and deleting failed attempts to solve problems. Updated 22 Oct â€¢ View Upvotes
