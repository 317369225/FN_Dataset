How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
This week I'll probably be doing this: Monday: Commute for one hour in each direction. Super productive - I'll probably write 20-50 lines of code in each direction. Then: Planning, analysis, helping to deploy our app into an environment to find a problem that we noticed with the deployment in Friday that only exhibits in the UAT environment.Â  Tuesday: Work at home. Super-productive. Write some code for half the day. Field questions from other developers on the team for the other half. Probably a couple of hundred lines of code. Wednesday. Commute again. 20-50 lines in each direction. No code the rest of the day, it seems. Just deal with a stream of questions from BAs, PMs & developers. What did I do to deserve this? Thursday: work at home: half / half again Friday: commute again. 20-50 lines in each direction. More people seem to work at home on Fridays. So I'll probably get another couple of hundred lines of code out. So that's about 450 - 650 lines of code in 5 days. 90 - 130 / day. 10 - 15 / hour. That's all useless information though. So what? The most interesting fact is that as a developer: My most productive time is on the train. Completely uninterrupted & focussed for an intense burst. Most of my time at work is not spent writing code but collaborating with a variety of stakeholders.
