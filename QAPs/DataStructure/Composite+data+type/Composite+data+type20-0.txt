What are the key ideas behind the relational model?
1. tuples -- the basic unit of stored information is a set of related values. In database theory, this is called a "tuple." In practice, tuples correspond to a row in a database. Tuples also appear in the "SELECT" part of the SQL statement. 2. joins -- two tables (or lists of identically structured tuples) can be "joined," which means that the cross product is taken of the two lists. Each row of list 1 becomes paired with every row from list 2 to create N*M total rows. This is probably the single-most strange and counter-intuitive concept in relational databases, yet it is the single most central idea to using them. This is the "FROM" part of the SQL statement. 3. filters -- if you filter out all combinations from #2 except for rows where a "foreign key" like blogpost.author_id matches a primary key like user.id, then you can automatically cross-reference data between two tables in a meaningful way. This is the "WHERE" part of the SQL statement. You might think that the "relational" in "relational database" refers to the idea that tables can be linked across entity relationships using joins, however actually this word refers to the contents of a single table table. All rows in the "employee" table are related to each other in that they are all "employees" represented by the same data structure (name, employee ID, manager ID, etc.). In practice, relational database servers shortcut away the above awkward abstractions and just do key-value lookup when needed. But the abstraction exists in the SQL language as a sort of mathematical purity. Updated 9 Mar 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
