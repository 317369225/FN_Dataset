What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?

Well, it was a good idea! Ouch, I didn't know about this. I know so few things. Hum, testing? Now I beat this, let's do other stuff. Security? Oh, forgot about that one. Let reuse solutions. Well, programming is composition. Ok, I can craft this. What if I used X instead? What a blatant mistake! Looks like someone did it already. Oh, I saw this concept elsewhere! Every programmer start disarmed, think that they are better than others then see how much they don't know. They often cycle between these 3 states. Updated 11 Nov â€¢ View Upvotes
