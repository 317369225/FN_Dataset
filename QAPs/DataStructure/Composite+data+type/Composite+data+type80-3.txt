How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
Learning to recognize a character and understanding how it is used in combination with other characters are two different things.  It's possible to get or make flashcards for 10,000 characters and brute force memorize all of them, but would that be the same as knowing them? To really understand a character, you need to know how it interacts with other characters to form words.  Just knowing them in isolation is not enough.  There's another level where you can start to get a sense of the history of the character, what it has meant over time, but that's not typical of native Chinese, so that's not really necessary. How many characters you memorize will depend on how much time you put into and individual intelligence.  I feel that a realistic pace focused on learning more characters and using them to read would be about 500 characters for every 3-4 months.  Eventually, though, you'd reach the point where you have learned all of the commonly used characters and get into far less commonly seen ones as you get above 3500 characters (the number a typical Chinese university graduate would probably recognize).
