Why is Cassandra called 'structured' key-value store? http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/I intend to know whether Cassandra can handle unstructured data, and if yes then why is it called 'structured'.
In fact, it's semi structured. It can do relation tables staff, indexed by primary key, column is typed, e.g. int/varchar/timestamp. It also support add and remove columns online for each row insert and update, kind of to handle unstructured data. For CQL 3.0, dynamically add/remove column with composite primary key is not allowed. Hope these help. -Z
