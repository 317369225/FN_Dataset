How much Java do I need to know to land a junior level Java job?I assume the answer translates over to the other languages as well.
I would agree with Jayesh and Djorde, you have to be fairly competant with Java and Java technologies. Just programming in Java, everything Jayesh mentioned and etc., polymorphism, the java libraries, e.g. Java.utils and javax.swing etc., concurrency, encapsulation, and design patterns. But then also it would probably be expected that you knew or be familiar with the Java technologies associated with Java enterprise, like frameworks, databases, web servers, application servlets, drivers and middleware integration. For example, the Oracle databases, Apache tomcat, possibly Glassfish, Eclipse Java2E, Netbeans, the springframe, JBoss, JavaFX and the list goes on. I hope this helps
