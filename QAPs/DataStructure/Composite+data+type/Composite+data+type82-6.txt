How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
Negative fifty. I mean it literally. A good programmer will use the one hour to produce value for the team he's working with (e.g., by fixing a bug, extending a feature, or improving the quality of the existing code) while reducing the total amount of code in the project, via a combination of refactoring, dead code elimination, reuse, use of better, higher-level abstractions or idioms, and standard libraries. Code should be thought of as a liability: it costs enormous resources to maintain, debug, learn, understand, document and support. Code is a burden. All rest being equal (features, quality, maintainability, etc...) the less code you have, the better off you are. Famous quote: measuring code productivity in lines of code is like measuring an airplane design by weight. Asking how many lines of code does a good programmer write per day is akin to asking how many pounds of weight does a good fighter jet designer adds to the airframe per day. If you adopt that as a measure of quality, your plane won't even be able to take off.
