What should everyone know about making good charts and graphs to represent data?I've seen so many charts and graphs that are misleading.
There are other good answers here about data accuracy. I'm going to take a step back and discuss the greater process of designing successful visualizations. Know your purpose. It's often not just "show this data," but rather "show this data so we can take a specific action." Understanding what people want to learn from the data is hugely important. Also consider things like how the data will be consumed (print, interactive, mobile, etc.) and the various needs of your specific audience (technician, administrator, etc.) Purpose gives you focus, and informs all subsequent decisions. Only include relevant content. We've all been told "show your work" forever, but when your customer is looking for an answer, they don't want your whole database. Give them exactly what they want up front, allow deeper research when they ask for it. Pick a useful structure. There are often several valid ways of slicing and graphing a given data set. Consider which data and relationships are the most relevant / important and select a layout that emphasizes them. Less relevant data can be layered on later. Use formatting to clarify and highlight. Once you've got your data plotted in a good structure, you can add color, labels, etc. Keep in mind their task is to support understanding; don't let the formatting details overwhelm or distract from the main purpose. And of course, iterate, try different things, ask for advice and responses, etc. For a more in depth explanation, here's me giving a talk on these four points, and a PDF of a similar slide deck.
