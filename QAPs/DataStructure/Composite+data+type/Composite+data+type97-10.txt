What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
From my experience (development languages come naturally to me) here are the stages of growth. Debugging.  The ability to identify commands and data, change values and adapt code to suit your application. Enhancement.  The ability to create a new module (sub/function/routine) using existing code as a reference. Solo.  Being able to build apps from scratch.  At this level your code is most likely not compliant to whichever standard that your language has. Experienced.  Your code is generally up to standards (all developers have their favored code snippets that are not the recognized standard code type for their language).  You use all the relevant features (classes, structures, error trapping). Expert.  You have your own library of snippets of code, or compiled DLLs that contain your most common procedures and shortcuts.  You post answers on forums like this and introduce your children (yes, developers can "make it" with the ladies and produce offspring) to the wonderful world of software development.
