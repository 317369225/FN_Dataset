Originally Answered: How can I improve my mock scores and get above the 99th percentile on the main CAT?So far you have done very good with your academics. A perfect profile for IIM-B and SP Jain so far. Now, coming to your mock CATs. Yes, the answers always seem easy. Do you find cooked food easy to eat or uncooked? Whenever you revise, see the solution and then hide the solution. Now try to solve the question yourself. If you can solve it then its fine, yopu are on the right track. If not then you need to build the concepts realted to that area. Make a table of wrong questions and categorize them into 'I don't know the formula', 'I don't know the concept', 'I did calculation mistake' and 'I am completely unaware of the topic'. A single question can be under multiple categories. Now, see where most of the questions fall. This will indicate where you are going wrong. Don't do it casually. Take it seriously. It will gradually help you improve your scores. Hope it helps.!!!
