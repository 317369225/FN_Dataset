Why is there so much hype about functional programming?I believe every OO programmer has definetly started coding using a functional programming language. For example you start with C and then move to C++ or Java... Why is there so much hype about functional programming nowadays. I mean if everyone has used one at some point and then decided that OO is the way to go?
Compared to traditional imperative programming styles which require you to type many redundant things to do simple stuff, FP enables you to type only things that you really need to type Example, before Java 8 to retrieve sub list: List ourSubList ... For looping ourList   Inside check for criteria     Populate ourSubList After Java 8 List ourSubList = ourList.stream().filter(...).collect(...); Basically the trend of programming language nowadays is to become less and less verbose and FP is helping us to achieve that goal
