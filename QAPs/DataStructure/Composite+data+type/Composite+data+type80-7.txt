How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
I am like Jonathan. I have studied for over six years but chinese is my third language and i don't get to use it in Mexico as much as i would like. Just an hour ago i did a free test online which says that i know about 2600-3000 characters. It sounds very poor, in my opinion, taking in consideration that out of those six years 2 were courses that i took in school. Also considering that i worked for a chinese company in which my coworkers communicated mainly in chinese and used english only when i needed further explanations. There is an article online which says that you must know at least 8k characters to read a newspaper. Like some of you said, it isn't so much the characters because they don't always appear alone. It is the number of known characters combined with others that makes it difficult. Besides that, we must remember that Chinese also has the so famous ”成语“ which are not only difficult to remember but difficult to decipher. Just my opinion !
