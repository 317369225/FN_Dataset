How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
A good programmer will jump right into the code, write a hundred lines, debug and tweak until the problem is solved.  A GREAT programmer will stare at the screen, scribble on a notepad, talk to himself, and then write 10 to 20 lines that probably doesn't need to be debugged.  If programming were a job of writing code, then lines per hour, or keystrokes per day would be a good way to measure productivity.  Programming is a job of thinking, planning and problem solving.  Once the main job is done, the code is just the last step. Remember in high school math classes when the teacher wanted you to show your work?  The intermediate steps before the answer is the real work and the answer is the result.  Programming is the same in that the mental steps are the work and the code is the final answer.
