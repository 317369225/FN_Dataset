How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
It is not the quantity of the code that matters but the quality. A good programmer might write more or less code but it will probably be the correct/efficient way to do it(which is what I think matters). They use their previous knowledge to  solve current tasks at hand. The spend more time thinking about the problem, trying to find the best possible ways to implement stuff, rather than simply start coding right away. Using the correct tool to solve difficult problems(and this comes with experience), they never reinvent the wheel.
