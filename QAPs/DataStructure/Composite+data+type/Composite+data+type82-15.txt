How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
No one really knows. Such measures are close to meaningless - for example I had a coding sprees in which I "wrote" at >1K LOC/hour (Ada binding to C library with tons of defines, basically copy-paste all defines from c and declare them as constants [with correct type]). But such situations are rare. When I go at 100 LOC/hour is when I'm really productive [and most of it is due to Ada catching most of bugs at compile-time combined with Ada being a bit more verbose]. If you ask me - 50 LOC/hour is very good in normal situation. It gets trickier in safety-critical applications - then 10 LOC/hour is a lot. But my count includes deleted lines (if it was mostly that) and comments - this is due to the fact that just adding lines of code is not actually a good thing. Code has to be first and foremost correct, easily understood and easily maintainable (after that comes speed and memory efficiency). And shorter code is usually all of the above.
