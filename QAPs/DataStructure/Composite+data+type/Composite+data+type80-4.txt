How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.Â  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
I would say that if you learn properly with the help of a professional, and take it very seriously, you can learn anywhere from 2-3,000 words in about two years if you work hard. That would be you only need a learn around 20 new words a week, which is just a few day. Studying flash cards, working with a teacher, and studying everyday will make you get there. If you push hard enough, you can be pretty fluent in two years, in which I mean you should be able to handle basic conversations and even get into depth in certain subjects of you interest.
