What is a good or proven technology stack to build a web based startup today?
While not a startup, our team at Mozilla is able to quickly launch projects using Linux + Apache WSGI + Django in fairly short order.  We primarily use MySQL for our data storage, Sphinx Search for Search Engine and REDIS for caching. We also use Celery powered by RabbitMQ for queuing offline tasks.  This is something you can grow into later, but it's super easy to implement. Where we differ from startups is that we use Zeus for load-balancing.  If I was bootstrapping, I'd use nginx instead as a reverse-proxy/load balancer.  These types of things are interchangeable. One thing that's helped is automated testing and continuous integration - for that we use Hudson.  At the pace you need to move as a startup, it's worthwhile spending some time getting those things in place.
