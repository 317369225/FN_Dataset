How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?Please provide your complete/exhaustive preparation details, if possible.
I could score 99.65 percentile in CAT 2014 and secured a seat at IIM C. There are different sections of the CAT exam : CAT English/Verbal Ability CAT Maths/Quant Ability CAT Data Interpretation CAT Logical ReasoningLearning English is a continuous process. Just keep an eye for new words. Go through basic grammar. Start reading newspapers with decent language e.g. The Hindu. Most important point for learning quant is knowing formulae and solving different problems. Infact after a point you will find it interesting to solve new problems. DI requires basics clear & fast approximate calculations which can be learned through practice. LR checks your analytical skills. If you could crack this section instantly, you can score here ,but if you can't then probably it will waste your valuable exam time. Finally all this requires practice which you can carry on through MOCKCATs. There are plenty of  sources available with such MOCKCATs. But the most important aspect of studying for CAT is not just giving exams but also analysing, where we have gone wrong and how it can be avoided. It won't make sense to give MOCKCATs everyday  & then forget after looking at your scores. At each MOCK you have to improve by analysing better ways to solve the exam. But don't get completely upset if you are not scoring well in MOCKs. (Neither I scored well in any of the MOCKs :D) MOCKs are not everything. Just keep studying with a positive attitude.  I would like to help others with quant  or verbal questions. You can post in the forum at Welcome to MBAzoombies
