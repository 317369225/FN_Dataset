What was the greatest challenge you faced as a software engineer?
Always feeling I wasn't as good as the next guy when I always was as good or better. Even though I have been a decent coder and done well in my career, I never felt like I was ever really that good at it. I believe that many engineers experience this and those that do hold themselves to high standards. These standards will help you be visible to your company, your peers and keep you doing a job well done.
