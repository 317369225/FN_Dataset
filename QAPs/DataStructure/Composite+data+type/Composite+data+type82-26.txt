How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
Probably the most productive and valuable year of my career was when myself and 2 teammates took an ~350,000 LOC enterprise application, and got it down to about 80,000 LOC while closing out over 1000 logged bugs and increasing performance up to 20,000% in a few critical areas. This comes out to somewhere around -45 net lines of code per hour per developer. This is a bit of an extreme case, but being able to take a holistic approach to problem solving and reducing complexity is, in my opinion, a much better marker of a good programmer than producing lines of code. Any halfway decent programmer could churn out 100 or more lines of production code per hour on a greenfield project, but it takes a good programmer with experience to rein in the temptation and be more circumspect about what they check in, usually applying an arsenal of patterns and practices that they have accumulated over the years in the knowledge that most problems have already been solved quite effectively.
