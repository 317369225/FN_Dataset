What is a good or proven technology stack to build a web based startup today?
Stick to what you know best.  It's not about what kind of technology you're using, but about the execution of your product.  Think in terms of discrete components and use the best technology for the solution.  We use PHP as a thin web layer that serves API requests with various services running in the back to serve various features.  For example, Solr (java) for search, ejabberd (erlang) for XMPP, various python daemons, etc.  MySQL for a majority of our DB and MongoDB for non-critical tasks such as logging, analytics, etc.  As for other parts of the system, we use Lighttpd for web servers, but may be moving to NGINX due to memory issues with Lighttpd. Other parts include Memcached, Node.js, etc.  Point is, use whatever is best/fastest to develop for your purpose.  You can always optimize it down the road.
