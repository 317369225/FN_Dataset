What are some functional programming design patterns?
Better to search online or read a book about them. Do note the FP design patterns are very different from Gang-of-four / OOP patterns. While OOP patterns generally look at common data marshalling and object creation techniques, fp patterns focus on common function composition and type creation methodologies. OOP design patterns are basically not needed due to powerful FP features. Read this Stackoverflow answer for more info As for FP patterns, off top of my head, we have: Persistent Data structures Lazy Streams Functors Applicatives Monoid Monads MonadTransformers Arrows Foldables Iteratees ZippersJust start learning Haskell and you will encounter most of the above one way or another (Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! )
