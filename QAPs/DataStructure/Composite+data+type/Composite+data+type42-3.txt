What should everyone know about making good charts and graphs to represent data?I've seen so many charts and graphs that are misleading.
A good visualization is purposeful, truthful, and clear. Every good visualization starts with a purpose (whether it be to compare different entities, elicit patterns, etc.). The type of visualization to be made should be aligned with that purpose. For example, bar charts are good for comparisons, while scatterplots are good for finding patterns in 2-dimensional data. Here are a variety of types of visualizations: Visualization Options Additionally, the visualization must be truthful, which harks to principles related to graphical integrity such as Bertin’s Principles. For example, bars on bar charts should begin at 0 to truthfully portray scales. The following chart violates this principle. Visuals with different sizes should also be avoided in bars, as violated by this: Also, as Will mentioned, 3D forms of 2D visualizations should be avoided. Finally, the visualization must be clear, which relates to design principles. Gestalt Principles, for example, can help organize visual elements in a meaningful manner: The Gestalt Principles It’s also important to pick colors wisely so that color-blind people can interpret the visualization - picking colors with different intensities help with this.
