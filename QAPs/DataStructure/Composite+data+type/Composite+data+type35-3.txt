What are the key differences between NASA's MAVEN and ISRO's Mangalyaan Mars Orbiter mission?
All details about them are correct given by Robert Frost. Just adding up a bit. MAVEN - Rs 29 billion MOM - Rs 4.54 Billion And ISRO doesn't have to information from project Curiosity, Its i guess second satellite launched by ISRO to collect information of spacial body other than Earth. And moreover launched by PSLV rocket. MAVEN upon reaching the designated Mars orbit will have only one chance to enter the the orbit, and if it does not do so, that will be the end. But MOM have an additional opportunity. For more unbiased comparison check out below link- MOM (The Indian Mars Mission) Â As I believe as an Indian I am biased towards MOM.
