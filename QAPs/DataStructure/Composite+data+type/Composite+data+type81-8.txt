What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
One of the issues with JavaScript programming in Node.js is its event-driven (callback) approach as solution to implied scalability. Developer has to think in terms of asynchronous execution model that is more complex then linear blocking I/O programming. I'm "twisted" on Python thus can provide of example that work better for average developer. Eventlet (http://eventlet.net/) library provides nonblocking I/O in Coroutines that implies threading-like Blocking development paradigm without threading-related problems (i.e. asynchronous). If Eventlet-like library exist for Javascript and Node.js would work in Coroutines style, it will be adopted by average developers sooner IMHO.
