Haskell (programming language): What are some practical uses of Kleisli composition (>=>)?I understand from the types how it works, sorta, but I'm having trouble using it in practiceâ€”I always seem to fall back on bind (>>=). I think seeing some examples of it used in practice would be helpful.
A practical use of Kleisli composition is the XPath language. It works more along the lines of Zach's answer. It is basically the list monad. Querying an XML document--a tree--is systematic composition of a->[b] functions. Only difference is that XPath is not typed. For typed XPath in C++ see LEESA.
