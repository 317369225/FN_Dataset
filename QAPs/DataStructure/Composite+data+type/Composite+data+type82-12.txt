How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
Depends on the hour. Seriously - it's a close to meaningless question: Are you asking about an average rate, or a maximum rate? Are you coding from scratch, or are you modifying existing code? How much design have you done before you start writing code? What language are you writing in? Etc.
