What is a primary key? A. Primary key : Each row of the data in a table uniquely identified by a Primary Key The column  (columns) that has completely unique data throughout the table is known as the primary key field.     primary key, also called a primary keyword, is a key in a relational database that is unique for each record. It is a unique identifier, such as a driver license number, telephone number (including area code), or vehicle identification number (VIN). A relational database must always have one and only one primary key. Primary keys typically appear as columns in relational database tables.     Primary Key   n  A primary key is a property given to a table column that distinguishes that record apart from each n  There are 3 Types of Primary Key   Simple Primary Key   Composite Primary Key   Surrogate Primary Key n  Simple Primary Key   It uses only one field to identify a record. n  Composite Primary Key   Multiple fields joined together to identify a record in a table. n  Surrogate Key   Unique running sequence number is generated to identify a record.     Q. What is the main role of a primary key in a table?   A. The main role of a primary key in a data table is to maintain the internal integrity of a data table.   Q. What are foreign keys?   A.Foreign key, also called a foreign keyword, in a database table is a key from another table that refers to (or targets) a specific key, usually the primary key, in the table being used. A primary key can be targeted by multiple foreign keys from other tables. But a primary key does not necessarily have to be the target of any foreign keys.   A. Foreign Key : You can logically relate data from multiple tables using Foreign Keys   Q. Can a table have more than one foreign key defined?   A. A table can have any number of foreign keys defined. It can have only one primary key defined.   Q. What is difference between UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints?   A table can have only one PRIMARY KEY whereas there can be any number of   UNIQUE keys. The columns that compose PK are automatically define NOT NULL, whereas a column that compose a UNIQUE KEY can have null values.   Q. Can a primary key contain more than one columns?   Yes. Primary key created on more than one column is called composite primary key.   Constraints The Oracle Server uses constraintsto prevent invalid data entry into tables. You can use constraints to do the following: • Enforce rules on the data in a table whenever a row is inserted, updated, or deleted from that table. The constraint must be satisfied for the operation to succeed. • Prevent the deletion of a table if there are dependencies from other tables • Provide rules for Oracle tools, such as Oracle Developer   CONSTRAINTS    PRIMARY CONSTRAINTS      : PRIMARY,UNIQUE,CHECK,REFERENCES) SECONDARY CONSTRAINTS    : NOT NULL,DEFAULT)   CONSTRAINTS BASED ON  2 LEVELS COLUMN LEVEL and  TABLE LEVEL   Eg. For SECONDARY CONSTRAINTS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   1. NOT NULL CONSTRAINT            CREATE TABLE EMP9( ENO NUMBER(3)  NOT NULL,            ENAME VARCHAR2(10));        2. DEFAULT CONSTRAINT         CREATE TABLE EMP9(ENO NUMBER(3)  NOT NULL,         ENAME VARCHAR2(10),DOJ DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE);      3. PRIMARY CONSTRAINT(COLUMN LEVEL)             UNIQUE         CREATE TABLE EMP9( ENO NUMBER(3)  NOT NULL CONSTRAINT UNIEMP         UNIQUE,ENAME VARCHAR2(10));         PRIMARY KEY     CREATE TABLE EMP9( ENO NUMBER(3)   CONSTRAINT PKEMP9 PRIMARY                              KEY,ENAME VARCHAR2(10));      4. CHECK CONSTRAINT         CREATE TABLE BANK( ACNO NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT PKBANK PRIMARY                                              KEY,ACTYPE VARCHAR2(2) CONSTRAINT CKBANK CHECK (ACTYPE IN         ('SB','CA','RD')),ACNAME VARCHAR2(10),AMOUNT NUMBER(4));        5. REFERENCES         CREATE TABLE EMP9( ENO NUMBER(3) CONSTRAINT PKE9 PRIMARY       KEY,JOB VARCHAR2(10),ENAME VARCHAR2(10),MGR NUMBER(4) REFERENCES EMP9(ENO));      6. REFERENCES(REFERING TO DIFFERENT TABLE)             CREATE TABLE DEPT9(DEPTNO NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT PKDNO PRIMARY  KEY, DNAME VARCHAR2(10), LOC VARCHAR2(10));           CREATE TABLE EMP9( EMPNO NUMBER(4),ENAME VARCHAR2(10),        SAL NUMBER(7,2),DEPTNO NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT FKDNO REFERENCES DEPT9(DEPTNO));   7. TABLE LEVEL CONSTRAINTS        UNIQUE  TABLE LEVEL   CREATE TABLE BANK( ACNO NUMBER(3),ACTYPE VARCHAR2(10),         BAL NUMBER(7,2),PLACE VARCHAR2(10),CONSTRAINT UNIBANK          UNIQUE(ACNO,ACTYPE));        PRIMARY KEY(TABLE LEVEL)       CREATE TABLE BANK( ACNO NUMBER(2), ACTYPE VARCHAR2(2) CONSTRAINT   CKBANK CHECK (ACTYPE IN ('SB','CA','RD')),AMOUNT NUMBER)     DATA Integrity Constraints   Constraint Description Describe  the  different  type  of  Integrity Constraints supported by ORACLE ? NOT NULL Constraint    - Disallows NULLs in a table's column.UNIQUE   Constraint      - Disallows duplicate values in a column or set of columns.PRIMARY  KEY  Constraint - Disallows duplicate values and NULLs in a column or set of columns.FOREIGN  KEY   Constrain - Require each value in a column or set of columns match a value in a related table's UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY.CHECK  Constraint        - Disallows values that do not satisfy the logical expression of the constraint.   What is difference between UNIQUE constraint and PRIMARY KEY constraint? A  column  defined  as   UNIQUE can contain NULLs while a column defined as PRIMARY KEY can't contain Nulls.   What are the Limitations of a CHECK Constraint ? The  condition  must  be a Boolean expression evaluated using the values in the row being inserted or updated and can't contain subqueries, sequence, the SYSDATE,UID,USER  or  USERENV  SQL functions, or the pseudo columns LEVEL or ROWNUM.  What is the maximum number of CHECK constraints that can be defined on a column ? No Limit.   Q What is an Index ? An Index  is  an optional structure associated with a table to have direct access  to  rows, which  can  be created to increase the performance of data retrieval.  Index can be created on one or more columns of a table.   Indexes are  automatically maintained and used by ORACLE. Changes to table data are automatically incorporated into all relevant indexes.   Indexes   n  Index will improve the throughput of the SQL Query. n  The Index should be created based on the frequently used columns in the WHERE clause.   CREATE INDEX emp_idx ON emp(emp_name);   SELECT ename,dept_id,sal,mgr FROM   EMP WHERE  ename like ‘Sun%’;     Q What is the  Subquery ? A Subquery is a query whose return values are used in filtering conditions of the main  query.   Q. What is correlated sub-query ? A  Correlated sub_query is a sub_query which has reference to the main query.   Q. What is an Integrity  Constraint ? A   Integrity  constraint  is  a  rule  that  restricts values to a column in a table.   Q. What is Referential Integrity ? A   Maintaining  data integrity through a set of rules that restrict the values of  one or more columns of the tables based on the values of primary key or unique key of the referenced table.         Q. what is Case Function Case facilitates conditional inquires by doing the work of  an if-then-else statement     CASE TATEMENT   In SQL caseworks with either the select or update clauses. It provides when-then-else functionality (WHEN this_happens THEN do_this) also known as nested IF-THEN-ELSE - IF  conditional statements   SELECT ename, CASE  WHEN sal > 0 AND SAL <= 100000 THEN 1 WHEN sal > 100000 AND SAL < 250000 THEN 2   WHEN sal > 250000 AND SAL < 5000000 THEN 3 ELSE 99 END AS emp_category FROM EMP   Q. Decode function   Decode : facilitates conditional inquires by doing the work of  a case or if then else statement   SELECT supplier_name, decode(supplier_id, 10000, 'IBM',  10001, 'Microsoft',  10002, 'Hewlett Packard',   'Gateway') result FROM suppliers;   Q. How you will avoid duplicating records in a query? A  By using DISTINCT   Q. What is difference between Rename and Alias?  Rename is a permanent name given to a table or column whereas Alias is a temporary name given to a table or column which do not exist once the SQL statement is executed.   Q. What is a view ? A view is a virtual table based on one or more tables.   Why Use views ?   To restrict data access • To make complex queries easy • To provide data independence • To present different views of the same data   Q. What are the advantages of Views ? • Views restrict access to the data because the view can display selective columns from the table. • Views can be used to make simple queries to retrieve the results of complicated queries. For example, views can be used to query information from multiple tables without the user knowing how to write a join statement. • Views provide data independence for ad hoc users and application programs. One view can be used to retrieve data from several tables. • Views provide groups of users access to data according to their particular criteria. Provide  an  additional level of table security, by restricting access to a predetermined set of rows and columns of a table. Hide data complexity. Simplify commands for the user. Present the data in a different perpecetive from that of the base table. Store complex queries.   Q. What are various privileges that a user can grant to another user?  SELECT CONNECT RESOURCES   Q. What is schema? A schema is collection of database objects of a User.   Q. what is Table ? A table is the basic unit of data storage in an ORACLE database. The tables of a database hold all of the user accessible data. Table data is stored in rows and columns.   Q. Do View contain Data? Views do not contain or store data.   Q. Can a View based on another View ? Yes.   Q. What is a Sequence ? A  sequence generates a serial list of unique numbers for numerical columns of a database's tables.   Q.  What is a Synonym ? A synonym is an alias for a table, view, sequence or program unit.   There are two types of Synonyms Private and Public. A Private Synonyms can be accessed only by the owner. A Public synonyms can be accessed by any user on the database.   Synonyms are used to : Mask the real name and owner of an object. Provide public access to an object Provide location transparency for tables,views or program units of a remote database. Simplify the SQL statements for database users.   Q. What is difference between TRUNCATE & DELETE ?   TRUNCATE commits after deleting entire table i.e., can not be rolled back. Database triggers do not fire on TRUNCATE   DELETE  allows the filtered deletion. Deleted records can be rolled back or committed. Database triggers fire on DELETE.   Advantages of COMMIT and ROLLBACK Statements With COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements, you can: • Ensure data consistency • Preview data changes before making changes permanent • Group logically related operations   Q. Difference between SUBSTR and INSTR ?   INSTR (String1,String2(n,(m)), INSTR  returns  the  position  of  the  mth  occurrence  of the string 2 in string1. The search begins from nth position of string1.   SUBSTR (String1 n,m) SUBSTR  returns  a character string of size m in string1, starting from nth postion of string1.   Q. Explain UNION, MINUS, UNION ALL, INTERSECT ?   INTERSECT returns all distinct rows selected by both queries. MINUS - returns all distinct rows selected by the first query but not by the second. UNION - returns all distinct rows selected by either query UNION  ALL  -  returns  all  rows  selected  by  either query, including all duplicates.   Union   n  The unionclause places two separate queries together forming one table. A union works best when using two tables with similar columns because each column must have the same data type   SELECT dno FROM emp UNION SELECT dno FROM dept;   n  UNION ALL selects all rows from each table and combines them into a single table   n  The Difference between UNION and UNION ALL, n  The difference between Union and Union all is that Union all will not eliminate duplicate rows, instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table     Q. What is ROWID ?   ROWID  is  a  pseudo  column  attached  to  each  row  of a table. It is 18 character long, blockno, rownumber are the components of ROWID.   Q. What is the fastest way of accessing a row in a table ? Using ROWID.   Q.  What  is  difference  between  CHAR  and VARCHAR2 ? , What is the maximum SIZE allowed for each type ?   CHAR  pads  blank spaces to the maximum length. VARCHAR2 does not pad blank spaces. For CHAR it is 255 and 2000 for VARCHAR2.   Q.   How  many LONG columns are allowed in a table ? Is it possible to use LONG columns in WHERE clause or ORDER BY ?   A    Only one LONG columns is allowed. It is not possible to use LONG column in WHERE or ORDER BY clause.   Q. What is  Database Link ?   A database link is a named object that describes a "path" from one database to another.      Private Database Link, Public Database Link & Network Database Link.   Private  database  link  is created on behalf of a specific user. A private database  link  can  be  used  only  when the owner of the link specifies a global  object  name in a SQL statement or in the definition of the owner's views or procedures.   Public database link is created for the special user group PUBLIC. A public database  link  can  be  used  when  any  user  in  the associated database specifies a global object name in a SQL  statement or object definition.   Network database link is created and managed by a network domain service. A network  database  link  can  be  used when any user of any database in the network  specifies  a  global  object  name  in  a  SQL statement or object definition.   Q. Which is more faster - IN or EXISTS? EXISTS is more faster than IN because EXISTS returns a Boolean value whereas IN returns a value.   Q. What is a join?    A. Join is a process of retrieve pieces of data from different sets (tables) and returns them to the user or program as one â€œjoinedâ€ collection of data.   Join & Union   n  JOIN   The joinclause combines columns of one table to that of another to create a single table     A join query does not alter either table, but temporarily combines data from each table to be viewed as a single table     3 different types of Join §  Inner §  Left §  Right   Inner join   n  An inner join returns all rows that result in a match such as the example above.      SELECT a.ename,b.dname,e.sal,e.mgr      FROM     emp a,               dept b      WHERE a.dno = b.dno     Types of Joins • Equijoins • Non-equijoins • Outer joins • Self joins • Cross joins • Natural joins • Full or outer joins   Equijoins To determine an employee’s department name, you compare the value in the DEPARTMENT_ID column in the EMPLOYEES table with the DEPARTMENT_ID values in the DEPARTMENTS table. The relationship between the EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS tables is an equijoin—that is, values in the DEPARTMENT_ID column on both tables must be equal. Frequently, this type of join involves primary and foreign key complements. Note: Equijoins are also called simple joins orinner joins.   Non-Equijoins A non-equijoin is a join condition containing something other than an equality operator. The relationship between the EMPLOYEES table and the JOB_GRADES table has an example of a non-equijoin. A relationship between the two tables is that the SALARY column in the EMPLOYEES table must be between the values in the LOWEST_SALARY and HIGHEST_SALARY columns of the JOB_GRADES table. The relationship is obtained using an operator other than equals (=).     SELECT e.last_name, e.salary, j.grade_level FROM employees e, job_grades j WHERE e.salary BETWEEN j.lowest_sal AND j.highest_sal;   Outer join : to also see rows that do not meet the join condition   Returning Records with No Direct Match with Outer Joins If a row does not satisfy a join condition, the row will not appear in the query result. For example, in the equijoin condition of EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS tables, employee Grant does not appear because there is no department ID recorded for her in the EMPLOYEES table. Instead of seeing 20 employees in the result set, you see 19 records.   SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, d.department_name FROM employees e, departments d WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id;   SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, d.department_name FROM employees e, departments d WHERE e.department_id(+) = d.department_id ;   Self Join : Joining a Table to Itself Sometimes you need to join a table to itself. To find the name of each employee’s manager, you need to join the EMPLOYEES table to itself, or perform a self join. For example, to find the name of Whalen’s manager, you need to: • Find Whalen in the EMPLOYEES table by looking at the LAST_NAME column. • Find the manager number for Whalen by looking at the MANAGER_ID column. Whalen’s manager number is 101. • Find the name of the manager with EMPLOYEE_ID 101 by looking at the LAST_NAME column. Kochhar’s employee number is 101, so Kochhar is Whalen’s Page on manager.in this process, you look in the table twice. The first time you look in the table to find Whalen in the LAST_NAME column and MANAGER_ID value of 101. The second time you look in the EMPLOYEE_ID column to find 101 and the LAST_NAME column to find Kochhar.   SELECT worker.last_name || ’ works for ’ || manager.last_name FROM employees worker, employees manager WHERE worker.manager_id = manager.employee_id ; Left Outer Join : This query retrieves all rows in the EMPLOYEES table, which is the left table even if there is no match in the DEPARTMENTS table.This query was completed in earlier releases as follows: SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, d.department_name FROM employees e, departments d WHERE d.department_id (+) = e.department_id; SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, d.department_name FROM employees e LEFT OUTER JOIN departments d ON (e.department_id = d.department_id) ;   Left Outer Join Syntax   A Left join returns all rows of the left of the conditional even if there is no right column to match   SELECT    a.eno, a.ename,d.dname FROM emp a LEFT OUTER JOIN dept b ON        a.dno = b.dno;   Right Outer Join : SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, d.department_name FROM employees e RIGHT OUTER JOIN departments d ON (e.department_id = d.department_id) ; Example of RIGHT OUTER JOIN This query retrieves all rows in the DEPARTMENTS table, which is the right table even if there is no match in the EMPLOYEES table. This query was completed in earlier releases as follows: SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, d.department_name FROM employees e, departments d WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id (+);   Right  Outer Join A Right join returns all rows of the Right of the conditional even if there is no right column to match   SELECT    a.eno, a.ename,b.dno,b.dname FROM emp a RIGHT OUTER JOIN dept b ON        a.dno = b.dno;   Full outer join SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, d.department_name FROM employees e FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON (e.department_id = d.department_id) ; Example of FULL OUTER JOIN This query retrieves all rows in the EMPLOYEES table, even if there is no match in the DEPARTMENTS table. It also retrieves all rows in the DEPARTMENTS table, even if there is no match in the EMPLOYEES table.   Cartesian Products A Cartesian product results in all combinations of rows displayed. This is done by either omitting the WHERE clause or specifying the CROSS JOIN clause. Table Aliases • Table aliases speed up database access. • Table aliases can help to keep SQL code smaller, by conserving memory.   Q. What kinds of joins do you know? Give examples. A. We have self join, outer joint (LEFT, RIGHT), , cross-join ( Cartesian product n*m rows returned) Exp: outer joint SELECT MyPixel Technologies, Department. DeptName FROM Employee, Department WHERE Employee.Employee_ID = Department.Employee_ID;   cross-join SELECT * FROM table1, table2;   self join SELECT Page on e1.name | |â€™    â€˜ | | e2.ename FROM emp e1, emp e2 WHERE e1. emp_no = e2.emp_no;   Q. How do you add record to a table? A. INSERT into table_name VALUES (â€˜ALEXâ€™ , 33 , â€˜Mâ€™);   Q. How do you add a column to a table? A. ALTER TABLE Department ADD (AGE, NUMBER);   Q. How do you change value of the field?   A. UPDATE EMP_table  set  number = 200 where item_munber = â€˜CDâ€™;   update name_table set status = 'enable'  where phone = '4161112222';   update SERVICE_table set REQUEST_DATE = to_date ('2006-03-04 09:29', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:MI') where phone = '4161112222';   What does COMMIT do ?COMMIT makes permanent the changes resulting from all SQL statements in the transaction. The changes made by the SQL statements of a transaction become visible   to  other  user  sessions  transactions  that  start  only  after transaction is committed. What does ROLLBACK do ?ROLLBACK  retracts  any of the changes resulting from the SQL statements in the transaction     Q. What is the highest value that can be stored in a BYTE data field?   A. The highest value that can be stored in a BYTE field is 255. or from -128 to 127. Byte is a set of Bits that represent a single character. Usually there are 8 Bits in a Byte, sometimes more, depending on how the measurement is being made. Each Char requires one byte of memory and can have a value from 0 to 255 (or 0 to 11111111 in binary).         What is a Procedure ?A  Procedure consist of a set of SQL and PL/SQL statements that are grouped together  as a unit to solve a specific problem or perform a set of related tasks.     Q. What is a stored procedure? A. A procedure is a group of PL/SQL statements that can be called by a name. Procedures do not return values they perform tasks.   Q. Describe how NULLs work in SQL? A. The NULL is how SQL handles missing values.       Arifthmetic operation with NULL in SQL will return a NULL.   What is a SNAPSHOT ?Snapshots  are  read-only copies of a master table located on a remote node which  is  periodically  refreshed  to  reflect  changes made to the master table. 135. What is a SNAPSHOT LOG ?A  snapshot  log  is a table in the master database that is associated with the  master  table.  ORACLE uses a snapshot log to track the rows that have been  updated  in  the master table. Snapshot logs are used in updating the snapshots based on the master table.   Q. What is Normalization? A. The process of table design is called normalization.   Q. What is referential integrity constraints? A. Referential integrity constraints are rules        that are partnof the table in a database schema.   What is Database Trigger ?A Database Trigger is procedure (set of SQL  and PL/SQL statements) that is automatically  executed  as  a  result of an insert in,update to, or delete from a table. Q. What are the uses of Database Trigger ?Database  triggers  can  be  used  to automatic data generation, audit data modifications, enforce complex Integrity constraints, and customize complex security authorizations. Q.  What  are  the  differences  between  Database  Trigger and Integrity constraints ?A  declarative  integrity constraint is a statement about the database that is  always true. A constraint applies to existing data in the table and any statement that manipulates the table. A  trigger  does  not  apply  to  data  loaded before the definition of the trigger,  therefore,  it does not guarantee all data in a table conforms to the rules established by an associated trigger. A  trigger  can  be  used  to  enforce  transitional constraints where as a declarative integrity constraint cannot be used.     Q. Which of the following WHERE clauses will return only rows  that have a NULL in the PerDiemExpenses column? A.   WHERE PerDiemExpenses <> B.   WHERE PerDiemExpenses IS NULL C.   WHERE PerDiemExpenses = NULL D.   WHERE PerDiemExpenses NOT IN (*)         A. B is correct ï¿½ When searching for a NULL value in a column, you must  use the  keyword IS. No quotes are required around the keyword NULL.   Q. You issue the following query: SELECT FirstName FROM StaffList WHERE FirstName LIKE'_A%' Which names would be returned by this query? Choose all that apply. A.   Allen B.   CLARK C.   JACKSON D.   David         A. C is correct ï¿½ Two wildcards are used with the LIKE operator. The underscore (_) stands for any one character of any case, and the percent sign (%) stands for any number of characters of any case including none. Because this string starts with an underscore rather than a percent sign, it won't return Allen or Clark because they represent zero and two characters before the "A". If the LIKE string had been "%A%", both of these values would have been returned. David was not returned because all non-wild card characters are case sensitive. Therefore, only strings with an uppercase "A" as their second letter are returned     Q. Write a SQL SELECT query that only returns each city only once from Students table? Do you need to order this list with an ORDER BY clause?     A. SELECT DISTINCT City FROM Students;   The Distinct keyword automatically sorts all data  in ascending order. However, if you want the data  sorted in descending order, you have to use an ORDER BY clause   Q. Write a SQL SELECT sample of the concatenation operator.   A.  SELECT LastName ||',' || FirstName, City FROM Students;   Q. How to rename column in the SQL SELECT query?   A.  SELECT LastName ||',' || FirstName           AS "Student Name", City AS "Home City"            "FROM StudentsORDER BY "Student Name"   Q. Write SQL SELECT example how you limiting the rows returned with a WHERE clause.   A. SELECT InstructorID, Salary FROM Instructors WHERE Salary > 5400 AND Salary < 6600;   Q. Write SQL SELECT query that returns the first and last name of each instructor, the Salary, and gives each of them a number.   A. SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary, ROWNUM FROM Instructors;   Q. Which of the following functions can be used only with numeric values? (Choose all that apply.) A.   AVG B.   MIN C.   LENGTH D.   SUM E.   ROUND          A. A and D ï¿½ Only A and D are correct. The MIN function works with any character, numeric, or date datatype. The LENGTH function is a character function that returns the number of letters in a character value. The ROUND function works with both numeric and date values.   Q.  Which function do you use to remove all padded characters to the right of a character value in a column with a char datatype? A.   RTRIM B.   RPAD C.   TRIM        A.  C ï¿½ The TRIM function is used to remove padded spaces. LTRIM and RTRIM functions were included in earlier versions of Oracle, but Oracle 8i has replaced them with a single TRIM function   Q. Which statement do you use to eliminate padded spaces  between the month and day values in a function TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'Month, DD, YYYY') ?   A. To remove padded spaces, you use the "fm" prefix before the date element that contains the spaces.      TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'fmMonth DD, YYYY')   Q. Is the WHERE clause must appear always before the GROUP BY clause in SQL SELECT ?   A. Yes.   The proper order for SQL SELECT clauses is: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY. Only the SELECT and FROM clause are mandatory.   Q. How Oracle executes a statement with nested subqueries?   A. When Oracle executes a statement with nested subqueries, it always executes the innermost query first. This query passes its results to the next query and so on until it reaches the outermost query. It is the outermost query that returns a result set.   Q. Which operator do you use to return all of the rows from one query except rows are returned in a second query?   A. You use the MINUS operator to return all rows from one query except where duplicate rows are found in a second query. The UNION operator returns all rows from both queries minus duplicates. The UNION ALL operator returns all rows from both queries including duplicates. The INTERSECT operator returns only those rows that exist in both queries.     Q. Which of the following statements are Data Manipulation Language commands? A.   INSERT B.   UPDATE C.   GRANT D.   TRUNCATE E.   CREATE   A.  A and B ï¿½ The INSERT and UPDATE statements are Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands. GRANT is a Data Control Language (DCL) command. TRUNCATE and CREATE are Data Definition Language (DDL) commands   Q. What is Oracle locking? A. Oracle uses locking mechanisms to protect data from being destroyed by concurrent transactions.   Q. What Oracle lock modes do you know?  A.  Oracle has two lock modes: shared or exclusive. Shared locks are set on database resources so that many transactions can access the resource. Exclusive locks are set on resources that ensure one transaction has exclusive access to the database resource   Q. What is query optimization? A.  Query optimization is the part of the query process in which the database system compares different query strategies and chooses the one with the least expected cost   Q. What is transaction? A. A transaction is a collection of applications code and database manipulation code bound into an indivisible unit of execution.it consists from: BEGIN-TRANSACTION Name Code END TRANSACTION Name   Q. What databases do you know?  Informix      DB2       SQL       Oracle   Q. Explain SQL SELECT example:     select j.FILE_NUM from DB_name.job j, DB_name.address a where j.JOB_TYPE ='C'   AND j.COMPANY_NAME = 'TEST6'   AND j.OFFICE_ID = '101'   AND j.ACTIVE_IND = 'Y'   AND a.ADDRESS_STATUS_ID = 'H'   AND a.OFFICE_ID = '101'   AND a.FILE_NUM = j.FILE_NUM order by j.FILE_NUM;       Answer: j and a aliases for table names. this is outer joint select statament from two tables.   Q. Describe some Conversion Functions that you know   A. TO_CHAR converts a number / date to a string.          TO_DATE converts a string (representing a date) to a date.            TO_NUMBER converts a character string containing digits to a numeric data type, it accepts one parameter which is a column value or a string literal   Q. In what sequence SQL statement are processed? A. The clauses of the subselect are processed in the following sequence (DB2): 1. FROM clause 2. WHERE clause 3. GROUP BY clause 4. HAVING clause 5. SELECT clause 6. ORDER BY clause 7. FETCH FIRST clause     Q. What is a pseudo column. Give some examples? It is a column that is not an actual column in the table. Eaxmple USER, UID, SYSDATE, ROWNUM, ROWID, NULL, AND LEVEL.   Q. Suppose a customer table is having different columns like customer no, payments. What will be the query to select top three max payments?   SELECT customer_no, payments from customer C1 WHERE 3<=(SELECT COUNT(*) from customer C2 WHERE C1.payment <= C2.payment)   Q. Find out nth highest salary from emp table   SELECT DISTINCT (a.sal) FROM EMP A WHERE &N = (SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT (b.sal)) FROM EMP B      WHERE a.sal<=b.sal);   Q. What are the difference between DDL, DML and DCL commands?   DDL is Data Definition Language statements. Some examples:   CREATE - to create objects in the database   ALTER - alters the structure of the database   DROP - delete objects from the database   TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for   the records are removed   COMMENT - add comments to the data dictionary   GRANT - gives user's access privileges to database   REVOKE - withdraw access privileges given with the GRANT command   DML is Data Manipulation Language statements. Some examples:   SELECT - retrieve data from the a database   INSERT - insert data into a table   UPDATE - updates existing data within a table   DELETE - deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remain   CALL - call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram   EXPLAIN PLAN - explain access path to data   LOCK TABLE - control concurrency   DCL is Data Control Language statements. Some examples:   COMMIT - save work done   SAVEPOINT - identify a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back   ROLLBACK - restore database to original since the last COMMIT   SET TRANSACTION - Change transaction options like what rollback segment to use         Can we drop a column from a table?   yes. ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;   Q.  Describe some Group Functions that you know   A. 1) The COUNT function tells you how many rows were in the result set.       SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Page on testing.qa       2) The AVG function tells you the average value of a numeric column.        SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM Page on testing.qa       3) The MAX and MIN functions tell you the maximum and minimum value of a numeric column.          SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM Page on testing.qa         4) The SUM function tells you the sum value of a numeric column.         SELECT SUM(SALARY) FROM Page on testing.qa   Group functions: Group functions operate on sets of rows to give one result per group   Count function : COUNT(*) returns the number of rows in a table. SELECT COUNT(*)FROM employees WHERE department_id = 50; Having clause If you restrict rows based on the result of a group function, you must have a GROUP BY clause as well as the HAVING clause. SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING MAX(salary)>10000 ; Query Syntax   Write a query to display the name, who is getting the max salary from EMP table  SELECT ename FROM EMP WHERE sal=(SELECT MAX(sal) FROM EMP)   Select ename, max( sal) from emp ( Wrong)   Write a query to display the employee name and respective manager name in the Emp table   SELECT a.ename, b.ename FROM EMP a , EMP b WHERE a.MGR= b.EMPNO   Write a query to display the employee name and respective manager name in the Emp table including the manager is null     SELECT a.ename ||' is working under '||b.ename FROM EMP a,EMP b WHERE a.mgr=b.empno UNION SELECT 'There is no manager to '||ename FROM EMP WHERE mgr IS NULL     Write a query to sum all the positive and negative values in the column Table name tab1   COL1        1             2             -1             -2         1)To get 2,3,N maximum salaries with complete row select * from emp where sal=(select min(sal) from( select * from (select * from emp order by sal desc) where rownum<=2)) (Replace 2 with the desired Number) 2) To get 2 Max Salary with complete row select * from emp  where sal= (select max(sal) mx from emp where  (Sal) <(select max(sal) from emp)) 4)To Get Top N rows select * from (select * from emp order by sal desc) where rownum<=5)) (replace 5 with the desired Number) 5)To Get Nth Row select * from emp where 7=(Select count(Rowid) from emp x where emp.rowid>=x.rowid) (Replace 7 with the Desired Number) 6)To Get Employees whose salary is greater the the avg salary of dept select empno,emp.deptno,sal,a.av  from emp,  (select Deptno,avg(sal) av from emp group by deptno) a where a.deptno=emp.deptno and emp.sal>a.av Other way SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL>(sELECT AVG(SAL) FROM EMP X  WHERE X.DEPTNO=EMP.DEPTNO) ORDER BY EMPNO 7)Deletion of Duplicate Records Delete from emp where rowid in(select min(rowid) from emp x where x.rowid=emp.rowid) --Select Case Example select ename,sal, case when sal between 500 and 1000 then 'D' when sal between 1001 and 1500  then 'C' when sal between 1501 and 2500  then 'B' else 'A' end Rank from emp ,salgrade where emp.sal between losal and hisal --Rows from emp and Salgrade tables select ename,sal,grade from emp,salgrade where emp.sal between losal and hisal --Use of Rank to Retervie top rows select e.*,rank() over(order by sal desc)rank from emp e where rownum<=5     Q. Describe TO_DATE function. A. The TO_DATE function returns a timestamp from a character string that has been interpreted using a character template.TO_DATE is a synonym for TIMESTAMP_FORMAT.   Write a syntax for To_Date function   To_date('2003/07/09', 'yyyy/mm/dd') would return a date value of July 9, 2003. To_date('070903', 'MMDDYY') would return a date value of July 9, 2003. To_date('20020315', 'yyyymmdd') would return a date value of Mar 15, 2002.   SELECT TO_DATE('January 15','MONTH DD') "Sample" FROM DUAL
