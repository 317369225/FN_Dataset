What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
I have used Node.js extensively and designed several node services running in production.  1.  Lack of libraries support for database drivers, memcached and etc.  For example, lack of support for memcached compression.  You can find libraries that implement the basic functions.  I need the query timeout function for a database query but I can't find it in the mysql client that we use.  2.  Event driven model will confuse a lot of programmers who are new to JavaScript.  The callback chain can get very long which makes it harder to maintain.  In web programming, you often need to grab some data to determine the next step, which means a long chain of callbacks. 3. Node.js is most likely not suited for general web development until a better web optimized framework come out.  It's easy to write a simple web page using Node.js but you will need to implement a lot of the basic functions in other more mature web frameworks.  4.  Hard memory limit.  I ran into the memory limit problem very early on and it took a while to resolve that.  5.  Node API is changing very rapidly which might cause incompatibility and bugs when you upgrade.  One of our production service ran out of memory after upgrading to the latest node version.   It took a few weeks to narrow down it's the node version we are using that caused the problem because it happened randomly on some servers after several days.  The memory leak issue did not surface until testing the system extensively under load for a long period of time.
