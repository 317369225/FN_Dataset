What is the benefit of string being immutable in Go language?
Strings are immutable in many languages, Java and Python to name a few. Immutability is useful for non-composite "data" types like numbers and strings, because it means that if you have a variable that refers to a certain string, its contents won't unexpectedly change due to other code's side effects. In addition, in Go, strings and numbers are allowed as keys in maps, and the contents of the string is used in determining equality of strings; and bad things happen if keys are mutated while in a map in such a way to change their equality, so it is beneficial to not allow them to be mutable at all.
