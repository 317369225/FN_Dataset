Is it true that Python is a dying language?A friend of my grandmother is a Computer Scientist from MIT, he told me that I should not learn Python because it's a dying language and that I should learn Assembly because it's better than Python.
Thanks for the best laugh I've gotten from Quora in quite a while.  I've written some substantial IBM-360/370 assembler language code in my time, but your aged MIT friend is either uninformed or pulling your leg.  I'm confident that you'll be far more productive with Python than with assembler language.  Ask him what he thinks about memory management and automatic garbage collection.  Find out what actual experience/knowledge he has about Python.  My guess is that he has none at all. If he argued in favor of, say, functional programming instead of imperative languages like Python, then there'd at least be a chance he should be taken seriously.  That would at least make for  decent but complicated debate.
