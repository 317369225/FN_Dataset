What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
One thing missing from Answers, your working domain knowledge, or understanding of your question. Any model/algorithms only works on limited scale of scenarios. In real world, the simple solution may be enough if you can present your question/request right. Data is a reflection of real world. Without knowing data, data science has no meaning at all.
