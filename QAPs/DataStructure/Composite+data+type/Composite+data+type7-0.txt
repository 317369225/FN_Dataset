Which two programming languages together are powerful and cover the largest field in programming?
This is an interesting question. I'm going to take general use into consideration as well. For example, you can use Java with the web, but it's generally not a hugely popular choice there. Single most powerful is C hands down. Pretty much everything goes back to C at some point. It's definitely not the easiest to use, but power? You've got it all there. If had to pick two that are reasonably well situated for a large number of areas there are a couple routes I could go. Java and JS would probably be one. With JS at this point you've got the entire web, and you can do it well with that (of course you need HTML/CSS, but JS is the driving force). With Java you've got fully cross platform (don't even need to recompile most of the time) application development that works well with the console and desktop apps. Also its built in UI toolkit is very powerful and fairly easy to learn. You've also technically got Android (main reason I picked Java over C++), though a lot of the code is used differently and there's a lot to learn to do that well. That's probably the most complete pair, beyond that I'd go with C++ and Python. Python has the same cross platform functionality of Java as it's interpreted. C++ is an OOP, general purpose powerhouse of a language that stretches pretty far into everything from application and console development to gaming. Python is more lightweight, but still very powerful and works well with the web thanks to Django.
