How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?Please provide your complete/exhaustive preparation details, if possible.
CAT '14: 99.99 Honestly, I gave the exam on a friends suggestion. I did not explicitly prepare for it, but having good Maths basics helped me a lot. Also, my habit of reading novels helped me with the Verbal section. As for preparation suggestions, I am the wrong person to ask. My recommendation would be to practice basic maths and brain-teasers of the DI kind a lot. Also, inculcate the habit of reading long literature pieces such as Op-Eds of Hindu or NYT. They will help you with Verbal section. Hope this helped :) Edit: Parth suggested I add the fact that I am from an IIT. Updated 21 Jul â€¢ View Upvotes
