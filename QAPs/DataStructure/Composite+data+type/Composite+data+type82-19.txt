How many lines of code can a good programmer write in one hour?
I can write pretty much any number you desire in an hour. It'll probably be meaningless lines of "this is a line of code" (see below). As a quick demo, I have written you 50. print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") print("this is a line of code") Here's how: 'print("this is a line of code")\n' * 50 #replace with how many you want
