How much Java do I need to know to land a junior level Java job?I assume the answer translates over to the other languages as well.
Well, I've always thought that if you do not know enough Java to pass the Sun(sorry Oracle's ) certification then you shouldn't call yourself a Java programmer But, I've been told that I'm wrong, and the industry standard seems to be a desire and ability to learn, be able to solve Fizz Buzz type of problems, and be able to sit on your ass and churn out programs. If you can do this, then you earn the privilege of being taught Java "on the job", which also means that you will overworked until you get to some level of competency.
