Is it best practice to write functional or object orientated JavaScript?I have been programming in JavaScript, mainly node.js, for about 6 months now and am still unsure if it is best to write my code with an object orientated approach or a functional approach. Is there a standard way, the go to when unsure as to which to choose. I wish to further develop my skills beyond beginner/intermediate and believe I should develop my skills in one of these paradigms.
I find it difficult to imagine that you should or could just choose one over the other. Javascript is an object-oriented language (with a very minimal definition of "object"), with some functional features. Those functional features allow you to write code in the functional paradigm. Typically, your objects contain functions as methods, and your functions process data that exists in objects. And of course, even functions are objects...
