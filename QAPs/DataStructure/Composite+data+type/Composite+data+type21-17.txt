What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
Developers grow by developing a high comfort level dealing with something they don't understand.  The more comfortable you are not knowing the answer to something, if you stay willing to take in on anyway, the easier being a programmer becomes.  It is nice to be in a company or work with peers that know more than you do.  The better you get at what you do the number of people that can help goes down and the more you need to rely on your own ability to figure it out.  It's not the problem itself that is the issue.  The real problem is your ability to focus on something you don't understand and figure it out.  Confidence is the result of the growth of a programmer.
