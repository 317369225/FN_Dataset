How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?Please provide your complete/exhaustive preparation details, if possible.
I guess most of the points are covered, but I will add just one more point. If the sectional time limit is 1 hour, you practise as if it was 50 mins. This will help you in time management. Trust me, 1 hour in cat feels lot shorter than 1 hour in practise. P.S.- I dont know what the current format is so just assumed its 1 hour.
