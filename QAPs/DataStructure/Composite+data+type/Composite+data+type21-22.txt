What are the growth stages of a programmer?Can someone share their journey and what clear stages you can identify over the years? e.g. learning your first programming language, first IT jobs, career decisions, understanding goals of corporate IT, etc?
Let me complement "What's Next" after the 5 stages of Mr Quincy Larson.  I have no idea what I am doingFor the first 2 years I worked as a java developer in some outsourcing companies. I found that I got no idea what I was doing. I am very self-confidentI stopped working, stayed at home and tried to study as much as possible. After 6 months I felt very self-confident. It was so easy to find a job that time, I didn't need to apply for jobs, the employers called me for interview with much higher salary level. I can do whatever I wantI felt disappointed with the market. And I wanted to work oversea for a more developed country. Luckily I did it also. I am an old developer but a young managerAfter 30, I didn't want to work as developer anymore. I studied leadership, coaching... to move to the next level. But most of the companies asked me to do coding... I am better than my bossy bossesMany times, I worked under younger & less experienced bosses. They always tried to prove that they're better than their staves. I tell you, you really don't want to suffer from this. But it's hard for you to run away from it. It's not the whole story but I guess I wrote too long already. You may work as a developer now. But you end up after few years,  apply for tester position. It's not abnormal...
