What is the most efficient way to sort 4TB on a single machine with 4GB of RAM?
Is this 4TB data of single data type, or composite type to be sorted? The idea here is when sorting is not done on the whole length of each element, it would worth extracting this information and see how much smaller the data will be. The extracted elements need to be found later, so indexing them to a separate location, data-store, and then sort this smaller extracted data.  At completion of this sort, each element can be looked up and re-associated with its origin, re-written if needed. Caveat, indexing can be also expensive on nearly 4TB data, so gain may be less or even loss.  Therefore, this presents the next series of problems.
