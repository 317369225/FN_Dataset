Is it best practice to write functional or object orientated JavaScript?I have been programming in JavaScript, mainly node.js, for about 6 months now and am still unsure if it is best to write my code with an object orientated approach or a functional approach. Is there a standard way, the go to when unsure as to which to choose. I wish to further develop my skills beyond beginner/intermediate and believe I should develop my skills in one of these paradigms.
As mentioned in other answers, there is no unique best practice when writing JavaScript code (or any other programming language with multi-paradigms). In fact, many other factors are at play when you write code and you need to choose a programming style: Previously written code (i.e. legacy code) In-house habits and style Used frameworks and libraries (some enforce a certain coding style, other are more permissive) The type of project you are working on Now, if I had the liberty to choose (no external factors) then I would advice the use of functional programming since it looks cleaner and is more aligned with the design principles of JavaScript (functions as first-class citizens, functional builtin methods...).
