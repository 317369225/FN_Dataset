How many Chinese characters can a foreign-language student expect to learn in one, two, etc years?Naturally this depends on the intensity of study (college class, full-time, etc) and other factors.Â  Those could be part of an answer, or an answer holding those factors fixed could be a useful benchmark.
I studied Chinese for a bit over two years in Taiwan at NCKU and learned about 2000 characters with our textbook, Practical Audiovisual Chinese, plus a few other sources. I guess that 1500-2000 characters would be standard for 2 years of study. However, once you know basic characters, you can go further by yourself by using memorization techniques such as the method of loci (the most effective IMO) or others such as spaced repetitions (cf. Anki) and writing practice + SRS (Skritter).
