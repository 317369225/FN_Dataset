How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?Please provide your complete/exhaustive preparation details, if possible.
The answers given here pretty much contain all the necessary points to be kept in mind while preparing for an exam like CAT (which is essentially just an aptitude test). In addition to these I would like to emphasize on just one point which, I think, helped me the most : Get into a habit of READING long texts from the computer screen and UNDERSTANDING them in one go. I tried to improve on this by making sure to attempt all the Reading Comprehensions and Para-Jumbles in the mock tests that I gave. Trust me, this practice will help you not just in the CAT but any other similar computer based tests that you would write. Most probably, this is the only reason for my better percentile in the VA section than in the QA section.
