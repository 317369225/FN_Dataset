What are the frequently asked basic and complex queries ( SQL) during a tech interview?
I usually ask this question based on employees table in HR schema in Oracle database. Query to print employee name along with their manager name. If no manager(that employee at the top level of the organization. I guess its Steve in employees table )then print employee name, "no manager". This query looks simple at first place. But trust me most of the fresh graduates fail to answer it correctly. Self join, outer join and nvl to be used to get the desired result. From this simple query I get an insight into candidates understanding of join.
