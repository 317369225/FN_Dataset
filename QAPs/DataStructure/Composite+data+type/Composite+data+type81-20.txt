What are the disadvantages of using Node.js?
It looks great and can definitely scale.  It has Yahoo behind it with Mojito.  But I always tend to keep my eye on any technology that is too hyped and has too much media push before it is a 1.0.  It's definitely fun to work with.  I did server side javascript at the turn of the century with Netscape Enterprise server and it was ok.   Vert.x is looking pretty cool because it supports JavaScript, Java and Python.  The performance specs on Vert.x look great.  Node.JS has so many great modules, frameworks and tools it's hard to ignore.  I am prototyping a few small systems now.  We could have used this for Database America's yellow pages engine!
