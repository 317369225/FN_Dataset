Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?The answer is 1 you have already mentioned it. see 1=5 here you have already mentioned it that 1=5 so obviously 5=1 obviously when L.H.S=R.H.S then whether you see it from left hand side or the right hand side the equation is balanced so that is why the answer is 1.
