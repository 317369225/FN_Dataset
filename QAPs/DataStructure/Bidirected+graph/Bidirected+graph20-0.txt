Concepts: Which structure or idea could overcome the dot-line structure of the network and offer the next conceptual model to apprehend reality?Since the Cybenetics and the generalization of the idea of system - now network, we have a model that allow us to think elements of any scale (DNA, cities, society, organs, planets, etc.) using a same single structure : the network. Then we can not honestly rely on a basic dot-line idea to represent anything on this planet. So, my question is : what can we envision as a model after the network?
Thanks for the provocative question! I think it needs deeper study. As you imply, the network is a standard model of choice, specifically for considering the transmission of material, energy and information. The advantage of a model is it provides a simplification of reality that can be reasoned about. The dot/line (or node/arc) network model can be drawn, stored, and implemented in physical structures, computing hardware or running code quite easily. The only alternative I can think of is diffusion. This is closer to the reality ofÂ  broadcast radio, mixing of gases, formation and shapes of clouds, liquid flow, or even the spread of ideas and memes. But consider for example meterology. It looks at network effects, but it considers many rich properties of the medium (air pressure, temperature, humidity, motion). So these two models have relatively clear boundaries for their application. Networks are useful for reasoning precisely about transmission, especially where there are discrete connections. Diffusion is useful where transmission is through a broadcast medium.
