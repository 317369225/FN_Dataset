What is social network analysis?Intuitive explanation please, also of network theory. It seems simply just connections between people to other people, I don't see how more involved analysis would proceed or it can construed as requiring theory. But I just want to be shown the light.
Yes, we're just talking about connections and relationships between people, but from this simple concept much more complex systems can arise. Intuition.  Boy loves girls.  That is two nodes with a directed arc connecting them.  If it is unrequited love, that gives one dynamic.  If girl loves boy as well, then you have a bidirectional edge between two nodes, with a different dynamic.  Add another girl who loves the boy.  Classical love triangle with inherent instability leading to all sorts of complications. With larger networks we can tackle questions of influence, idea propagation, resilience, etc. Think of it as a mix of sociology and graph theory.
