How did you get recruited to Directi?Looking to learn what Directi looks for in potential hires, the whole interview process, anything particular one should know before sitting for the interview. For those who do not know it is an Indian Company which pays a pretty competitive salary and is known to recruit geeks without bothering about academic performance.
I wrote a detailed post about how my recruitment process underwent couple years back during campus placements. Although, process has changed a bit in recent times, I hope you find it helpful anyways! Check it out here: Directi Selection
