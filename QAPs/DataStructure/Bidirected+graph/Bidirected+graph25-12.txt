If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Definitely the answer will be 25, not 5 or 1. since 1 is not equivalent to 5 ,we can infer here "=" is not an equality operator. And nowhere in the question it is mentioned that the operator "=" is commutative or not, and there is no example given to support the commutative law. so instead of "=", if we put R, it will turnout to be 1R5, 2R10, 3R15, 4R20, There is no mathematical/fundamental support to assume aRb is equivalent to bRa. Since we can not say, R is commutative in nature or not, it's safe to conclude, the commutative nature does not hold till now, so 5R25 is a correct option ,in other words, 5=25.
