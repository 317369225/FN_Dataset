I am confused whether to use angular.js, underscore.js react.js, ember.js or backbone.js for my next project. Can someone help me with material which states which type of web apps each library rocks at?
As with everything in software engineering, it depends Backbone/Underscore Backbone (and underscore or lodash) is a great option if you're trying to integrate into an existing website that already heavily uses jQuery or Zepto and you have a REST API to back your models. Angular is great for when you're building a single page client application and want a lot of code from the community. There are plenty of angular modules out there and it has a great story around testing. Ember is very opinionated on how things should work. If your app fits the Ember Way you may have an easier time developing things quickly with it. React is the least opinionated of the bunch and my favorite to work with. I've found that it's really removed the need for a lot of plugins and frameworks.
