What is the best way to represent a graph in MySQL?
For a directed graph, one table with columns for source and destination nodes will do it, as you suggested.  Once your graph has a lot of edges (~100M+), this approach will become slow and you might need to partition the table.  Still, I think this is the best approach, but as the table grows you need to monitor its performance. You would not want to make a table for each node (as was suggested in your now-removed question details).  This would require dynamically constructing a new query each time, and would be unable to take advantage of prepared statements.  Joins would also be impossible.
