What's the use of graph traversal and minimun spanning tree algorithms in social networks?
I'm not sure how useful minimum spanning trees are in social networks specifically, though they are useful in other contexts. Disclaimer: I only have a little bit of background in social networks (university course). So I could be wrong about this; maybe there are some more advanced contexts where they come up. Graph traversal is useful in almost every context where graphs are useful, with social networks being no exception. Graph traversals help us find all the connected nodes in a graph, which is useful whenever we need to know which entities in the social graph can be reached from a given node. Some other useful operations, usually implemented by BFS or bidirectional BFS, include finding the shortest path between two nodes in a social network (degree of separation) and finding all the connections of a node having degree of separation (distance) less than K.
