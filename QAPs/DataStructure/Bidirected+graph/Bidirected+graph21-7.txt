I am confused whether to use angular.js, underscore.js react.js, ember.js or backbone.js for my next project. Can someone help me with material which states which type of web apps each library rocks at?
Angular and Ember are frameworks whereas backbone and react are really libraries.  Im using reactjs currently and like it because it provides a nice control of state and largely gets out of the way whereas angular and ember hide things from you so you dont entirely know whats happening.  I am planning to use ember though for a project to see what its about.  Ive also used backbone somewhat and liked it for the same reason i like reactjs.  The problem with backbone is for a large application the code because increasingly difficult to manage and you get alot of redundant code as well.   It really has to do with your use case.  The application i used reat in has alot of state and react is built for that.  So it encapsulates alot which makes it easier to maintain.  It also includes drag and drop.  I had considered other frameworks however i didnt like how there was so many layers you had to deal with.  Which can be helpful but they can also create problems.  Ember seems to be doing alot focused on clean code and for a certain project it fits the need well.  At least at first glimpse.  So at some point im looking to use that as well to have something to compare to. So figure out the needs of you project and then maybe do some tests in each and see how it goes.
