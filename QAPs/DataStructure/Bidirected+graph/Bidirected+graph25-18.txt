If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?Short answer:- It can be;;- not defined, 1 or 25 dependining on the way it has been asked As yout question mentions 1=5 and so on.. Let's first focus on the meaning of these statements As 1 does not equal 5  and so on, numerically  ,even they are not in any way similar visually , neither of the equality sign or similarity sign hold Which means you are possibly mentioning a situation in which  1 is related to 5 2 is related to 10 3 is related to 15 4 is related to 20 So to answer what 5 is related  to we need to know more about the relationship between the numbers on the left hand side and the numbers on the numbers on the right hand side Aka the function that relates them If it is the same function that relates all the four values then we need to knoe wheather it is a unidirectional pathway or a bidirectional pathway., i.e. if it is a reflexive function or not If it is a reflexive function then we can conclude 5 relates to 1, If not we need to knoe more I.e. wheather the relation when plotted on a plane takin lhs and rhs on the axis's  we get a straight line or not and wheather the point lies in the domain of function or not If it is a straight line and 5 lies in its domain Then we can conclude  5 relates to 25 as  a straight line has constant slope . Otherwise if 5 doesnot lie in the domain of the function we cannot calculate the exact value at 5 E.g. y= 5x(x-5)/(x-5) Has a limiting value of 25 as we approach 5 on the x axis from both sides but vanishes when we are exactly at 5 as it can't be calculated In the other case When the graph would not look like a straight line, it would be foolish to draw a conclusion As the given information only provides the location of 5points on the coordinate axis's and the reason for them holding their position unknown it can't be answered where a point with x co-ordinate 5 would like to rest . .In my opinion the most appropriate answer to the question would be 25 As it allows the asker to have a good laugh at your stupidity.
