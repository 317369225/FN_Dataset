If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?Can be 1  If "=" means equal to and is commutative (a=b means b=a) so 1 =5, so 5 =1 It can be 25, when"="  is not equal to but overridden function  where RHS is 5 times of the LHS Some thing like in stead of writing 1 * 5 = 5, we wrote 1 =5 So in stead of writing 5 *5 =25, it can be written as 5 =25 PS: I don't find what is mathematics in the question.
