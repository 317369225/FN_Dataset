Which elements must be in RÂ  so that it is reflexive, symmetric, or anti-symmetric?
Yes you are absolutely correct . In fact it get's easier if you represent the whole thing as a graph and consider each element as a node . then make edges according to the relations . say (2,3), so make an edge from 2 to 3. then check three things 1.Does every node has an edge to it self ? If yes then it's reflexive 2. Is the graph fully bidirectional ? If yes then it's symmetric 3. Is there at least one bidirectional edge ? If yes then it's not symmetric . If no then it's anti-symmetric .
