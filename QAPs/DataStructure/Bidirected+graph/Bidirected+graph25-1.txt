If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally answer here : Ronak Chopra's answer to If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=? As per the pattern : a = 5 times a 1 =5 2 = 10 3 = 15 4 = 20 5 = 25 This is the most basic pattern that one may notice and answer accordingly in a hurry But......But.......But..... As per common sense If, a=b then it is evident that b=a (one doesn't need to prove this, this is the most basic mathematical logic explained in lower classes) Thus keeping in mind what we first mentioned, 5 = 1
