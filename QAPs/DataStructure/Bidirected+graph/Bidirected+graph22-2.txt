Who are the most important/respected unrecognized geeks on the internet?Many people have toiled in the dark and helped advance the internet in radical way, only to be forgotten by most people later on (for example, Peter Tattam, who created Trumpet Winsock. More on him here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item... ). So who are other people who made significant contributions to the internet but did not really profit much from those contributions?
