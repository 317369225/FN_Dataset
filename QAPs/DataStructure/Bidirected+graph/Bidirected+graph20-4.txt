Concepts: Which structure or idea could overcome the dot-line structure of the network and offer the next conceptual model to apprehend reality?Since the Cybenetics and the generalization of the idea of system - now network, we have a model that allow us to think elements of any scale (DNA, cities, society, organs, planets, etc.) using a same single structure : the network. Then we can not honestly rely on a basic dot-line idea to represent anything on this planet. So, my question is : what can we envision as a model after the network?
