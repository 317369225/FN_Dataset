If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?The question is malformed (doesnot contain enough info to solve it properly amd is ambiguous). As such it can be answered in two ways based on two assumptions: 1. "=" is commutative here. So a=b => b=a. So the series will be 5, 10, 15, 20, 1, 30, 35, 40, 45, 2, 55... That is... i=i*5 (if is is not a multiple of 5) and i=i/5 (if i is multiple of 5). 2. The "=" is not commutative. A=B does not mean B=A. In this case clearly the answer is 25. Assumption 2 makes more sense because if assumption 1 is true this means an operation performed on LHS should give RHS AND the same operation performed on RHS should give LHS. (I believe that is how commutation works). So assumption 1 iiswrong because it leads to internal inconsistency.
