What is social network analysis?Intuitive explanation please, also of network theory. It seems simply just connections between people to other people, I don't see how more involved analysis would proceed or it can construed as requiring theory. But I just want to be shown the light.
In simplest terms, Social Network Analysis (SNA), is the analysis of the nodes that are modeled in form of network where the node can be any physical world entity or may even exist in virtual world like Facebook.      For instance, a graph or network of nodes of your Facebook friends(each friend acting as a node) can be created to analyze the interactivity and thus helps to gain very useful insights. This allows us to understand how information diffuses in Social Networks.     In physical world, we get to know how resilient, different infrastructure networks such as roads, or metro-rail station, or electrical power grids are too random or intentional builders.     The nodes may vary from financial entities to political entities or any object of environment under consideration.      This should get you started: An automated layout algorithm The book - Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World.
