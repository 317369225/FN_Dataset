If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?These patterns can be confusing if you look at the following perspectives. As already mentioned, point 1 is illustration of your description. You can look at this question in 3 ways: 1 - According to rules of Equality and deriving equations: It sates that if left hand side (LHS) is equal to Right hand side (RHS), then RHS will definitely equal to LHS. So,  1 = 5 and hence,  5 = 1 2 - According to Binary representation: Your above pattern can be written as: 00001 = 00101 (1 = 5) 00010 = 01010 (2 = 10) 00011 = 01111 (3 = 15) 00100 = 10100 (4 = 20) And hence,  00101 = 11001 (5 = 25) 3 - According to a Ist Standard Student: By adding 'X5' in your pattern: 1 X 5 = 5 2 X 5 = 10 3 X 5 = 15 4 X 5 = 20 And hence,  5 X 5 = 25 . These conditions changes as per your demand of question. This is a pattern. Hence you need to answer according to the category and area it's asked. Hope it helps.
