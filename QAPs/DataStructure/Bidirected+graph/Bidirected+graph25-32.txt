If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?This is a kind of pattern, by doing some manipulation on one number we will get another. First try to get the relation between given numbers. 1 = 5 2 = 10 3 = 15 4 = 20 Here by doing some manipulation on the left side number we are getting the right side number. By examining this series all the left hand side numbers are multiples of 1 and right hand side numbers are multiples of 5. So if we want to equate them left side number should be multiplied by 5. So we can get the right side number by multiplying the left side number by 5. In this case: 1*5 =5, 2*5=10, 3*5=15, 4*5=20 So the answer is 5*5 = 25
