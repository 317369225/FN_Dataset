If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?May be 25 (75%) may be 1 (25%). The answer would be 25 if this is following a pattern and 'equal to' sign symbolises just a relation. But if its an IQ question and 'equal to' sign holds its meaning then the answer will be 1 since 1=5.. .. Better not to attempt such questions.
