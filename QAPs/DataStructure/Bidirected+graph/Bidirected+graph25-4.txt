If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?As seen in the statement earlier, (1=5) the question doesn't describe '=' as any relational operator, since logically, 1 can never be equal to 5. But, when seen of it mathematically, it is clear that 1=5 is in a pattern, maybe of an arithmetic progression like: 5,10,15,20,.... Find the next no. <- somewhat like this. The statement does make an appealing answer of it as 5=1, but given this a thought, there wouldn't be much sense if we ended up writing: 1=5 2=10 3=15 4=20 5=1 6=30 <--- here the question stands somewhat irrelevant. Hence, there can be 2 answers, based on what category this question stands, for which 'mathematics' stands as a good category than 'logic' to me. So, conclusion, 5 here would mean the fifth element of the series, being 25.
