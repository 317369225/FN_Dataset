If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Observing the pattern, one would be expected to guess that 5=25. Also, since 1=5 in the first case, you might even put your bets on 5=1, like the other responses here. However, I really can't give a definite answer to this question as the symbol used, '=', does not resemble it's actual meaning. Since the symbol in question doesn't really mean equality, I don't think we can assume that it's commutative. For questions like this, even if you used a symbol like '→  ', the answer probably won't be 1, as the relation will point to the answer being 25. Updated 31 Oct • View Upvotes
