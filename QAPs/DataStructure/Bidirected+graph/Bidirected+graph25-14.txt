If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?The answer to the above question is not based on real calculations, but just some logic. '=' does not mean we need to find out a relationship between values considering them as variables. As the values are constant numbers, solution can be provided using logic. It has been mentioned in question already 1=5 , so 1 can be an answer. Some people may claim that the answer is 5=5 whatever the other values may be, considering it to be an IQ based question. These answers are based upon the presence of mind and situation. The above answer cannot be true if the question comes under reasoning category. Then, we need to solve for answer using following logic: A very simple approach to solve the above problem can be - "If one stick is divided into 5 parts, two when divided in similar way gives 10 small sticks, three will give 15, four will make 20 of smaller ones, and five such sticks will have 25 small ones." 1 * 5 = 5Â  => 1=5 2 * 5 = 10 => 2=10 3 * 5 = 15 => 3=15 4 * 5 = 20 => 4=20 5 * 5 = 25 => 5=25 Each number on left hand side (L H S) when multiplied with five gives right hand side (R H S). The answer hence in this case is 25. Such problem may be used to test either reasoning or IQ or both and anyone of the above can be an answer as per the situation. Please consider the different answers provided for different situations. Multiple answers are possible.
