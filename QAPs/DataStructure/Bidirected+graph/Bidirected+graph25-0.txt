If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?The answer is slightly out of the box if you ask me. Short answer - You cannot apply the mathematical laws of equality. If you consider the laws of mathematical equality as a relation: 1. Its symmetric i.e if x=y then y=x 2. if reflexive ie x=x 3. its transitive if x = y and y=z then x=z Where most people go wrong is they consider the '=' in the above question as the sign of mathematical equality. You cannot just follow one rule of mathematical equality(symmetric) and neglect the other(reflexive).  Lets use a different sign - R so, the question is 1 R 5 2 R 10 3 R 15 4 R 20 5 R ? Now from the given information what is the most probable answer? You might as well had answered 5000 following any random relation.  The problem is these question doesn't have a definite answer, just the most probable one. So, the question wants to find the same pattern which was followed by the question setter to develop the relation. A very obvious mind can easily find the pattern and say that the relation is R: I -> I  ( 5x for each x belonging to I ) Apart from this information, you cannot conclude anything. You cannot assume that the relation follows the symmetric relation or transitive relation(it is obviously not reflexive). So, the most probable answer is 25. If you had two options to choose from - 1 or 25, 25 is still the more appropriate answer.
