I am confused whether to use angular.js, underscore.js react.js, ember.js or backbone.js for my next project. Can someone help me with material which states which type of web apps each library rocks at?
Use Angular, make a module of underscore and inject it anywhere in your angular app and finally use React.js with angular to make rendering the view fast. Below is the link to how to use react in an angular app : Faster AngularJS Rendering (AngularJS and ReactJS) Smile  like a boss. You have got Angular's semantic, underscore's library and React's fast view rendering feature.  Don't go for ember.js or backbone.js because Angular is better than both in many ways.
