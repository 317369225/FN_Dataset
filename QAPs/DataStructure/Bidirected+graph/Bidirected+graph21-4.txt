I am confused whether to use angular.js, underscore.js react.js, ember.js or backbone.js for my next project. Can someone help me with material which states which type of web apps each library rocks at?
angularJS & emberJS are DOM manipulation + DI injection frameworks. These basically automate all your $('.foo').val / text/ html setters and getters underscore IS A MUST, regardless as you will use it to process data. It works really well with angular when getting the REST API data responses. Lastly, backbone is a matter of your back-end which drives also the MVC front ent. This is useful when your backend is node.js (instead of C# WebApi2). The gotcha is that backbone Also produce views (kinda like in PHP) but is JS.
