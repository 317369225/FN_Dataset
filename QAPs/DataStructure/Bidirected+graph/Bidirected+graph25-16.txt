If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
This follows a simple, high school algebraic topic, known as sequences or sequential orders. There are two types of sequential orders; Arithmetic and Geometric. This math problem is classified as Arithmetic. The constant term is 5 . The first term is also 5. 5-5 =0 for term difference. Therefore, it can now be written as an algebraic expression. 5n +0 = 5n Where n equals the term or position. Using this, we can find any term. Here we are asked to find the 5th term. We can now use our expression. 5(n) = 5 (5) = 25. This expression could be used to find any number term, 2000 or even 10500. Yay math !
