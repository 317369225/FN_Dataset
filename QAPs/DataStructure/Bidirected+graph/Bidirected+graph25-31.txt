If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?Ok! So you are playing with a pattern here. This really seems to be a stupid question to few of the NON ENGINEER buddies (I asked few of my non engineer friends). Sometimes pattern becomes design and a design always repeats itself after one round. Here 1 = 5 and 2 = 10, after these 2 equations you can believe that 3 will be equal to 15 and then 4 will be equal to 20. Ok that is true, we are dealing with multiple of 5. But asking that 5 is equals to what ? 25! According to the pattern, yes. But think about design of the question. 5 is already there in the pattern and which is equals to 1. (first equation). Wow, you are a genius!! I think this is really a stupid question to answer, but I read somewhere that these small stupid questions makes the difference and some people encountered these type of questions in IIM interviews as well. So to answer these type of questions, you should stop at a point and think. No need to spend few minutes thinking. Just look back what you have got and then move forward. You will get the right answer. Sometimes small things teach us the way we tackle big problems. Thanks for asking a stupid but very useful question. (No offence :P)
