I am confused whether to use angular.js, underscore.js react.js, ember.js or backbone.js for my next project. Can someone help me with material which states which type of web apps each library rocks at?
I have switched from Backbone/Marionette to Angular and since then my code became smaller, writing faster, and testing - easier (here Angular seems to stand out). To show how compact Angular code is, here is a full Angular App: <input ng-model="variable">{{variable}} That is all needed to auto-update your input variable on the right. You can easily upgrade it by replacing {{variable}} by any Angular expression, for instance {{variable * 2}}. If I need to do it in Backbone, I would have to create a template and put it into a separate script tag, then create Backbone Model and attach it to Backbone View, then define my rendering method in the View, and then set up event listener to update the model upon key press, and finally, another event listener to re-render the view upon model change! And further, any expression logic you have to implement yourself. Underscore or its successor Lodash is completely different beast - a set of very useful utilities, that are still as useful in Angular. Can't speak about other frameworks but I understand their code for the same functionality would be longer, which is a major argument for me (but may not be for everyone).
