I am confused whether to use angular.js, underscore.js react.js, ember.js or backbone.js for my next project. Can someone help me with material which states which type of web apps each library rocks at?
i already used ember and backbone (together with marionette) and evaluated angular. also underscore was used in smaller javascript projects. i personally prefer ember and backbone over angular, because i don't like this tag-programming done in angular. but this is my personal taste. regarding ember and backbone i have to say both have its advantages and disadvantages. regarding backbone/marionette i like the modularity. you can define completely independent moduls wich continue working also if one of the others is switched off or broken. everything is done via events and the components listen to it. the disadvantage of this is, that you have to build the event listenings and if that are many, code can become a bit ugly. nevertheless i like backbone. maybe one addition: in backbone there is a danger to create memory leaks. in the beginning this happend often. this finished when we understood how the eventhandling really worked ember on the other hand does this binding stuff for you and if you have a project, not becoming too complex, ember is a very good solution. if you have to to more advanved things you will often have to hack around, which is sometimes a bit tricky. i can recomment both, ember and backbone. regarding underscore. this is more a library from my perspective. in case you use backbone you will most likely also use underscore
