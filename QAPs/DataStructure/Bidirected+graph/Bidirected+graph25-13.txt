If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Originally Answered: If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15, 4=20, then 5=?If we follow the basic rules of mathematics,our logic goes wrong at the first statement itself. 1 can never be equal to 5  according to the number system rules. So, here we should take the '='  just as a relation. Hence we can make an assumption that '=' in this context means multiplying the number on the left with five. Based on this assumption we can not say 1=5 implies 5=1,as multiplying 5 with 5 does not result in 1. So, we can conclude that the answer for this question is 25.
