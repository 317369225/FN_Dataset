If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
1 = 5 2 = 10 3 = 15 4 = 20 5 = ?   We if you think for a second, you will get the answer i.e. 25.   The above numbers represent a series, i.e. find the difference of the two numbers placed on both the sides.   like 1~5 =4, 2~10=8, 3~15=12, 4~20=16.   Therefore, the series is 4, 8, 12, 20.... This is an arithematic progression and the next number will be 20.   Therefore, the answer will be 5=25, since 5~25=20.   This was indeed simple, but the problem reaches a whole new level when it gets to 9.   Check you my below answer for further details : Wamsi Viswanath's answer to Needs Attention: What is the next number in this sequence and why?
