I am confused whether to use angular.js, underscore.js react.js, ember.js or backbone.js for my next project. Can someone help me with material which states which type of web apps each library rocks at?
AngularJS and EmberJS provides end to end base for your application. Simply I would say they will force you to write app in best practiced way. ReactJS is something different, you just feed your data and tell how to render it and where to render it. As above this is not complete framework but it is like do whatever the shit you want to do with JS and give me the end data and tell me how to render it. RactiveJS is also worthy addition to ReactJS kind libraries. UnderscoreJS is different, this is widely used Utils library. Whether you use any framework or no framework, UnderscoreJS will help you to write your Business logic by providing some nice api to reduce redundant work. If you ask me for individual opinion, I suggest RactiveJS. Disclaimer: I am contributor to that project. Though AngularJS is very powerful, RactiveJS and ReactJS are like girl friends who give freedom to you in the other hand AngularJS is like a typical wife :|. Updated 5 Mar â€¢ View Upvotes
