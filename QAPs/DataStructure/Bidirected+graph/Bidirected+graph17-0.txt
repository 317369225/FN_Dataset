How do I know I have defined a state correctly in this "Trampoline maze" problem? How to know in all problems like this which require BFS in k-dimensions I have done it correctly?
Another way to accomplish this is to construct a parallel graph in which nodes are linked by edges that indicate reachability. Let's look at the maze you gave as an example. There is a trampoline at (row,column)=(1,2). Because of that trampoline, our parallel graph would connect the starting point (1,1) to both (1,2) (the trampoline) as well as (1,4) (because you could jump over the wall via the trampoline). Similarly, the point at (0,2) (north of the trampoline) would connect to (1,2), as well as (3,2). It is important to note that these trampoline-enabled connections are not bidirectional! They can only be traversed in one direction. You'll also want to weight the edges appropriately, to indicate that these "trampoline edges" require two moves to accomplish. Once you have the parallel graph set up, you can run your solution process on it (either BFS, or DFS) to find the path between any two points.
