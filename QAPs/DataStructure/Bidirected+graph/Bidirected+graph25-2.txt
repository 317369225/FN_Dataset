If 1=5, 2=10, 3=15 4=20 then 5=?
Did that option set have "none of the above" ? Because I'm at a bloody war with myself and I doubt humanity's existence up till now. Whenever I come across these kind of question, I feel like we're back to square one, being caveman. I mean, that's bloody madness ! How can you write 1 = 5, and be okay with it ? All of this type of questions has no basic ground upon which, you can draw your conclusion for Recorde's sake ! 'Presence of mind' , my ass ! Equality operator states that a value/another variable is assigned to an UNKNOWN VARIABLE ! Like a=5, meansÂ  5 is assigned as the value of a . Not 5 has the value of a. a+b=c, means the value of c is equal to sum total value of a, and b and so on. When you write 1=5, the statement from the beginning goes wrong. there has to be some operation/variable in the LHS, like 1+4=5, or x=5. Call me an arrogant, but this shit has to stop ! P.S. Robert Recorde is believed to be the inventor of equal sign. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro...
