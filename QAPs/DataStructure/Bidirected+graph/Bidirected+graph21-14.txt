I am confused whether to use angular.js, underscore.js react.js, ember.js or backbone.js for my next project. Can someone help me with material which states which type of web apps each library rocks at?
Some of these tools are for different things.  Likely you will choose angular/backbone/ember as your front end framework in contrast to using something like JQuery.  I use angular and from what I can tell it has pretty broad reach a number of libraries for most anything you could want to do.  React is Facebooks method for JS on mobile and really belongs in a conversation with Titanium/Ionic (Google's answer and Angular focused). Underscore/Lodash on the other hand are a low level functional programming libraries.  They're pretty useful if you want to do a lot of JSON data manipulation.
