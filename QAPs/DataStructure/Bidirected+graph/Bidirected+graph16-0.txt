What is the difference between tree search and graph search?
In Graph Search you hold a list of explored nodes, while in Tree Search you don't! when you have undirected cycled graph,these two searches produce different outputs because in Graph Search you know which node has been explored(visited) and then you don't expand it, but in Tree Search you don't know and you expand it again.but this doesn't mean Tree Search is dumb because it doesn't hold such list.sometimes for example in games you have repeated states and you have to explore them again. You can see pseudo code of both graph and tree searches in page 4 and 5 of this pdf: https://courses.cs.washington.ed...
