Am I likely to get into Columbia law with a 3.6 GPA from a top university?
A 3.6 GPA is in the 25th percentile of those accepted to Columbia Law School, so you have a shot. The median is 3.72. Your LSAT score may be more important. The median LSAT is 172, with the 25th/75th percentiles at 170 and 175. http://web.law.columbia.edu/admi...
