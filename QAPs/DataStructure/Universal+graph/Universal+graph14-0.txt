I am a student in University. We now have a Graph Theory course, and I found it so hard to learn it well. Can you tell me how to learn it well in a correct way?
I would advise you to focus on the basic principles first, Learn the definitions, get a visual feel for them Work through the theorems, proofs. Build intuition for it. Understand the key idea behind a proof. Try to reconstruct a proof on your own. Solve exercise problems, write down the solution and check for mistakes Use a rigorous approach, don't solve problems/proofs in the air. It's very easy to get carried away in the wrong direction thinking that its promising or overlooking a mistake while solving stuff in air. Write stuff down, make sure every argument is concrete, precise and correct. If something seems obvious to you but isn't part of a definition or known theorems, then don't blindly use your intuition, prove it first before using it. Use intuition to get various ideas, but always rigorously test them using the formal methods. This advice should be applicable to any field of math for the most part.
