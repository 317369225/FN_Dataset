What is the best way to represent a Graph in Java?
Java is object oriented language so taking advantage of it, we can represent Vertex, Neighbour as inner classes. Neighbour can be implemented in the LinkedList style. The class Graph can have size to maintain the number of nodes. Inner class Vertex and inner class Neighbour. Then we need an array of Vertex 'V'. Vertex should have name of the vertex and an integer 'cost'. Neighbour should have int index, to represent the index as per the node in 'V' to which it corresponds to. Neighbour should also have a instance variable of type Neighbour 'next' to have the implementation of LinkedList. Next we need addNode() and addEdge() methods.
