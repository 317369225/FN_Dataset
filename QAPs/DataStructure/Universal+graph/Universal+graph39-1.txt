If the universal gravitational constant (G) is varying with respect to time, how can we rely on [math]F = G (M1 * M2)/R^2[/math] to calculate the gravity of other planets and exoplanets?
As you can observe from the plot provided as a part of this question, the magnitude of the gravitational constant varies by approximately 0.002 around its central value over the years (assuming the information you provided is true). Even though on the surface it might seem that this variation would produce a noticeable effect on the predictions made by the Newton's Law of Gravitation, the effect would be minute to make any significant difference on a macroscopic scale (except for really massive and dense objects, for which we don't use Newton's Law of Gravitation anyways!). For instance, we known that the average value of Earth's acceleration due to gravity is close to 9.8 m/s^2. Now if we take this variation into account, this value varies by only 0.003 m/s^2, which is insignificant except for precision calculations.
