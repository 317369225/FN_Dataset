Is this data no longer relevant?
I remember looking at those. As you suspect, they give an optimistic impression, and that's because of a few things: 1. They're old. Acceptance rates were higher in previous years. 2. The dots representing accepted students cover up those representing rejected and waitlisted students. For many top schools, red and yellow dots are found everywhere on the graph, even at a 4.0 GPA and a 2400 SAT score. I'd recommend you check out https://colleges.niche.com/ I use that site to find out a ton of information about colleges. Under the "Admissions" section of a school, you can see a more up to date graph in the same format. You can also choose to see only accepted students, only rejected students, etc. and see how your stats compare.
