Who are some of the best faculty in Thapar University?
As far as conversion rate from personal knowledge to a student's brain is concerned these are some of the Faculty I think have the best strike rates: 1) Ajay Kumar (CSED): he does take a lot of pain/time/examples to convey the his subject. Had the pure pleasure of studying Discrete Maths & Theory of Computation 2) Apurva Bakshi (Humantities): glib & classy. Knows marketing like anything. I would suggest CS students to take up Marketing Management in the finalÂ  year if he is taking that course. I promise you, you would end up learning something whose applications you see in the real world. Plus, if you have some common sense you get an easy A's. (Most of my batchmates, were positively astounded by his Question papers, which were all application & not the normal crap like Organisational Behavior) 3) Parteek Bhatia: again, takes a lot of effort for his subjects (DBMS) & sets some really good papers too. 4) Karamjit Cheema: she taught us Graph Theory & Compilers. Her first time in both the courses & was amazed how she won the respect of 150+ hooligans in GT, but even fundamentally, she was quite strong. I would suggest any junior reading these course that the above are some of the most approachable faculty Thapar University, and would really help you during your pre-final & final years, during which you have all the thoughts of what to do after college (at least I did)
