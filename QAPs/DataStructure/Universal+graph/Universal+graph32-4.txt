Computer Graphics: Are modern game engines threats to traditional renderers?
Currently, game engines in general do not have much overlap with traditional rendering packages and workflows as the requirements for both are different and complex, but the line between them is definitely becoming hazier day by day. Speaking in perspective of architectural rendereing (archviz) they (game engines) definitely are showing a lot of promise and advancement as compared to VFX pipelines. This might soon change though, seeing the new releases of Cryengine 4 and Cryengine Cinebox (beta). ￼ ￼ Also the work by French firm Enodo with Cryengine is also worth taking a look at as it shows the use of real time rendering engines for large scale urban planning projects. On a side note, real time archviz renderers such as Lumion, Artlantis etc. are advancing rapidly, offering quick, yet good quality renderers (in the right hands of course) within tight architectural deadlines which accounts for better design decisions though at the trade off for extreme photo-realism. I personally feel the question for choosing any rendering pipeline is that its a tradeoff between ''how good vs how fast'' though my answer is heavily slanted from an archviz point of view.
