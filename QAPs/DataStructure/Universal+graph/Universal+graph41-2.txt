Is this data no longer relevant?
Though this graph misses the other variables that affect admission, I think they are still informative. When I was in High School, our system automatically updated these charts, so it doesn't seem like there was much self-reporting bias, though I'm not sure where your data is coming from. If you think there is a bias in these statistics, then probably people who were denied tend to not report as much, and maybe people who were admitted tend to report more. In that case, the computed probability of being accepted is probably overstated. But keeping this bias in mind, I still think it's useful.
