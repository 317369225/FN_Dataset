Who are some of the best faculty in Thapar University?
Dr. Vinay Kumar Designation Assistant Professor Program Co-ordinator (Electronics and Computer Engineering)Currently, I am in 4th semester and Vinay sir teach me 'Circuit analysis and synthesis'. Just 4 lectures are left with him in this semester.Well till now, I would say I have not encountered any teacher of such personality. I enjoyed his each and every single lecture. This was the only lecture at the end of which I can say that yes I gained something. His teaching style is completely unique.This might sound awkward that he usually make us solve 2 to 3 questions only in each lecture.But we used to gain a lot from these question. how ? Because he use to write the question and then roam around the class, check that each and every student is solving and getting the concept, and if a student is not solving, then instead of scolding or ignoring him he personally tell him the concept behind the question.This way mostly all of the students got the concept clear. The irony is that though he made us solve only 2-3 questions per class still our syllabus was always a way ahead of other classes. Few Other teachers which I found Good are : D.S SirÂ  - Taught me Engineering drawing in 2nd semester. Vikas Sir - Taught me Optimization techniques in 3rd semester. Gurvinder Ma'am - Taught me communication skills in 2nd semester.
