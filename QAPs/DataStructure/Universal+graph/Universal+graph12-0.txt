Which universities (in US, UK, Canada, Australia, Europe) offer specialization coursesÂ  in Social Network Analysis and/or Graph Theory for MS?
I cannot find any specific programmes but I can find Computer Science programmes that have required courses in Graph Theory, but I have a feeling that's not what you want.
