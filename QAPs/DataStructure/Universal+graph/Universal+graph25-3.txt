I would like to implement Extended Kalman Filters for flight path predictions and create some graphs (obviously) to analyze the results. What would be a good choice to implement Extended Kalman filters: Matlab or R ? Note: I have the university license for Matlab, so cost is not an issue.
I only used Matlab once for a class project on modeling Feshbach resonances in F + H2.. This was circa 2007, and from what I remember Matlab wasn't too intuitive, or graphically beautiful. I've used ggplot2 in R and been able to create some really beautiful visualizations. You can also output results from R and ggplot2 into Tableau, which has an even nicer visualization capability.
