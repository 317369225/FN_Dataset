Keith Rabois said that "the better the Internet idea, the more difficult it is to sell it to others." Why and how is this true?
I've seen this a lot in consumer research. My rule of thumb is that if it's truly innovative, it will fail in focus group testing. Most people have a hard time grasping something new. If you were to put concepts such as Tivo, Facebook, etc. in front of consumers, they would've choked. It's even harder when it doesn't directly relate to their lives. For example, we tested social concepts and people would see pages that said "John Smith is going to Italy" "Rob is at Chilis". The universal answer was "who cares?" But when it is people you know, it becomes strangely compelling content. People can relate to incremental improvements, not revolutionary ones. That's why the classic elevator pitches are things like "Groupon for small businesses", "Facebook for cats", etc. If you can't sum up your idea like that, it will be harder to sell to customers, investors and media. Back in 2006, I tried convincing my company (a large Internet company with a large user base) to open up their social graph so any other company could use it. I couldn't convince anyone to do it. I still kick myself about that.
