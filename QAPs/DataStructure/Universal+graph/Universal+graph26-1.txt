What is social learning? How can social media, technology and innovation make the greatest positive impact on higher education?
Kelly Meeker's first link is interesting, What is the definition of "social learning" and how big is the market?, mainly because for me it puts the emphasise on the idea that the term has been hijacked as a marketing gimmick (this is not to say that the concept isn't grounded in sociological theories of knowledge like social constructivism and social constructionism I just think the real meaning of the term is in the process of being lost) Back to your other question: How can social media, technology and innovation make the greatest positive impact on higher education? I think this is the wrong way round, and the mistake most institutions make. It's not what social media can do for HE, but instead: How can higher education make the greatest positive impact using social media, and technology? Its a small difference but I think institutions are struggling to adapt or have the agility to use technology to amplify teaching, learning and research. It's also just not the process of learning in question here but the entire ecosystem the learner is a part of. For example, I recently posted about the concept of the 'invisible helpdesk' <http://mashe.hawksey.info/2011/0... >in which tools like Twitter can be used to tap in to 'what is happening' and provide targeted support. This is obviously not a new concept many businesses are already using this strategy, but are any institutions doing this?
