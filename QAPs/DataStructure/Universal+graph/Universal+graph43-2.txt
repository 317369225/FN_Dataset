Keith Rabois said that "the better the Internet idea, the more difficult it is to sell it to others." Why and how is this true?
This answer is incredibly short, but I've spent a long time thinking about similar questions dealing with innovation.  IMO, the easiest way to explain an internet idea is to use "It's X for Y" (http://itsthisforthat.com/ anyone?) Ideas that are truly innovative at the time usually aren't describable in that way.      There are no X's and Y's.  In more traditional industries, there would be something troubling about people always explaining their ideas as "X for Y" concepts, as it would imply that there's no true innovation.  But because the internet is in such infancy, simply piggybacking off another idea and pivoting it to another vertical or target segment is an incredibly easy way to make returns without the risk of introducing a new concept that's harder for people to wrap their minds around.
