Who are some of the best faculty in Thapar University?
Of all the teachers that I have come across so far at TU, I really liked two teachers: 1. Hitashi Lomash Department: Humanities Subject taught: Organizational Behaviour In my opinion, nobody at Thapar commands a class better than her especially if the class is an all-boys mechanical class.The way she taught was amazing. I didn't miss even a single lecture of hers. She made us love the subject. My only complaint is that the question papers weren't up to the mark. 2. Ajayinder Singh Jawndha Department: Mechanical Engg Subjects taught: Machine Drawing, CAD Either you love him or you hate him, you cannot simply deny the fact that he is one of the most knowledgable teachers on TU campus. We used to awe at his CAD skills. But he is a bit arrogant. Thats why he isn't popular among students. Updated 131w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
