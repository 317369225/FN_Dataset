CodeChef: I am in my third year of university now. What should be my strategy so that I am comfortable with solving problems of general topics such as graph problems, dynamic programming and other general problems which require some thinking and logic?
Practical usage of subjects is more important. First and foremost its never too late, its just the will that you need. Rather that studying lots of subjects, I would suggest to use them practically so that you not only your programming skills will get improved but also the design and aptitude skills will improve. Start picking small projects and start implementing them. Start using various design pattern while implementing those projects. I will also suggest to use websites like HackerRank. Write codes and optimize it so all cases succeed. Small projects could be like : 1. Command line tool to upload something to google drive using REST api. 2. Small utility to broadcast different mails to a set of friend from your mail using publisher subscriber pattern. 3. Donate to some open source projects. 4. Upload some small programs on git and write there links in resume. This type of projects also adds a lot of value addition in resume. The biggest thing which is to be understood is :      Companies recruit employees to work as part of some projects. And nothing matches practical knowledge. They do not need algorithm expert but they need employees who can apply all those skills. They really do not need to you to write quick sort all the time in O(nlogn) but use a sort utility to solve the problem in hand.
