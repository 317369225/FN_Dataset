How does Facebook Graph Search technically work?
It has multiple layers, I can talk a little about putting together what's already public knowledge if you've seen graph search in action. The first is a layer which which suggests a well formed query for your natural language input, for example one of the suggestions for "friends living in new york from carnegie mellon" is the well formed query "My friends who live in New York and went to Carnegie Mellon University" This is then converted to the following expression in the URL: https://www.facebook.com/search/... ... and is retrieved using Unicorn posting lists (Inverted index) and then ranked using one of many ranking models depending on your query taking privacy into account. It's very similar to traditional search engines on the infrastructure side but a lot of extra work went into indexing a complex social graph, generating the assisted grammar and being privacy aware. For more on Unicorn, which is much closer to a traditional search index than crawling a graph in real time see Tudor Bosman's answer to Graph Databases: What exactly is Facebook Unicorn?
