If the universal gravitational constant (G) is varying with respect to time, how can we rely on [math]F = G (M1 * M2)/R^2[/math] to calculate the gravity of other planets and exoplanets?
If the constant G does vary with time, it does so only over extremely long periods, in the billions of years. The only planets we can observe are within hundreds of light years, practically right on top of us. Another thing to note is that the graph indicates a variance on the order of parts-per-thousand. Estimates of planet mass are far coarser than that, in the range of the single digits. Even if the graph were relevant, it wouldn't affect our estimates of exoplanet mass. And the graph isn't relevant, because it's not about gravity, but about the measurement of gravity. Nobody expects that gravity, even to within parts-per-thousand, on the planet Earth. The origin of the variation is uncertain, but the news story from which you got the graph has a suggested explanation, a slight wobble in the earth's rotation closely corresponding to the period in the graph. It's not clear that that's the full explanation, since the wobble in the orbit is considerably smaller than the variation in the gravity measurements, but it's intriguing. Why do measurements of the gravitational constant vary so much?
