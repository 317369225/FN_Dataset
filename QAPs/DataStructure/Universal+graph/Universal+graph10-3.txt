Based on the theories of relativity including gravity and time dilation, what would a graph of the "speed of time" look like over the life of the universe relative to our speed of time today?
The speed of time is always constant This is because time is defined in relaticity and quantum mechanics and all of physics as the output of your clock ( youÂ  being the observer) So in any frame of reference, the speed of time would be the rate of change of time which is ( change in time ) / ( Chang in time ) which is always one Different observers can find your clock changing faster or slower but the entire general relativity shows that you being in one frame of reference will never know if your clock changes faster or slower because of the definition. You would have to change your frames of reference to know the speed of the other clock in which case you switch the clocks. So without changing clocks you never know the speed of time and hence the premise is that it's one.
