Am I likely to get into Columbia law with a 3.6 GPA from a top university?
Glancing at the charts at Columbia University - Admissions Graph, it looks like 3.6s have a good shot at getting in there with LSATs in the mid- to upper-170s (or URM status, of course). The quality of your undergrad program surely matters somewhat, although I've anecdotally that law schools don't pay much attention to the level of grade inflation at different schools. That is to say, your raw GPA matters more than your class standing. FWIW, I got into NYU with something like a 3.5 from a top liberal arts college, upper-170s LSAT, and several years of post-grad experiences.
