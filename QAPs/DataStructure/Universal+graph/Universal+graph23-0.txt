If there the universe is infinite and there are in fact infinite numbers of identical earths with an identical me, would I have the same natal chart?
The universe is not infinite and there are not an infinite number of Earths and, even if there were an infinite number of Earths, it would not follow that there was an identical you. In addition, any other Earth would necessarily be in a different position in the sky and thus not completely identical.
