Is the universe a directed acyclic graph?
Depends on what you are modelling. If you are modelling the multi-scale physics of the universe, or some portion of it, using an expansion of a graph model to map the physics, then the answer is no, as nature often includes feedback effects that are cyclical. However, if you are modelling the multi-scale physics, causality and semantics of some design optimisation problems, then the answer may be yes, as many of these problems are just intricately structured (complicated) and can be modelled without feedback loops, using Russian doll encapsulation.
