I would like to implement Extended Kalman Filters for flight path predictions and create some graphs (obviously) to analyze the results. What would be a good choice to implement Extended Kalman filters: Matlab or R ? Note: I have the university license for Matlab, so cost is not an issue.
Matlab or Python. Or Julia if you feel like it. But the biggest consideration would be - at which you are most comfortable. If you are not experienced in any, choose Matlab for the IDE, debugger and help. Pro tip - consider having an hypothesis for a straight line and another for a turn (parabolic) for the xy plane.
