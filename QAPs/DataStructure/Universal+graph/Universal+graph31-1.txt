What were Quora's best answers of 2014?
I answered a question from a guy looking for career advice.  I answered really directly stating he should improve his writing to get ahead at work.  He actually took the time to find my personal email and send me a message asking how he could improve his writing.  I gave him three tips and encouraged him to rewrite the question.  He did and it was just about a million times better. That whole process intrigues me to no end.  I've documented the exchange in pics below, in case you're interested. Nat http://natdevo.com *Yes, I see my writing error!
