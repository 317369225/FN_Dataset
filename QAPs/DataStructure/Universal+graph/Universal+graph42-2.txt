How does Facebook Graph Search technically work?
In general, the way graph databases work is that you use some index to find a starting point, called a "node." Once you have a starting point, you "traverse" (a.k.a. query) the graph node by node by traveling across "relationships" (or the lack thereof). Designing for a graph database is all about turning your data into nodes and relationships. Typically, the nouns (i.e. "me") are nodes and the verbs (e.g. "like") are relationships. For Facebook Graph that starting point is often your account, every item in the Graph is a node, and your actions (like, share, etc.) are relationships between you and those nodes. Taking an example similiar to the one offered by Rabimba Karanjai, to find a list of possible new restaurants to reccomended you'd traverse all your friend relationships to find restaurants they like and then take the intersection between 1) the sets of nodes connected to your friends via a "like" relationship and 2) the set of restaurants that you yourself have not yet "liked" The 1) set works something like this: me (node) -> IS_FRIEND_OF (relationship) -> someone else (node)Â  -> WHO_LIKES (relationship) -> some restaurant (node) And the 2) set takes each "some resteraunt" as a new starting point and then does something like this: some restaurant (node) -> has no WHO_LIKES (relationship) -> me (node)
