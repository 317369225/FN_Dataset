Can I have the list/chart of Internet speeds (approximate) in different famous private universities in India?
I don't see a list of internet speed for all of the famous universities in India. I came across these information on Quora. IIT appears to have the best internet speed. What is the fastest Internet speed in India? What are the Internet speeds at the various IITs?
