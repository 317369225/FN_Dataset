Where can I get data for the observable universe to obtain a radius/time graph (i.e. a data table of its radius at certain time periods)?
In standard cosmology, the differential equation for the scale factor of the universe (which you can think of as its radius) is the Friedmann equation: [math]\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = H_0^2 (\Omega_m a^{-3} +\Omega_r a^{-4} + \Omega_\Lambda)[/math] where [math]\Omega_m, \Omega_r, \Omega_\Lambda[/math] are respectively the dark matter, radiation and dark energy densities in the universe, and H0 is the Hubble constant. Solve this differential equation for a(t) and you will get the curve you want. I used WMAP observation values for the constants: [math] \Omega_m = 0.27, \Omega_r =0.0000824, \Omega_\Lambda=0.73, H_0=0.07261095 (\mathrm{billion\;\;years})^{-1}[/math] The curve I obtain is the following (choosing log scale as you did in your picture). I also plotted the equivalent curves for a radiation-dominated and matter-dominated universe for comparison, but the curve you want is the red one.
