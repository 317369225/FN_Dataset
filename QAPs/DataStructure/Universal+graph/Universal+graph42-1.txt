How does Facebook Graph Search technically work?
Disclaimer First: This answer will be mostly based on my understanding of the graph searching mechanism, instead of a specialized Facebook one since I don't know much about that. Now to the answer: Graphs are inherently visual. It’s not so difficult to understand how the technology works, even if you’re not that technical. Let’s take one of Facebook’s example Graph Search queries, which is to find all of the New York sushi restaurants that my friends like. Getting the answer is a very simple matter for a graph database. You just need to formulate the question in a way that the database understands. Those who are more technically inclined can see an example below for the query that answers the question: “find New York sushi restaurants that my friends like”: START philip=node:person(name = 'Philip'),city=node:location(name='New York') MATCH (philip)-[:IS_FRIEND_OF]->(friend)-[:LIKES]->(restaurant)-[:LOCATED_IN]->city WHERE restaurant.cuisine = "sushi" RETURN http://restaurant.name Query Example: “Find New York Sushi Restaurants that my friends like” Thinking in graphs is natural, and contagious. The more you think in terms of connections, the more you realize that graphs are the way that we implicitly think. What is a decision tree, for example, but a graph of possibilities? The more you look, the more you start to notice that graphs are, in fact, everywhere. Graph database users regularly use queries like the one above to answer questions, and the more you ask, the more you think of new questions that never occurred to you to ask previously. Graph queries can get quite elaborate, and it’s entirely possible to run queries that scan across a social network that is two, three, or more levels of friends removed.
