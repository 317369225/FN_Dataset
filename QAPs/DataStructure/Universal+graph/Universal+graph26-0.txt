What is social learning? How can social media, technology and innovation make the greatest positive impact on higher education?
First, let me point you to relevant discussion for this question in these questions: What is the definition of "social learning" and how big is the market? Can specialized social networks replace Learning Management Systems in colleges and universities? Broadly speaking, social learning is knowledge acquisition that occurs in communication between people: the act of communicating with peers, colleagues and the larger world to seek information. Incorporating social learning practices in school environments can help students make progress more efficiently. Social learning does not require social media, but it can be accelerated with the use of social media. Social media tools are technologies that enable communication andÂ  create connections between people. Social media can enable social learning and make it even more powerful by capturing, recording and organizing information exchange and learning that occurs between people. Salman Khan of the Khan Academy has proposed a new educational model for elementary and high schools to leverage the benefits of social learning. He suggests that students should access videos and elearning resources at home to be introduced to new concepts, and then do "homework" at school - to work collaboratively, with the teacher and their peers, to implement their new skills. Social media networks can also offer new ways for learners to access information and get advice and guidance informally.
