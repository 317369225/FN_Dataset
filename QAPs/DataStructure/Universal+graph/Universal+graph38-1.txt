Am I likely to get into Columbia law with a 3.6 GPA from a top university?
You'll be competitive with a high enough LSAT.  Different schools prioritize the LSAT and GPA differently.  Columbia and NYU have traditionally been more focused on LSAT than other top schools.  In addition, both your school and your major are taken into account (STEM will give you a bit of a boost, EE especially).
