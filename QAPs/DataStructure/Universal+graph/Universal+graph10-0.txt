Based on the theories of relativity including gravity and time dilation, what would a graph of the "speed of time" look like over the life of the universe relative to our speed of time today?
The standard view is that as the universe expands it dies a heat death.  Considering this question we get a different answer as well as insight into what we call dark mater and energy.  The change in the relative speed of time, or equivalently light speed balances the expansion such that the universe appears almost the same consistently over time to the inhabitants of that time. Since matter slows time given a nearly constant amount of matter time speeds up relatively as the universe expands. Just as the speed of light is always constant locally so is the speed of time.  No matter how fast or slow your time is relative to someone else light will always take one nanosecond to pass your ruler. If your clock is slow relatively, it follows that your light is also slow relatively. As the universe expands, timespace expands, and the mass density decreases relatively, and thus time and light speed is faster relatively, but it would not be noticed locally because light still passes a ruler in one nanosecond. With this understanding dark matter and energy can be understood as the nonuniformity in this expansion, slower near galactic centers where mass is concentrated we call that effect dark matter, and faster in deep space where we call the effect dark energy. In quantum mechanics there is no time, everything is timeless. The speed of time is in effect infinite.  Except for matter slowing time, we could expect there would be no time. Matter manifests time by exhibiting an immutable local ordering of events (t=h/e) distinguishing our world from all possible worlds.
