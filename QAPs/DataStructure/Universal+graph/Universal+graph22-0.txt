Why is University of British Columbia so well known in academic circles for its excellence, yet comparatively lower on ranking charts?
Ranking charts are misleading as they include a lot of factors not necessarily related to quality of research. For example, the overall staff - student ratio, number of student clubs, athletic standings, endowment fund (probably why Harvard gets ranked so highly), graduation rate, avg. length of bachelor students to completion.
