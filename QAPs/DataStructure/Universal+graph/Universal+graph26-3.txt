What is social learning? How can social media, technology and innovation make the greatest positive impact on higher education?
I recently put together an infographic based on a survey by Pearson and the Babson Survey Research Group that details ways college professors are using social media to teach. As it turns out, more than 80% of professors are using social media for some aspect of teaching. (For more stats about how professors use social media, check out the infographic here: http://www.schools.com/visuals/c...) The interesting thing, to me, is how many different ways these social tools can be used. For example, one lecturer at UT Dallas uses Twitter during her lectures as a way to pull less vocal students into the discussion. A San Diego State professor of literature has her students create a wiki based on an obscure 18th century novel. A Stanford professor taught a class on the Psychology of Facebook, during which he required all of his students to create Facebook applications and then persuade more than 16 million people to install them. (For a cool slideshow of how professors are using these tools, check this out: http://www.schools.com/articles/...) In general, I think social media is capable of being a very powerful educational tool, but there is no one way to use it. It's up to the individual professor to figure out how to adapt social tools to his/her own classroom.
