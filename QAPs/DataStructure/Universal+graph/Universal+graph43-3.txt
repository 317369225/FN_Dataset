Keith Rabois said that "the better the Internet idea, the more difficult it is to sell it to others." Why and how is this true?
Great Internet ideas are usually revolutionary and aim to change the way people do things rather than improve on existing ways. And change is always a difficult sell. Using the Crossing the Chasm framework by Geoffrey Moore: the larger the technology chasm, the more interesting the idea, but also the more difficult it is to cross from early adopters to early majority users where the money lies. Although dated, this is probably still one of the must-reads for any technology marketer/PM/CEO.
