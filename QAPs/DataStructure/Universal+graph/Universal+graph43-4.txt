Keith Rabois said that "the better the Internet idea, the more difficult it is to sell it to others." Why and how is this true?
The answer to Keith's question depends on the definition of "others". Many entrepreneurs who hear NO will console themselves by saying "he just doesn't get it!". They then stubbornly move to the next meeting, without thorough self reflection. I think the hard part is determining whose opinion/approval matters and whose doesn't. Returning to a Wall Street framework: the innovators, imitators, and idiots - we see similar cycles in technology.  Some people who are either well placed or incredibly thoughtful are able to see the trends shaping the future for a specific segment. This group are other visionaries & insiders that I call the enlightened. - If the "visionary" is alone in his vision, then he is hallucinating. - If this "visionary" can convince other visionaries or insiders, then he's on to something - If that something can cross over to imitators, then he's got a business - If that something can cross to idiots, then he's got an awesome business. Even if said entrepreneur can convince others to his vision, there is still uncertainty that the trend in question will cross over into imitators & idiots. No matter how charismatic or powerful the entrepreneur, he cannot affect the crossover.  The best he can do is identify the waves, position himself accordingly, build contingencies, and then pray. So in my view, the entrepreneur NEEDS to find that small segment of enlightened people or innovators/insiders to believe in him.  Too often, the entrepreneur spends time with investors passing as innovators but who are really imitators.  It's easy to get confused because said person has a big title, resume, sexy portfolio, or gave a great keynote.
