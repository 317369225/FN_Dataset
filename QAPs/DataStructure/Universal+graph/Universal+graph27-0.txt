How do I get into Harvard Law School?
Get good undergraduate grades, and do well on the LSAT. There's not more to it. Depending on how good your grades are, you can get away with a slightly worse LSAT score, or vice-versa. If you are an under-represented minority, you may get somewhat of an admissions boost. Certain other "soft factors", like great work experience, or having been exceptional in some way before law school, may also be factors, but LSAT and undergraduate GPA are the dominant factors. See below for admissions information for the 2013-2014 application cycle. The blue line represents, roughly, the admissions cut-off - to get into HLS, you need your LSAT x GPA to be above that line.
