How do I get into Harvard Law School?
You give no information about yourself, so I'm assuming you're legally classified as Caucasian or Asian, ad not disabled. You need: A bachelor's degree, preferably from a well-known school, wth a GPA above 3.5 (absolute minimum, preferably in the 3.8 range or better. An LSAT score in the 98th or 99th percentile (170 or more). Three recommednations, usually two academic and one from an activity, all saying that you're at least the top studnt of the year. Participation in 5 to 7 activities with a leadership position of a schol-wide status or higher, or national ranking in a sport or club (like debate). An interesting essay, with not a single error. Serendipity (luck): Serendipity! by Loretta B DeLoggio on Law School Admissions
