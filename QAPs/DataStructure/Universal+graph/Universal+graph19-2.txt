CodeChef: I am in my third year of university now. What should be my strategy so that I am comfortable with solving problems of general topics such as graph problems, dynamic programming and other general problems which require some thinking and logic?
One thing that you can simply do is by searching problems with tag on codeforces and then solve around twenty problems  from each categories like dp,graphs ,number theory and so  on and keep practicing. Once you have done this repeat in the same way and solve another  twenty dp problems ,graphs problems  and in orderto learn some new concept ,solve problems from codechef or spoj.
