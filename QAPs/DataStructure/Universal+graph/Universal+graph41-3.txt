Could you please provide your source? As a general note, self report is hard to base any decisions off of. For example, if someone has high scores and high GPA, he or she would be happy to share. The other extreme is happy to report as well, low scores and low GPA since they are happy to have gotten into the school. I think the best conclusion I would draw from these graphs is that admissions is not the same as it was 10 years ago or even 5 years ago. Back then, if you had good test scores and a good GPA, you were set. Now, there's an X factor that dictates a large part of admissions. That is what I like to call the uniqueness factor. Schools want diversity and diversity of talent. Thus, it makes sense to admit someone with less than perfect statistics in the hopes of promoting talent diversity. Michigan and Georgia Tech are great schools, but are not in the Top 20 tier where scores are 2200+ and GPAs are super high (3.6+). Solid test scores, a good GPA, good recommendations and modest extracurriculars should gain you admission. Good luck!
