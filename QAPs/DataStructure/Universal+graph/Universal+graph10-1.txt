Based on the theories of relativity including gravity and time dilation, what would a graph of the "speed of time" look like over the life of the universe relative to our speed of time today?
Think of time as a bread in a whole. When you slice the bread in parallel to edges then that time is called "NOW" slice. But sometimes the "Now" slice isn't seem to be parallel with edges, instead it appears to deflect with some angle. Which alters the "Speed of time" called time dilation. We can only cut the slice horizontally not vertically. Hence. the time only moves in one dimension. We therefore, cannot relate the time from "Past" cut slice to "Now" cut slice. "Speed of light is constant from it own relative point" I am adding a picture for you to understand. TIME SLICE A1 and A2 can be related.Â  B1 and B2 also can be related on property ""Speed of time". While Any of A to B or B to A cannot be related on property "Speed of time". It is moving along a single dimension. Just like as if you are watching a movie frame by frame.
