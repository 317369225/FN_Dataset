Who are some of the best faculty in Thapar University?
While Pranjal Bhatia's answer has already listed the four teachers whom I also consider among the best, I'll like to add 2 more names to the list from CSED The first four 1) Ajay Kumar 2) Apurva Bakshi 3) Parteek Bhatia 4) Karamjit Cheema 5) Dr. Shalini Batra: She is one of those teachers who are always up to date with things going on in research. It was always so much fun and informative to talk to her on any topic whatsoever. I remember her saying this once, "Bache un teachreon ko yaad ni rakhte jisne A diya tha, bache unhe yaad rakhte hai jinhone acha padhaya tha", and this question did remind me of her :) 6) Dr. Maninder Singh: Our batch was unlucky in this regard as we were never taught by Maninder Sir. But anyone who has met him even once will judge him as a humble, down to earth person with such immense knowledge of his field. Plus he saved many of us from getting an F from time to time, which makes him the best.. ;) Updated 136w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
