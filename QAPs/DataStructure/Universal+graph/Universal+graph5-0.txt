What are some classic papers on graph theory?
In my opinion, ones like these: Edmonds, Jack: Blossoms, trees and flowers (1965) (maximum matching algorithm) Hopcroft, John and Robert E. Tarjan: Efficient planarity testing (1974) (linear time planarity testing and kuratowski subgraph location) Appel, Kenneth and Wolfgang Haken: "Solution of the Four Color Map Problem" (October 1977) (first example of a computerized proof) Graham, Ronald L. and Bruce L. Rothschild:  "Ramsey's Theorem for n-Parameter Sets" (1971) (solution to one of the most famous problems in Ramsey theory involving one of the biggest numbers ever seen in a proof) Rado, Richard: "Universal graphs and universal functions"  (1964) (a modern description of the infinite graph, though Ackermann described it somewhat earlier) Dijkstra, Edsger W.: "A note on two problems in connexion with graphs" (1959) (Dijkstra's algorithm) Ford, Lester R. and Delbert R. Fulkerson: "Maximal flow through a network" (1956) (Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm) Aldous, David J.: The random walk construction of uniform spanning trees and uniform labelled trees. (1990) (a very simple algorithm for uniform spanning tree-also see wilson's algorithm for a faster algorithm created 6 years later) (There's some good approximation algorithm papers too, but I can't pick a "most classic" example, so I'll leave it to others.)
