Based on the theories of relativity including gravity and time dilation, what would a graph of the "speed of time" look like over the life of the universe relative to our speed of time today?
Time hasnt really been affected by the expansion of the universe On the cosmological scale (i.e. when you look at the universe as a whole) space is the same pretty much everywhere, and in every direction: it is a big empty place with a little bit of dust floating around (be that debris, nebulae, or galaxies; its all the same on the biggest scales), a little bit of long-wavelength light (in the CMBR) and a little bit of vacuum energy (i.e. dark energy). The gravitational field solution for this matter distribution is called the FLRW solution. It describes time behaving in the same way as in special relativity for all time (and obviously in all places) but the universe expanding (or contracting) uniformly over time. So the speed of time isnt really affected.
