Computer Graphics: Are modern game engines threats to traditional renderers?
It's unlikely that the game engines themselves will ever replace offline rendering; they're fundamentally optimized for different things.  If we take a movie frame from 10 years ago, and we can now render that in real time, it doesn't mean that we're done, it just means that today's movies can have considerably more complexity. What is happening, however, is that the same computational power that makes game engines like UE4 so impressive can also be harnessed to accelerate offline rendering processes, so we should start to see significant leaps in offline production rendering performance as more photorealistic renderers begin to be built to run on GPUs.  This is already happening. In realistic rendering, more performance doesn't mean real-time.  It means that you can handle more complex scenes, lighting, animation, or material models in your traditional time budget.  One of the biggest advances in the last 10 years or so has been the ability to do high quality preview renderings at near-interactive rates; this gives designers and artists a much better idea of how the final scene will look so they can tweak parameters until the scene will look just so.
