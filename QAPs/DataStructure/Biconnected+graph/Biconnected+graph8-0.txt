What is the easiest way to prove that every connected graph with three or more vertices has at least two vertices which are not cut-vertices?
The biconnected components of the graph form a tree called block tree. If the block tree has a single vertex, the graph forms a single biconnected comonent and all vertices are non-cut vertices, and we are done. So let us consider the case when the block tree has more than one vertex. Then it has at least two leaves. If a leaf component consists of a single vertex, it is a leaf in the original graph as well and is thus not a cut vertex. On the other hand, if the leaf in the block tree has more than one vertex, that biconnected component will have at least one non-cut vertex (since the leaf component can have only one cut vertex). Thus the two leaf vertices give rise to at least two non-cut vertices. Updated 7 May 2014 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
