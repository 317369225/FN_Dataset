What's a complete list of topics/a complete syllabus to fully learn computer programming from scratch?
You need to start coding first. I recommend Java over Python as a first language. You can even experiment with something simpler, like GW-BASIC. Do not distract yourself with real-world applications for now. Before algorithms, you need data structures. After algorithms, you may want to understand the principle of programing languages. In particular, you need a good grasp of various programming paradigms and concepts: imperative, OOP, functional, meta-programming. Then, learn 2-3 languages, perhaps Python, C++, and Clojure. You don't have to be good at all of them, but you need to be proficient in at least one primary coding language. I recommend Java or C++.
