Is there a linear time algorithm that checks if an edge in a directed graph is a bridge (cut-edge)?As Tarjan's algorithm seems to be for undirected graphs, I am wondering whether there is some way I could modify Tarjan's algorithm to work for a directed graph, or is there any other linear time algorithm ?
A cut-edge in a directed graph will never be a member of a strongly connected component. If there is an edge from node a to b and there is a path from b to a, then this edge is not a bridge. So this should work: Find SCCs of a directed graph linearly (using Tarjan's or Kosaraju's algorithm). For an edge between node a to b, if a and b are members of different SCCs, it is a cut-edge.
