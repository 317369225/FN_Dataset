Is there a linear time algorithm that checks if an edge in a directed graph is a bridge (cut-edge)?As Tarjan's algorithm seems to be for undirected graphs, I am wondering whether there is some way I could modify Tarjan's algorithm to work for a directed graph, or is there any other linear time algorithm ?
There is a linear time algorithm based on a Depth First Search to find articulation points (cut-vertices) and bridges (cut-edges). See Biconnected component and Bridge (graph theory).
