How much of machine learning must one know to understand and go through the new course of Deep learning offered by Google at Udacity?
It is important to know what is supervised learning and a basic supervised classification algorithm such as nearest neighbour method. You should know what an input datsaset is, what an output dataset means and in general what a loss function is used for. Linear algebra knowledge of working with matrices helps and a basic knowledge of how to differentiate a function also helps.
