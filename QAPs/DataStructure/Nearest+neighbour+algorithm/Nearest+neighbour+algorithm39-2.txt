What is Euclidean distance in terms of machine learning?
Euclidean distance is not a term specific to machine learning. It is a fancy name for the distance formula that you learned in high school, but it can be generalized to n-dimensional spaces. If [math]\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^n[/math], then [math]D(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i-q_i)^2}[/math] In terms of the Euclidean distance's use in machine learning, it could be used to measure the "similarity" between two vectors (though you should normalize the data first). The farther away two vectors are, the less similar. Beware, though - this measure of similarity may not to do well in high dimensions. Consider cosine similarity as a possible alternative.
