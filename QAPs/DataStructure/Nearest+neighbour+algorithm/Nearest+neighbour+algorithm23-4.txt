All these Machine learning algorithms, what is the point?  It seems like choice of machine learning algorithm, decision tree, neural net, svm, isn't nearly important as the feature selection and feature extraction process which determines what goes in to it, garbage in garbage out, that sort of thing.
this is true up to a point. there is no substitute for really understanding how the different algorithms work, and what their limitations are, and how to get around them.  that only comes with a thorough understanding of the underlying theory as well as good data analysis skills. there are certain applications that do require more sophisticated models, as pointed out elsewhere.  the reality of applied machine learning is indeed that resources are better spent on accumulating more data, engineering features, and developing robust pipelines until there is very compelling evidence that a custom-tailored approach is necessary. many academics who make the transition to non-research applications in industry take a long time to realize that deploying an approach of the kind you would write about in a NIPS paper is not the right choice most of the time.
