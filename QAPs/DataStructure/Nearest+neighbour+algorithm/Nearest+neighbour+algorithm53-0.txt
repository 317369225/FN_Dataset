What are the ways to make a program/code an efficient one?
Many great answers here. Only one thing I can add. Because processors have on memory code and data caches now that operate at the same clock speed as the CPU, making sure the routines your code uses the most is as small as possible as is the data it accesses often can get the entire set of code and data in the L1 cache of the CPU. This is extremely fast. But as many have said it still has to be a good algorithm. Even so, sometimes a bad algorithm running entirely in the L1 can still beat a good one that accesses a lot of memory. L1 caches on modern processors are about 64-128K. Beyond that is the on-chip L2 cache and L3-cache (often on CPU as well - see the below picture of the amount of caches on an AMD Bulldozer series CPU) So often smaller is better. With gcc you can optimize a whole program for size using (-Os). Most people compile the Linux kernel that way now.
