Which is your favorite computer vision algorithm and why?
HOG features + linear SVMs are quite powerful for object detection thus they are my favorite.  Also, these techniques are quite easy to use and there are a few places where you can get code to start building object detection systems.  There are lots of variants of this approach: Part-based HOG+SVM: http://www.cs.brown.edu/~pff/lat...
