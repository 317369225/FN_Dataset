Why is dimensionality reduction useful?
Even random linear projection can be a useful way to reduce dimensionality without losing critical information. SimPoint[1] uses random projection prior to running k-means clustering, yielding a huge speed boost. With the time savings, SimPoint can perform multiple runs with different random projections and keep the results yielding the tighest clustering. The results compare favorably to full-scale k-means clustering at a fraction of the computational cost. [1] http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~calder/s...
