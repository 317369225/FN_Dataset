Which is your favorite computer vision algorithm and why?
Quite basically I would definitely quote the Hough transform algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hou...) which in its most basic form is designed to detect simple shapes (e.g. lines). I like the fact that it operates within a different space - here the parameter space, as it is the case for many "smart" signal processing techniques with time vs frequency domains (e.g. discrete cosine transform and its application to lossy compression). In addition to the Wikipedia entry, this recent blog post contains interesting pointers and videos on this topic (http://notes.gordonbailey.net/po...).
