What algorithm should I use to implement a recommendation engine using PHP/MYSQL?
Algorithms are not specific to any language or database. The most popular ones used in collaborative filtering are K-Nearest Neighbour, Singular Vector Decomposition and Alternating Least Squares. Not too many implementations of these exist in PHP. Nor is PHP is a good language for machine learning. If you are looking to develop your own implementation of these algorithms, C++, Python or Java would be much better. More likely, you want an existing implementation that you can integrate into your PHP/MYSQL application. You are better off building a separate recommendation engine and using web services to push data and retrieve recommendations. You have a few options: Easyrec. This only has a Slope One plugin for collaborative filtering. But you could develop plugins for other models.This is not very scalable. Myrrix. Developed by Sean Owen, creator of the recommendation algorithms in Mahout. Implements the ALS algorithm. Highly scalable in volume, but limited in terms of algorithms you can use. Prediction.io. Looks interesting, but not really sure of the pros and cons. Directly use a standalone instance of Mahout. This is the most challenging technically, but also offers you the maximum flexibility.
