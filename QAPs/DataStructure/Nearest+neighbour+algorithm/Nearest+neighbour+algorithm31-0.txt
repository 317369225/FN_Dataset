Can you suggest good resources to study anomaly detection algorithms?
There is this short book on anomaly detection, which exposes you to various types of method. A New Look at Anomaly Detection . You can download an e-copy of it. This survey paper on anomaly detection has 2600+ citations and worth reading http://cucis.ece.northwestern.ed... In my masters thesis, I proposed a generalized JK nearest neighbour one-class classifier to identify anomalies. The thesis is available here https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~s255kha...Â  . You will find a lot of other nearest neighbour outlier detection methods in the literature survey in Chapter 4 and Section 4.3.
