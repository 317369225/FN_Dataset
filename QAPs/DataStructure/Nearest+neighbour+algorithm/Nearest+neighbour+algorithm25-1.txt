What are some modern day applications of classification in data mining?
Well Quora itself is an example of application that uses classification algorithms.  It classifies text mainly I guess. For example they classify text in order to recognize good or pertinent answers automatically. The same approach can be used to classify user profiles and generate tailored feeds automaticaly for a certain user starting from his interests. A simple classification method is Naive Bayesian clasification that uses conditional probability.  I think it is used for recognizing  spam emails and automaticaly discarding it in the spam box. Also K-nearest-neighbour is another algorithm used to classify new entries based on their features. Clustering algorithms can also be used to classify documents based on their content. One of the most famous is K-means. LDA method is also a way for classifying text from a semantic point of view. All those clasifiers are first trained with labeled data. It means that they Learn from the labeled data how to do their task. Fitness wrist bands such as fitbit ones are trained to recognize users activity such as walking, cycling, running or sleeping. This way they can measure and report activities with great precisione.
