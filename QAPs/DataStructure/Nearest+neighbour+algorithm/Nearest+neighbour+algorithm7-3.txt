Which is your favorite computer vision algorithm and why?
That may surprise you but I do not really "like" current CV algorithms! Compared to other fields those that work well feel "brutal" (local information + statistical stuff...), and those that try to do more interesting things like emulating how human sight works do not work. If I had to chose one, I would go low level and say that it is the Approximate Nearest Neighbour algorithm based on KD-Forests used in the FastANN library (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/...). I have implemented a slightly different version and I have to admit it has a few interesting twists.
