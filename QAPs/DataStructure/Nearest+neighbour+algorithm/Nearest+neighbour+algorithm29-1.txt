What are some good problems for practicing the branch-and-bound technique?
Branch and Bound Algorithms can be used to solve a variety of questions seeking optimization. You can use branch and bound for a number of NP-Hard problems: Integer Programming Nearest Neighbour Search Knapsack Problem Bin Packing Job Assignment Problem MAX-SAT Problem and many others. Branch and Bound Heuristics are also used in solving game trees like Sudoku, Tic Tac Toe. If you want to practise Branch and Bound, I recommend you read the problems really well at first, the problems require complete understanding before you can figure how to use Branch and Bound to solve them. Good Luck!!
