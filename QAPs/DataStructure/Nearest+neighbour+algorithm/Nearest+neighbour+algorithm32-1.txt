What is the best machine learning algorithm for regression?
Thank you for the A2A. I usually don't reply when I believe theÂ  best answer is there but I'm opening an exception. The best answer I've read in this thread so far is by Giuliano Janson. I could not agree more with this: Part of your job is to figure out what the best algorithm is for the regression problem you're trying to model. I'll take it a little further and say that if you are doing predictive modelling answering those questions is your job. Picking the models, feature engineering, working out the way to have your model achieving whatever you want it to achieve. It's not that people are not helpful. Quite the opposite. The issue is that without actually doing the work it is not possible to answer the question. It is an iterative process of analysing, fitting, measuring, etc. That will answer your question. Everything else is wishful thinking. Good luck!
