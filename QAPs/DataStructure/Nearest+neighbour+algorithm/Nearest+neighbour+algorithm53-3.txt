What are the ways to make a program/code an efficient one?
* Unit test Run it in isolated mode to isolate bugs and understand it better. * Annotate Comment your code thoroughly - this will help you understand your code better and also help debug. * Investigate Find faster and more efficient ways to accomplish repetitive tasks better. * Explain the problem to the duck Ask the duck, acknowledge the duck and thank the duck: Rubber duck debugging * Build your own routines Create code snippets that are re-usable for handling similar problems. These will prove invaluable in the future. * And pray Pray before you start coding that you won't make the same mistakes that you did yesterday and that your memory will finally start working "normally" and somehow that the code that you write just runs, baby it just runs.
