What is meant by 'nearest neighbour search' in computer graphics? What is it used for?
Nearest neighbour or k-nearesr neighbour is an algorithm used for clustering a set of points in different sets. This algorithm is used is prominently used in computer vision and machine Learning for classification purposes . The algorithm is basically used in the following sense: Suppose in an area there lives two tribes A and B . Now a person is new and do not know his tribe. Now to know his tribe he takes k nears neighbours(based on Manhattan distance or some other criteria) and takes a majority vote among them,if majority vote is in favour of a his tribe is A else B. Hope that helps.
