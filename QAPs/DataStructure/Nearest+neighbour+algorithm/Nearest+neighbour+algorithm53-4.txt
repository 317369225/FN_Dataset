What are the ways to make a program/code an efficient one?
Before you optimize your code, you should first make sure that your program is correct, correction is more important than optimization IMO. "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.         - Donald E. Knuth 1. Think about a better algorithm to solve the problem, O(nlogn) is much much better than O(n^2) algorithm on large size of data. 2. If you can not find a better algorithm to do it, do what as Kendall Meade said, use a profiler to test the program, and see which part of the program is time consuming, and do optimization on that part.
