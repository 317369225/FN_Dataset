What is Euclidean distance in terms of machine learning?
If you have a result that you want to classify and determine which previous observation is closer, you use that theory. Specifically when classifying observations with a general form where: y  = x y z: Your previous obsvervations are: y1 = 5, 6, 7 y2 = 6, 8, 9 and a new one is: ynew = 10, 10, 10 You can use the Euclidean distance (as described in the previously mentioned formulae; hence  compare((10 - 6)^2 + (10 - 8)^2 + (10 -9)^2))^0.5 with ((10 - 5)^2 + (10 - 6)^2 + (10 - 7)^2))^0.5 ) to find out which previous observation is the closest neighboor of your new one. In this example by using the theorem of Euclidean distance you will find out that the closest neighboor of ynew is the observation y2. It can be a useful theory in pattern recognition.
