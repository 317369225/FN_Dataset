What is the best algorithm for automatically calculating a credit score?
It turns out this has been extensively studied -- in fact, this was one of the first applications of decision trees. The UCI repository contains several credit worthiness and/or credit approval data sets including: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/da... (23 years old!) http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/da... Either an ensemble of regression trees approach (bagging, boosting, random forest) or a support vector machine approach would be the best options here. Personally, bagged regression trees would probably do pretty well here. Some attributes are likely to be non-parametric or discrete, which are easier to build into a regression tree model. If you wanted to use support vector machines, that might also work if you could work out a way to normalize the attributes. Nearest neighbour approaches and Naive Bayes would likely not work very well. Nearest neighbour would have distance issues. Naive bayes would not be able to express the complex variable relationships.
