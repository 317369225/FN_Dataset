What is the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm? What type of problems can be solved by this algorithm? What type of math is required?
KNN is basically a non-parametric technique, which means that it does not take the overall data properties into consideration. It is used for classification purposes, and also seldom for regression purposes too. Classification: We classify the new data-point as the class which the majority of the K data-points closest to the new one possess. Regression: The value of the new point is the value of the average of the distances between it's K closest points. The distance metric should be taken accordingly. (user's choice). You've gotto know matrices, linear algebra, and all those needed for general data science.
