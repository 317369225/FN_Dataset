What is better, K - nearest neighbor (KNN) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier?
For most practical problems, KNN is a bad choice. Because it scales badly - if you have a million labeled examples, it would take a long time (linear to the number of examples) to find K nearest neighbours. Two solutions: - use k-means instead - or if you really insist on KNN, use ANN (approximate nearest neigbours) which is usually 10x - 100x faster, with neglible impact on precision SVM works differently and it is good and fast solution for many problems. Generally: just try it on your dataset. Both algorithms have great open source implementation so it's usually a matter of one hour to try it.
