There is an assortment of say 250 products. Is there an algorithm to segregate these products in 5-6 clusters (based on the product dimension) for their packaging and identify the packaging dimension of each cluster?
The K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm or a variation of these should give you a decent result. To figure out the number of clusters (K), a general practise is Check out this link: Determining the number of clusters in a data set. For more information on K-Means Clustering, I'd recommend this video: https://class.coursera.org/ml-00...
