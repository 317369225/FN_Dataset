What simple and intuitive machine learning methods deliver the most value?
I disagree with your assertion that they are domain specific -- many are very general. I would characterize three core algorithms because they show different flavours of machine learning, and add a fourth for the mathematically inclined: 1. Nearest Neighbour/Instance-based Learning. This is a very easy algorithm: simply compute the distance to nearby instances and pick the class of the nearest one. You can then get more fancy through various approaches (e.g. k nearest neighbour -- choose the k nearest ones and do a vote amongst the predicted classes), but that's about it for twiddles. 2. Naive Bayes: Also very clean both mathematically and conceptually: treat each attribute as an independent probability distribution, model the probabilities based on observed data and take the product across all attributes then choose the class with the highest probability. Very simple. 3. Decision trees: This is the classical machine learning algorithm (CART or C4.5). At each point make a simple decision about which attribute to test on, and when you hit a leaf of the tree it is labelled with a class. Not many parameters to tweak aside from: what's the smallest leaf node you are willing to accept.Â  4. [More mathematical] Support vector machines: Project the classification problem into a high dimensional space, then try to find the surface in that high dimensional space that separates the features as much as possible (the margin). Once you have that surface, project the new point into that space and decide which side of the surface you are on. This one does have some twiddling: the main one is which high dimensional space do you project into?
