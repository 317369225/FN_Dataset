What applications does Kolmogorov complexity have to finance?
There is a great book Universal Artificial Intelligence by Marcus Hutter about the only true and known possibility to build artificial intelligence for all known and physically possible problems. The problem is that you need a computer that computes exponentially hard algorithms. Applications to finance very simple: 1. bet on every sequence of time series more if it has low Kolm. complex. and less on high Kolm. compl. sequences. 2. A simplified but theoretically sound version of KC is Universal Portfolio from Thomas Cover. UP is especially for finance. There are some improvements of UP eg. by Gy√∂rfi, Lugosi that use k-nearest neighbour computation. In their simulation they get 10^12 times as much as invested! You can compute Log-Optimal portfolio with http://cvxr.com/cvx/examples/cvx... matlab UP should have theoretically in the long run assymptotically the same growth rate like log-optimal portfolio. In log-optimal p. you compute just a vector like (0.1 0.3 0.6) for a given known time series(3 stocks) and rebalance your portfolio according to it every time period regularly without signals etc. It is called log-optimal portfolio because you get from all rebalance vectors the highest growth rate but you need to know historical prices in advance what is impossible. If I could use a time machine(not for free) for transmitting number vectors, I would use it just for log-opt. p. and become a millionare in a short period time.
