What should all software engineers know about machine learning?
1. Machine learning algorithms predict, classify, and cluster data. 2. Machine learning is a very broad and interdisciplinary field that combines linear algebra, statistics, hacking skills, database skills, and distributed computing skills. 3. Most machine learning practitioners whom I know and know of grew into the field; that is, they do not hold PhDs in machine learning. 4. Data points are represented as multidimensional points on a plane or hyperplane. 5. Machine learning algorithms can can be grouped broadly into supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. 6. Supervised learning entails using labelled data points (for example, a collection of hand-written digits pre-labelled 0 through 9) to predict the labels of an unlabelled "test set". 7. Good old linear regression is an example of supervised machine learning. 8. One of the commonest examples of unsupervised learning is "clustering", by which data points are grouped into clusters algorithmically. 9. The essence of machine learning is minimizing a so-called cost function, often through iterative algorithms such as gradient descent. 10. One the first and most critical steps in machine learning problems is feature extraction, which means representing inputs in a consistent and meaningful way as points on a (hyper)plane. 11 Machine learning is one part science, one part art. Knowing how to apply algorithms is half the story. The art of machine learning lies in effective troubleshooting (diagnosing problems), extracting features, and using tricks like boosting and bootstrapping. 12. Machine learning guides more aspects of our lives than most people would imagine, from Amazon/Google/Netflix recommender systems to routers to car brakes. 13.
