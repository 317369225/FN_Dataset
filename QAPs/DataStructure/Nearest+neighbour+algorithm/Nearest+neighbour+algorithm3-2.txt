What are the state-of-the-art in nearest neighbour learning algorithms?
I would recommend k-means over KNN. It's more efficient, generalizes better and can be used as features for other algos. My favorite library for that is SofiaKMeans - sofia-ml - Documentation for sofia-kmeans: fast k-means clustering. - Suite of Fast Incremental Algorithms for Machine Learning. Includes methods for learning classification and ranking models, using Pegasos SVM, SGD-SVM, ROMMA, Passive-Aggressive Perceptron, Perceptron with Margins, and Logistic Regression. - Google Project Hosting Update to answer Alexey's comment: k-means can be used for supervised learning in this way: first you train K clusters using k-means and then you'll calculate K features for every entity, each one is max(0,AverageDistance-DistanceToCentroid[i]). These features are usually really good. You then train usual stuff (neural networks, linear SVM, forests) on these features. It's somehow similar to RBF kernels in SVM but more efficient (K features instead of N features).
