What are some modern day applications of classification in data mining?
Thank you for the A2A. Classification can be many things. It depends on the domain. In the case of game analytics, our users, cohorts, behaviours, and many other things are classified through a number of methods. Those classifications are then applied in different problems, for instance: Fraud detection Churn detection Product offer User segmentation These are the ones that involve data mining and machine learning. There are many more but we're not using them other than analysis, research and experiments. Classification is a much broader task then mining/learning.
