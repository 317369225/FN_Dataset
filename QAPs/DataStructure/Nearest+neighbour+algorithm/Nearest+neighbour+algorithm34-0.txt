Algorithmic Trading:Â After creating simple vectors out of a set of stocks, what meaningful calculations can I produce?
You can do a lot of interesting things with a formatted data set like what you have. Since you asked about data visualization you can plot a graph/scatter plot to find out the value of EPS around which most shares are. This might give you an idea of a normal share price. This can be helpful to predict if the share has gone down in value or gone up. You can use algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbours to predict the shares that have the closest value to a paricular share you're interested in. Say you want to invest in Oil based companies you can look at one company which you've profited from before and find 3 other closest companies and can buy shares from them. This could assure you a constant percentage of earnings. You can pull data over a period of time and try to find the growth of share prices of a specific company or a set of companies. For example, plotting EPS over a period of 10 days would give you a very good idea of stock fluctuation. You can also pull other relevant data like weather details or inflation rates over a certain period and try to find some sort of correlation between these two data sets. You have the numbers, you can try pretty much any data science algorithm and design your own problem.
