What should all software engineers know about machine learning?
#1) Don't Worry too much about the Algorithm All Machine Learning algorithms are based onÂ  Correlation and have some built in assumptions about the distributions of the data they are analyzing. Since all algorithms are based on a very similar mathematical basis - don't waste time trying to pick the "best" algorithm - pick the easiest to start with and see what you can learn from the data. You'll probably find you need to tweak or clean the data. Staying simple helps you understand, when invariably your algorithm learns some strange relationship, why this is so. #2) Preprocessing You will find that data preprocessing can simplify the learning problem a lot. From recasting the data into a better distribution (for your algorithm) to other challenges (e.g. how to deal with missing data) you will find this drives much of your success
