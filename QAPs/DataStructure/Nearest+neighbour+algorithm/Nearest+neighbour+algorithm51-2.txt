Which machine learning algorithms are capable of solving prediction problems?
Machine learning is as capable of solving a prediction problem as you or I are. A machine learning algorithm builds a list of actions that will provide the best outcome in the agent's environment. This is the exact same as us learning something in everyday life. What we do with that knowledge is use past outcomes and reasoning to select what we think will give us the best outcome. While this can be done with any algorithm, it tends to be Unsupervised Learning algorithms that focus most on prediction. Unsupervised Learning algorithms are set in an environment where the agent learns by analyzing the responses it gets, not knowing the actual outcome. My professor's comparison between the big three (Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement) was this: Supervised Learning: You ask someone what happens when you put your finger in an outlet and they tell you. Reinforcement Learning: You ask someone what happens when you put your finger in an outlet and they say bad. Unsupervised Learning: You put your finger in the outlet and get zapped. The latter definitely has the largest ties into the areas of prediction, but again, they are all technically just algorithms to gather knowledge. What you do with it is restricted by you.
