Do companies need machine learning processes that are real-time, or are offline batch computations most usually sufficient?
In most cases, I would say no. The trick is to generate more results than the final interface demands. That way, when a user clicks on "Refresh", the extra pre-computed results are shown in some weighted order to give the semblance of a "real-time" update. As long as you retrain your model every night, or even every week for some cases, you should be fine. I would argue these work pretty well for recommendation, search (applications I have been mostly involved with). In some cases, you would need a real-time prediction system. E.g. when a new user joins a system. Even here, the trick is to compute the results off the "pre-computed" model. Here's another bit: With most of the datasets companies work with (>1M datapoints), the addition of a few datapoints would not really change the model much.
