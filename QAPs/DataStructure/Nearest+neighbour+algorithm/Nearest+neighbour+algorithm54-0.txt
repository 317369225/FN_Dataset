How do I use machine learning to ask users dynamically and recommend a result?
If you put your problem in Bayesian terms, you are saying that the priors are the answers to each set of questions and the posterior is the likelihood that the subject will be happy with each of the possible sports. If you want to change the questions you ask throughout the questioning period, then you are going to want to use a secondary version, given the previous answers, which question will give me the highest probability of arriving at a stable conclusion. Note that you will need more data to answer in the latter case, as you will need to specify the priors in terms of the path to the answer instead of just inÂ  terms of the answers themselves. But I believe with the numbers of variables you have it's a tractable problem - just make sure your corpus is big enough to avoid overfitting.
