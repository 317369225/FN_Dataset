Is the universe computable?
On a higher level.. I'd like to say it is Not Possible 1. Information can only be gathered from the observable universe (and nothing beyond it). Things that exist beyond the observable universe most certainly influence it - via gravity as an example. Infomation about unknown or undetecable degrees of freedom will not be captured. Information captured will only be complete in our perception. When it is reproduced, it will almost certainly be entirely different. 2. Information at the micro scale - Quantum mechanics and instances of perceived randomness in the non deterministic world puts limits on the information we can record. Although, probablity functions exist, they will not be accurate.
