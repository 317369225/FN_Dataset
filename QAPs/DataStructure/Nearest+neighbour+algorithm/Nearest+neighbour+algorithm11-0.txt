What concepts can I learn about data science in 15-20 minutes?
The K nearest neighbours algorithm: you have labeled training data (samples comprising "features" belonging to a certain class). You want to predict the label of a new, un-labeled sampled. You choose a measure of distance between samples (for numerical features, this could be the euclidean distance, i.e. square root of the sum of the squared differences between features). You then choose the K samples in the training set with the smallest distance to your un-labeled sample and assign to it the most common label among the K nearest training samples. You just used K nearest neighbours to classify a new sample, and the algorithm surely took less than 15 minutes to learn.
