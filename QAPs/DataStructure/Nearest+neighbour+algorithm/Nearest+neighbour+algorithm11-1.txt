What concepts can I learn about data science in 15-20 minutes?
Well with 15 minutes we aren't going to be talking about deep technical thoughts or indeed even CS syntax at all; so I'll mention a quick visualization tip since we often have to show our data to people: Custom-style all your plots to the environment you are going to be showing them in.  The default plot options in almost every visualization package are VERY BAD. A huge offender is Excel, the grid lines are very noisy and end abruptly without a chart border, and the axis fonts are far too small.  Other offenders include MATLAB, R, and matplotlib.  These are all beautiful tools once properly configured, and can make top-notch graphs, it's a shame the defaults are all so bad.  You should be able to read the fonts on any graph you are going to show from the back row of whatever room you're presenting in.
