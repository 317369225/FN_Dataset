All these Machine learning algorithms, what is the point?  It seems like choice of machine learning algorithm, decision tree, neural net, svm, isn't nearly important as the feature selection and feature extraction process which determines what goes in to it, garbage in garbage out, that sort of thing.
I wrote an answer to a question similar to yours, available at Which feature selection approach typically yields a more accurate (in out of sample performance) model: black box or intuition (more detailed explanation of question inside)? I reproduce it as is: A  short answer: Feature extraction is a heuristic derived from underlying  domain knowledge (Plotz et al. 2011) - that may work on some domains  and may not work on others. Therefore the question that which feature  selection method is better is quite coarse. Based on these problems,  researchers are now trying to learn features directly from the data to  find a generic and effective representation and deep learning is  emerging as a good methodology to reach that goal.
