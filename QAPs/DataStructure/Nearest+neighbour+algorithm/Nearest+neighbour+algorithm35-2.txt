What is better, K - nearest neighbor (KNN) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier?
"Which algorithm is mostly used practically?". Both are used. KNN is more intuitive but KNN might also be slower to use in case K's value is to be kept high, or total number of points is high . (This might be made better using KD-tree or other such algorithms) "Which algorithm guarantees reliable detection in unpredictable situations?" That depends upon the data. If the datapoints are heterogeneously distributed, both should work well. If data is homogenous to look at, one might be able to classify better by putting in a clever kernel into the SVM.
