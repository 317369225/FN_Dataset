What is the simplest artificial intelligence pseudocode algorithm?
I am not sure what you are referring to as an AI algorithm. In my opinion one of the simplest and often used pseudo code design would be the A* algorithm. It is a best first search algorithm and is often used to find the least cost in a procedure. I think a good source to learn about this algorithm would be: http://theory.stanford.edu/~amit...
