What applications does Kolmogorov complexity have to finance?
The applications I've seen are of two kinds: Kolmogorov Complexity as a measure of randomness. Like Charles says, you try to find the KC of a time series. If it's low, that suggests exploitable structure, so you can to trade it/model it further. If it's high, then the series is too efficient/random, so you're probably wasting your time. KC as just another stock indicator to use in your machine learning algorithm or technical analysis whatever.You can't actually compute Kolmogorov Complexity, though, so you try to "approximate" it in various ways (e.g., by feeding your time series through a compression algorithm and seeing how much you're able to compress, or by defining your own entropy-like measure.)
