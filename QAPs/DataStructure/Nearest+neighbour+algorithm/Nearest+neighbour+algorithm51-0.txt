Which machine learning algorithms are capable of solving prediction problems?
Darwin Froese answered the question quite comprehensively. I would also like to add a point, that not all prediction problems are alike. For instance, there can be Ad Recommendation (eg. Google AdSense) or Connects Prediction (rg. Facebooks Do You Know FriendList) or Stock Market Prediction or even Algorithms used for Cancer Prediction. Anyway, there are several classes of algorithms that can work for prediction, like k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Bayesian Networks, Linear Discriminant Analysis etc : 1. Linear/Logistic Regression for continuous values 2. SVM/Kernel-based Classifiers for classification problems. 3. LDA/QDA Gaussian-based classification for samples within the same distribution. 4. K-Means for Unsupervised Learning/Classification. 5. Neural Networks for prediction and classification, for specific types of classification  where manipulating/weighting features can give more insight than simple  classification. 6. Random Forest seems to work particularly  better-than-expected when data is limited for classification/decision  problems, by "bootstrapping" existing data in a sense.  But yeah, Neural network is a major up and coming field of research for a prediction algorithm (especially Deep Learning).
