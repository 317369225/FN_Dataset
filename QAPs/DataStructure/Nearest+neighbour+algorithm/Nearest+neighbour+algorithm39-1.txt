What is Euclidean distance in terms of machine learning?
Euclidean distance has nothing to do with machine learning specifically. It is only one of the many available options to measure the distance between two vectors / data objects. However, many classification algorithms (for e.g. K-Nearest Neighbour, Minimum Distance Classifier etc) use it to either train the classifier or decide the class membership of a test observationÂ  and clustering algorithms (for e.g. K-means, K-medoids etc) use it to assign membership to data objects among different clusters.
