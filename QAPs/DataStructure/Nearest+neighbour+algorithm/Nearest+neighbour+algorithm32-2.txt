What is the best machine learning algorithm for regression?
There is no one-size-fits-all here. But your knowledge of the problem can help a lot here. Here are several questions that absolutely need to be answered before making decisions about the algorithm for modeling: What kind of dependency are you expecting to see? I will explain this a bit. If we are looking at, say, text regression, it's likely that you can get decent results using a linear model. But if you are predicting amount of likes from the image source, you will need neural networks. What features do you have? What are their nature, what values can they have, what are their distributions? For example, tree-based models are exceptionally good with categorical features. What kind of analysis do you need? If you are going to make a deep, detailed analysis of the learned dependency, you will need a highly interpretable model, say, linear/polynomial regression. It's unlikely that you can visualize a GBM or Neural Network in a comprehensible way. As Giuliano Janson said, good feature engineering beats any algorithm.
