What are the top 10 algorithms every researcher in Machine Learning should know about?
Since you've asked for 10, here's my top 10 favorite ML algorithm list: Decision trees: CART & Random Forest Ensemble methods: Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) Support Vector Machines Artificial Neural Networks: Back-Propagation k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) Topic modeling: Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) Clustering: k-Means Association Rule Learning: Apriori and FP-growth algorithm Dimensionality reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) Hidden Markov Models
