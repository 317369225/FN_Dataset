Do companies need machine learning processes that are real-time, or are offline batch computations most usually sufficient?
It's very case dependent, but learners usually don't need to be real time. Appropriate When Data is best modeled in transient data streams rather than persistent relations Data relevance or freshness fades fast Too much data to store (infra, latency etc) and must be tossed News, Advertising, Gaming (A.I.), Stock Markets Benefits Instant Gratification- immediate integration of data into modeling outcomes, Yahoo invented S4 to process user feedback in real-time to optimize search advertising ranking algorithms [1] Mine more- In some systems it’s only possible to use all of your data in an online setting because there is simply too much Highly relevant now (matters for news) Challenges Online systems have one defining characteristic YOLO (You Only Learn Once). This generally changes the algorithms, thought processes, and approaches to machine learning [2]. Specific expertise- Machine learning approaches are typically applicable towards offline systems. Online systems don’t store data and approaches have to be optimized or altered to accommodate that. Evaluate and interpret- Because data is not seen again, it is difficult to evaluate why a model is performing poorly, and inherently related, why a result is what it is. You lose the ability to interpret results to an even higher degree than offline learned models. Difficult to maintain- Data changing, adapting to new features, latency, evaluation Infrastructure that can support it. Supporting real time learning is a whole different ballgame [3] After considering your domain, context, and problem to be solved, if the problem domain can be scoped into an offline system, it usually should be [1] Distributed Stream Computing Platform [2] Page on uchicago.edu [3] Realtime  Distributed Analysis  of Datastreams
