All these Machine learning algorithms, what is the point?Â  It seems like choice of machine learning algorithm, decision tree, neural net, svm, isn't nearly important as the feature selection and feature extraction process which determines what goes in to it, garbage in garbage out, that sort of thing.
If you don't mind the irony, what I'm reading feels like "if all hammers are the same choosing one is not as important as the screwdrivers that allow much better cooking." One of the things I spend most time on is to document where models, methods, algorithms, etc, are good or bad in abstract situations and better or worse against their peers also in abstract situations. I copy paste a lot of bits of information I find (copy pasted a couple from this thread actually) to a Evernote notebook that I religiously maintain for reference. It doesn't matter that there are thousands of algorithms, what matters is if we know how to choose some to work with in given context, measure its performance and present the best possible results.
