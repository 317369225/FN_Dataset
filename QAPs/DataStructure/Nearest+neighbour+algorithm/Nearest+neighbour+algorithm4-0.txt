How can the K Weighted Nearest Neighbour algorithm be used to classify a new point which is in the form of a Gaussian Distribution that is being compared to other Gaussian Distributions that correspond to an (x,y) coordinate?
I've just skimmed the paper, so I could be wrong here. But I think what is happening is: 3: For each fingerprint/location you have, you calculate the probability that the observed strengths correspond to a gaussian distribution of strengths around the observed fingerprint value. (I assume that it's gaussian in logarithmic signal strength — that is, decibels — not in absolute strength, because negative absolute strength would be meaningless). This probability will be exponential in the L2 metric. 4: You calculate the probable location by averaging the K best locations from step 3, each weighted by their probability. I think this algorithm should work reasonably well, as long as there are at least a few strong signals. If all signals are weak, by using a gaussian distribution, the algorithm could essentially decide that they're all noise, then average over the weakest fingerprints available, producing a garbage result. In such a case, it might be better to look for a similar but stronger pattern in the fingerprints, rather than looking for a fingerprint that's similar in the absolute sense.
