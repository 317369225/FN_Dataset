Do companies need machine learning processes that are real-time, or are offline batch computations most usually sufficient?
The answer is very strongly domain-dependent, and depends on how/whether the relevance of information decays (often exponentially) with time (e.g. a lot of financial trading, or social network sentimentÂ  analysis). And whether that time constant is milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks etc. Sanjay's answer is not thinking of this scenario, only of systems where fresh data only slightly extends generalizing ability of an (essentially static) system. Sentiment analysis on social networks: real-time (e.g. What is the reputation on my product/service on Twitter this morning? How was the response to my PR or marketing campaign?) Stock/bond trading: entrain a model real-time based on data every tick, second, minute, hour etc. At least every day, we generate a new model. Topic-learning, search engine keyword learning: offline Recommenders, product recommendation, social network analysis, friend or stranger recommendation: offline etc.
