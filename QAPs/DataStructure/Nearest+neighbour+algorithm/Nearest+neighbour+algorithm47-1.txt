Wi-Fi:Â How does Wi-Fi help determine location?
Wifi positioning is mainly used in indoor positioning. RSSI based: The central concept in Wifi based positioning based on recieved signal strength(RSSI) from at least three Wifi APs whose locations are known. The distance from the wifi device to the Wifi AP is calculated using the RSSI. The approximate position of the wifi device can be calculated with triangulation algorithms. Wifi fingerprinting: In this method, RSSI from a Wifi AP is mapped with location coordinates covering the entire grid inside the building. This information is stored in a centralized server. The wifi client device will determine the location by calculating the RSSI and query the centralized database with Wifi SSID and RSSI. For the intermediate points Machine learning algorithm like K nearest neighbours is used. SUPL SLP server: From the OMA SUPL 2.0 specification version Wifi positioning is supported in the Secure user plane protocol. Any SUPL client connected through IP network to HSLP and DSLP can get the position from the centralized database.
