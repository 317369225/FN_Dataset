What is the best machine learning algorithm for regression?
Interesting question. There is no free lunch. In other words, Part of your job is to figure out what the best algorithm is for the regression problem you're trying to modeljust like what Giuliano Janson said and Ricardo Vladimiro reiterated. Despite years of experience, Giuliano and Ricardo said that they try several algorithms before fixing on one. We are much younger to the field and should be less confident on our models based on just a couple of experiments. Of course prior experience gives you an intuitive understanding of the problem but in real life, every data is different. And when you're especially using out-of-box implementations, the only keys are solid feature engineering and robust experimentation.
