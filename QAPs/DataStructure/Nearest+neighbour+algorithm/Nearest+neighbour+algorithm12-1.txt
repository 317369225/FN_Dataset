What are some of the cool Python projects?
While "cool" can be ambiguos, I'll write some projects I consider "cool". For a class I had to write a 68hc11 assembly compiler in any programming language, I decided to do it in Python, it's a cool project because you're going to learn assembly language, the different opcodes and mnemonics for the Motorola 68hc11 and you'll see how compilers work. It also gives you a deeper understanding of how low-level programming works. In case you're interested about it, you can download/check out my compiler here: Assemblycompiler by da-edra Another cool project was one I made for another class where I used the Twitter and Instagram API's to retrieve pictures with a certain #hastag, location, text string, user or by popularity and then, after retrieving the information with a Python script create another script that automatically generates HTML5 code with the retrieved images inserted in it, I had to show the image with information in this order: User who uploaded the image Date of upload Time of upload Text that came with image My project displays the information when the cursor is over the pictures so, if you're interested, you can see the working project (final result) here: Page on daedra.ml While they're really simple an easy projects, they're fun, interesting and cool.
