What are the good algorithms on nearest neighbours problem?
This one is called Reverse k-Nearest Neighbour. There are a few algorithms built using the same approach : (i) RECORD algorithm , (ii) Agglomerative RECORD algorithm and (iii) Stability-based RECORD algorithm. You can find more about it here... A Simple Yet Effective Data Clustering Algorithm I pointed this out as it was explained to us by my professor during Data Mining course. It was devised by one of his students. The best part is, the algorithm is very simple yet intuitive, yet more effective than DBSCAN in terms of producing results and detecting outliers.
