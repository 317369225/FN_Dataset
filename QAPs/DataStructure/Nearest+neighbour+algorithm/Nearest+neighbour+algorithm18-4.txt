Why is dimensionality reduction useful?
Dimensionality reduction is useful as an utility in performing a lot of common tasks due to the vast diverse applications it can be used for. Common but important scenarios where dimensionality reduction is useful are: Visualization -- because projection into 2-3 dimensions can be plotted -- Reduce time complexity -- because of less computation required-- Reduce space complexity --because of less number of features -- More interpretable --because it removes noise; thus provides simpler explanation-- Feature Extraction Anomaly Detection -- e.g. PCA subspace -- And of course, to mitigate "curse of dimensionality" which is common in scientific communities.
