What would be the minimal and ideal knowledge to have before exploring a data mining framework - WEKA for implementing a machine learning solution?
The most important thing for data mining is finding the right algorithm. If you are working with WEKA, try to create two sets of possible input file(.artf) which matches your expectation. Now train the weka with the first set of values with the different classifiers and check the output accuracy. Marks some classifiers algo which provide good accuracy with your input. Now give second set of input data to make sure the output is coming as per your expectations. Try to learn some basic classifiers algorithm as well like random forest, clusteringÂ  regression, bayes, svm, nearest neighbour.
