What is the most fascinating and simple algorithm of clustering?
I would say the most fascinating algorithm  due to its simplicity is the K-Nearest Neighbour (introduced in 1997 by  D. W. Aha in “Special AI review issue on lazy learning" Artificial Intelligence Review, vol. 11). It's based on the minimum distance from the query instance to the training samples to find the k-nearest neighbour (you have to define a priori the value of k which is one of the drawbacks of this technique) Additionally, it's very easy to find the implementation. For example in python language: 1.6. Nearest Neighbors
