What are the state-of-the-art in nearest neighbour learning algorithms?
"state-of-the-art" is a broad term. The more state-of-the-art something is, the more specific it is, and not general in the way described in the question details: "anything that is data-driven". To get access to a first-cut at state-of-the-art, start with a general purpose machine learning library in your favorite programming language, for example: MatLab: Machine Learning with MATLAB Python: Scientific Python / scipy (SciPy.org - SciPy.org) Java: Weka machine learning library (Data Mining with Open Source Machine Learning Software in Java) C++: The OpenCV (open computer vision) toolkit has great algorithms (ml. Machine Learning) These toolkits will allow you to experiment broadly with mixing and matching techniques to suit a problem. They take care of the complex mechanics, so you only need to set up the problem and dataset, and configure the parameters of the algorithm. If you find a technique that works, but has issues (too slow to compute, doesn't handle certain cases), then you want to search for state-of-the-art for that particular technique. Every technique that has been broadly proven effective is available in a library somewhere. If an algorithm is so state-of-the-art that it is not generally available in libraries, then you are talking about research algorithms that need to be adapted from a journal paper and demo code. At this point, you are basically on your own, because now you are the state-of-the-art. Updated 53w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
