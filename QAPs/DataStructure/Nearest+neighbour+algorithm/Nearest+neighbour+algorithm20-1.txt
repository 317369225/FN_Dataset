What is the best algorithm for automatically calculating a credit score?
It's a regression problem. Stochastic Gradient Regression can be used if the data set is huge. Although many research papers(I've gone through few) suggests CART/MARS and other decision tree algorithms as well. Any mentioned Machine Learning Algorithm plays along good if you can engineer the features nicely.Feature Selection (Wrapper/Filters/genetic algorithms) helps increasing the efficiency of the learning algorithm. And error analysis is mandatory,it will ovoid the over-fitting of the model as well as give you a fair knowledge of variance and bias.For example if your model has a high variance,getting more training data is useful and toying with feature improves the model. I generally use these algorithms and select the best one using an extensive error analysis. You can refer to this cheat sheets Error and Algorithm respectively reference:-Â  Page on scikit-learn.org
