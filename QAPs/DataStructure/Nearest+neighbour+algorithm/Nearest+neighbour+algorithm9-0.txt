What graph algorithms should a sophomore CS undergrad implement?
I think this is the best time you should start solving lot of problems as much as you can Though I've never worked on AI but i'm aware of some graph related algorithms,below are some of those that you can practice. Breadth-first search Depth-first search Shortest path problem Dijkstra's algorithm Johnson algorithm Bellman–Ford algorithm Traveling salesman problem Backtracking Priority queue Graph Coloring algorithm PageRank algorithm Edge Rank TrustRank algorithm Edmonds–Karp algorithm Kruskal's algorithm Minimum spanning tree Prim's algorithm Euclidean minimum spanning tree Longest path problem Kosaraju's algorithm Hungarian algorithm Topological sorting Edmonds's algorithm Strongly connected components Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm Tarjan's least common ancestors algorithm Floyd–Warshall algorithm Transitive closure Nearest neighbour algorithm Knight's Tour A star algorithm B star algorithm D star algorithm Bloom filter Tree traversal Beam search Bidirectional search Incremental heuristic search Updated 59w ago • View Upvotes
