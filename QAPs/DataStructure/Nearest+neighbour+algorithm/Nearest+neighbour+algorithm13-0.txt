How do people find amazing coincidences, facts and statistics? Is there a automated system or are human efforts required?
Thanks for A2A!!! This is an interesting question!!! It would be fairly easy to construct a model which could give us amazing coincidence using programming but it is not necessarily the case. Some could actually be die hard followers of that particular sports/ field and noticed it. If you really want to try your hands on it, then you can try the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to find a player who is most similar to the given player in terms of the given statistics. If you want exact matches (coincidence) then it can be achieved by a small piece of code using Python-Pandas/ SQL provided you have the data set containing all the statistics of the players.
