Suppose an LCD screen has a screen resolution of 720 x 1080. When I play a YouTube video of 480, does the screen resolution remain the same as 720 x 1080 or does it change to 480 pixels?
The process is called resampling. There are algorithms such as nearest neighbour by which you can achieve up sampling.Â  If you give smaller software resolution than your monitor can handle, the video card simplifies the image going to the monitor. For example, making 4 pixels (in square), show the same color that 1 pixel of your image contain. The lower the resolution, the more pixels will be "unused" - marked with same color. The image [typically] contains a fixed number of pixels - the same as your monitor. The size of pixel depends on monitor. So, if you have 1600x1200 screen, but are running at 800x600 resolution,your 800x600 image will show twice as large as it would be if viewed on 1600x1200 resolution. If you view an image, that is 1600x1200 on 800x600 screen, you will see only 1/4 of it on screen. If you zoom it out, to make it show full screen, you will see all of it, but it will be simplified - the pixels, depending on ratio (in this case 1/4), will have calculated an average color/brightness from 4 pixels of your image, giving you and average color, from each of 4 pixels (in square) into 1 pixel on screen. If you are looking for more information on resampling, have a look at the wikipedia article on Image scaling
