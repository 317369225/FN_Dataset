★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
Dawkins realises full well that atheism is not a religion, it's the blockheads who are constantly trying to redefine unbelief as belief, and outspoken atheists as prophets for said belief, who attempt to put words in the mouths of anyone seen as contradicting religious myths.  Unlike theists, atheists do not claim to know all the answers by dint of divine revelation, or to be the special, chosen children of a supreme dictator.  Atheism is a position arrived at when you see religion for the protection racket it is, it isn't a world view, and nobody who knows anything about it would say that it is.    Embed Quote
