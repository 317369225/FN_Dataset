★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
First, I'd ask Dawkins. Second, I've never had to 'reestablish' my morals or ethics.  Don't see why anyone else would either. Third, metaphysics is another word for bullshit, frankly.    Embed Quote
