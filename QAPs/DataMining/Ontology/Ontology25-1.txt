★Ontologies (information science): Is time an ontological measure while space is epistomological?Time denotes events, which are inherently subjective. Space denotes objects, which are inherently objective. So is it fair to say that time is the core quality, or mechanism?, of being/Ontology, while space is the core quality, or mechanism?, of doing/Epistemology?
An observer looking at the universe from the inside may observe in the space domain (in which case time is subjective) or in the time domain (in which case objects are subjective). The coin of subjective/objective must be one way up or the other, relative to the box we call the universe, but that only changes the perspective, not the box. A hypothetical external observer would see an objective four dimensional space and no time at all. Possibly. The nature of time is hotly debated across philosophy, mathematics and physics. There are opinions, with everyone quite naturally thinking they are right and that everyone else is too fond of the cheese and wine parties. I contend that a 3+1 universe multiplies entities unnecessarily, that there is no need to have special cases or privileged positions, you only need a direction to face and the inherent uncertainty that involves (a product of the uncertainty principle that all information is subject to - blame Shannon) to create the subjectivity and the illusion of an arrow of time.    Embed Quote
