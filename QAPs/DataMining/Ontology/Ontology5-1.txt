★What does "ontological" or "ontology" mean?I don't understand the word "ontology" or "ontological" when it is used in a sentence. I guess I kind of maybe get the concept, but not enough to understand its many uses when I see it.
Ontology means "the study of being." It usually crops up when someone wants to talk about what truly and actually is, and is usually contrasted with epistemology ("the study of knowledge"), which talks about how we can form knowledge. For example: Ontological question: "Does God Exist?" Epistemological question: "How could we know whether God exists?" Ontology - philosophically speaking - is a bit dated. Since the mid 19th century philosophy has been shifting away from ontology, and focusing more on theories of knowledge and theories of the construction of meaning. This isn't to say that philosophers have given up on the idea of an 'ontos' (true reality), but philosophy tripped over... A phenomenological gap: the disconnect between any ostensible reality and our inner mental representation of it, one that is only partially bridged by our senses. A language gap: the capacity of language to construct and reconstruct our experience of the world. What sense is there (philosophically) in talking about the ontology of something when all we know about it is the fragments of impression we get from our senses, colored by the way others tend to represent that thing in language?    Embed Quote
