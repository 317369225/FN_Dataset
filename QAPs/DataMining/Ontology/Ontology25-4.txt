★Ontologies (information science): Is time an ontological measure while space is epistomological?Time denotes events, which are inherently subjective. Space denotes objects, which are inherently objective. So is it fair to say that time is the core quality, or mechanism?, of being/Ontology, while space is the core quality, or mechanism?, of doing/Epistemology?
What purpose would it serve to establish that theoretical framework? I guess it depends on what you think a person amounts to and what being is.  Hypothetically of course.  I'm assuming that there is after all, one reality.  I would think that being is the core of both time and space, as well as matter and non-matter.  You seem, with the way you phrased your question to be very matter oriented.    Embed Quote
