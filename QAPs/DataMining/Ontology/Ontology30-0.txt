★What is an ontological literature analysis?Ontology is the study of the nature of being as opposed to epistemology which is the study of perception. But what is an ontological approach to literature analysis and could you perhaps link to or provide an example of an ontological literature analysis?
Vladimir Propp is the acknowledged innovator in this matter. He reviewed a large corpus of Russian folklore and analyzed their plots. He found that all fell into one of 31 narrative categories. This has also been done in the book Iron John in which the author Robert Bly looks at the history of writing tales about men and explains the symbolism of various tropes. The stranger arriving on a dark horse, the young man leaving home on a quest for meaning, etc. I'm not sure that there is any significant difference between morphology  and ontological literary analysis. It is the analysis of the story for  what it is, rather than how people interpret it. Claude Levi-Strauss may have a different idea of how literature might be  objectively analyzed but I still think it comes down to empirical  identification elements of the text itself. Who is the protagonist, what  does he do, why, what happens, etc.
