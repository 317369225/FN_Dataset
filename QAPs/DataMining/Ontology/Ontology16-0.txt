★Is ontology mathematics?Twentieth-century French philosopher Alain Badiou claims that ontology is mathematics. Badiou also believes in deep connections between mathematics, poetry and philosophy. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M...
Huh? Ontology as philosophy, and Ontology as information science. Neither has much to do with mathematics per se. Given your edit I'd add that modern French philosophers are the people that have also claimed (at various stages) that i  - square root of minus 1 - (Jacques Lacan) is a stand in for the penis and that e=mc^2 is a "sexed equation" (Luce Irigaray). There is a worrying tendency for philosophers of this ilk (and I may be doing them a disservice, but I don't think so) to import maths and science (especially physics) into their pronunciations in some sort of (failed [1]) attempt to add weight, validity and a specious rigorousness. This not to say that mathematics isn't involved, but it's probably more that maths is at the root of the real world than anything else. 1 See, for example, the Sokal affair and/ or read Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity and related material, particularly Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science by Gross and Levitt and Pseudoscience and Postmodernism.    Embed Quote
