★What is a process ontology?
I believe it is a reference to Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy as written in his very difficult books, i.e. Process and Reality.  Fundamentally, nothing exists in itself, everything is in transformation all the time.  Therefore, all that really exists in the relationship between "things" including mass and energy is the relationship, which can be either potential or actual.   You can find more on wikipedia or read the book by Robert Measle, I believe his name is, an Introduction to Process Thought, published by the Templeton Foundation.  The fundamental ideas are based on quantum theory, which Whitehead understood in a mathematical sense, and thus created his viewpoint.    Embed Quote
