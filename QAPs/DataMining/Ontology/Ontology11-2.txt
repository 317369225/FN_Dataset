★Ontology (philosophy): What is the nature of Being?Ontology is about the nature of Being. But what is Being? Does Being have an essence?
My summary would be that the essence of a being is it's degree of becoming, where three orders can be distinguished: - the natural order (material and chemical "things", biotope, people) - the social order - the techno order See the "entity dictionary link" below for more details on these three orders in which "beings" dwell, and their relationships. For a rather modern, yet lengthy, discussion of the topic I recommend Mario Bunge's Treatise in Basic Philosophy : 8 volumes in 9 parts.
