★What's the difference between an ontology and a taxonomy?
I think their "purposes" explain their differences clearly. A taxonomy's purpose is knowledge classification. While an ontology goes beyond into "knowledge representation". Although the "hierarchical structure"  is absolutely inadequate to classify anything, for some strange reasons, our ancestors were deceived into thinking that it is sufficient. Anyone who used taxonomies to classify the real world entities would appreciate what I am saying :) As ontologies take the responsibility of representing the knowledge of the world, they are inherently "graph"-ical in structure and support more semantic vocabularies to define the relationships.    Embed Quote
