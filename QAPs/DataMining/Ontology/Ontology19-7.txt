★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
Atheism is not a philosophy at all. Atheism is only the lack of belief in any gods. I'm sure that Richard Dawkins is well aware of that, but I can't speak for him.    Embed Quote
