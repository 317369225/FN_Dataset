★What's the difference between an ontology and a taxonomy?
Ontologies tend to be more about the relationships between things (in addition to their properties) than taxonomies which are generally limited to classification only. Because of this, complex formal ontologies often have things that fit into multiple areas of a given hierarchy, strict taxonomies try to avoid this. Here is a good link http://infogrid.org/wiki/Referen.... If you are asking specifically about ontologies and the Semantic Web then they are a superset of taxonomies. You can express a taxonomy in the Ontology Web Language (subClassOf) for example, but the purpose of ontologies is to allow tools called reasoners to do interesting things with the data. Taxonomies are rarely interesting. On the web (from the World Wide Web Consortium) ontologies are "usually expressed in a logic-based language, so that detailed, accurate, consistent, sound, and meaningful distinctions can be made among the classes, properties, and relations" (http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-we...)    Embed Quote
