★What's the difference between an ontology and a taxonomy?
Ontology from the Greek ὄν, genitive ὄντος: "of being" (neuter participle of εἶναι: "to be") and -λογία, -logia: science, study, theory Taxonomy from the Greek τάξις, taxis (meaning 'order' or 'arrangement') and νόμος, nomos (meaning 'law' or 'science') If you break down the Greek into an exact meaning: Ontology = science of being Taxonomy = arrangement science Think of it as a house. Taxonomy is a list of all of the elements in a hierarchy (ie Drywall goes on top of wood beams and the plumbing and electrical exist alongside the wood beams). Ontology is the house and the relationship between all of those hierarchical elements (Drywall is held up by the wood beams and without the plumbing and electrical existing alongside the beams the house wouldn't be a house). Taxonomy is structure and ontology is THE structure.    Embed Quote
