★Ontology (philosophy): What is the nature of Being?Ontology is about the nature of Being. But what is Being? Does Being have an essence?
Aristotle would say only humans are Being. We however understand the being of animals. This is to say I know the being of a Tiger, but a tiger is not a being. Tigers do not know the being of dog, as they basically are only-every...being a tiger. Being is essentially the point at which a sentient life begins to perceive the essence of 'Being'. In other-words it is the essence of the Tiger we experience in the imaging of its 'Being'. Thus it is the essence of something that IS Being--that enables A BEING to know how it Bes. TL;DR Being as noun refers to human's in Aristotelian Metaphysics. Being as verb refers to any give lifeform doing it's thing What is important is that humans can realize the Beings of things.    Embed Quote
