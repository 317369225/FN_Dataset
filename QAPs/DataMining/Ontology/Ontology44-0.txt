★How should Alain Badiou’s ideas about mathematics as ontology be understood?
As a waste of paper. As with much recent abstract French philosophy, he waves vague terms around like magic wands, generating a tsunami of words and dragging in all sorts of other fields without a single proof, the same way that psychics drag in quantum mechanics as a bogus justification for their charlatanry without a single Feynman diagram. He claims that set theory demonstrates that there is no God. Such remarks indicate that he knows little about either.    Embed Quote
