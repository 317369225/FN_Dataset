★What are "ontological commitments"?Ontological commitment (Wikipedia)
"Ontology" is the question of what there is in the world*. An "ontological commitment" is something that you take for granted about the structure of the world. Any time you use language, you inherently invoke ontological commitments, and these commitments are crucial to interpreting what (if anything) your utterance means. * Or at least, in your domain if discourse. You can have an ontology of Harry Potter, even though domain of discourse of Harry Potter does not directly reflect real objects in the world. You can also refer to green ideas or other nonsensical notions: as long as the language can refer to it, a statement using the term invokes ontology.    Embed Quote
