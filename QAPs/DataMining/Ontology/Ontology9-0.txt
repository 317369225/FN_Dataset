★What is Buddhist ontology?
Dependent origination (Sanskrit: pratītyasamutpāda, Pali: paṭiccasamuppāda) could be considered the ontology of Buddhism. It explains the interdependent causation of phenomenon. It's a very deep teaching that spans across multiple texts and schools, but the essence can possibly be understood from this paragraph from the Samyutta Nikaya (12.44). And what, bhikkhus, is the origin of the world? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. This, bhikkhus, is the origin of the world. [1][2] [1] The Connected Discourses of the Buddha [2] Loka Sutta: The World    Embed Quote
