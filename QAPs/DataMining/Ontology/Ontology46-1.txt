★What does a Quora Ontology Architect do?Sounds rather grand and enigmatic at the same time. But what is it? (Layman's terms, please!)
Ontology and epistemology, and a few other "head-based"   meta-cognitive disciplines, are incredibly important elements relative to the survival of cultures, societies, civilizations and for us, especially at this point in time; for our own species. It is not critical that everyone be engaged consciously or intentionally in such arts. It seems likely that it is not even desirable to be more aware beyond the premise that narratives frame perception reality and possibilities. And, because such things actually fascinate and obsess a very few among us; it, slowly perhaps, becomes more possible to make sense of things in an increasingly rapid changing world where yesterday's 'realities' and today's do not always match up. Intentional obtusity (Now I gotta see how 'real' that term/usage is) gentle obfuscation or 'magical' misdirection helps avoid conflict around elements that could become problematic or decisive until they (autonomously) begin sort themselves out better. What the shape of the knowable can be at any point in time is crucially important to explore because the shape of the knowable is not fixed or eternal. There are always prerequisites for what we can know foundation perspectives that can in effect drift in and out of focus along with the zeitgeist. There is much of 'reality' that has gotten metaphorically left behind at some turn of the trail; where something appeared to displace it's ability to be perceived. Not that any such thing is truly and necessarily gone for all eternity. only that conditions that require it are no longer in general circulation. Thank you Ontology Architects! Build well, you hardy bricoleurs.    Embed Quote
