★What is Christian ontology?
Ontology is the study of the nature of being. What does being "God" or "human" really mean? What is the essence of being? Christian ontology is primarily concerned with the nature of the Trinitarian God. How can one God be three persons?  Does God change? What are God's attributes? At this stage, I have to point out out the distinction between ontological trinitarianism (what is the nature of God) and economic trinitarianism (how do the functions of the three persons of the Trinity differ). But you asked about ontology, and the Bible is quite explicit about the ontology of God. There is little debate about it, unlike the topic of the roles / functions ("economy") of God. Christian ontology is secondarily interested in what it is to be human. What does made "in the image of God" really mean, in a moral, spiritual, or even physical sense? Christian ontology takes as a starting point that God made us, that God has a purpose for us collectively as a human race, that we were not made to be sinners and end in death, but in relationship with the Creator for ever. Ontology takes those foundations and explores the implications for thought, belief and practice in life. Clearly the atheist will have a very different ontology of humanity than the Christian. However, the ontology of (for example) the Muslim will also be quite different from the Christian, in that the answer to "what is the highest purpose of the ordinary human?" will differ. I've not mentioned Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God, as I doubt many today would find it helpful. It is an interesting application of logic & ontology to "prove" the existence of God. Google it if you're interested in ontology applied to apologetics! Finally, I'm really not an expert. You might like to read http://creationwiki.org/Ontology and http://carm.org/ontological-and-... as a starting point for more study.    Embed Quote
