★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
Why Dawkins? He's a best-selling writer and television personality as well as a respected scientist, but he is not now nor ever has been a leader of atheism. There is no leader of atheism. Atheists already have the ethics thing worked out. No problem. Metaphysics? Explain the value of metaphysics in everyday life.    Embed Quote
