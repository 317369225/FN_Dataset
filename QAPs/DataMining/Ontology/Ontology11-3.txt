★Ontology (philosophy): What is the nature of Being?Ontology is about the nature of Being. But what is Being? Does Being have an essence?
All things are beings. Everything we know is a being. Ontology studies what a being is, what its properties are, and its causes. Being has existence only through an essence, for example "I am" (being) ..."a human" (essence). There is a certainty that comes with what it means to be and that comes with essence. The greatest ontology authors in history would be: Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas.    Embed Quote
