★What is ontology?
Ontology is part of metaphysics which also includes epistemology, and is the study of Being. Being only exists in Indo-european languages, and thus must be distinguished from existence and other standings toward phenomena that are articulated in other language groups. See my works on the meta-levels of Being at http://archonic.net or http://works.bepress.com/kent_pa.... The meta-levels of Being are Pure, Process, Hyper, Wild, and Ultra.    Embed Quote
