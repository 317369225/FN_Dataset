★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
I'm sure that Dawkins realises atheism is not a complete world view. He's probably confident that not believing in unicorns is not a complete world view either. Atheism (how many times do we have to say this?) is the absence of belief in gods. That's it. If you want to add ethics or ontologies, that's entirely up to you.    Embed Quote
