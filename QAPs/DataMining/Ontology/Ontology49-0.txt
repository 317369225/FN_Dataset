★What is the ontology of nursing?
Ontology is Aristotle's philosophical term for the act of 'Being.' Ontology of Nursing, according to Reed (1997) is "An inherent human process of well-being, manifested by complexity and integration in human systems." My interpretation of this statement is that we, as nurses, have an instinctive drive to give relief and healing to those in need, and to promote the continuing process of well-being. The individual "Human" can be seen as a complex combination of systems that work together to create and maintain life and wellness. Clinically, Nurses work as part of a team of health care providers to treat their patients and return them to their optimal state of health, whether that be their normal, pre-illness/injury condition, or to die with dignity, or somewhere in between. Nurses act as the managers of their patients' over-all health. They coordinate the time that patients receive medications, laboratory, blood, tissue and/or body fluid sample draws, and diagnostic testing. They also act as the patient advocate when the patient is unable to communicate their needs or wishes. Finally, nurses are the liaison between the patient, family, aggregate (consulting) and direct (Attending Physician Team) providers, in an effort to ensure that there is an understanding of the patient's plan of care among all those concerned.    Embed Quote
