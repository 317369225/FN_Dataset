★How does an ontology work?I'm doing a research work on existing ontologies.. and i am absolutely new to this.. so if someone could explain it right from scratch it would be of great help :)
We explained how ontologies are used in the semantic web by organizations such as the BBC, MD Anderson and Chevron in an issue of the PwC Tech Forecast that's available for download here: Spinning a data Web You'll need to download and read the full PDF to get the full sense of it. Building on Roby Duncan's answer, ontologies act at the data layer to add another dimension to tabular information so that the information can be interlinked in graph form. It's a more flexible, Tinker Toy means of joining tables a noun at a time via verbs or relationships so the tables become graphs. Once you start to build relationships in and make the data relationship rich, you see that relationships are foundational to data description, i.e., an entire person, place or thing can be described completely in relationship terms in a form that can be machine read. For example, a soccer player in the World Cup is on X team from Y country and plays Z position and last year team X played team A with result B, etc. When those nouns and verbs together are machine readable, each verb acts as a hook that helps pull in a clusters of relationships. That's the basis of dynamic publishing--machines retrieve and display clusters of info on a dynamically rendered page, and that assemblage is made possible by enriching the relationship descriptions with the help of an ontology that provides the relationship skeleton. Each ontology provides a different skeleton that can be used for a different context.    Embed Quote
