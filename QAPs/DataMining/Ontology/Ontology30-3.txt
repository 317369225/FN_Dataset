★What is an ontological literature analysis?Ontology is the study of the nature of being as opposed to epistemology which is the study of perception. But what is an ontological approach to literature analysis and could you perhaps link to or provide an example of an ontological literature analysis?
Possibly Quine might be helpful at: Page on sysu.edu.cn I hope the link works. I found his Ontological Relativity essays stimulating many years ago,  although this is I suppose strictly philosophy. The Royal Institute of Philosophy of London did a series on Literature and Philosophy, which might throw up some more ideas. I am sorry I cannot be more helpful, but my copy of these RIP lectures are tucked away in my loft, after moving flats (apartments) some time ago. Stuart Hampshire also covered this, but cannot remember the title of his book[s]. People like me who keep many books should never move.    Embed Quote
