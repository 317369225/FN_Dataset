★Ontologies (information science): Is time an ontological measure while space is epistomological?Time denotes events, which are inherently subjective. Space denotes objects, which are inherently objective. So is it fair to say that time is the core quality, or mechanism?, of being/Ontology, while space is the core quality, or mechanism?, of doing/Epistemology?
s.t. ,doesn't need a time-stamp  or coordinates to  be ontologically true, all it requires is logically consistent  spans. Something can occupy space,without absolutely no information & hence without any epistemology ,between the timestamps in which temperature is  absolute zero. Other than such theoretical & abstract absolutes,everything in some order of existence usually has some information associated to it. PS:  The information can be unusable in a black-hole,which doesn't mean no information (yet).    Embed Quote
