★Is there a nice visual diagram of the entire Quora ontology (all the topics)?I want to drag around a giant tree...
Not right now.  I've tried to do some visualizations before (that can be seen here at How did Quora implement its topic/tagging architecture?), but unfortunately, all my attempts at visualizing a snapshot of the entire topic ontology failed due to the large number of nodes and connections. If anyone knows of a good performant graphing program that can handle a large number of nodes (about a hundred thousand), I will try again.    Embed Quote
