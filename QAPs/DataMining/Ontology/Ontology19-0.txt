★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
I don't know why you'd expect someone to speak for Dawkins, but I really doubt he'd fall for such a wobbly straw man. Atheism is not a philosophy. At all. Please see the Atheism FAQ.    Embed Quote
