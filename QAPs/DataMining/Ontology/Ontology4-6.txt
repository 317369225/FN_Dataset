★What's the difference between an ontology and a taxonomy?
Many of the answers here appear to define the difference between ontology and taxonomy in terms the additional structure an ontology once defined, offers over taxonomy. In a sense a "thin" ontology that only has a hierarchy defined would "collapse" into a taxonomy. I, however, feel that this does not explain the difference well enough. I would be looking for a more principled distinction where the structural differences (hierarchy only vs. networked relationships) are then an outcome. Here is one stab at it: An ontology describes concepts through which we view the world. For example,  we may say the world is made out of objects and properties. We could also say that the world is made out of dynamic processes requiring us to view the world in terms of changing variables and differential equations. Furthermore we may view the world as fields, as in electromagnetic field theory. If my intuition has any footing, then an "ontology" in the sense described in other answers, would be systematic examples (instances) of an object/property ontology, not an ontology itself. A taxonomy would also be an example of an ontology where one lists examples of conceptual or physical objects. One open question might then be: where do classifications (the classification relationship) come from? Are these real phenomenon in the ontological sense -- they are assumed to be -- or are these merely mental/cognitive processes that are part of our sense making apparatus.    Embed Quote
