★What does "ontological" or "ontology" mean?I don't understand the word "ontology" or "ontological" when it is used in a sentence. I guess I kind of maybe get the concept, but not enough to understand its many uses when I see it.
Ontology is the study of what it is that exists, or an ontology may be a list of things that exist. So at the deepest level it separates what precisely exists from the appearances (assuming that these are different, and that precisely what exists is describable). Some famous examples of this kind of ontology: 1. a single material substance 2. a single non-material substance 3. a material substance and a non-material substance. 4. a plurality of kinds of substance.    Embed Quote
