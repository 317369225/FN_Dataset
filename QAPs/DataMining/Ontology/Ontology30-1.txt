★What is an ontological literature analysis?Ontology is the study of the nature of being as opposed to epistemology which is the study of perception. But what is an ontological approach to literature analysis and could you perhaps link to or provide an example of an ontological literature analysis?
It is a small subset of how some philosophers look at the world. A search yields but 27 articles on the topic. It did also yield a definition, which might help you get your head around it: "Literary ontology is essentially a phenomenological issue rather than one of epistemology, sociology, or psychology. It is a theory of the phenomenological essence intuited from a sense of beauty, based on the phenomenological ontology of beauty, which puts into “brackets” the sociohistorical premises and material conditions of aesthetic phenomena." (From an article by Xiaomang Deng, The phenomenological ontology of literature, 2010, Frontiers of Philosophy in China) I think only a philosophy PhD or professor would be able to indicate rather than assert conclusively whether a review is written from an ontological or an epistemological stance, seeing that this divides philosophy since  Plato and Aristotle.    Embed Quote
