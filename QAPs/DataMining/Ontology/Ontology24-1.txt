★How important is ontology to AI?http://www.reddit.com/r/artifici...
One cannot quantify the importance of ontology to AI, but undoubtedly, ontology is a great tool in solving many great problems in AI. Since AI is all about finding relationships between input variables and using them in problem solving, having a comprehensive list of the connections between entities that the computer may encounter as input variables indeed helps in making intelligent connections. But linking ontology to AI often turns out be a problem in itself. The computation overload can be uneconomical, which is compounded if the organization of  ontology is not proper or a convoluted organization strategy is used. Also often the ontology trees can grow to huge number of nodes that make it impossible for the program to run in real time. Having said that, a lot of research is underway on how to successfully apply existing ontologies to the new realms of machine learning. Read: 1.
