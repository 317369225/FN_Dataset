★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
I was born an atheist.  I've never needed to adjust anything. I am more ethical than most religious people. I think the question contains an assumption that doesn't exist.    Embed Quote
