★How can I easily explain the word ontology?what is an example of ontology or ontological analysis?
For me, it was always - in simplest terms - the branch of philosophy that concerns itself with being + existence OR more 'concretely' that which exists + that which does not. As Joshua Engel mentions, ontology can closely be tied to metaphysics (the philosophy of fundamentals, grounding, transcendance, initial conditions) in that the latter may help determine + hone out the former. As an example, one will see that the analytical tradition (e.g. Russell, Quine, Carnap, etc) have a very limited ontology since reality + that which exists is based upon symbolic logic + language. On the other hand, the continental school of thought explores it much more 'loosely' in order to accommodate a reworked metaphysics (large shout out to Nietzsche). So the latter is less concerned with the existential state of unicorns, pink squares, imaginary numbers, symbols, nothingness, transcendental 'objects' + so forth.    Embed Quote
