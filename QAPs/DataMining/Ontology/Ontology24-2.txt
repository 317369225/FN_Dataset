★How important is ontology to AI?http://www.reddit.com/r/artifici...
There is a general argument that comes from the history and philosophy of category theory that might help us understand what is at stake when we consider the fundamental and foundational issues involved in ontology and AI in general.  Consider Spivak's book on Category Theory for the Sciences where he makes us of "ologs" that define databases related to each other by mathematical functions.  And take Marquis and Kromer, one who argues for the geometrical nature of CT and the other who sees CT as a movement of pragmatics.  My view is that a "presentation-invariance structure for theories" [Marquis 2009, 235] would be the optimal way of couching arguments relating ontology to AI in the most general way.  The key is in realising the difference between (1) applying piecemeal techniques as "tools" and (2) applying the whole of the theory as "object".  In (1) we would see piecemeal replacements and substitutions of processes in a competitive field, while in (2) we would come to realise that a definite geometry is implied directly by the ontology and AI.  In the latter, varieties of ontologies would be subgroups of the larger theory, and thus, we would have the confidence to proceed the applications and applicability of theory.    Embed Quote
