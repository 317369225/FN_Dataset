★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
Framing an assertion as a question doesn't make you look smart. And as many people have mentioned, atheism is not a philosophy, it is the rejection of assertions of the existence of a personal deity. Nothing more, nothing less. And I am sure RD is aware that morality comes from our innate, evolved, social attributes like empathy and love. Humanity has to come up with its own laws and codes of ethics by which to live.    Embed Quote
