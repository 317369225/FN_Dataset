★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
I'm going to address this in terms of metaphysics, but without reference to Dawkins, just atheism. The metaphysical position would be that God does not exist. Now what? You could take a rationalist position. Seeing as God does not exist and has never existed absolutely nothing has changed. Being that non-belief in the non-existent is not a cause so it cannot have an effect. This is a clear position expoused by Aristotle and probably Hegel. A different view would be Nietszche's "God is Dead" argument. He conjectured that as the world was screwed up, it didn't matter whether God existed or not and as there was no evidence for his existence he was redundant. This led to the problem that without religion there was now a cause, losing belief in something that might exist would lead to a search for an alternative. Nietszche came up with the neat concept that ethics and morality could only be defined by an individual. The big drawback with Nietszche is that one of his biggest fans was Hitler and amoral ethics was behind the Holocaust. You could take a materialist/ Marxist stance, that man created God. So God is essentially irrelevant. God is used to justify man. It would be entirely consistent to claim both a false premise and a false dichotomy metaphysically. Equally valid would be from Kant, that the ethics of any action should be considered, however ethics being a universal consideration leads us to the same place. Finally if you want a Satrean view whether your question is true or false is my choice. So the metaphysical answer would be yes, no and maybe as always    Embed Quote
