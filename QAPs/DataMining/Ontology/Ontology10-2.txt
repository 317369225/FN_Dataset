★Ontology (philosophy): Does tomorrow exist?Ontology
If spacetime exists as a single, static 4D object (a perfectly valid model used by perfectly sane scientists) then all points in time exist. If the Many Worlds model is added to this, then every possible tomorrow, given absolutely any theoretically possible past, must exist. The problem is, if this is correct then "tomorrow" doesn't exist as a distinct entity, it's merely a 3D transverse cross-section. There is no subjective declaration of it being "tomorrow" because we're just instantaneous static 4D waveforms, a static object can't observe and an instantaneous object has nothing to observe in. Of course, that means this posting is also an instantaneous 4D waveform, which creates something of a problem when it comes to reading it.    Embed Quote
