★What is the difference between "ontology" and "epistemology"?in business research
Ontology is the study of what there is in the world.  Epistemology is the study of how you know it. Topics in ontology include: What does it mean to be a "thing"? How do things persist over time? How do things change over time?Topics in epistemology include: What does it mean to know something? What does it mean to mean something? Do we actually really know anything at all for certain?The two are intimately related.  Any statement of ontology (e.g. "Bees are a kind of insect") is intended to be a statement of "truth", and epistemology is trying to figure out what it means to be "true".  But the notion of "truth" is inherently grounded in our idea that there's some kind of world out there for which the distinction between "truth" and "not-truth" is relevant.  It's hard to know what epistemology would mean if you really were a brain in a vat with no sensory inputs (but that doesn't stop epistemologists from trying to figure it out). So the boundaries between the two are fluid.  Some ontologies of philosophy would group them both under the topic "metaphysics", but largely because "metaphysics" is just a catchall term for questions that don't go anywhere else.  ("Metaphysics" just means "After Physics", all the questions that Aristotle found leftover after he wrote all of his other books, including Physics.)  There's a huge amount of thought in all of these fields, so any serious study of them requires specialization, but you'll end up having to study all of them to some degree because there's no clear demarcation between them.    Embed Quote
