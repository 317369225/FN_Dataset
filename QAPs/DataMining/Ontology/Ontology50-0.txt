★Is there an RDF & ontology-driven UI package?I may need to build (or implement if I am lucky) a solution that would retrieve data from the user. The kind of data to be retrieved will be driven by an OWL ontology and some RDF data. Effectively the solution would be instantiating an node of a particular Class, so an OWL ontology would be queried to find out what data properties and object properties can or should be defined. Any recommendation?
JXML2OWL Swing application allows you to map elements from an XML schema to concepts (classes, properties) of an ontology. It is important to note that JXML2OWL does not create an ontology from an XML schema. Indeed, once the user have specified the mappings, it creates an XSLT stylesheet that transforms instances of an XML schema into instances of an existing OWL ontology.
