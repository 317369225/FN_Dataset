★What are the root node(s) of Wikipedia's ontology?
I'll assume that the question is about the categories in Wikipedia, and by "Wikipedia" I'll refer to the English Wikipedia. Wikipedias in other languages may do it differently. The top of the English Wikipedia category tree is Category:Contents. In fact, this is the top only by convention - technically it is not at the top, because it is itself included in Category:Container categories, which is a semi-technical category for categories that are supposed to contain only other categories and no pages. Under the "Contents" category there is the Category:Articles category, which includes all the English Wikipedia articles, which, in turn includes Category:Fundamental categories and Category:Main topic classifications. They are similar in goal, but different in execution: "Fundamental categories" has only a very short list of domains - currently, Concepts, Life, Matter and Society, and "Main topic classifications" has several dozens of topics represents different fields of study. If we go back to the "Contents" category at the top, then we'll see that it also includes content types other than "article" - Glossaries, Lists, Wikipedia categories (pages that refer to Wikipedia itself and to its community), etc. Wikipedia is changing all the time, so this answer may well become irrelevant in the future quicker than we think. Another thing to note is that the Wikidata project is also organizing Wikipedia content, but in a more multilingual way and in a rather differently planned ontology. In the future ןt may become as visible as the current Wikipedia categories or even replace them - but Daniel Kinzler can write about that much better than I would. (Thanks to Erica Friedman for A2A - I knew the answer more or less, but it was good to dig it again to see the details.)    Embed Quote
