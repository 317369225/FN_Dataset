★Does the semantic web need ontology?
The unhelpful answer is: it depends what you mean by semantic web, by ontologies and need. The possibly more useful answer is: yes. If you think of the Semantic Web as a web of information interpretable and so exploitable by machines, then you need to assume that there is a way to specify formally the meaning of this information. In this case ontologies are needed as they represent logical models of the concepts that are involved in modelling and sharing data. Now, this view has been criticised a bit for being too high level and inpractical (which I think is wrong, but that is another question). But even if you adhere to a view of the semantic web which is less oriented towards formal semantics, ontologies are still essential. They form a structured, reusable specification of the concepts and relations that are involved in sharing data. In other terms, talking about the same kind of things on the semantic web mostly means using the same (a compatible) ontology(ies). To give a example, you can expose information about products on the Web, but it is only with the use of a shared ontology (such as GoodRelations) that this information becomes exploitable automatically, at web scale. Now of course, you can always argue that other technologies could have been used instead of ontologies to achieve the same goal. In this sense, the answer is that no, the semantic web does not fundamentally need ontologies, as it could be built with something else. But that would not be a terribly helpful answer either.    Embed Quote
