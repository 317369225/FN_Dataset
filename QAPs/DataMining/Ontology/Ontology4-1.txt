★What's the difference between an ontology and a taxonomy?
Think of it this way: A taxonomy is a simple hierarchical arrangement of entities where you have a parent-child kind of relationship. This is very much similar to the taxonomies that you study in the field of Biology, for example: Panther is a type of Carnivorous animal, which intern is a type of Mammal and all Mammals are types of Animals. Taxonomies are simple arrangements of classes without any restrictions on any properties at any level of the hierarchy. An ontology, on the other hand, is a more complex variation of taxonomy. Besides having the hierarchical arrangement of the classes that represent entities, each class has intern several restrictions on its relationships to other classes or on the properties a particular class is allowed to possess. An example of this would be that for a hierarchy in the photography domain, if I simply say Camera is a parent of two classes viz. Digital and Point&Shoot, and then add another simple statement saying Person is another separate entity whose child is a Photographer, I am basically referring to a simple taxonomy. But if I add constraints on the relationships for these entities for example like: 1) There exists a relationship named "possed_by" that is a prerogative of only the Digital class. 2) An instance of the Digital class can be possed_by only an instance of the class Photographer    then we are talking about ontologies. Notice here that there could be other children classes of Person besides Photographer, but by placing the restriction 2) on classes of the photography ontology, we are adding more knowledge for the machine to infer that if there is a relation between an instance of the Digital class and an instance of the Person class (which has a child as Photographer), then the object instance should and must be a Photographer. In short, an ontology enables inference for the machine to be able to add more knowledge to its database.    Embed Quote
