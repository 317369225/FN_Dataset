★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
I suspect he probably has. Have theists realized that atheists, by definition having rejected the central  premise of theism on which all other religious claims and associated "world-views" are based, were long aware of this from the very beginning?  Because that was kinda the first issue we all faced (being humans and having things like ethical questions and such).    Embed Quote
