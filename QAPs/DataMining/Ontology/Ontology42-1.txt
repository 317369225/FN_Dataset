★What are "ontological commitments"?Ontological commitment (Wikipedia)
This phrase gets deployed in a couple of different ways. I'll try and explain it at its most basic, least-complex form, and if you're asking for a more specific explanation (one tied to some text, conversation, field) then I'll try to be more specific. Assume that you start with a statement like: Gold is a different sort of metal than iron because of its atomic structure. If you were to analyze this statement for its ontological commitments, you would evaluate the statement to determine which different concepts its makes use of in order to articulate its meaning. At a very, very basic level (informal language here) you are committed to the idea that there is a type of substance called metal. You are committed to the idea that metal is a non-singular thing, and that there are different varieties of it. You are committed to the idea of gold, and of iron, and that they are both organizable under the earlier idea of metals. You are committed to the notion that both gold and iron have atomic structures, which additionally commits one to a package of concepts about atomic theory, and some set of rules that govern the structures of atoms. If you wanted to be more abstract, you also commit to the concept of differentiated beings, because you are asserting that there are multiple metals, and that difference can exist between them... which wouldn't likely be possible if there was only kind of substance. So all of that to say, ontological commitments are the concepts/substances/"Things" that a particular kind of statement or claim about the world commits you to claiming the existence of. How you organize it from there can go in a lot of different directions, and what logical forms you use to do your analysis can vary... but I think that might be a relatively general explanation of the term.    Embed Quote
