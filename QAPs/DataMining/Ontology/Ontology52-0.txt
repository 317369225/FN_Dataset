★What is Ontology (Information Science)?What is meant by Ontology in information science and how is it done?
If your reality challenges mine, we cannot inform each other.  If you refer to your tiger as "Richard Parker" and I invite "Richard" over for afternoon tea (by assuming he is an Englishman) then we have a troubling situation on our hands. To initiate you,  here is a wikipedia article on semantic interoperability as well as two classic journal articles covering the field. Gruber, T. (2007). "Ontology of folksonomy: A mash-up of apples and oranges." International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems 3(1): 1-11. Ontology of Folksonomy: A Mash-up of Apples and Oranges Reddy, M. (1979). "The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language." Metaphor and thought: 284-324.  http://www.biolinguagem.com/biol... Semantic interoperability    Embed Quote
