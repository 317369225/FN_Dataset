★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
Your question implies that one must know the mind of Richard Dawkins, a very bad presumption and totally irrelevant. Atheism is simply a rejection of a belief in a god. It has nothing to do with ethics or metaphysics. In my case, I was a theist, then became an atheist. For me there was no question of what my ethics were because they didn't change, and I no longer believe in anything supernatural.    Embed Quote
