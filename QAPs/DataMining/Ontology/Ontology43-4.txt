★Can this version of the ontological argument be refuted?
Basically, "greater" includes the trait of "existence" from #2.  If #1's "greater" does not include that trait then the term "greater" is used in different ways, which is invalid for an argument that treats the meaning as the same.   If #1's "greater" does include the trait of existence then the argument defines God as existing, which is nonsensical for a proof that God exists.    Embed Quote
