★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
Dawkins aside! Atheism in simpleton's terms is just a lack of need to invoke a deity of any sort in explanation of observable phenomena (human affairs included). As such, theism vs. atheism, I think has nothing to do with ethics and metaphysics. Weather you invoke deity or not in your foundational choices of ethical and metaphysical beliefs does not matter. Regardless of your choices what matters are your actions and their consequences.    Embed Quote
