★Ontology (philosophy): Will tomorrow ever exist?
Does "today" even "exist?"  In what sense would a duration of time, or a description of a series of events, "exist?"  Do mathematical concepts exist?  Does the concept of existence exist independent of a mind?  I would say that physics says tomorrow will (or already does) exist, but not by itself.  Spacetime exists, and it is one word for a reason; space and time are inextricably linked according to our current understanding (thank you Einstein).  So, according to my lay understanding of current physics, the answer is yes, sort of.  Does only the present ever exist?  Or, does all matter and energy, as well as the affected spacetime, that ever was and ever will be, exist simultaneously and we humans can only perceive one 4-D slice at a time?  Can we ever really *know* these answers? What actually "is" tomorrow?  When it becomes today, it won't be tomorrow anymore, because it will change into today.  However, if the concept of tomorrow is only in our minds, then it exists in our brains somehow.  So, subjectively, tomorrow does exist, and is ever changing just like the rest of the Universe.  The real answer?  42    Embed Quote
