★Does Wikipedia have an Ontology Architect?
No, not on staff.  But keep in mind, staff don't make decisions about such things, the community does through a process of discussion, dialogue, and debate, and many people who are interested in ontology architecture and similar topics participate in those discussions.    Embed Quote
