★What is object-oriented ontology?
Well, according to Ian Bogost: Ontology is the philosophical study of existence. Object-oriented ontology ("OOO" for short) puts things at the center of this study. Its proponents contend that nothing has special status, but that everything exists equally--plumbers, cotton, bonobos, DVD players, and sandstone, for example. In contemporary thought, things are usually taken either as the aggregation of ever smaller bits (scientific naturalism) or as constructions of human behavior and society (social relativism). OOO steers a path between the two, drawing attention to things at all scales (from atoms to alpacas, bits to blinis), and pondering their nature and relations with one another as much with ourselves. And according to an Object Oriented Ontology Symposium at Georgia Tech, it is: an effort to brew a new flavor of post-continental philosophy for the twenty-first century.  Given that I didn't realize that "continental philosophy" was over, I'm having a hard time finding much place in the universe for a "post-continental philosophy". So, as far as I can tell, it's "the process of applying old buzzwords to old ideas in the hopes that somehow a new thing pops out".    Embed Quote
