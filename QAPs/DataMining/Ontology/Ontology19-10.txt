★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
I believe you're confusing atheism with secular humanism, which already has an established world view.  Atheism shouldn't have a world view or body of ethics any more than disbelief in Zeus should have.    Embed Quote
