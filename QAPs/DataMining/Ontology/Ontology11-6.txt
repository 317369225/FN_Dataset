★Ontology (philosophy): What is the nature of Being?Ontology is about the nature of Being. But what is Being? Does Being have an essence?
Self-referral which is synonymous with consciousness. In order to be and to be discriminated from am otherwise homogenous soup of undifferentiated energy, vortexes which turn around their Eye or I or little self must form. This establishes a  I-dentity of turning around itself and undergoing relations with other vortexes, which are similar manifestations emerging from an absolute hypostasis, which in Hinduism would be the higher Self or the principle that experiences. The Self experiences the little selves vortexes until their momentum, ie. Karma is gone and the little self dissolves again into the absolute, thereby giving up its relative being and merging with the non-being underlying hypostasis of Self. Whereas every vortex has its idiosyncratic form and resonance frequency, which one could call its essence, this is merely a temporal essence and not an eternal metaphysical essence. The interactions between the little selves are a form of self-study, self-referral, leading to self-knowledge. The nature Prakrti is the doer and the phenomenal being. The nature of being is therefore also Nature, or the content of the consciousness. The seer, Purusha is the non-being hypostasis and the vessel of this content consciousness. The seer is not the doer. But I think your own answers and understanding on this topic are more elaborate and complete, so why ask the quorans who are less expert than you yourself? My personal understanding of this topic has more to do with mystical experiences than philosophy btw. There is no way to know being via the intellect. It must come from direct experience. I don't wish to discuss the different kinds of being, Being, existence etc.    Embed Quote
