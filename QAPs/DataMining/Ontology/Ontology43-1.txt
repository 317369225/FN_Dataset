★Can this version of the ontological argument be refuted?
What you have there is called St. Anselm's proof, and is ridiculous for many reasons, one of which is that you could make the same argument to "prove" the existence of anything, just by postulating that that thing is "great"/"perfect". Consider simply that the proof doesn't even bother actually looking at the world, or taking in evidence from it; you could make the same argument if you were blind, mute, deaf, and had no connection at all with reality. That's a BIG red flag for anything that is trying to prove something about reality. Also, as featured in one of my favourite SMBC comics (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal) here's St. Anselm's corollary: "It doesn't matter if you've never seen her. She's the best girlfriend ever. The best girlfriend ever would exist. Therefore, my girlfriend from Canada who's REALLY hot exists,  AND WE DO IT ALL THE TIME!". The ontological argument is applied in the same manner, but surely you do realize that the conclusion is absurd (albeit hilarious)    Embed Quote
