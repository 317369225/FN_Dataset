★Does the semantic web need ontology?
Ontologies enrich the metadata with relationship descriptions, and the ability to infer descriptions based on existing descriptions are what allow metadata to scale. The metadata are the glue of a database Web. That metadata scalability is what distinguishes the "semantic Web" from siloed data. Tim Berners-Lee uses a spreadsheet example to illustrate the power of this approach--imagine adding lots of columns to a spreadsheet. The additional columns enable better filtering. Larger parts of the Web, in this scheme, can function as "databases".    Embed Quote
