★What's the difference between Quora topic ontology and Wikipedia's topic ontology?
Individual language Wikipedias, such as English, don't have formal topic ontologys. Categories are assigned to articles, but whether they are correct or complete is, of course, dependent on interested volunteers. An article can have multiple categories, and categories themselves are typically assigned to belong to a (higher-level) category. (For more information for the English Wikipedia, see Portal:Contents/Categories.) However, a relatively recent development, Wikidata, which involves all language versions of Wikipedia, does have formal ontology - see Wikidata/Development/RDF - Meta    Embed Quote
