★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
Assuming you mean 'all atheists' in the place of one of them, you're still being absurd. Atheism is simply a conclusion, like the conclusion that the Earth is round. Your ethics come before any amount of philosophical thought. If you see a pregnant woman being kicked repeatedly in the stomach you will be outraged. This feeling in your mind (and perhaps your own stomach) occurs before you can think to quote any scripture, or remember what your parents taught you. It is as automatic as hunger or thirst, and all contemplating of ethics occurs after this reaction. 'Ethics' is a dissection of something already present in most human beings, genetically programmed into us.    Embed Quote
