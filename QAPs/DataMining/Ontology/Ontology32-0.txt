★How does Google learn ontologies?
While secret, they've given us some insights into how their search engine learns multiple layers of abstraction. Neural Nets, especially Deep Learning implementations are great at building a "gist" representation of a concept, and then linking that gist concept up to other things. In simple, imagine that "hardwood floors" were commonly followed up for a search of "vintage hardwood floors". Their learning algorithm builds a representation that says that they must be related more so than, say "Sputnik" and "hardwood floors". Google also published that they unleashed an artificial intelligence online and it came back, having no explicit instructions/details of the world, having learned about what cats are (amongst other things), and could recognize them in videos and pictures.    Embed Quote
