★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
False.  Dilemma.  Fallacy.  / Affirming.  The.  Consequent.  Fail.  So, in short, no, RD doesn't "realize that" because (a) you haven't proven your point logically (and yes, this is the right place for "proof") and (b) no one here has a magical "red atheist telephone" that rings right in to Dawkins' secret volcano lair, from whence he plans the downfall of humanity.    Embed Quote
