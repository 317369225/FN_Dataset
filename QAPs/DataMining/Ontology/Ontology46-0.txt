★What does a Quora Ontology Architect do?Sounds rather grand and enigmatic at the same time. But what is it? (Layman's terms, please!)
Why, they study, catalog, and design structures for Ontos... of course! (How's that for being intentionally obtuse?) More seriously LMGTFY. Wiki has a great article about ontology.  It is the study of, organization of (hierarchy), and determining the access points for a knowledge base (set of facts, questions and Answers in this case). Sorry, that may also be "unhelpful"... I guess I'm just in a mood today. Let's try that again: An easier way to think about it in meat space is to think about the guy who wrote the Table of Contents and Index for the entire Encyclopedia Britannica, and then did the page layout, and article layout, of the printed books so as to match that Table of Contents and Index; which means that by using those tools (aka: Site Map and Search Function on a web site) we can actually FIND the information we're looking for.    Embed Quote
