★Why is ontology reconciliation difficult?Ontology reconcilation, a premise of the Semantic Web, is difficult, but why?  Do you think it is due to technical or theoretical reasons?
I think it's difficult mainly for practical reasons. Natural language ontologies, which are the basis of human communication, are dynamic, but any particular ontology in use is static; that it is, it has been written down and codified with with fixed nodes, edges, relations, hierarchies. There are many ontologies in use that have been devised for particular purposes but none of them can stand in for the dynamic ontology that we all carry around in our heads and adjust as we need to for the purpose at hand. Reconciliation of ontologies, which may be attempted by static mapping of one to another, is bound to break down for the same reason that individual ontologies break down: they are static. If there is a theoretical failing here it is the failure to model the dynamic nature of mappings in the human lexicon.    Embed Quote
