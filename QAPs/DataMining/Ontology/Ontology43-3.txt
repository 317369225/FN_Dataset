★Can this version of the ontological argument be refuted?
You can prove anything, irrefutably, when you are allowed to make up the definitions.  Seeing as how there is no universally agreed to definition for "god", the very first point is, at best, debatable. And secondly, even if the "definition" were not debatable the premise is, as it would have to be altered and "God" replaced with "God, if it were to exist,", and also "which none greater can be imagined" does not exclude that you are also "imagining god". And, and point three, "something that exists is greater than something than doesn't" only applies to the real world, not to creatures you are imagining.  And, you are not "imagining" something that provably exists, so simply stating that this exists, and that does not, does not say you are imagining anything greater than your imagination for god, as that point explicitly attempts to say.    Embed Quote
