★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
I have no idea, you should ask him, he has Twitter @RichardDawkins is his username, if you don't have Twitter it takes like a minute to start an account. If atheism is accepted? Accepted by whom? Some of us have never been religious and therefore have the same ethics as we always had. Don't really have any metaphysics in my everyday life.    Embed Quote
