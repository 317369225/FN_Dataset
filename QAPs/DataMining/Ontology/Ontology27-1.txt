★What are the root node(s) of Wikipedia's ontology?
Ontology (information science)  the study of how things are organized There is an interesting game you can play with articles... Wikipedia:Getting to Philosophy If you click random links (or the first link) you will eventually get back to the article on Philosophy. This works for an amazingly high percentage of articles that have at least some content. So you could argue that philosophy is the root of knowledge on Wikipedia. But... I think another way of putting it is what are the root categories (to use Wikipedia  terminology). And I don't think there is a single root category that is the parent of every other category. Category hierarchy is an active area of editing on Wikipedia. I don't know the exact answer but I think you'll find that many things lead back to geography, and many others to basic sciences. Walking the categories up might be an interesting exercise. But you may find that things loop. There surely is research on this but it may be hard to find :) See also How can Quora, Wikipedia or any other large scale integration of collective  knowledge, organize its topics so they don't become fragmented? Thanks for the A2A... but see also Amir E. Aharoni's answer, which is much better at specifics.    Embed Quote
