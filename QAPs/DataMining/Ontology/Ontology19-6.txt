★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
    Of course. Then as a man of science he is outraged that children are being taught outright lies about our biological nature, that people are being beheaded , and that there are no actual solutions to our problems in religion.  Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to see people thanking God when a doctor saves a person's life. To see women, gays , atheists, or people born with birth defects, shunned, killed, stoned, for merely existing.    There is no magical realm, prayer and crystals don't work. There are monsters out there controlling, and killing people using religion as their excuse.   It makes me mad as hell. Why should I have to swear on a bible in a court of law? Why should my friends and family members who are homosexual be denied the right to marry?       Metaphysics? How about reality? there are no magical vibrations, or other realms of conscience. There is no magic bullet.   We should just accept we don't know why we are here, and there might not be a purpose or reason.     There are preachers on the radio and late night TV damning us to hell over the airwaves.     Can't a few of us not accept that?    Embed Quote
