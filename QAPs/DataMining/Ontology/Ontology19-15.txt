★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
Being a long-time atheist I would guess that Richard Dawkins realizes perfectly well that atheism is simply the absence of belief in a God or gods. Atheism is not a religion, a belief system, a philosophy, or a moral landscape. It has no pope. It has no holy book. In fact, most theists actually come to their ethics and metaphysics on their own as well. The Bible lays out a number or laws for moral living that nobody but madmen follow today. If our child disrespects us, we do not take them to the village elders and call the neighbors together to stone them to death . We do not keep slaves. We don't consider women unclean when on their period, or feel the need to kill doves to ritually purify them. We do not punish anyone for eating shellfish, or wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, or planting a flower bed with mixed flowers. But Jesus assured us these laws are still in force and the Bible tells us in the Old Testament and New that God is the same, yesterday, today and forever. In fact, Christians set their own moral compass just as atheists do, and that compass points the same way. We all recognize unjustified killing, robbery, rape and false testimony are wrong. Australian aborigines knew this 50,000 years before Adam and Eve were even "created" and far before Moses received the 10 commandments.    Embed Quote
