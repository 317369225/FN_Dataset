★Ontologies (information science): Is time an ontological measure while space is epistomological?Time denotes events, which are inherently subjective. Space denotes objects, which are inherently objective. So is it fair to say that time is the core quality, or mechanism?, of being/Ontology, while space is the core quality, or mechanism?, of doing/Epistemology?
I think it is clearer to think of time as continuous and arbitrarily cut up into an finite number of conventional intervals and space as having the quality of any physical thing having a potentially infinite number of discrete positions. Time as a continuous quality doesn't change and space as a discrete quality has oh so many faces. These characteristics are blended in reality and by abstraction separated. Their self-preserving structure can be thought of as a projection of two morphisms (arrows) composed into a pullback square. In other words, space and time is more like (space) x (time) as the initial object, with (space) as one codomain and (time) as another, with two compositions that form injections to a terminal object that is any particular thing at all in the world.  In other words, the self-preserving mapping of (space x time) is a commutative square.    Embed Quote
