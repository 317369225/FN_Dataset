★What does "ontological" or "ontology" mean?I don't understand the word "ontology" or "ontological" when it is used in a sentence. I guess I kind of maybe get the concept, but not enough to understand its many uses when I see it.
It could be used in many different ways in different sentences, but what I suspect you're hearing is something like, "What is the ontological status of [category]?", which is just a fancy way of saying, "Is [category] real?" "Ontology" is often used as a synonym for "description"; in particular, a description of the relation between things in some field or other.  The simplest and most common ontology is taxonomy: "Shrews are mammals are animals are living things".  In that sense, "ontological status" is just the abbreviated, one-place form of the question: "Are shrews?  Do they really exist?  Or is the category just a red herring?"  That question can actually be of some value; say, when you realize that the distinction between two categories of things is arbitrary, or you realize that two things you had been lumping together actually have a distinction that makes a difference. It's often applied in a more navel-gazing way to abstract things. "What is the ontological status of laws?  What's the ontological status of categories?  Are they real things?"  I personally find such questions devoid of value, as they draw distinctions without differences, and the status of "ontological" to be nil.    Embed Quote
