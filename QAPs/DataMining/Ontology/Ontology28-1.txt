★Is there any kind of web ontology for "semantic news"?
Building on Marin Dimitrov's answer here--you might also check out Tom Scott's critique of the rNews standard: http://derivadow.com/2011/06/02/.... He points out that rNews is a good start, but incomplete without sufficient URIs, predicates and reuse of or linking to existing Dublin Core and FOAF. I don't know enough about rNews to speak to its completeness as of November 2011. But the whole point of ontologies, whether the goal is "semantic news", a smart personal assistant like Siri, the Web as database, or the next thing after Flipboard or Zite, is ultimately to link all entities representing people, places and things and describe the relationships between those entities to get to a machine-readable interest graph. (Our summer issue at http://www.pwc.com/us/en/technol... describes the interest graph concept in detail within the context of social tools used for enterprise collaboration.) Without sufficient predicates and URIs, you don't really have linked data or "smart links" that allow machine-assisted findability, retrievability, connectability or reuse. You don't have the base intelligence for any of that. You aren't building sufficiently on the tacit intelligence of the social information layer that's being added. Verbs and links as IDs for the nouns are key. Without them, too much meaning is missing, and you still have information overload.    Embed Quote
