★Ontology (philosophy): Does tomorrow exist?Ontology
Yes, it does exist in the mental realm, but not in the physical one. In the physical realm, only 'this' moment exists.. All the past moments (the moments when this answer was written till here), and all the future moments (the moments in which I am going to write the next words) all lie in the mental realm only. And as I am writing this answer and as you are reading this answer, all the moments in which it was written or read are becoming past, and all the upvotes or comments (if any) on this answer, lie in the future, both of which exist only in the mind.    Embed Quote
