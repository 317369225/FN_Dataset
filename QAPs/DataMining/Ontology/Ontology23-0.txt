★What is the ontology of architectural design?
NaN, this question contains no semantic meaning either in the field of information technology, where ontology is a formal representation of knowledge within a domain, and thus there could be numerous ontologies of architectural design constructed, nor in the field of philosophy where ontology is the study of nature and being, and hence architectural design has definite ontology because it exists. Perhaps you actually mean the word etiology or etymology both of which would be concerned with origin?    Embed Quote
