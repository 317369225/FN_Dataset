★Ontology (philosophy): What is the nature of existence?
No thing-1 really exists.  The only thing-2 that exists is change.  It has some regularities.  A thing-3 comes into existence and passes out of existence when its form approximates some convention.  Existence is not a property of thing, but a quality of its field / context.    Embed Quote
