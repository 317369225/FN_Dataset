★Ontologies (information science): Is time an ontological measure while space is epistomological?Time denotes events, which are inherently subjective. Space denotes objects, which are inherently objective. So is it fair to say that time is the core quality, or mechanism?, of being/Ontology, while space is the core quality, or mechanism?, of doing/Epistemology?
Coming at this from a slightly scientific perspective, while it's true that our thoughts occur in time but the physical world exists in space, it's also true that time seems to be a fundamental property of the physical world too; to the extent that space and time are considered almost interchangeable in Relativity theory. On the other hand you could go to the other extreme and debate whether space really exists, or is something that our minds have conjured up. We have propositional knowledge of our thoughts as well as of things that occur in space, so I'd be suspicious of attempts to neatly segregate space and time.    Embed Quote
