★Does Richard Dawkins realise that atheism is not a complete world-view, seeing as it doesn't contain a school of ethics or an ontology?
No one here can speak for Richard Dawkins, but I'm pretty sure that just about any atheist out there doesn't throw away their whole worldview with their belief in a deity. Like many athiests, I had a time when I believed in God (though curiously, this happened in middle school...when I was very young it was never really brought up as an issue). When I decided that the idea of a god made sufficiently little sense for me to no longer believe it, I didn't then say "well, absent God, what are my ethics and my ontological worldview?" I already had ethics in place and they didn't change. In fact, I'd say a big part of why I rejected religion was that I found it was more and more going against my ethics. As for ontological worldview, a very small amount of my conception of reality came from believing in God. I didn't walk outside the next day, unable to comprehend or process the now-sourceless being around me. It was simply a day like any other, experienced by me in the same way as any other day. This is because the vast majority of our lives, whether religious or atheist, is born out of personal experience. The significance of almost everything in my world was pretty much unchanged for me. Regardless, I don't think that ethics and ontological worldview should ever be fixed. These are conceptions about reality that should grow and change with our experience of it. One step of the way for me was to stop believing in God, but that didn't mean that I had to start over.    Embed Quote
