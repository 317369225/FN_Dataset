★Can this version of the ontological argument be refuted?
Fails on premises. 1 accepted as the definition to base the logic upon. 2 is a false assumption. 3 is a false conclusion based on 2. 4 is an individual's limited imagination- or the assumption that god varies according to each individual's imagination. 5 invalid conclusion, since it is based on 2. 6. yes, that is true- just like Voldermort and Superman. 7 nope again, because of 2, again. Thus: There is an arbitrary assumption that whatever fantastic thing someone can imagine must be real, as long as they assert that the imaginary thing is the greatest of all possible things. He is extrapolating from the imaginary into the real based on false criteria- that reality is always "greater" than imagination. He is imposing an artificial linear relationship of "greater" or "lesser" on the concept of imaginary and reality, when there is no basis for such an assertion.    Embed Quote
