What is a good way to learn about Bayesian methods?
I'm not an expert but an user. In my experience, I can not agree with those respectful answers because I think the best way of learning for who want to bring it to practical situations as fast as possible is not bringing a lot of symbols and lectures into brain, especially who hasn't trained with serious math. The best way in my experiences is learning by doing. You'll finally know what you should do and figure out the concepts by practicing. You'd better read abstract math concepts only if you already get the concepts in minds and know what you're doing.

I hear bayesian long times ago but I just start learning it recently because it's much intuitive and flexible than frequentist's approaches. Before I learn bayesian, I spent much time to figure out what confidence interval, null hypothesis, p-value, alpha... are. Many concepts in frequentist approaches are quite misleading and unintuitive because it separates two kinds of unknown variables. When parameters are fixed, random variables follows distributions. That makes things complicated by switching minds between these two kinds of variables. When it comes to Bayesian, there's no such fixed parameters anymore, parameters are also random variables, that means we can merge everything into probability inference without switching minds and even get distributions of parameters. In this case, parameters can even be treated as data and provide futher flexibility.    Embed Quote
