Are we all Bayesians?
If Steven Pinker's book "how the mind works" is anything to go by, then we are indeed Bayesian. Not only intellectually, but even evolutionarily. Our minds draw inferences about the state of world by combining sensory input with our prior knowledge of likelihoods of all possible states of the world, and conditional probabilities of all possible sensory inputs given each possible state of world. In that sense our minds are very strong Bayesian computers. Our minds do those calculations faster than we snap our fingers. The animals in the wild are more likely to expect ruffling of leaves as a sign of approaching predator than are humans who have much less likelihood of finding themselves cornered by a predator. We learn these prior probabilities not only from experience but they are also hardwired in our minds since birth. I wish I could use more examples from the book but I can't remember from top of my head.    Embed Quote Updated 9 Jun, 2014. 427 views.
