What is a good source for learning about Bayesian networks?
For understanding the mathematics behind Bayesian networks, the Judea Pearl texts [1], [2] are a good place to start. I also enjoyed Learning Bayesian Networks [3]. There's also a free text by David MacKay [4] that's not really a great introduction but makes for an enjoyable read. [1] http://www.amazon.com/Causality-... [2] http://www.amazon.com/Probabilis...
