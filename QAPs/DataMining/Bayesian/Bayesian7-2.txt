★What are some real-life applications of Bayesian Belief Networks?
A quick application which may be of interest: head-to-head ranking of competitors. MSR created TrueSkill (http://research.microsoft.com/en...), a Bayesian network with the goal of accurately modeling the relative skill of players in head-to-head competitions. A very nice explanation can also be found at http://www.moserware.com/2010/03.... In general, applications are far and wide. Any recent machine learning conference which has significant focus on applications (KDD, WWW, even IJCAI or AAAI) will have a great number of papers which are essentially various Bayesian networks made specifically to model data in various real-world applications.    Embed Quote
