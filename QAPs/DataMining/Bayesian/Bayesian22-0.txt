Are prejudices similar to prior distributions in Bayesian models?
The word prejudice has several slightly different senses. One of these is simply "preconceived judgment." Bayesian prior distributions are a way to describe prior beliefs, so with this meaning prejudices are indeed closely related to Bayesian priors. However, I think the question is about a different sense: the one we use when we talk about racial prejudice (for example). When we accuse someone of racial prejudice, we are not simply ascribing to him a prior belief about a racial group. There is a further component of irrationality here: this kind of prejudice is a prior belief which is impervious to contrary evidence. Bayesian calculations allow for rational updating of prior beliefs in light of new evidence. If prejudices are irrational (as I am claiming), the Bayesian framework will not serve directly as a model for prejudiced thinking. But we might use Bayesian calculations to describe how prejudiced thinking departs from rationality.    Embed Quote
