What is a "Bayesian approach to data science"?
I'm not sure the question is clear enough. Bayesianism is an approach to statistics not data science. Statistics is generally concerned with "how to make decisions", estimation/prediction (of models), or "what is the right way to validate ideas", and there are a few others that don't come to mind right now. Data science is more concerned with aggregating data (how to compute stuff from data), meta analysis, and more recently how to visualize data. There is a strong connection though, Bayesians use meta analysis quite often in order to get some hints for their prior. And just to be clear, for those who see the slight ambiguity, I am not necessarily suggesting that meta analysis implies the reuse of data. My favorite book on the subject is "Bayesian Data Analysis" by Gelman et al. It has some great meta analysis examples.    Embed Quote
