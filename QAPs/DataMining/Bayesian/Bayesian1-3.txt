★What is the difference between Bayesian and frequentist statisticians?
The term "Bayesian" statistics has caught so many meanings, it has to be disambiguated before answering such a question. The term might be used whenever conditioning using Bayes theorem. This might be due to several motivations: (a) To capture our subjective beliefs. (b) To capture a hierarchical sampling scheme. They can obviously be combined, as in "Hierarchical Bayes". When the "prior" represents some (physical) population, you are dealing with a frequentist setup. So there is no difference between a "Bayesian" and a frequentist. The difference arises when the prior (thus the posterior) represent subjective believes. To distuinguish the two, many names have been suggested such as "pure Bayes", "De-Finetti Bayes", "Epistemic Bayes",...
