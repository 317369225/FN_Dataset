★What are some real-life applications of Bayesian Belief Networks?
Bayesian networks (BN) have been used to build medical diagnostic systems. The networks are hand-built by medical experts and later used to infer likelihood of different causes given observed symptoms. Similar systems have also been built for diagnosing problems in factories and other mechanical systems. In systems biology, BN structure learning is used to infer different types of biological networks from data. Here, the qualitative structure of the learned network is the main output because it maps fairly well (but not perfectly) to biochemical pathways and networks. The learned BN isn't normally used for future inference. Spam filters and many other binary or multinomial classifiers are implemented using Naive BN. While they are technically BN, they are 1) only one level deep and 2) assume that the parents of the label node are independent. These simplifications make them computationally efficient with large amounts of data but eliminate many of the benefits of a full BN. The most (in)famous example of BN is Clippy, the Microsoft Office assistant. MS Research actually has many of the leading BN researchers but Clippy ended up being a terrible application of BN.    Embed Quote
