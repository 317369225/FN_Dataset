What are the advantages of Bayesian methods over frequentist methods in web data?
Bayesian methods allow us to use priors to help with regularization. Let's say you have a simple upvote capability on your site to upvote Bert and Ernie. Bert has 2 upvotes and 0 downvotes, while Ernie has 45 upvotes and 5 downvotes. A simple frequentist MLE estimate would rank Bert above Ernie, as Bert has 100% upvotes, while Ernie has only 90% upvotes. This unfair to Ernie as Bert barely has any respondants. What we can do is attach a prior to Bert and Ernie This would be equivalent to giving them some upvotes and downvotes even before we start collecting user data. We can give each 1 upvote and 1 downvote (this is equivalent to placing a flat Beta(1,1) prior on your distribution of what their true proportion upvotes should be). Now Bert will have 3 upvotes and 1 downvote while Ernie will have 46 upvotes and 6 downvotes. Bert will now be 75% upvotes while Ernie will be 88% upvotes. We will now rank Ernie above Bert. This kind of prior usage is a very easy way to deal with proportions data. This is an easy way to deal with things like upvote data, click-through rates, conversion rates, when making decisions regarding ad campaigns, item prioritization, or similarity metrics. The priors here help make sure that things don't get too extreme when there's too little data. Note: There are also more more complicated ways that help induce a sort of regularization to this kind of data.
