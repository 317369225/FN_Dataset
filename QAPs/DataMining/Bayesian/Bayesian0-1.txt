Are we all Bayesians?
If you mean "are people, before training, Bayesians or frequentists?" then I say we are neither Bayesians nor frequentists we are WAGgers (wild ass guessers) and we are thoughtless consumers of statistics. For instance: The weather forecast says "20% chance of rain". Does the typical person have any idea what this means? I would be surprised. We hear "XXXX gets clothes 42% cleaner than clothes washed without XXX" does the typical person wonder "How the BLEEP do you  measure cleanliness in %?" We hear that the "margin of error" on a poll is plus or minus 2 % and we then come up with nonsense like "statistical dead heat". We hear that the life expectancy of smokers is XXX years less than that of nonsmokers and we conclude that smoking takes XXX years of your particular life. We ignore variation, we ignore complexity, we're horrible at guessing probablity and, as Kahneman and Tversky showed, we reason using heuristics (see e.g. Thinking Fast and Slow). Meanwhile both frequentists and Bayesians have their problems. I wrote poems: An Ode to a Frequentist Ode to a Bayesian    Embed Quote
