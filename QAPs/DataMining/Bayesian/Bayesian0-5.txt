Are we all Bayesians?
Have a look at Sir David Cox' opinion on the matter, discussing some problems that Bayesians might face. Cox on Bayesian Stats And here is Andrew Gelman's reply: Philosophy of Bayesian statistics: my reactions to Cox and Mayo - Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science Moreover, there are(!) frequentist interpretations of probabilities in philosophy. If you're interested in that, have a look at the following article: Interpretations of Probability Especially the frequentist and propensity interpretation could be interesting for you. Last, but not least one interesting difference that excited me when I did Bayesian stats is the so-called Likelihood principle. In short, this means that frequentist tests do not only depend on the data that was observed, but the data that could have been observed/the set-up of the experiment.    Embed Quote
