Are we all Bayesians?
Frequentist statistics is still the mainstream in much of science. That's because it appears to offer an objective way to assess evidence, whereas the Bayesian approach requires suspicious-seeming priors that are often controversial. More about this in Michael Betancourt's answer to Bayesian Inference: In what way is Bayes' law unscientific? But we are all Bayesians in that we interpret an observed confidence interval as a likely range of values for a parameter. No matter how fervently we recite the Frequentist liturgy, at this point the interval is fixed, so we must be thinking of the parameter as random.
