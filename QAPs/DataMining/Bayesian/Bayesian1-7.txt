★What is the difference between Bayesian and frequentist statisticians?
Gelman has an interesting paper on this difference (fair warning, he's biased towards Bayesian ;-) at http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.1423v1  Money quote: “frequentism” absolutely encourages people to use horrible, noisy estimates out of a fear of “bias.”  (This paper will most definitely bother your frequentist acquaintances.) The most pragmatic difference I personally see is that with Bayesian inference any policy simulation explicitly takes into account the distribution of the real parameters around the estimates (that is, you have to integrate them out of the final policy simulator, rather than plug a point estimate in the appropriate location in the simulation). Of course this makes simulation of policies very computationally intensive (leading to various numerical methods for integration).    Embed Quote
