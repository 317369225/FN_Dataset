What is a "Bayesian approach to data science"?
A Bayesian approach to data science is an attempt to deal with the problem of what 'statistically significant' means in situations where the 'prior probability' of the hypothesis is rather small. This is a particular problem with many pseudo-scientific hypotheses. Rather than assign equal probability to all outcomes, the Bayesian approach uses prior probabilities and Bayesian inference to adjust the significance of outcomes. Unfortunately this opens up a whole miasma of problems with where the prior probabilities come from and so on. Simmons et al (2011) Page on cornell.edu criticise this approach and suggest other ways to address the flood of 'statistically significant' false positives being produced in papers. The paper includes an excellent example in which they show, with statistical significance, that listening to a song about old age actually made people younger...    Embed Quote
