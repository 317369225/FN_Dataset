What is a good way to learn about Bayesian methods?
People throw around the word "Bayesian" because it sounds cool, trendy, and like a break from the stodgy past, not because the term has a particular meaning or describes a unified body of knowledge. Speaking very generally, Bayesian methods are typically ones that concern themselves with evaluating or estimating a conditional probability (a "posterior," or a "predictive" probability), given some observation and some assumptions made a priori. In the first half of the 20th century, mainstream statisticians often derided such techniques as improper applications of "inverse probability." The methods have made a huge comeback and are now very popular for a wide variety of applications. In some fields -- like psychology or cognitive science -- self-described "Bayesians" are particularly militant, perhaps because traditional statistical methods have been applied overzealously and dogmatically in those fields by older practitioners. The "Bayesians" in these fields see themselves as the new guard effecting a revolution. But saying you want to be "an expert in all things Bayesian" is not a realistic goal, as "Bayesian" is more often than not applied to any method that involves the evaluation of a conditional probability. A good general (and practical) introduction would be Gelman et al., "Bayesian Data Analysis," 2d ed. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obido... You might also enjoy the book-length technical polemic by the late E.T. Jaynes, "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science," http://www.amazon.com/Probabilit... This book has sparked a deep interest in probability and statistics for hordes of readers and is a fun and edifying read.    Embed Quote
