What are the most significant flaws in Bayesianism?
Let me expand a bit on Jay Verkuilen's answer. When you use Bayesian methods, you start with a prior, you get some data, and you combine those two things to get a posterior.  If you start with a good prior, you'll get a good posterior.  If you start with a bad prior, you'll get a bad posterior.  So, the question is then how you pick a good prior.  In theory, your prior corresponds to your actual beliefs, so you should be able to just go with those, but translating your beliefs about a situation into a probability distribution is not entirely trivial (i.e., very difficult). There are also computational issues associated with Bayesian methods.  It's not all that great when you have to wait a week for your sampler to converge so you can start getting a feel for the posterior, and the problem is even worse in high dimensions.    Embed Quote
