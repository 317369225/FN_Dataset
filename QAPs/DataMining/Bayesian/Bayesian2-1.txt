What is a "Bayesian approach to data science"?
There isn't really an answer to this question, at least not one along the lines I imagine you're looking for. A Bayesian approach to data science is just one where the analyst primarily employs Bayesian models. I suppose I'd venture that someone who called themselves a Bayesian data scientist would be more likely to approach analysis and problem solving with a likelihood based view, rather than the more algorithmic based view of someone who chose to label themselves, say, a machine learning expert. But I'd make that claim very loosely.    Embed Quote
