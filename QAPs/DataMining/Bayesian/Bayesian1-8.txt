★What is the difference between Bayesian and frequentist statisticians?
Bayesians think that probabilities are in the mind. They are states of knowledge or confidence rather than objective facts about the world (statistics/frequencies). One way to see that is the following experiment: I put some black and red balls in an urn, and ask you to assign a probability to picking a red ball. Your answer should be 50% (no reason to favor red over black). This has nothing to do with statistics, only with what you know and don't know. I then tell you that there are 10 red balls and 90 black balls. You update your probability to 10%. Yet nothing has actually changed about the urn. I then tell you that the 10 red balls are organized at the top of the urn. You update your probability to 90% (or some other high value). In all cases, you have to assign a probability with limited knowledge on an event that you are not allowed to test (it's a one-time event in the future) and the urn has not changed physically while we had the discussion.    Embed Quote
