Are we all Bayesians?
I personally think it depends  on the layer of abstraction you are mapping the construct 'we' to. At  the physiological level, things are profoundly Bayesian IMHO  (Brain/McCulloch-Pitts). Now, overlay 'mind' and you begin to see the makings of a  frequentist paradigm (and 'am guessing that this is what you allude to and so is Jack Rae).  But then, connect the minds and you get a society, which is again  Bayesian. This is a tangential ansatz based on how well concepts such as social network formulation, rumor propagation and other social phenomena has been organically dealt with within the Bayesian framework.    Embed Quote
