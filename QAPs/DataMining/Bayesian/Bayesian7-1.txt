★What are some real-life applications of Bayesian Belief Networks?
One of the important but lesser known applications of Bayesian Belief Networks is in Turbo Codes [1]. These are state-of-the-art codecs being used in Wireless 3G and 4G mobile telephony standards, which achieve performance close to the theoretical Shannon limit. The decoding algorithms used in Turbo Codes are equivalent to Pearl's Belief Propagation algorithm [2,3] on the Bayesian Network representing the Turbo coding-decoding process. The Bayesian Network representing the Turbo decoding problem from [3]: From [4]: Several new error-correcting decoding algorithms are instances of "probability propagation" in various Bayesian networks. These new schemes are rapidly closing the gap between the performances of practical channel coding systems and Shannon's 50-year-old channel coding limit. The Bayesian network framework exposes the similarities between these codes and leads the way to a new class of "trellis-constraint codes" which also operate close to Shannon's limit.
