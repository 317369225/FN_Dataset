★What should everyone know about natural language processing?
Building Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems is harder than it seems, partly because humans are very good at understanding natural language. Therefore, try first to accomplish manually what the system is supposed to do, to check that it is possible for a person. Lingpipe's Breck Baldwin phrased this nicely in Sometimes I Wish NLP Systems Occasionally Blew Up: Sadly, the tremendous promise of the field is held back by a combination  of overselling, under-delivering and lack of awareness of how to build  good performing systems... One of the greatest frustrations I face is severely underfunded  projects. For the most part rockets get a much healthier dose of funding  because people see the failures clearly and do not have a grasp of how  rockets work. Not so much for NLP. Language processing is so easy for humans that it is like trying to sell  cargo airplanes to eagles. They just don’t get what is hard, what is  easy and the necessity of infrastructure. “Mr. Eagle, um, well we really  need a runway to get the 20 tons of product into the air”. Mr. Eagle  responds with “What are you talking about? I can take off, land and  raise a family on a tree branch. Cargo planes are easy because flying is  easy for me. So I will give you a fish to do the job.”    Embed Quote
