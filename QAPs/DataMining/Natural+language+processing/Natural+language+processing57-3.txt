★Natural Language Processing: What are good algorithms related to sentiment analysis?
I am not sure what you meant by algorithms related to Sentiment Analysis. What I feel sentiment analysis is more than just a single algorithm. Let me explain myself a little bit. Since, sentiment analysis is very basic technique in NLP and it hardly uses the real power of NLP, but anyway you can use Latent Semantic Analysis. This may not give you very good results if you are dealing with short text or messages. But if you incorporate some of modified techniques like removing stopwords change sentiments based on slangs used incorporating abbreviations incorporating emoticonsyou may likely to improve the results. So, your best bet is on LSA with these or even more additional features. I hope my answer addresses your question.    Embed Quote
