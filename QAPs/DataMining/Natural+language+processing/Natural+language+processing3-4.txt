★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
People who are smart enough and have enough drive to do ML well are rare. That's a tiny percentage, even in the software industry. People with the connections to get funding are rare. That's another tiny percentage, which is why founders are able to get people to work 90-hour weeks for sub-0.1-percent equity (i.e. their employees don't have the option of doing their own startups). The correlation between those two factors is almost zero. Multiply two small numbers together and you get a really small number, even relative to the magnitude of the two numbers being multiplied.    Embed Quote
