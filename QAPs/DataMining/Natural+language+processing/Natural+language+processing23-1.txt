★What are the best schools for studying Natural Language Processing?
According to Google Scholar metrics 2014, some of the top journals/conferences in Computational Linguistics/Natural Language Processing are: Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING) Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL) While making individual effort for selecting the right graduate school in NLP, I did a small experiment: I extracted all publication links from Google Scholar categorized under these top journals/conferences which pointed to an ACM Digital Library link, then scanned the publication summary to retrieve the authors and their universities. Here's the rundown: There were 222 different publications and the contributing authors hailed from ~150 different universities worldwide. Total contributor count for an university is the total number of authors (including repitition) from a particular university whose name turned up in at least one of the publications. Total publication count for an university is the total number of publications that had an author from that university. The universities mentioned comprised ~64% of all publications. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and IBM had a major contribution as well but I excluded them from this list. Important note: The experiment includes only articles having citation count >= the h5-index of the particular journal in which it was published according to Google Scholar.    Embed Quote
