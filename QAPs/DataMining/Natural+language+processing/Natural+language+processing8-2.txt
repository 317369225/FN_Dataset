★What makes natural language processing difficult?
Interesting question. My take on this is that it is mostly because of the nature of computers and programming languages that we develop to control computers. Computers are extremely good at manipulating syntax (for example, count how many times the word and appears into that 120 pages document), but they are extremely weak at manipulating concepts. As a matter of fact, a concept is totally stranger to computer processes. On the other hand, natural language is all about concepts and it only uses syntax as a transient means to get to it. I personally developed languages to manipulate concepts (available here: True Natural Language Understanding through a Conceptual Language Understanding Engine), and the results were that natural-language processing became way easier as a result. So, to answer your question with the most precise and concise statement as possible, I'd say that the fact that a computer is unaware about conceptual processing dimension makes it difficult to process natural language since the purpose of natural languages is to convey concepts (and syntax is only used as a transient means in natural language). Such a limitation can be alleviated by making computer processes more aware about the conceptual dimension. This is almost a philosophical question. In natural language, syntax is a means, and concept is the goal. If you relate to transportation for example, a road is the means where getting from point A to point B is the goal. If extra-terrestrial would come to earth long before we are gone and would find roads all over the place, would they be able to make some sense about transportation just by analyzing the means? Probably not! You can't analyze the means exclusively in order to fully understand an object of knowledge. This is, on the other hand, what we do with natural language by limiting our analysis to syntax (this is condemned to fail).    Embed Quote
