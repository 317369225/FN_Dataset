★What are the available APIs for NLP (Natural Language Processing)?What are the (open and commercial) available APIs for doing Natural Language Processing?
OpenAmplify, www.openamplify.com, has an API for NLP. The Insights API service uses multi-patented text analysis software to take text (interviews, comments, blogs, tweets, web pages, reviews, etc.) and return to you an XML document that details: •  Topic & Entities = What's being discussed •  Sentiment = Whether an author’s view is positive or negative for both the whole document and each topic – “My BMW is Great!” •  Guidance = Offering or requesting advice or direction on a topic – “You must buy a BMW!” or “Should I buy a BMW?” •  Intentions = What action the author plans or intends to take and when – “Let’s go check out a BMW this weekend.” •  Decisiveness = how likely the action is to be taken – “We really must go and test drive that BMW.” •  Time Scale = when the action is likely to be taken •  Flamboyance = a measure of how "passionate" the writing style is – “I really love those new stylish BMWs, Totally Awesome, especially the All-New 6 Gran Coupe!”    Embed Quote
