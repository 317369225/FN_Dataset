★What programming languages are suitable for natural language processing?
Since no one has mentioned it yet, Java has OpenNLP (Welcome to Apache OpenNLP), LingPipe (LingPipe Home) and Stanford CoreNLP (The Stanford NLP (Natural Language Processing) Group).  Additionally Lucene can also be helpful providing comprehensive text analysis and tokenization (across languages), though it mainly focuses on information retreival / text search: Welcome to Apache Lucene Additionally it has a ton of other projects that will support your NLP efforts, e.g., providing machine learning functionality like these: WEKA http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/index.html Mahout https://mahout.apache.org/ LibSVM LIBSVM -- A Library for Support Vector Machinesand some of the most widely used and popular projects for large scale data processing and machine learning: Hadoop Welcome to Apache™ Hadoop®! Spark Apache Spark™ - Lightning-Fast Cluster Computing Mahout https://mahout.apache.org/ I don't see why anyone would say "don't use any compiled languages" - that seems to be completely groundless.  Especially something like Java which is a breeze to use and build programs with, especially with modern IDEs, and has scripting languages you can run on top of the JVM with any Java libraries.  Not to mention in most benchmarks Java is significantly faster than python (and other interpreted languages) across most tasks.
