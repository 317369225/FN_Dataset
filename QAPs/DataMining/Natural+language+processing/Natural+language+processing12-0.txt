★What are all the ways Quora uses natural language processing (NLP)?Wikipedia definition of natural language processing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat...
It uses a combination of both Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing to ensure high-quality content on the site. Classification (machine learning) algorithm for grouping questions into categories. Parsing algorithm for grammar correction. Cluster analysis & SMD Similarity  calculating algorithm for finding duplicate questions. AGV like algorithm which gives the relevance of the questions returned as instant search results & the relevance of the suggested topics to questions being asked. It finds a kind of homogeneity in a data set and divide them in a finite number of clusters. It also uses a similar algorithm for Rankings. Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), when you ask a question, it automatically assigns some topics to it. It also uses Thrift. Other than that cose is primarily based on Python (programming language) , Tornado (web framework) , PyPy. Other than that one thing I'm sure about is their Machine Learning Projects include the word "Deep"  ☞ Adam D'Angelo on Twitter    Embed Quote
