★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
ML and NLP don't work that well in the general case.  To make them work satisfactorily, you have to restrict yourself to a subset of the general task at hand and fine-tune for that application. To do that, you need data and an existing product.  To get that, you need lots of work building something that people want regardless of the ML tricks you're using. There are lots of good ML and NLP systems deployed right now, but few startups just generally "doing ML" (maybe Hunch was?) because without any  context you can't really get good results out.    Embed Quote
