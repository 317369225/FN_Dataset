★What is the bottleneck holding back true (non-statistical) Natural Language Processing?
If only rule-based NLP is used, then one of the big difficulties will be the huge amount of grammar rules that will have to be engineered into the system. Imagine having to write a grammar that covers the whole English language, then imagine doing the same thing for every other language you want your system to support, then imagine writing rules for translation. Having a large number of rules hurts performance as well. So basically the problem is that some tasks will either be incredibly complicated to do using a rule-based approach, or that we simply don't know how it can be done because we don't know how humans do it. That's why machine learning techniques are used a lot in NLP, usually in conjunction with rule-based approaches.    Embed Quote
