★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
There are three fundamental reasons: A massive gap exists between a research prototype and a polished product for most ML-driven technologies. It is incredibly difficult to monetize a business that starts with ML as its core value proposition - this becomes a cool technology seeking a use case seeking a business model. Very few companies have successfully navigated the path from "a cool algorithm that does X% better at Y," to "software that people use or that changes behavior of a system," to "a very valuable business." (Google's one) For most problems, ML really shines once you hit a certain volume and velocity of data. ML becomes increasingly valuable as a company goes larger, but it is rarely something that it makes sense for most businesses to focus on initially. For example, think about how you'd make a book recommendation given one user and ten books vs. a million books and a billion users. I don't think it's true that there are "so few machine learning and natural language processing startups" though. If I spent a bit of time on this, I'm confident that I can generate a list of hundreds of active ones with funding. I would say that many of these have refocused on specific domains and use cases, with the ML component being one key component of a much larger product offering.    Embed Quote
