★Are there any JavaScript natural language processing projects?So far I found only this simple part of speech tagger http://code.google.com/p/jspos/ Wondering if there are more comprehensive NLP projects for JavaScript. And why does Python have so many and JavaScript have so few?
I recently wrote an interactive version of the BLEU metric that is used to evaluate the translations from any statistical machine translation system. It contains a native JS implementation of the metric but also visualizes the scores and allows comparing to Google and Bing translations with one click. See http://ibleu.googlecode.com    Embed Quote
