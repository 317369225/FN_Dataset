★How do I develop a resume parser using NLP (Natural Language Processing)?
Thanks for asking this questions to me. You people are asking complete inside of our product. search on quora we answered this question. In short -- learn about NLP, hire one good data scientist who has passion about Data Mining / Extraction. And you are done .... Once you write a algorithm which do not conflict with any other patent, then try it in market and tweak for better results. if you are looking for a overnight solution then please do not focus on NLP,  this is not someting you can build in 10-15 days and come out with perfect solution. In case you still need any detailed replies, feel free to write me . Vinay    Embed Quote
