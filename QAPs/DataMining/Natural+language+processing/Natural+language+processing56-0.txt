★What is the best Natural Language Processing textbook(s)?I'd like to learn something about NLP, at least some general understanding to later decide if its a field I'd like to go deeper.  I see that everywhere people is suggesting Coursera's NLP course, but I'm not great with that approach to learning; I'm a books person. Which books would you recommend?
(Sorry for the bold text.  Apparently Quora's editor has a bug.) "Speech and Language Processing" is the standard university textbook: Speech and Language Processing (2nd Edition): Daniel Jurafsky, James H. Martin.  This book is also available in draft form as a PDF. I've heard good things about "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing": Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing: Christopher D. Manning, Hinrich Schuetze Both texts cover underlying theory, especially the application of probability/statistics and machine learning to the analysis of NLP.  The first is much more encyclopedic, including material on morphology and speech; the latter focuses more specifically, on probabilistic text analysis (parsing, tagging, info retrieval, etc). In contrast, "Natural Language Processing with Python"  Natural Language Processing with Python: Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, Edward Loper  is more applied, illustrating use of the NLTK (natural language toolkit) to do NLP analysis using Python.    Embed Quote
