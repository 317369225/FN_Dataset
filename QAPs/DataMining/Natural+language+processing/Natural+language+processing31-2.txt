★What are the biggest open problems in natural language processing?
Trying to make the computer simulate consciousness. As a child learns to speak, they mimic sounds and associate meaning. A computer doesn't have those environmental cues and context. So, a computer can learn by being told yes and no only. Or perhaps respond to silence or a laugh sound. Then it is statistical analysis of the sentences in whatever books or scripts have been loaded into memory. If that were done, I think a computer would emit sounds that would be profoundly insightful on various subjects. If the book were loaded in memory.    Embed Quote
