★What are the best schools for studying Natural Language Processing?
Columbia University! NLP is one of the most active research areas here in the CS department. We have some really renowned people like Michael Collins, Kathy McKeown, Owen Rambow, Julia Hirschberg, Nizar Habash, Mona Diab and Becky Passonneau. Consequently there are a lot of projects that you could possibly get the opportunity to work on, under one of the aforementioned. The funding scene for NLP projects seems pretty decent too.    Embed Quote
