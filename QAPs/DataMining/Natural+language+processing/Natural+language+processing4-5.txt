★What programming languages are suitable for natural language processing?
At the moment people seem to use Java, Python, C++, Lisp, and Prolog. You could use anything; but what language us use really is determined by the type of approach you are taking. Java lends itself to supporting community initiatives and real world implementations by teams of people. Python has similar attributes but is the language of choice in big US universities at the moment. C++ provides (if you really know what you are doing) performance advantages. LISP and Prolog provide alternative styles of programming that suit the implementation of algorithms with particular structures—quite a few parsers use Prolog for example.    Embed Quote
