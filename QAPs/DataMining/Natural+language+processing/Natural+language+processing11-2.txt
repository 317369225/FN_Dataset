★Can natural language process structured information from a text?
This is something I've been occasionally working on for a while now. I have a parser prototype built but it's too slow in its current form. Eventually I'll get it converted over from Python to C or C++ to increase its speed and release it as open source. I'll try to let you know here when I do, or you can contact me if you'd be interested in helping out in that effort. In the mean time, check out the link grammar parser. (http://abisource.com/projects/li...) It's not exactly a semantic net that's produced, but it's possible to apply graph rewrite rules to transform it into one.    Embed Quote
