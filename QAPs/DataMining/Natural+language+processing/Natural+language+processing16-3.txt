★Natural Language Processing: Why did Google share their "ngrams" data for free?
At least in Germany there is a lot of critique in scanning all the books (not so much in the US). By making the data public Google builds a case in being able to defend himself (as they acted in the public interest) - and the possibility that this whole act of scanning everything backfires in expensive liabilities. I believe someone got scared. And I also believe they want to do good - and build on the possibilities. But I think it is about 50/50 the bad and the good. A little bit like the case that google bet on the frequencies bands, but was not interested in winning. United States 2008 wireless spectrum auction IMO    Embed Quote
