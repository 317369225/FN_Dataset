★What exactly is Deep Natural Language Processing (DNLP)?See also: What are good examples of shallow natural language processing (SNLP)?
Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana. Distinguishing these two sentences requires "deep" processing. Actual understanding of the semantics of the words and the meaning of the overall sentence. Note that the first three words in each sentence change their grammatical component depending on the overall meaning. The second sentence retains a certain ambiguity as it could be either of Noun-verb-comparator-participle-noun Adjective-noun-verb-participle-noun Although the first interpretation is rather strange unless you haven't come across the common Fruit Fly. "Shallow" processing involves understanding at the word level only. It will work for simple sentences like "the cat sat on the mat" but fails for more sophisticated sentences. Many people have seen this failure with so-called Chinglish user manuals (written in poor English translated from Chinese).    Embed Quote
