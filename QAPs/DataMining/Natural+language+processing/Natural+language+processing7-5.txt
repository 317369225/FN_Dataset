★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
Factual is hiring in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley. Our goal is to create an open data platform that can be used by developers and companies to build great apps and websites. We have an awesome founder, an awesome team, and just raised a large Series A from Andreessen-Horowitz. We're definitely looking for people with experience in machine learning and/or NLP. We aim to extract as much structured information as possible from a large corpus of unstructured data, and there are many challenging problems to pursue -- data extraction, cleaning, deduping, etc. Please email me (or jobs at factual.com) if you're interested or have any questions.    Embed Quote
