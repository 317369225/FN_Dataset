★How mature is Natural Language Processing technology as of May 2014?
A very subjective question. You may use your own personal experience with either Siri on iPhone or Cortana on Windows Phone to judge how mature you believe it to be, at least in an applied commercial sense. There is a lot happening in academia to advance the state-of-the-art in NLP.  (Check out Percy Liang's work on Semantics for a flavor of where this is going.) My personal opinion is that we now have a strong baseline of utility, (whereas before we had almost none - try training Nuance's Dragon Naturally Speaking to get a sense for how frustrating this used to be before Siri.) We are just at the very beginning of realizing the promise of NLP.    Embed Quote
