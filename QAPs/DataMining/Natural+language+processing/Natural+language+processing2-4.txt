★What exactly is Deep Natural Language Processing (DNLP)?See also: What are good examples of shallow natural language processing (SNLP)?
The depth of an NLP system, assuming the use of a neural network (NN), refers to the number of hidden layers in the NN. Early NNs had just one hidden layer. Advances in algorithms and computing power have made NNs with multiple hidden layers feasible. 'Deep' has been conflated with ensemble approaches where a combination of algorithms are used to create scores that are then processed through an algorithm(s) that detects more subtle relationships.    Embed Quote
