★What makes natural language processing difficult?
Many things, but basically it's because text is not very computer-friendly. Language is inherently very high dimensional and sparse. There are tons of rare words, words can mean the same thing in different contexts, etc. Language is organized in a hierarchical manner. Characters form words which form sentences which form documents which form ideas. Which level do we target? Order and context are extremely important. "I shot a photo" and "I shot a person" have vastly different meanings even though they differ by a very small amount. There are many different ways to represent the same thing. Text isn't just characters on a screen, it's a way for us to share ideas, concepts, and memories. We usually communicate concepts/ideas/memories by relating them to other things, which means for a computer to fully understand language it first must understand humans. This problem has led to us breaking down the field of Natural Language Processing into basically a bunch of individually-solvable problems, skirting the requirement of truly understanding language.    Embed Quote
