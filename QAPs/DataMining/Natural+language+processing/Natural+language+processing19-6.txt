★What are some good resources for getting started learning about natural language processing?This is a follow-up question to What are some good books on natural language processing and semantic analysis?.  I'm interested not just in textbooks, but papers, blogs, basic programming toolkits, etc.
Disclosure: I work for AlchemyAPI. AlchemyAPI offers an API that can perform many common natural language processing tasks, such as entity extraction, keyword identification, sentiment analysis, etc. To get started learning about natural language processing, you can request a free API key to get 1,000 calls per day, use our SDKs and/or interact with our demo. Much more info can be found on our website: http://www.alchemyapi.com/    Embed Quote
