★How do I develop a resume parser using NLP (Natural Language Processing)?
Start with a minimalistic solution just to see what you can extract. The key to hacking together something quick is that it is going to be far from perfect. What is the baseline thing that you can create that will make you say, "cool! Let's improve on that." Try to extract something simple like education, name, or contact information. Using intuition you can look for names in the first part of resumes and extract headers to give you better local awareness to what to parse. For instance, if you find education and words containing degrees, you are likely to find surrounding text to tell you what university, what degree, where and when they graduated. Most people that format their resumes will separate sections with whitespace to make it easy to read. Regarding nlp, just remember your regex, tokenization and use corpus to hint at important information.    Embed Quote
