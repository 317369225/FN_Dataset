★What are the biggest open problems in natural language processing?
This one: "A car flew off a bridge." It requires actual human experience to "parse" correctly - knowing that cars don't have wings and knowing that there are such things like the laws of physics (in this case, gravity). If you tell that to a human, he will instantly know the meaning of the sentence. A computer would be none the wiser. Also this one: "I liked your product as much as I like being poked in the eye with a stick." It's highly likely this will be interpreted as positive sentiment instead of negative sentiment. How would a computer know humans don't like getting poked in the eyes with sticks? The common thing between them is they require no less than a Strong AI (Artificial general intelligence).    Embed Quote
