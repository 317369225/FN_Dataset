★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
I'm involved with two ML/NLP startups that do text mining. I work exclusively with PhD's. What I can tell you about PhD's is that they're not all alike. So don't pigeon hole them. I think the answer to the question, as many people have alluded to, is because people don't like solving really hard problems. Especially when it seems so easy to build a $0.99 app that makes fart noises.    Embed Quote
