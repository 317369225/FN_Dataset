★What are the available APIs for NLP (Natural Language Processing)?What are the (open and commercial) available APIs for doing Natural Language Processing?
There are several available, Chatterbox, Alchemy API, Clarabridge… It just depends on what you’re looking for. Personally, I prefer Semantria (http://www.Semantria.com). They’re an SAAS text and sentiment analysis API. As mentioned they are based off Lexalytics engine, which is pretty cool. I have used their English and French language analysis with great success and they also fully support Spanish, German, and Portuguese.   Semantria identifies the categories, entities, themes, and sentiment of my text. They also have queries available, but I have yet to try them. So far, I'm really impressed with their tool, especially their sentiment analysis. I can find the sentiment of full documents or individual elements and make my own adjustments to their sentiment dictionary. They also just released a language detection feature, which is really handy when you have text in all different languages.   There is a learning curve to using their tool, but they have some online tutorials (Tutorials | semantria.com) and a responsive support team. So despite the learning curve, in my opinion it’s totally worth it.    Embed Quote
