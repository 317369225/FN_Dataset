★Are there any JavaScript natural language processing projects?So far I found only this simple part of speech tagger http://code.google.com/p/jspos/ Wondering if there are more comprehensive NLP projects for JavaScript. And why does Python have so many and JavaScript have so few?
NLP is a set of techniques and some of them are not resource intensive so it's perfectly possible to use NLP on a browser. If you can read in portuguese or you can translate it to your language, you can access my blog where I already have some snippets: http://www.erickfernandes.com. I'm planning to launch a NLP JS library for running on browser as an open source project and would like to hear some thoughts...    Embed Quote
