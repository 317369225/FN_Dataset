★What makes natural language processing difficult?
I agree with all the above answers and think it pretty much answers the questions. To just add a few points : 1. Ambiguity : One of the biggest problems. Different languages have different structures and different ways of interpreting. There are languages without spaces or word dividers which makes it hard to even parse them ! Conversion between languages is one of the most difficult tasks and the way we try to resolve it is by writing lots and lots of rules that we know exist in those languages 2. Data variation : Most of the NLP systems give a > 90% accuracy for data which it is trained and tested on. NLP systems are application specific and need restructuring for the same kind of problem but for different application. Main reason behind this is the language, syntax and semantic used in each application. We humans allow variations and adapt to them easily and understand the difference between different domains. To emulate them into computers is like writing lots and lots of rules ! So we have algorithms, which tries to learn these "rules" from the data itself. But when the data itself is so sparse and variant, building a complete and correct systems becomes difficult    Embed Quote
