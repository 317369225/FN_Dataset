★What is the best natural language processing MOOC?
Well so far there haven't been that many unfortunately. General, introductory NLP courses: Natural Language Processing by Columbia University Michael Collins (Spring 2013; 80-100 workload; Coursera) Natural Language Processing by Stanford Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning (Spring 2012; 60-80 workload; Coursera) These two generalist NLP courses are great, but I wish there existed more advanced NLP, like: MT class (no video) More specific courses: Text Retrieval and Search Engines by UIUC ChengXiang Zhai (Spring 2015; 16-24 workload; Coursera) Text Mining and Analytics by UIUC ChengXiang Zhai (Spring 2015; 20-40 workload; Coursera) Related: Semantic Web Technologies by HPI Harald Sack (Spring 2013, HPI) Knowledge Engineering with Semantic Web Technologies by HPI Harald Sack (Spring 2014, HPI)    Embed Quote
