★What are the available APIs for NLP (Natural Language Processing)?What are the (open and commercial) available APIs for doing Natural Language Processing?
You may take a look at VisualText and the NLP++ progamming language which is tailored for the requirements of Natural Language processing. You can download the VisualText IDE including NLP++ and use it for non-commercial projects for free: Getting Started Package NLP++ is fully transparent. You don't get a black box API you can't customize yourself. It takes some time to learn and understand NLP++ and the multi-pass strategy of VisualText but you get a very flexible and fast environment. Further, you can continually improve your text analyzer. You can join the NLP++ Community and ask questions, discuss your anaylzers and learn more about NLP++. Last but not least, the inventors and developers of NLP++, Amnon Meyers and David de Hilster, are active in this community as well.
