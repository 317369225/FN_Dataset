★Natural Language Processing: What's the cutting edge for NLP?After reading the blistering review on the new Summly acquisition, it seems like startups that are marketed as NLP are not actually that cutting edge. What are some of the coolest things that people are doing in NLP, and how are they translating it to products?
I cannot say if people are already translating it to products, but one of the exciting things going on in both NLP and IR is the process of extracting or acquiring knowledge from unstructured text. The web is full of knowledge; when we read blogs, online newspapers, etc., it's relatively easy for us (as humans) to extract that knowledge. We cannot say the same thing for computers, at least not in its full breadth. There is though promising research towards that, for instance the Never Ending Language Learner (NELL) project as one user suggested; the OpenIE from the turing center at University of Washington, etc.    Embed Quote
