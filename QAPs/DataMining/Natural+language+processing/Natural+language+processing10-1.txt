★How does natural language processing work?
Most of the current work relies on statistics built on large bodies of data, with varying amounts of human-annotated data attached to them. This could range from a book with parse trees annotated on each sentence, and with a semantic lexicon attached in correspondence with each word, to just a bunch of raw news articles scraped from the web, and there are different strategies for dealing with each, but for the most part, they just build statistical models of what's going on and try to predict from there. As commented, it's hard to answer this question without a clearer understanding of what you mean by it.    Embed Quote
