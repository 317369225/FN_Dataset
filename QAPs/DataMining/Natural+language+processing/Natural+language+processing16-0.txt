★Natural Language Processing: Why did Google share their "ngrams" data for free?
We chose to share the Ngrams data for a few reasons: We thought it would help researchers conduct experiments they couldn't perform any other way. We thought it would help draw attention to an ancillary benefit of scanning millions of books. We thought it would help others improve their NLP applications. Why not share? I've been very pleased with our decision.  Google makes many charitable donations; hopefully this can be viewed as an act of charity where the medium is not money but data.
