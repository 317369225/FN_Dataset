★How does natural language processing work?
NLP is first a stack of algorithms, that produce the annotations over the text. Roughly, the steps are tokenization, meaning separating the words (almost trivial for written English, but difficult for spoken languages or written Chinese). Subsequently, the parts of speech are identified, the dependency relations between words and the identification of the meaning of the word, if there are multiple entries in a dictionary for the same token. All these algorithms are as of today stochastic, it is not guaranteed that they return the correct answer. Once the annotations are in place, SQL-like querying can be issued, so that useful data is being extracted. Other applications of NLP are summarization of texts, detection of certain sequences in text (for instance, what part has been broken before the customer complained), text clustering (division of the statements in bins, on a predefined criterion), attribution (determine who wrote an anonymous text, given large samples of a number of individuals' works).    Embed Quote
