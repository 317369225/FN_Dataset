★Natural Language Processing: What are the most important research papers which all NLP students should definitely read?Which NLP research papers (no matter whether classic or state-of-the-art) do you recommend students to read, if you were a teacher/professor/adviser? And why?
If you were a student who wanted to get and idea about NLP, I'd recommend a textbook, for example Manning and Schuetze, FSNLP, 1999. Then, if you were interested in a particular topic, you'd better familiarise yourself with a particular chapter in a textbook, see the suggested reading list in that chapter, and proceed from there.    Embed Quote
