★Are there any JavaScript natural language processing projects?So far I found only this simple part of speech tagger http://code.google.com/p/jspos/ Wondering if there are more comprehensive NLP projects for JavaScript. And why does Python have so many and JavaScript have so few?
I am not sure if this qualifies as NLP, but here you can find a JavaScript Logo-like language interpreter and canvas render engine for turtle graphics. http://www.jsclasses.org/package... Full disclosure: I moderate this site.    Embed Quote
