★Natural Language Processing: What are the most important research papers which all NLP students should definitely read?Which NLP research papers (no matter whether classic or state-of-the-art) do you recommend students to read, if you were a teacher/professor/adviser? And why?
I think it depends on the students' background. I think even undergrads can learn something from The Unreasonable effectiveness of Data by Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira (here is a link to the pdf version http://bit.ly/ieRXNk). It is a great overview of today's trends. A Grand Challenge for Linguistics by Bender and Good is a white paper on the future challenges of linguistic data. I think comp.sci. and linguistics students have to read it because it deals with very relevant theoretical and technical problems. (You can find it here in pdf version http://bit.ly/cUGq9W) I really don't know what should someone include in the list. It really depends on one's taste and background. I think Chomsky's views on the limits of probabilistic methods expressed in his Syntactic Structures  and Charniak's book, Statistical Language Learning, are great historical examples. Montague's papers are great examples of the birth of modern semantics and computational semantics too. Indexing by Latent Semantic Analysis by Dreewester, Dumais, and Harshman, when read after Montague, gives a great contrast btw the two approaches.    Embed Quote
