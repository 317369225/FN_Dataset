★Are there any JavaScript natural language processing projects?So far I found only this simple part of speech tagger http://code.google.com/p/jspos/ Wondering if there are more comprehensive NLP projects for JavaScript. And why does Python have so many and JavaScript have so few?
The reason JavaScript has so few is because, up until a year ago, its primary use case was in the browser. Typically speaking, NLP is difficult and resource intensive even server-side. It has no real place client side (unless you were doing some kind of distributed model, and even then, there's a root server). Python's had its place in academia for some time, too, as evidenced by SAGE, so NLP is just a natural fit in that regard.    Embed Quote
