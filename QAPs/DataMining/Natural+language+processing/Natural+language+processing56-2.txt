★What is the best Natural Language Processing textbook(s)?I'd like to learn something about NLP, at least some general understanding to later decide if its a field I'd like to go deeper.  I see that everywhere people is suggesting Coursera's NLP course, but I'm not great with that approach to learning; I'm a books person. Which books would you recommend?
Recently I made a little research concerning the most reading NLP books. If you are interested check it here Best NLP books    Embed Quote
