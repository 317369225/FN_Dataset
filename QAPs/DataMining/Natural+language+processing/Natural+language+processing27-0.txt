★Which are the top Natural Language Processing (NLP) firms?Interested in professional consulting firms (boutique, large, etc.) not packages like GATE or Weka. For example, for extracting information from customer emails, processing internal data, etc. Quid, Splunk could be possible examples. Would be nice to know if they have products for a non technical customer base.
