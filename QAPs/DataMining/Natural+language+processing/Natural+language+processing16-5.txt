★Natural Language Processing: Why did Google share their "ngrams" data for free?
because it's the right thing to do, the same way franz och and his team likely used the data from the linguistic data consortium over the years - it makes everything better for everybody, so it's only logical to give back to the same community...knowing of course that few organizations can go as far out on 5 and 7 plus ngrams as google or a handful of others (in my opinion)    Embed Quote
