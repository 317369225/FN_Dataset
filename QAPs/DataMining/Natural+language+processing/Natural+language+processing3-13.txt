★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
I don't agree that there are few: See Vicarious (SF) and Luminoso (Boston) for example. These are just the two examples on top of my head. Additionally many established players like AlchemyAPI or Lexalytics must be actively hiring NLP and ML professionals / researchers.    Embed Quote
