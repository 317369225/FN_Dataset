★What exactly is Deep Natural Language Processing (DNLP)?See also: What are good examples of shallow natural language processing (SNLP)?
As an active researcher in NLP, I find this terminology confusing and not helpful. Sometimes people use the adjective "deep" to refer to representations (e.g., "deep semantics" where you're trying to capture something like a logical form of a linguistic input), and sometimes to methods (e.g., "deep learning" where you are learning to automate a task using neural network with many hidden layers).  Neither of these is very precisely defined.    Embed Quote
