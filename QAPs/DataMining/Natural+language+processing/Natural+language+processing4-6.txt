★What programming languages are suitable for natural language processing?
Python. There is already a lot of open sourced industry level code you can use, such as NLTK. Also, Python's close-to-english looping syntax and it being a scripting language makes it a very good language to quickly prototype and test stuff. Ofcourse, there are NLTK ports and APIs available for Java and other languages. But in Python, you can quickly do K-Means, for example, in two lines, without actually defining classes, methods, compiling code or even creating a file (REPL, FTW). Another good reason to go with Python is the syntax similarities to MATLAB. MATLAB itself is important for NLP, and choosing a language close to it will save time.    Embed Quote
