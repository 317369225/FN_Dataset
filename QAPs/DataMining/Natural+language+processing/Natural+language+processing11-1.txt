★Can natural language process structured information from a text?
For an up-to-date introduction to knowledge extraction techniques I would recommend you take a look at the recent work in Google's "Knowledge Vault" project. As you can read in their recent paper (Page on cmu.edu), this project is trying to do exactly what you are asking: build a probabilistic model of "knowledge" starting off mainly from unstructured text but also using webpage structure, links, and other auxiliary information. References in that paper will point you in many interesting directions. Note that this approach is very related to the already existing Knowledge Graph, which in turn is related to the idea of Linked data. As for particular techniques you might want to get started with, I recommend Latent Semantic Analysis and Conditional Random Fields. You should also take a look at the The Stanford NLP (Natural Language Processing) Group toolkit. And you can even finish up by looking at the very hot applications of Deep Learning to this problem (see Deep Learning for NLP)    Embed Quote
