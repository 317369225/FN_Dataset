★How can natural language processing be leveraged to improve search?What approaches exist at the border between information retrieval and natural language processing?
NLP could be used to compare the potential result set vs the specificity of the query.  If the initial query results in too many varying results, clarification can be sought, using NLP to create a dialog: Searcher: Apple Response: Are you looking for information about fruit or technology or something else? Searcher: Records Response: Apple Records was founded in 1968 by the Beatles.  If you'd like more information, you can find it in history (wikipedia), recent news (beatles available on itunes), CDDB (Albums by the Beatles), and on the company website (http://www.applerecords.com)    Embed Quote
