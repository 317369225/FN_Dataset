★Research firms in Natural Language Processing in India?I'm a soon-to-be Computer Engineering graduate and I am trying to find a company/firm in India that does research in NLP or Information Retrieval, that would take up a graduate student like me (even if only for an internship - I'm looking for experience! ). A start-up would do as well. Anywhere I can apply that would give a fresher the opportunity to work on the latest methods in NLP/IR??
BloomReach India would do!    Embed Quote
