★Natural Language Processing: APIs for common mispellings?Are there apis for getting common mispellings for a word? Or at least websites that provide such a service? For instance, if I say acquaintance I would get: acquaintence, aquaintance, etc..
I've not come across a service that offers this, except I've not come across a service that offers this, except Spelling Suggestion Web Service, which has been shut down apparently. There are some corpora available that list the most common misspellings along with the correct word. Here are some of which I have found useful :- Wikipedia:Lists of common misspellings/For machines Birkbeck spelling error corpus You can use the above corpora along with How to Write a Spelling Corrector and create your own spelling corrector. Some websites that allow you to search for misspellings (manually) [although it might be possible to use the data provided by these sites through another website, I think that would be unethical and probably even illegal] Dumbtionary.com a dictionary of misspelled words A to Z Online Dictionary of Misspelled Words, Wrong Phrases, and Mistyped Websites    Embed Quote
