★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
Nowmov.com is. In startup lingo we're "pandora for online videos". In regular lingo, we're the place to go when you want to see what the world is watching right now. Endless awesomeness. We find videos that are trending in real-time (with special magic sauce) - both around the world and in your social graph - and present it in a simple, leanback experience. The machine learning problems are very exciting because we want to figure out in real-time what videos to show a person, like an intelligent TV channel. There is just an incomprehensible amount of videos uploaded every minute and we start off knowing very little about a user. But as you use our site we learn by your every action and your social connections about what your tastes are, and provide an increasingly better experience. In the longer term, we'll want to dig into the videos themselves to figure out interesting patterns (auditory or visual) that can provide additional datapoints. The founders are two ex-Apple engineers that have video processing background (iTunes, Quicktime, h264). We're a YC startup that has great advisors, investors and is well funded: http://www.crunchbase.com/compan... We're located dead-centre in Union Square (view from my desk): If you want to spend your day watching videos - send me a PM.    Embed Quote
