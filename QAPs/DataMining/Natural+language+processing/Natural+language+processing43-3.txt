★Who is the best expert in natural language processing in Poland?I mean somebody who is brilliant, extremaly smart, fast thinker and doer with theoretical and practical competences in NLP. If you don't know such a person in Poland please suggest someboby in Europe.
I would recommend Agnieszka Mykowiecka, who is a Linguistic Engineering lecturer at the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology and researcher at the Polish Academy of Sciences.    Embed Quote
