★What is the difference between natural language processing and computational linguistics?
The terms are mutually interchangeable. However, there is a trend using nlp for more engineering oriented approaches and computational linguistics for more theoretical works. Stefan Th. Gries wrote a few interesting papers arguing compling and nlp are the subdisciplines of computer science, and what computational linguistics meant in "ancient times" is linguistics computing (i.e. using computers in linguistic research for model building or data processing) - and I think digital humanities is also something similar.    Embed Quote
