★What programming languages are suitable for natural language processing?
The reality is that short of toy implementations, NLP (and machine learning in general) is a team sport. Shaping the data for ingest and moving the data through the process at any scale requires different talents. A team of engineers with a common language trumps the slight advantage of one language over another. To know the best team language choice is to examine the effort behind extending the language in the direction of interest. Scipy and the other extensions of Python mentioned make short work of what used to take man-years to create. If I need to ingest a few million .docx files, I don't write the code; I do a few calls to BeautifulSoup. SOAP? suds. I've not come up empty when searching for a module that does what I want more efficiently than I could code up myself. A nod to Spark goes here as it is emerging as the platform of choice for anyone creating anything that moves large volumes of data through a process, NLP or otherwise. Generally, language advantage is transient. A group of talented and energetic engineers can change the landscape quickly. And they do every day. If this is news to you, look in the mirror and realize you're not a software engineer.    Embed Quote
