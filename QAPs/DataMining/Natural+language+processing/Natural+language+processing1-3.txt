★Natural Language Processing: What are the most important research papers which all NLP students should definitely read?Which NLP research papers (no matter whether classic or state-of-the-art) do you recommend students to read, if you were a teacher/professor/adviser? And why?
I think it is difficult to introduce a single paper representing whole nlp research, too. Therefore I would like to introduce some papers in the field of automatic text summarization so as to improve recall of this article. Automatic Text Summarization J. Clarke and M. Lapata. Modeling Compression with Discourse Constraints. EMNLP-CoNLL 2007. (shows importance of joint inference) K. Knight and D. Marcu. Summarization beyond sentence extraction. Artificial Intelligence 139, 2002. (opens the door to statistical approach to sentence compression) R. McDonald. A Study of Global Inference Algorithms in Multi-Document Summarization ECIR 2007. (formulates summarization task as global optimization problem using integer linear programming) W. Yih et al. Multi-Document Summarization by Maximizing Informative Content-Words. IJCAI 2007. (introduces stack decoding to this field)Interestingly, the year 2007 was a milestone of summarization research. In addition, generally speaking, studies of automatic text summarization have been strongly influenced by machine translation. Representative papers of machine translation would help students begin text summarization research.    Embed Quote
