★Natural Language Processing: How would you programmatically parse a sentence and decide whether to answer "that's what she said"?Outline an algorithm that, given a sentence, returns true or false for whether a "that's what she said" is appropriate.
Let me change the angle of the reply a little bit. I think it is interesting to notice that many many  times (it would be interesting to know a percentage among the people of a same country or culture) people do not understand correctly what the other said and therefore don't paraphrase correctly. Interpreting the meaning of something can be a very hard task to do, even more if you think that many times people do not even agree with the intentionality of something that was said or what was intended to be implied by the other. Subjectivity is a very important influencer in human communication. and a common course of disagreement (as well as mental affections). One thing I would suggest is first to measure the level of subjectivity and objectivity of what was said, if it was mostly subjective it is a really hard task, but if it is the other way, by grammatical transformation rules learned in a semi automated way the job can be done.    Embed Quote
