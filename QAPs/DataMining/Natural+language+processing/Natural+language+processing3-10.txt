★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
There is presently a big focus on hacking together a start up very quickly and then working out the kinks. This approach doesn't really work for ML or NLP applications. They aren't going to emerge with a few programmers hanging out together for the weekend drinking coffee. So i would guess its a complexity issue (i'm not referring specifically to scaling, but that is one potential area for complexity). Many of the start-ups today could probably have hacked a bare bones prototype together in a weekend, so those types of apps are obviously going to be more widespread compared to those that take months of banging your head against the wall. Given that i would argue these types of start ups will naturally be rarer, but also more likely to succeed once something is actually built, as the barrier to creating something half decent is quite large comparatively.    Embed Quote
