★What are some good resources for getting started learning about natural language processing?This is a follow-up question to What are some good books on natural language processing and semantic analysis?.  I'm interested not just in textbooks, but papers, blogs, basic programming toolkits, etc.
If you know Python you can take a look at the Natural Language Toolkit (http://www.nltk.org).    Embed Quote
