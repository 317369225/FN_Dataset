★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
It's been a few years since this post, and things have changed.  There are now many startups doing machine learning and natural language processing, e.g., see Natural Language Processing Startups on AngelList.  I agree with posters here though that these techniques have to be judiciously applied in appropriately focused domains on a product that suits the precision, recall and computational efficiency of the solution built.  For instance, the company I work at, InboxVudu, has applied machine learning and NLP to build a product that addresses email overload.  Our technique works great for accurate sentence-level semantic analysis of requests, which makes the product work extremely well.    Embed Quote
