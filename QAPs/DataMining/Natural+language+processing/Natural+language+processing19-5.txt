★What are some good resources for getting started learning about natural language processing?This is a follow-up question to What are some good books on natural language processing and semantic analysis?.  I'm interested not just in textbooks, but papers, blogs, basic programming toolkits, etc.
Lookup Weka (java framework and their are open-source full-semester classes you can take), Check out Jason Baldridge (Bcomposes) he has tutorial with github code to guide you using Scala; Also check out Blackburn's book for NLP with Prolog (Natural Language Processing Techniques in Prolog) ...seeing NLP done in languages other than Java/Python OOP is important! See van Eijk's book computational semantics with Haskell (Computational Semantics with Functional Programming) also because you should see NLP in something not Java/Python OOP Also, this journal Association for Computational Linguistics    Embed Quote
