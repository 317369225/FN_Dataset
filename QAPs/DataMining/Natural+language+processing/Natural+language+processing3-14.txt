★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
ML and NLP are used everywhere in SV. I know at least two startups using these. My previous company, Quantcast, and my current company, BloomReach, are both using these technologies at full scale. I believe aside from big companies like Netflix, Amazon, Google, Yahoo, and LinkedIn using these technologies, a bunch of other startups in health (23andMe, HealthTap, CastlightHealth), finance (Mint, Quantbench) and advertising (Quantcast, AppNexus, RubiconProject) also use them extensively.    Embed Quote
