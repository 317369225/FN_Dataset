★What exactly is Deep Natural Language Processing (DNLP)?See also: What are good examples of shallow natural language processing (SNLP)?
It's pretty simple:  deep processing is processing that attempts to extract the meaning of a sentence and act upon it.  Shallow processing only makes use of superficial features, such as words and grammatical features.  For example, a language-translation program could act at a shallow level by translating word-for-word (usually yielding gibberish), or it could act at a deep level by constructing a sentence in the target language that has the same meaning as the source sentence.    Embed Quote
