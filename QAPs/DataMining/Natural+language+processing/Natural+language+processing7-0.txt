★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
People treasure their memories, and millions of people already use Evernote (product) to capture and organize them, with over a million more joining every month. But what if Evernote helped you decide what to make for dinner and automatically created a shopping list from all those recipes you've accumulated? Or noticed that you were planning a trip and reminded you about that handy "Best Hotels in Paris" article you saved last year? Imagine all of the ways that you, as an engineer, could leverage technology to make memory more powerful, more useful, and just plain better. That's what we're building. We have a long history of using machine learning for handwriting and printed character recognition, and we're now tackling a more ambitious challenge: using Evernote should make you smarter. We're looking for talented machine learning engineers and data products engineers to apply cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques to help people recall, contextualize, and understand their memories. Come work with a huge, one-of-a-kind data set and help millions of people organize and improve their lives. We'd love to meet you! http://evernote.com/careers/    Embed Quote
