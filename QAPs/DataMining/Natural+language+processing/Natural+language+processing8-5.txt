★What makes natural language processing difficult?
I think the reason NLP is difficult to achieve right now is because computer scientists, like most humans, lack introspection skills. If we could figure out how the human mind processes natural language, of course we could translate it into a data structure and algorithm. The human mind processes language with ease, so it has to be simple. Were just missing something obvious. Also, I think the way in which currently approach software problems is in contrast to the way the human mind works. We're thinking about it wrong. That may have something to do with it. One should try to be as creative as possible when approaching NLP problems.    Embed Quote
