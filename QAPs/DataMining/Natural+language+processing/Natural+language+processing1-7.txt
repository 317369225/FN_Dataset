★Natural Language Processing: What are the most important research papers which all NLP students should definitely read?Which NLP research papers (no matter whether classic or state-of-the-art) do you recommend students to read, if you were a teacher/professor/adviser? And why?
As an influential work in machine learning based NLP, I would recommend Michael Collins' Perceptron paper. Michael Collins (2002), "Discriminative training methods for hidden markov models: Theory and experiments with perceptron algorithms"The paper re-introduced the classic Perceptron algorithm as a simple and powerful tool for structured prediction. The method and idea have been applied to many tasks.    Embed Quote
