★What programming languages are suitable for natural language processing?
Without a doubt, Python: NLTK[1], although not the most efficient implementation, provides a lot of awesome tools to quickly prototype a hypothesis Python's re-module[2] is amazing. Combine re with list comprehensions and collections and you can make some really cool stuff: 1

 def words(paragraph):     return [ w.lower() for word in re.findall(r"([a-z]+)",paragraph) ] (if you do not think that function is awesome, read no further ... ) For more, check out Peter Norvig's spell corrector [3] Scipy[4] + Numpy[5]: everything that isn't in NLTK is definitely in these libraries. If you want to use more advanced algorithms like Latent Semantic Indexing[11] or Latent Dirichlet Allocation[13], Python has libraries to do that also[12]. Python has really great XML/HTML parsing libraries such as Beautiful Soup[6] and Scrape.py[7]. You can use these libraries to quickly scrape the web and generate large data sets to improve the performance of your models (because lets face it, big data trumps complexity) Python has great web-frameworks like Django[8]/Pylons[9]/Tornado[10]. If you invent a revolutionary sarcasm detector that can predict trends in the stock market, you can quickly integrated it into a web service, make millions, and buy a large island in a third-world country. Consider your other options: It would not make sense to use a compiled language like C++/Java for this type of work unless you needed to increase performance (computational speed, not model accuracy). As far as I can tell, Ruby is completely useless for any Machine Learning, Data Mining, or Natural Language Processing task. Maybe you could use Lisp, but at this point, Python has a larger eco-system. [1] http://www.nltk.org/ [2] http://docs.python.org/library/r... [3] http://norvig.com/spell-correct....
