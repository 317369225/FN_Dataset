★How mature is Natural Language Processing technology as of May 2014?
NLP technology is not at all mature. It's *useful* -- you can do some pretty cool things with it, as Siri, Google Now, Google Translate, and lots of other technologies show. There's interesting ongoing work in question answering at Google and Microsoft, as well as in academia, and of course most AI research is really about language understanding. But we're really not at all close to solving the problem. Most NLP techniques can label text in a variety of ways, but it's not what anyone would call "understanding" the text (unless you're trying to get a grant or impress someone at a cocktail party). Extracting information from text -- what does a passage mean -- usually requires aggregating over a large number of examples, because techniques are so noisy. And we're even farther from understanding what someone means in a conversation. Every nlp system makes mistakes in places where humans have no trouble immediately understanding the text. These "dumb mistakes" are everywhere, and a clear sign that we're just not very good at this stuff yet. It turns out that it takes more than a few decades of work to approximate hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. As a quick test: can you summarize my post in a sentence or two, and communicate the essential meaning? There's no NLP system yet that can do that fluently and reliably. We still have a long way to go.    Embed Quote
