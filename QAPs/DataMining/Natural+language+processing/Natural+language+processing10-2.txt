★How does natural language processing work?
Very Well? Natural language processing is a field, not an algorithm or a process.  The objective of natural language processing is build computer programs that process human languages as well as well as or better than humans.  Most human workflows involve natural language processing tasks.  The field has overlap with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP include automatic translation of texts (Google's translation service), extracting financial information from news reports, automatically summarizing text, creating new texts by combining information from multiple documents, search engines, converting spoken speech into text and automatic subtitling of videos. Using statistics and machine learning we can extract meaning from text and build systems that are able to communicate with users in English.  Document processing is a 3 trillion a year industry and NLP will eventually enable automation of much of this currently human capital intensive industry.  The development of human competitive NLP systems will be on the most economically significant developments of the next twenty years.
