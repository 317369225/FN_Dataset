★What fields need NLP (Natural Language Processing) or Textmining techniques?
Text mining is used in a variety of industries, here's a list of some: Academic Research - First & foremost NLP is a growing research interest in the computer science community. Here the main concerns are usually machine translation, speech processing, automatic summarization, sentiment analysis, OCR, information retrieval and information extraction. Most of this research is immediately applicable to real world technology.
