★Natural Language Processing: Why did Google share their "ngrams" data for free?
Think about mindset: You might be ascribing the database a monetary value of potentially, say 100 units. Those would've belonged to Google. But the act of sharing it produces benefits worth maybe 1000 units or more, spread over the many users accessing it, and with potential of multiplication! In economic terminology, we would have referred to the former potential value, the one accruing to Google, as producer surplus. The one accruing to user would be referred to as Consumer Surplus. Remember, part of the n-Gram database data input is derived from another shared database, so the Google N-Gram database itself wouldn't had had been possible without a willingness to openly share knowledge in the first place. Google itself is a company built on the open sharing of information through the Internet: It sells ads on the open Internet but not so much on the closed Facebook! Consequently, it wold be only natural for them to have this sharing mindset, and embrace the potentials of large consumer surpluses. The pie tends to be large enough for some google benefit, too.    Embed Quote
