If "language" for you does not necessarily mean "English" If you want to go beyond the black and white sentiment analysis and rigid entity extraction If you have diverse needs, and have to have a low-level access to the language internals You may want to pay a visit to LinguaSys GlobalNLP. Apart from the regular stuff like: Sentiment analysis Entity extraction Lemmatisation Stemming PoS tagging (more accurately, grammatical property tagging) Segmentation Word sense disambiguation Domain extraction You will get: Crosslingual retrieval helper methods Semantically-aware automatic translation Anaphora resolution Quotation extraction and attribution and more, in numerous languages.
