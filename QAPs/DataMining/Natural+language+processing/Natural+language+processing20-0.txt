★What kind of Natural Language Processing technologies do Palantir products use?
I am sure the Palanitr keeps this information as a closely guarded trade secret, however, at least one company claims to know what they do internally.  In January 2014, a small company in New Jersey, Ant Leap Search LLC, sued Palantir for patent infringement.  In their complaint, they allege Palantir infringed U.S. Patent 7,617,193, which relates generally to information retrieval.  From the public record, it's unclear whether Antleap is just a patent assertion company that is trying to extract licensing fees from Palantir (the two companies settled back in July 2014), or whether it knows something more about Palantir's internal process, but it may be one avenue to start looking for answers.    Embed Quote
