★What are the Natural Language Processing principles of automatic summarization?I'd like to build a process of automatic summarization - without having any knowledge about either Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (yet!). What are the best resources? How much groundwork do I have to do in NLP to achieve this? And what parts of NLP/CP theories are important for building such a system?
Most of the points about Automatic Summarization was covered by Nitin. I will focus more on single document summarization because I don't have the experience to talk about multi document summarization. As Nitin mentioned, there are two types of automatic summarization: extraction, and abstraction. Extraction just lifts the most important sentences in the article and present it as a summary. Abstraction on the other hand is the type of summary known to people. It summarizes by compressing and paraphrasing the article. I read somewhere (sorry forgot the source) that a summary must be 50% less than the original article. My research for my MS degree is about automatic summarization. In it, I managed to formulate an algorithm that do extraction. I call it TextTeaser. I then continue to build it as an app, and an API. During my research, I stumbled upon pretty good references. You're asking for resources, so here are some papers I read: A Survey on Automatic Text Summarization link: Page on Cmu Comparing Commercial Tools and State-of-the-Art Methods for Generating Text Summaries link: (needs an account) Comparing Commercial Tools and State-of-the-Art Methods for Generating Text Summaries Evaluation of Features for Sentence Extraction on Different Types of Corpora link: Page on Upenn    Embed Quote
