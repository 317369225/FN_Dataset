★What is it like to work in Natural Language Processing?Also, some info on your background would be nice.
Natural Language Processing is a field, which is ever evolving and always has a surprise in store. The beauty of NLP, is that one can make out exciting inferences from it. I would like to cite an example: Consider a person who is economically deprived, and is accessing an online course.  If he/she is asked to add a detailed information about his/her interests and stuff. He might not do it in a systematic method (by using tags, or cean data in terms of a Data Analyst). So,  we have to carry out an NLP on the available data and extract useful information, so that we can devise an efficient recommendation (be it a CF or I-I CF) algorithm for generating an efficient recommender system for such data. Working with NLP is tough at the beginning, but when you start loving what you do and most importantly you've gotto embrace ML,  then you'd have a wonderful experience, while devising the learning algorithm.    Embed Quote
