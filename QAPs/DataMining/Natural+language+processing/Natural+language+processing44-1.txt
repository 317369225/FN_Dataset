★What is the future of natural language processing?
Future is Bright :D There are basically two coups: statistics based and linguistic based. In recent times, statistics have shown to producer better results without much hard work in contrast to the hard work put by linguistic experts. Also, there is hardly any need of linguistic expets in the statistical scene and hence, there seems to be a momentum in favour of statistics now.  Also, since the language is ever evolving it would be hard to keep the corpus, tags and related stuffs up-to-date as the grammar itself might change. So, I presume a combination of both linguistic and statistics might very well wok out in the future.    Embed Quote
