★Natural Language Processing: What are the most important research papers which all NLP students should definitely read?Which NLP research papers (no matter whether classic or state-of-the-art) do you recommend students to read, if you were a teacher/professor/adviser? And why?
I'll add few more for different NLP topics, Information Extraction Hearst. Automatic Acquisition of Hyponyms from Large Text Corpora. COLING 1992. (The very first paper for all the bootstrapping methods for NLP. It is a hypothetical work in a sense that it doesn't give experimental results, but it influenced it's followers a lot.) Collins and Singer. Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification. EMNLP 1999. (It applies several variants of co-training like IE methods to NER task and gives the motivation why they did so. Students can learn the logic from this work for writing a good research paper in NLP.)Computational Semantics Gildea and Jurafsky. Automatic Labeling of Semantic Roles. Computational Linguistics 2002. (It opened up the trends in NLP for semantic role labeling, followed by several CoNLL shared tasks dedicated for SRL. It shows how linguistics and engineering can collaborate with each other. It has a shorter version in ACL 2000.) Pantel and Lin. Discovering Word Senses from Text. KDD 2002. (Supervised WSD has been explored a lot in the early 00's thanks to the senseval workshop, but a few system actually benefits from WSD because manually crafted sense mappings are hard to obtain. These days we see a lot of evidence that unsupervised clustering improves NLP tasks such as NER, parsing, SRL, etc, and this work is one of the roots of unsupervised clustering of words)    Embed Quote
