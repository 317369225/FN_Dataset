★Natural Language Processing: What is the best approach for text categorization?There are standard approaches like svm, naive bayes, logistic regression, neuron network. Features come from words, phrases scored with tfidf e.t.c. Is there are any more robost and scalable approach?
We do something like this at Roistr. We have a simple demonstration of clustering (8 texts into 2 indefined categories) at http://roistr.com/compare_all - click on "fill in some data for me". As you will see, it managed to disambiguate the 2 different senses of the word 'Python' well enough. Our approach was broadly the bag of words; but that was just the starting point for analysis. It goes much deeper using a range of triangulated methods and a more proposition-based within-document analysis, but you can get good results using even just latent semantic analysis on its own as long as your model is good. Getting a good model takes a lot of time and careful experimentation.    Embed Quote
