★What programming languages are suitable for natural language processing?
I would like to divide them into two kinds, one is general developing languages, the other is computing and analytic lanaguages. In term of general developing languages, I recommend Ruby. Ruby's syntax is very agile and nimble, more expressive than Java and C#, and easier to understand. Regarding this point, I think it is a good natural language, So is Python. In term of computing and analytic languages, I prefer esProc. esProc can simply complex business logic or procedures by deviding the whole job into several steps, for example, compute one step, check the result, if the result is espected, then begin the next step; If the result isn't OK, just adjust the above step----this is real natural thinking insdead of computer thinking like SQL.    Embed Quote
