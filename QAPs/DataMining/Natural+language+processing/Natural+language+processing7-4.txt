★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
If you love food/cooking, Yummly.com is a great place to be.  We are the leading next generation recipe site that wants to understand food/recipes at all levels. As an analytics person at Yummly you will tackle a wide range of  data problems which can not be solved with a basic spread sheet.  Specifically, we would love to have somebody with extensive computational linguistics or NLP experience to help us reach our goal of  analyzing and indexing every recipe on the web. What this really means is we are looking for someone who can help get our back end system to understand the phrases: "Mix all dry ingredients." or "3 to 4 1 1/4 to 1 1/2  inch hanger steaks (about 4 to 5  lbs total) cubed."  This process is to go beyond raw parsing, but to meta data extraction and recipe inference. andrew@yummly.com http://www.yummly.com    Embed Quote
