★What are some good resources for getting started learning about natural language processing?This is a follow-up question to What are some good books on natural language processing and semantic analysis?.  I'm interested not just in textbooks, but papers, blogs, basic programming toolkits, etc.
the O'Reilly NLTK book is actually really good. Jurafsky & Martin is excellent for a more thorough survey, more detailed and helpful instruction on widely used techniques and algorithms.  The O'Reilly book on the other hand gives you a good place to start with ideas for playing with NLTK.    Embed Quote
