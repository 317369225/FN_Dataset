★Natural Language Processing: What are the most important research papers which all NLP students should definitely read?Which NLP research papers (no matter whether classic or state-of-the-art) do you recommend students to read, if you were a teacher/professor/adviser? And why?
I tend to suggest one paper: Conditional Random Fields: Probabilistic Models for segmenting and labeling sequence data, which has been awarded Test-of-time Award in ICML 2011. Below is an excerpt from the ICML website: Test-of-Time Award This award is given to papers that time and hindsight proved to be of lasting value to the Machine Learning community. This year, we are recognizing the seminal paper of CRFs. John D. Lafferty, Andrew McCallum, Fernando C. N. Pereira. Conditional Random Fields: Probabilistic Models for Segmenting and Labeling Sequence Data. http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~pereir...    Embed Quote
