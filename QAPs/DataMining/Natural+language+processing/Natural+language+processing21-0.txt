★How do I develop a resume parser using NLP (Natural Language Processing)?
If you can't understand how to do it, don't even try to ask others to define it for you so you can implement it. Resumes aren't written in complete sentences. Standard NLP methods aren't a good match. I've observed how fools who tried to implement this this way have butchered my resume multiple times, and the HR industry persists in using idiots to write code for it. Resumes are more viably parsed according to code that looks for structural patterns and formats, and tries to pull data out accordingly. However, meaning and not just data requires understanding context and then interpreting meaning, and that is much harder, with no simple easy formula.    Embed Quote
