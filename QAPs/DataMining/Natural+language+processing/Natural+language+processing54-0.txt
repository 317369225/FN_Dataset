★What is the bottleneck holding back true (non-statistical) Natural Language Processing?
I'm glad you asked. Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the most important problem in non-statistical NLP right now. A program that can disambiguate the senses of words in a sentence probably has an idea of what that sentence means. WSD is the foundation upon which further reasoning can be achieved. Also, there is too much emphasis on taxonomy and ontology and not enough focus on cross part-of-speech semantic relations esp. noun-verb semantic relations. We must also really have a deep appreciation of the fact that everything is an object. A sentence is an object. A preposition is an object.    Embed Quote
