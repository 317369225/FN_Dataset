★Who is the best expert in natural language processing in Poland?I mean somebody who is brilliant, extremaly smart, fast thinker and doer with theoretical and practical competences in NLP. If you don't know such a person in Poland please suggest someboby in Europe.
The Neurosoft guys (http://www.neurosoft.pl/) are worth talking to. Their "gram" semantic language analysis software powers one of the only remaining Polish search engines Netsprint, used by WP.pl (or at least it did couple of years back).    Embed Quote
