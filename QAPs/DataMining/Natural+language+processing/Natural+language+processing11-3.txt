★Can natural language process structured information from a text?
Adam D'Angelo provided useful background to this problem -- I'll add to this some specifics that you can use to pkan out your strategy. We've been developing algorithms to provide this capability at Gnowit for the past 5 years. Any solution to this problem will essentially be driven by the information that you want to extract, and the format of the source. There are a whole host of problems that you need to solve -- you need to monitor the source for new information, access the data when it is available, traverse the structure of the document/database/API to select the most useful elements, extract the most useful representation, build 'frames' to arrange related information, match these frames to existing information that you have available, and then synthesize the most current unified version of this. If you need advice on how to do this, feel free to contact me at shahzad AT gnowit DOT com and I'll be happy to offer specific suggestions to help you on your way. If you need generic info, feel free to create another question and tag me, and I'll be happy to contribute.    Embed Quote
