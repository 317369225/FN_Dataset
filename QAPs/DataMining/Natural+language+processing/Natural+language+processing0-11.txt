★Natural Language Processing: How would you programmatically parse a sentence and decide whether to answer "that's what she said"?Outline an algorithm that, given a sentence, returns true or false for whether a "that's what she said" is appropriate.
To avoid straight stimulus response and take prior knowledge into account one must first keep what the program last said to the program.  For instance.... Program:  I'm very hot today. User: That's what she said. The program's prior input must get rewritten to the program as ... She said I'm very hot today. Then your standard stimulus/response becomes much more effective because you are responding to a much higher possible number of stimulis and hopefully the response will in fact be much more appropriate because it is based on prior knowledge of the conversation. Also if the program is sophisticated enough to track context and knows that the context is "weather" rather than "sex" the response to the derived stimulus will vary when context is taken into account. Responding in a sexual manner when the context is "weather" will make the cause the program to be judged as a bit orf a perv while responding about the weather when in "sexual" context would make the program appear very naive. Effectively taking context into account on a consistent basis is one of the primary failures of present day bot technology IMHO. My bot technology always tracks context when one can be derived from the last input.  And does not get reset until a new context overwrites it.  Thus it can always answer the question "What are we talking about?" without resorting to a bluff and appearing ignorent or nonresponsive. This I believe underlines the major weakness of some of the statistical approaches utilizing text mininng.    Embed Quote
