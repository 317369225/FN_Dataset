★Can natural language process structured information from a text?
With all due respect to you being curios about this topic (of which I'm guilty as well), this question IMHO calls for more than a dozen of research papers, maybe even books. I seriously doubt that you can get an answer, comprehensively covering the topic. Having said that, I agree with Adam D'Angelo in recommending to do your own research, starting from Wikipedia. I disagree, though, that the starting point should be information retrieval, as it's more of an umbrella term, covering different technologies and lacking focus on the semantics aspect. I would recommend to base your search on the term Semantic technology and work your way from basic to advanced knowledge by reading research papers on the topic as well as papers, referenced there. Other potential candidates for search terms are: knowledge management, knowledge engineering, knowledge representation, information architecture, ontology, taxonomy, Semantic Web.    Embed Quote
