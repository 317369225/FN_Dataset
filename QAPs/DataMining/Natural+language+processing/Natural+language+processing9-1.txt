★Natural Language Processing: Why is knowledge technology still keyword-based?
NELL at CMU wanders the internet and learns facts. Carnegie Mellon University see "recently learned facts" list. The bad quality of results might be due to the internet scale but I think it does good job. Also for search I dont want to write "I want to search NELL" or "who is obama" google does hard work to understand what the user really want to search with few keyworks. Thats the part of user experience. BTW I also donot agree with your definition of intelligence. Intelligence should be applicable to all the things we are connected to. Vision, feel, taste, speech, language. Unsupervised learning. Reward system(even animals can learn this). Should learn science with examples. What is fundamental to intelligence? That fundamental should create all the rules you think is intelligence. SPEED: 2 seconds is the most I would like to wait on my computer end to end. Also What if I am new to english and my grammar is really bad. I give you keywords. Keyword search is important.  Vicarious a startup build on known things about brain using recursive cortical network(Initially working in vision). Which they say learns like human. And dileep george the founder has worked in heirachical temporal memory and cortical micro-circuits. might add more thoughts.. :D    Embed Quote
