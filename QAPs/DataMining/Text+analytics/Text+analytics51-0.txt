★What do you think is the top future trend of automated Text Analysis / Text Analytics?A lot is happening in the space. We have had automated entity tagging for some time and sentiment analysis is growing more popular. What do you think is the next trend?
*top* *future*?Discourse analysis coupled with language generation and reasoning: The ability to mine, model, understand, and ultimately participate in conversations.  Right now, text analytics digests individual messages and documents within larger corpora, but it rarely handles temporality, sequences of messages that build on and respond to earlier messages.  Further, what I'd call "language generation" -- holding up one end of a conversation -- is limited to response formatting, simplistic bots, summarization, answer extraction (a la IBM Watson), and automated translation.  This is great stuff that will provide the building blocks for future advances. Add discourse analysis, reasoning, and language generation to current technologies to obtain the top, future trend in text analytics, a trend, not incidentally, toward ability to pass the Turing Test.    Embed Quote
