★What is the best text analytics API + service?There are a lot of text analytics / text analysis APIs out there. What is your experience and what API do you think is the best one?
I don't know if it is the best but may I suggest you to try wikimeta www.wikimeta.com. If we talk about textanalytics, it's a very efficient system (that you can compare to some of the others cited here with NERD comparizon tool http://nerd.eurecom.fr), that provides complete part-of-speech tagging, named entities labelling (including date and time), semantic annotation, linkeddata links and text distributions statistics. It's important when you search for the most efficient solution of text-mining and text analytics to not only rely on "online annotation forms" or "visual impression" that can be false friends. However it should be an acceptable way of evaluation if you apply exactly the same text with various online forms, like NERD does, and compare the annotation results side by side. What you have also to verify is the text-analytics API capacity to annotate inline (this means associating a semantic link and a named entity tag to an exact word sequence), if it has been verified publicly in scientific evaluation campaign (like ESTER, ACE, or CONLL for named entities or co-references) and mesured with standard metrics on state-of-the-art corporas like WSJ or BBN and published in peer reviewed papers. There is a lot of work that have been done by the Natural Language Community during the last 30 years to build engineering evaluation tools and metrics for evaluation of text processing application and it's good to use them if you want a fair evaluation of text-analytics API systems.    Embed Quote
