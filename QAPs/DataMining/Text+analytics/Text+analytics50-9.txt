★What is the best text analytics API + service?There are a lot of text analytics / text analysis APIs out there. What is your experience and what API do you think is the best one?
"Best" is subjective, but if it comes to: Number of languages supported natively (not via MT) Quality and quantity of the metadata / features Flexibility and power I would nominate our LinguaSys GlobalNLP. Free plan is available. Features in all the languages we support include (but not limited to): Entity extraction Domain of discourse extraction Low-level methods for lemmatisation, stemming, PoS tagging, anaphora resolution Sentiment analysis Quotation detection and attribution    Embed Quote
