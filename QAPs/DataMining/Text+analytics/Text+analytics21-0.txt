★What are some good ways to recruit PhDs with expertise in text analytics?I am looking for a postdoc or above who can play a senior scientist role as member of the founding team for a highly disruptive startup located in a Midwestern university town.  Areas of particular interest include multidocument summarization, point of view injection, and search.
You'll need either real money to offer (read: not equity in a company that doesn't have revenue yet) or similar academic credentials, and preferably both. Once you have one of the above, there's a couple routes you can go.  If you know enough people in academic circles, they can usually point you in the right direction.  You can work with headhunters or recruiting firms, and they'll take a cut that sounds painful, but if they know the right people and can get the attention of the right candidates, it's totally worth it.  I personally know a lot of people in a number of academic and professional circles across the country, so if people are looking to hire experts, I'll temp-to-perm them through my LLC for the people looking.  It works out for all parties involved and everybody generally ends up happy. Past that, if you have credentials in the field, you might be able to find people willing to dive in with you just out of academic curiosity.  A lot of good things happen when two experts find each other and decide to put their expertise to use.    Embed Quote
