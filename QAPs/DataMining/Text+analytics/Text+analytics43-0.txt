★What would the text analytics and natural language processing disciplines be like they had not begun with converting everything to text format?It seems that most of the foundational work in these fields begins with a tacit limiting assumption to strip most of the typographic and formatting meaning from text.  How would the field look if this assumption had not been made?
Formatting hides the basic meaning of the text. Formatting adds an extra layer of complexity beyond the semantics of the language. The formatting is also very much dependent on the medium through which you are reading the text.  If text analysis were to consider the formatting, then the same text could have multiple meanings. Stripping out the typography and formatting is not a limitation, it is removing the excess which hides the true meaning of the words.    Embed Quote
