★Can a work experience in text analytics be leveraged if I am eyeing a career in management consulting?I am a 22 year old college fresher with a job offer in text analytics (related to online customer engagement and online marketing). My long term goals include getting an MBA degree 2-3 years from now and working with a management consulting firm afterwards. Would my current job offer help in gaining relevant work experience? What are the other options (business analytics, etc) that I should consider?
What is the text analytics job offer you have?  I it business related or academic? If you are working in a corporation on something which is core to it's operations you should be able to pick up other knowledge on the way.  And who knows, in two years tie you may find that data science and analytics have taken you somewhere else.    Embed Quote
