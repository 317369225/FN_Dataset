★For social media in a business context, what differences are there between social media monitoring, text analytics, and predictive analytics tools?Most vendors seem to be competing against each other across these categories rather than within the categories, including the clubbing together of these tools in various analyst reports. As a technical consultant I find it confusing & usually a hurdle while convincing the client why a particular vendor product is not enough for their needs.
Because it's a relatively new industry, all the players are being grouped in the same "social media monitoring/analytics" category. It's important for someone looking for any of these tools to have a clear understanding of his/her objectives and evaluate tools based on that. At least for the big players, there are countless reviews online that speak to the strengths and weaknesses of each, that, combined with your own review of the tools should help clients decide what is right. However, I imagine the real issue is that they may not exactly know what they're looking for because of unclear objectives. Start by asking "why?" and from there you can find the right tool (and help clients understand what they need as well.    Embed Quote
