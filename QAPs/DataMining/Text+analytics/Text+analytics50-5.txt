★What is the best text analytics API + service?There are a lot of text analytics / text analysis APIs out there. What is your experience and what API do you think is the best one?
Which is best depends on factors such as: 1) What kind of analytics are most important to you?   - entities, facts/events/relations, linking, sentiment, topics 2) What kind of text are you trying to process?   - news, blog, everything/open web, proprietary docs 3) How much are you willing to pay? APIs which provide entity extraction at a minimum include: http://www.opencalais.com http://www.openamplify.com http://www.zemanta.com http://www.alchemyapi.com http://www.evri.com http://pingar.com/entity-extraction http://www.languagecomputer.com/... Good reviews of APIs (from early 2010): http://blog.viewchange.org/2010/... http://faganm.com/blog/2010/01/0... I'm biased -- and I'd have to vote for my personal favorite, which is from Language Computer.  It provides more types of entities out-of-the-box than any other service that I'm aware of, along with other features like state-of-the-art entity disambiguation.    Embed Quote
