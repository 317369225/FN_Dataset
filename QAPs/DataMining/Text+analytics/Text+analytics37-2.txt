★What special considerations do you need to take into account when using machine learning and text analytics methods with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean texts?Theoretically, a machine learning algorithm such as a Bayesian or SVM classifier will work with any set of texts, but my understanding is that tokenising the ideogrammatic characters in these languages may be difficult. If anyone has any experience or pointers to papers on this subject, that would be great.
You are correct. From my experience at GROUP OF MEN INC. (www.groupofmen.com), for feature vectors consisting of individual word counts, classifiers such as SVM, logistic regression, perceptron, KNN, etc. are less sensitive to word segmentation for East Asian languages. It makes more difference for techniques that look at local information such as naive Bayes. Pay special attention to the way you normalize your feature vectors (in L0, L1, or L2 space) for SVM-type classifiers. Take a look at the Libsvm and Liblinear manuals for more details.    Embed Quote
