★How is User Generated Content impacting text analytics industry?Are there any blogs / resources that I should follow?
User-generated content has greatly increased the amount of text content there is for companies to track and analyze with text and sentiment analysis. User-generated content can be both beneficial (think, customers singing your praise to their friends) and disastrous (imagine, a customer complaint that’s gone viral) for a company. With this being said it can be tough for companies to manually analyze all the data that’s being produced. This is where machine-based text analytics has played a big role and why it has made so many advances in the past 15 years. The amount of user-generated content means that machine-based text analytics needs to be able to process larger and larger amounts of data, faster than ever before. We now expect text analysis engines to deliver real-time results and analyze thousands of documents at a time.   With more and more companies analyzing user-generated content for business insights, text analytics companies are continually improving their functionality. Ten years ago Lexalytics first introduced sentiment analysis, which has been a fantastic tool to understand the tone (positive, negative, or neutral) of text. Now many of the leading text analytics providers are able to classify content, extract sentiment, named entities, themes, and much more, to provide their users with the best possible insight into user-generated content from all angles.   As a disclaimer I work for Semantria (http://semantria.com), leading cloud-based text and sentiment API.    Embed Quote
