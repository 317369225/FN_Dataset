★What are current commercial text analytics tools lacking?I'm talking about seemingly do-it-all solutions like Clarabridge. What business or user needs are they currently not responding to or what features or usability elements could be improved?
A few items I've encountered while looking for tools: - Lower precision and recall ("accuracy") than our clients require (vs. human coding*) for auto-coding verbatim responses - Very poor accuracy when using a "generic" code frame -- to be expected - High training cost -- too high for "projects" (one-time activities) -- ROI can be positive on longitudinal activities; calendar time requirements for training can be problematic for some "project" schedules vs. hand coding. Today, the look-and-feel of the UI and its usability are the least of my concerns with NLP / text analytics tools. * vs. human coding -- I know this is a controversial benchmark as human coders do not have infallible precision and recall.  Human coders are, however, the benchmark for many clients -- and clients pay the bills...    Embed Quote
