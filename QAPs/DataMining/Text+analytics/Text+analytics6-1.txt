★What do you think is the top future trend of automated Text Analysis / Text Analytics?A lot is happening in the space. We have had automated entity tagging for some time and sentiment analysis is growing more popular. What do you think is the next trend?
I think the next step is to take these small chunks (Automated tagging, Summarization, Sentiment Analysis, Automated Headline Generation, language Identification and more) and to design a solution that can efficiently make recommendations/suggestions to the end-user.     An example of such a solution could be a machine which crawls all the reviews of books on Amazon and other online book-stores, reads through the various Books, and then recommends appropriate sections inside new books that should be read by the end-user.     Another example of a smart textual analytic solution is where the machine reads through all the previous filings of various companies and then applies data-mining to be able to alert a possible filing of bankruptcy or future values of the company's shares.     In general, I think the future is to be able to take the capabilities you mentioned and then to apply them smartly to make suggestions/recommendations and provide real-time alerts to the end-user.     So, I feel the future is smart recommendation.    Embed Quote
