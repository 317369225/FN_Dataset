★Has someone built a conversation guide using text analytics - in a specific context?Are there any programs / is the text analytics technology developed enough that it can act as a one of the parties to a conversation -- something deeper than what Siri does.  Say can a text analytics driven program can actually conduct a conversation say about movies or about food?
AFAIK, the answer is no.  This is a known issue with conversational agents.  Generally speaking, all of today's chatbots are reactive, rather than proactive.  Of course, there has been some research done in this area, but with mixed results at best.  The big data trend toward personalization technologies does promise progress; generally, some kind of prior knowledge, or sensory information, is necessary for effective proactive communication.    Embed Quote
