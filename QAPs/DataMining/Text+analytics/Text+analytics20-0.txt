★What text analytics tools are best at multi-dimensional characterization of a chunk of complex text?
Coh-metrix (Cohmetrix - Home) might be helpful for this case. It provides 100+ metrics regarding sentence length, vocabulary complexity, sentence coherence, reading difficulty. However, I don't think Coh-metrix handles rhetorical questions, strong sentiment, as these concepts are related to deeper understanding of the text semantics. For those kinds of metrics, I would look for specific tools that address these areas, such as sentiment analysis tools (consult this Quora question: What are the most powerful open source sentiment analysis tools?, and this paper: Page on Stanford).    Embed Quote
