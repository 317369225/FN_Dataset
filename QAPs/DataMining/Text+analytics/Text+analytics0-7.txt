★What is the best text analytics API + service?There are a lot of text analytics / text analysis APIs out there. What is your experience and what API do you think is the best one?
the Self Service Semantic Suite (S4) by Ontotext provides various services for text analytics and semantic data management. In particular: entity and relation extraction service for biomedical texts (Semantic Biomedical Tagger) entity and relation extraction service for news (News Annotation) a News Classifier service and a service for Twitter analytics (based on the GATE Twitter IE component) The entity extraction services also perform disambiguation and mapping to knowledge graphs such as DBpedia, Freebase, and Geonames (news analytics), or to specialised biomedical databases (biomedical tagger) the S4 text analytics services are easily accessible either as RESTful services, or via the Java/C#/uimaFIT SDKs for S4. There are also S4 plugins for GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering) and Apache UIMA which make accessing S4 services from these language engineering platforms easier Ontotext S4 also provides RDF database-as-a-service capabilities, so that information extracted from text documents can be integrated into knowledge graphs and published/queried as Linked Data in the near future more text analytics services will be available via S4, incl. sentiment analytics and entity/relation extraction for multiple languages disclaimer: I work for Ontotext and I'm involved in the S4 product line    Embed Quote
