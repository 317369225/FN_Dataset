★What are some good open source (and possibly free) text normalization/mining/analytics tools?
I've been working on a text analysis API that allows you to mine features from text such as: keywords, entities, language, author, summaries, main image, main HTML body, clean text, text classification and more. Particularly, text classification and author extraction are slightly biased towards media articles but the rest of features work with any kind of text. The API works by submitting an: URL, text or a RSS feed. Then, it returns all the features previously mentioned. Since it's an API, it works with any language and at the moment is free of charge. It might be open sourced in the near future. You can find it in Mashape: Article Analysis API Documentation Besides that, I've used other text analysis APIs and I have to say that Alchemy API is by far the best I've seen so far. Powering the New AI Economy I hope my answer helps.    Embed Quote
