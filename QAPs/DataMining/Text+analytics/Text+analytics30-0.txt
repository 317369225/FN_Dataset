★Which has a better scope with respect to career development, web/text analytics or predictive analytics?
Companies are investing a lot in data and pulling out information to take business decisions. The scope of predictive analytics is very wide and growing at very good rate. Digital analytics has seen tremendous growth in last couple of years, where every company wants to go digital or wanting to invest in online marketing. Many job opportunities are there in market and can expect more in coming years. So, we can’t differentiate which is good or bad. Its depend on person’s qualification and interest level in which field he/she wanted to go.    Embed Quote
