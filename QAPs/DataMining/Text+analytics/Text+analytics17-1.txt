★What is the best sentiment and text analytics software for a Voice of the Customer (VOC) program?
We have found that an integrated solution works best. By having text and sentiment analysis as part of our Voice of the Customer solution we can analyse text from virtually any channel such as text from social media, open ended survey questions or customer support cases or complaints. As it is a integrated solution we can combine the completed analysis with results from surveys to get a complete view of the customer.    Embed Quote
