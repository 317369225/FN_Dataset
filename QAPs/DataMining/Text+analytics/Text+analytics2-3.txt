According to Seth Grimes’ reports about the Text Analytics market (the latest, published @Page on altaplana.com) the most frequent application of text analytics during recent years has been Voice of the Customer / Customer Experience Management. Text analytics offers the possibility to combine inputs from both structured and unstructured sources, in both solicited and unsolicited opinions, in a 360º customer/market view: customer surveys, social comments, contact center interactions. To achieve this, text analytics functionality is needed that can not only extract basic information from text (e.g., brand names, themes) but also to discover some application-specific meaningful insights: user brand affinity, customer journey stage, detection of intent... MeaningCloud, a SaaS API product, provides this advanced text analytics functionality in the form of web services, so that it can be easily integrated into any application or system Voice of the Customer | MeaningCloud (Disclaimer: I work for Daedalus, the company that markets MeaningCloud)    Embed Quote
