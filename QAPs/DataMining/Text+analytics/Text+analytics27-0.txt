★What algorithm does SPSS use for text analytics?
The product that was called "SPSS" before the acquisition of SPSS Inc. by IBM is now known as "IBM SPSS Statistics." This product does use any algorithm for text analytics, since it does not have text analytics capabilities. SPSS Inc. offered a number of text analytics products over the years. Some are still available through IBM, others not. These two are still available: SPSS Text Analytics for Surveys and IBM SPSS Modeler. Documentation for each of these products is available through IBM Support Portal (you don't have to be a customer to use it).    Embed Quote
