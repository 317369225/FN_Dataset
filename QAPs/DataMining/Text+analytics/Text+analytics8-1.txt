★Has anyone used text analytics techniques to analyze unstructured patents data?Methodology; Tools; Suggestions; How important is the use of ontologies
We believe that a complete automation technique for the purpose of patent analysis may not work. This is due to the fact that most patents are written to be not found in searches. Further, the keyword clustering tools like Anaqua and Innography have their inherent drawback say they change the taxonomy in real-time as and when newer patents are added. This in the ideal world is not desired. So, we feel that a judicious combination of manual analysis based automation or in simple words machine learning tools can be the ultimate winner.    Embed Quote
