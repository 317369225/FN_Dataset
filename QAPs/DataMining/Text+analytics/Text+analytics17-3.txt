★What is the best sentiment and text analytics software for a Voice of the Customer (VOC) program?
I've used iPerceptions, but there are companies like Foresee who is in the same space for VOC program.  The challenge is these solutions maybe good at answering VOC for overall website efforts, but may not be so good at page level analysis on its survey verbatim.  Then you probably need Qualaroo like service. I am still learning myself so I don't know what the best service would be, but some companies do integrate their social media efforts and feed those data into Radian 6 like sentiment analysis tools.  Little costly though...    Embed Quote
