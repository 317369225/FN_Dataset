★What is the best text analytics API + service?There are a lot of text analytics / text analysis APIs out there. What is your experience and what API do you think is the best one?
We (http://AYLIEN.com) just launched our Text Analysis API: an easy-to-use bundle of 8 different NLP, Machine Learning and Information Retrieval functions that allow developers extract meaning and insight from documents with ease. Here's what you can do with our API: Article Extraction: Extracts the main body of article, including embedded media such as images & videos from an URL and removes all the surrounding clutter. Article Summarization: Summarizes an article into a few key sentences. Classification: Classifies a piece of text according to IPTC NewsCode standard into more than 500 categories. Entity Extraction: Extracts named entities (people, organizations, products and locations) and values (URLs, emails, telephone numbers, currency amounts and percentages) mentioned in a body of text. Concept Extraction: Extracts named entities mentioned in a document, disambiguates and cross-links them to DBPedia and Linked Data entities, along with their semantic types (including DBPedia and schema.org types). Language Detection: Detects the main language a document is written in and returns it in ISO 639-1 format, from among 76 different languages. Sentiment Analysis: Detects sentiment of a document in terms of polarity (positive or negative) and subjectivity (subjective or objective). Hashtag Suggestion: Automatically suggests hashtags for better discoverability of content on Social Media.
