★What software companies in India are focused on text analytics such as semantics and grammar rules?I am interested in independent companies as well as resellers, business partners.
Hoping this might help you. Do not know exact s/w companies but then some companies that do text mining and text to voice (vice versa) are Clarabridge (US), IBM India, Nuance,[24]7, Mesh labs- places where few of my friends work. To a lesser extent, analytics divisions of  Infy, TCS, Accenture,  - all having major BPO operations are getting into it..    Embed Quote
