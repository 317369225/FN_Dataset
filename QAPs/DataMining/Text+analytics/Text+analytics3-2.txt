★What are current commercial text analytics tools lacking?I'm talking about seemingly do-it-all solutions like Clarabridge. What business or user needs are they currently not responding to or what features or usability elements could be improved?
Most text analytics tools are very good when extracting common sense knowledge, but most often they lack of precision when analyzing special, sometimes more complex domains like 'clean energy' or 'buildings performance'. In this case a thesaurus based text mining approach comes into play: take a look at http://api.reegle.info/ and http://poolparty.biz/products/po... The use of enterprise vocabularies to analyze large text corpora becomes a more and more feasible method especially when the creation of thesauri is not as costly as it was in former days since a lot of (linked) open data can be re-used now to generate seed thesauri.    Embed Quote
