★What is the best text analytics API + service?There are a lot of text analytics / text analysis APIs out there. What is your experience and what API do you think is the best one?
Being from OpenAmplify I am naturally biased but we generally work well. :-)We have some customers using OpenCalais for entity extraction and OpenAmplify for Sentiment, Intention and Guidance among other signals. They can work very well together depending on what you are looking to accomplish.    Embed Quote
