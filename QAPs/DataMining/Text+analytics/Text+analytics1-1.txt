★What are the coming revolutions in text analytics?
I think that a combination of algorithms can currently be used to understand text(s) at a deep level. Building systems that combine PoS tagging, named entity extraction, classifications, and topic modeling, can lead to a deep insight into the motivations and interests of the 'writers' across a body of text.  This insight will, however, be generalised; the revolution will come when we can take the full understanding that these methods have given us and train a system based on our interpretation of the outcome to give us details - way beyond sentiment analysis - about the person posting a tweet, in real time. I don't see this as just a text analysis revolution - it is a data combination revolution, as information corporations hold about their customers is in many different places and forms, and fully understanding those customers means you have to combine all these forms and sources of information.    Embed Quote
