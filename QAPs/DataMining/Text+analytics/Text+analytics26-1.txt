★For social media in a business context, what differences are there between social media monitoring, text analytics, and predictive analytics tools?Most vendors seem to be competing against each other across these categories rather than within the categories, including the clubbing together of these tools in various analyst reports. As a technical consultant I find it confusing & usually a hurdle while convincing the client why a particular vendor product is not enough for their needs.
It appears the SM monitoring is focused on transactional, rather than contextual, data and rudimentary semantic analysis based on that data. I have seen it used primarily for brand reputation management as early warning/alarm tools, and influencer relationship tracking. Text analytics is used most often for internal Voice of Customer generated data, because the most tools, I am aware of, require upfront serious software "training" investment that is not very scalable across different domains. Deploying such a technology for an open context Social Media content, without specific target or focus, is very difficult thing to sell internally. I have seen only very few corporate attempts crossed the line from "pilot" into "process". I think predictive analytical models are the "holy grail" for all of these ideas, but I have yet to see one that was consistently validated by historic data. There may be a few reasons for that: 1. The user generated content have become available, in representative volumes, relatively recently. Therefore methodologies and their implementations are only starting to mature enough to even produce meaningful models; 2. Corporate customers are not very trustful without a proof which makes it a familiar chicken/egg situation - the modeler needs access to historic data to validate a model, but cannot have it because the proposed model has no proof in the eyes of the data "owner". The only accepted models, I know of, are based on publicly available data.    Embed Quote
