★What are current commercial text analytics tools lacking?I'm talking about seemingly do-it-all solutions like Clarabridge. What business or user needs are they currently not responding to or what features or usability elements could be improved?
Relative to automated solutions, accuracy (Precision and Recall) is quite a bit better with crowdsourcing. At CrowdFlower, we have a software layer that trains and authenticates workers in real-time, so the spin-up time for new projects is also minimal. Check out https://senti.crowdflower.com/ for a simple tool to identify topics/relevance and measure sentiment, powered by crowdsourcing.    Embed Quote
