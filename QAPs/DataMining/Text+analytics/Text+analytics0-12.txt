★What is the best text analytics API + service?There are a lot of text analytics / text analysis APIs out there. What is your experience and what API do you think is the best one?
If you're looking for an API that does sentiment analysis from a a given piece of text, I suggest these two: - http://www.mashape.com/apis/Text... Sentiment analysis, stemming and lemmatization, part of speech, tagging and chunking, phrase extraction and named entity recognition. - http://www.mashape.com/apis/Sent... Multilingual sentiment analysis API to classify short texts as positive or negative. The system uses advanced statistical model trained on social data, meaning the detection can handle slang, common misspellings, emoticons, hashtags, etc. There is a paid version as well (for high traffic): http://www.mashape.com/apis/Sent... For Chinese text analysis you can also take a look at this: http://www.mashape.com/apis/Enli... Hope it helps.    Embed Quote
