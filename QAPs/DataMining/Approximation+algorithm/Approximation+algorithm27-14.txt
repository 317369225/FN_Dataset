★Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
I'm obviously biased, but I think the discovery and rapid development of the networking/algorithms area now known as distributed hash tables (or structured peer-to-peer networks) probably qualifies.  I don't know what the right metric for "brilliant" is.  In this case, this class of algorithms allows you to communicate "quickly", i.e. in O(LogN) time across very large (e.g. billion node) networks.  From an empirical standpoint, DHTs have been fairly influential, in that they dominated major networking and systems conferences for the better part of 5-6 years in the early 2000's.  The initial set of core papers in this space, particularly those on the first batch of 4 systems (tapestry, pastry, chord and CAN) all have 10,000+ citations on google scholar. For a while, these protocols were not adopted in any practical sense.  Then they were used to build trackerless bittorrent, then the core ideas/algorithms were used in Amazon's scalable, eventually-consistent NoSQL key/value store Dynamo (2007), and more recently Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.  There are also variants of these "consistent hashing" algorithms in no-SQL stores like memcached and others.    Embed Quote
