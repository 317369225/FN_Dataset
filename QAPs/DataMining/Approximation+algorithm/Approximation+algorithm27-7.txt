★Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
Billions of fast fourier transforms are run everyday. The MIT sparse fast fourier transform improves on the speed of fourier transforms for a good range of practical cases. The improvement is based on giving weights to certain frequencies, processing only those important (heavily weighted) frequencies efficiently while discarding the rest (without significant loss of information). The MIT team was not the first to explore the idea, but had managed to squeeze greater performance out of this technique, thus opening up the possibilities of practical applications.
