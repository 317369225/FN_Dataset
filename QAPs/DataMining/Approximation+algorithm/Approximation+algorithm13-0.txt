★Apart from MIT videos, what are some good video lectures (full courses) on approximation algorithms, online algorithms and randomized algorithms?
The Stanford "Mining Massive Datasets" course, offered through Coursera, is an excellent survey of those topics.  For me, it added a lot of depth to areas touched on by other courses I've taken in algorithms, data science, statistics, and machine learning.  Unfortunately, the session just ended and it is uncertain when it will be offered again.  However, the text, which I found very accessible, is available for free (Mining of Massive Datasets), as is material from the Stanford course.    Embed Quote
