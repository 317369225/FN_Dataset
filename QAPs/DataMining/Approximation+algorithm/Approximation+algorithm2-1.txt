★What is the good source to learn Approximate algorithm?Looking for a good tutorial on approximate algorithm problem. Basically, how to select a small data set from large corpus using approximation theory. Will greedy algorithm work in this case ?
Vazirani's book is probably the best to start with (atleast to my knowledge). For more integer programming and primal-dual stuff, I think Approximation Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems: 1st (First) Edition: Dorit S. Hochbaum (Editor): 8580000199802: Amazon.com: Books is also very good but is probably a more difficult read.    Embed Quote
