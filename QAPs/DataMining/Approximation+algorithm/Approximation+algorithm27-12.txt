★Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
The new IDR methods for iterative solution of generic nonsymmetric linear systems look promising: Link: IDR While a revival of a technique known in the 70s, it was only recently recognized to have serious potential in solving a big problem in iterative solutions: maintaining a good balance between solution speed and memory cost, a problem that plagues nonsymmetric problems unless you have an insanely good preconditioner.    Embed Quote
