★Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
LARS (Least Angle Regression) is an algorithm developed by Efron, et. al. in 2003 to solve L1-penalized regression (the LASSO). It's an awesome algorithm that provides a whole new intuitive interpretation to the optimization problem that results from L1-penalized regression. In short, it's basically a method that is able to select the "right" variables with which to run a particular regression analysis. http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/...    Embed Quote
