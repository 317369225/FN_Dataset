★What are some good online resources for developing approximation algorithms to solve NP-complete problems?
There are many different types of heuristic methods, which find solutions relatively close to optimal relatively quickly, as well as approximation algorithms, which find solutions within a specific bound of the optimal. One type of heuristic method that I have used in programming contests with some success is simulated annealing.  Take a look at this explanation from Numerical Recipes that provides a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem using that approach: http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~csatol... .    Embed Quote
