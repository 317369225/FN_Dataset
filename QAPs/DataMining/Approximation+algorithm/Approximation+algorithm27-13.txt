★Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
http://news.cs.cmu.edu/article.p... A faster algorithms for solving a class of system of linear equations from CMU came out in 2010. Another one relating to the complexity of matrix multiplication from late 2011: A Breakthrough On Matrix Product. One thing to realize is that textbooks are a relative terms. While neither of the above are likely to make their way into undergraduate text books, they will certainly form part of the reading material for the relevant grad classes.    Embed Quote
