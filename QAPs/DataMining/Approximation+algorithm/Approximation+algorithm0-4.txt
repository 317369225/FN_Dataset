★How often are approximation algorithms used in practice?
Approximation and Optimization go hand in hand. Optimization technology is ubiquitous in our society. It schedules planes and their crews, coordinates the production of steel, and organizes the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Optimization clears the day-ahead and real-time markets to deliver electricity to millions of people. It organizes kidney exchanges and cancer treatments and helps scientists understand the fundamental fabric of life, control complex chemical reactions, and design drugs that may benefit billions of individuals. Also, many a time we have heard about Taylor Series. It is used all over mathematics and Robotics for approximations.
