I suppose this is one of the greatest achievements by any IITian although some of the people may not agree with this. Arvind Kejriwal, changing the scenario of the Delhi elections when there was a wave of Narendra Modi all over the country. Giving a common man a hope who used to think "Is desh ka ab kuch nahi ho sakta" Provoking the students in colleges like IITs to participate in politics most of whom don't give a damn about happenings in politics. FYI around 500 IITD students did campaigning for Aam Aadmi Party.    Embed Quote
