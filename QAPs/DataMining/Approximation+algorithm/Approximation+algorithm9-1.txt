★What are some of the must read papers on STOC, FOCS and SODA in last 10 years on approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms and online algorithms that introduced new useful techniques?I have read some such as ARV Sparsest cut, Moser-Tardos LLL paper, Lovett-Meka discrepancy based rounding, Iterative Rounding, Graphical TSP papers, Raghavendra's CSP algorithm. Please let me know other papers and other new techniques to learn.
Off the top of my head, I think Aaron Sidford and Yin Tat Lee's paper (working on a very large sequence of papers with other coauthors) on linear programming is very cool Solving Linear Programs with \~O(sqrt(rank)) Linear System Solves    Embed Quote
