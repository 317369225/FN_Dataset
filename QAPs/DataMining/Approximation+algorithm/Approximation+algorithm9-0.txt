★What are some of the must read papers on STOC, FOCS and SODA in last 10 years on approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms and online algorithms that introduced new useful techniques?I have read some such as ARV Sparsest cut, Moser-Tardos LLL paper, Lovett-Meka discrepancy based rounding, Iterative Rounding, Graphical TSP papers, Raghavendra's CSP algorithm. Please let me know other papers and other new techniques to learn.
A good starting point is the list of all best paper award winning papers: Best paper awards at AAAI, ACL, CHI, CIKM, CVPR, FOCS, FSE, ICCV, ICML, ICSE, IJCAI, INFOCOM, KDD, MOBICOM, NSDI, OSDI, PLDI, PODS, S&P, SIGCOMM, SIGIR, SIGMETRICS, SIGMOD, SODA, SOSP, STOC, UIST, VLDB, WWW However, there are many great papers and often the conference versions of the breakthrough results are not the best place to read for multiple reasons -- the results are not in context, presentation is yet to be polished, etc. Even more often (like in Pablo's answer), a single paper doesn't capture the full picture and state of the field has emerged (or is still emerging) in multiple papers. For example, for the Raghavendra's CSP result there is a much simpler follow-up paper by Raghavendra and Steurer: Page on cornell.edu  There is a nice survey series on Theoretical Computer Science: Foundations and Trends® in Theoretical Computer Science. For fast algorithms for numerical linear algebra there is a new survey by David Woodruff that covers multiple papers (including Clarkson-Woodruff): Page on ibm.com. For differential privacy research there is a survey by Dwork and Roth: The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy. There are also many other surveys that you might find interesting, e.g. for LP/SDP hierarchies there is a survey by Chlamtac-Tulsiani: Page on uchicago.edu    Embed Quote
