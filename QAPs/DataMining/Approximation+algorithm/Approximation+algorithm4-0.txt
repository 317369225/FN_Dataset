★What are some of the practical applications of approximation algorithms?
Problems falling under NP are solved using approximate solutions. For example, evolutionary algorithms do not guarantee global optima. And most of the time, we don't even care. The simplest form of approximation is trying to find an element in an array whose frequency is known to be greater than 50%. Randomly pick an element once: Chances of success =50% Randomly pick an element twice: Chances of success =75% Randomly pick an element 10 times: Chances of success >99% What if you ran this function on thousands of arrays and didn't care about a few wrong results? Instead of O(M*N) solution where M is size of an array, you have an O(N) solution.    Embed Quote
