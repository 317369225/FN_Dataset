★Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?Especially those that may REPLACE some algorithms in current textbook. Since most of the algorithms in textbook are designed in 20th century.
"Lock free" and "non-blocking" data structures are pretty close to the 10-year horizen you've asked about. The academic literature goes back further, but their popularity in commercial software projects really started to take off in the 2000-2010 timeframe. The basic idea is to avoid taking a lock when modifying trees, lists, dictionaries, and other such structures - but still remain safe for multi-threaded use of the structure. Usually this is done with compare-and-swap CPU instructions (which are guaranteed to be atomic and safe) rather than mechanisms that cause other threads to block until some condition is met by the currently-executing thread (for example, all others wait until the current thread has exited a critical section).    Embed Quote
