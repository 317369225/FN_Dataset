★What are some cool applications of eigenvectors?Bonus points for anything that is really "out there."
Google. Specifically, Google's PageRank algorithm works by computing an eigenvector of an adjacency matrix for the internet, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goo... The basic idea is to define a matrix , where i and j run over pages on the internet, with the following property: If you have some probabilities of being on a page i, then the probabilities of being on some page after following a link is the product . An eigenvector of with eigenvalue 1 represents the probabilities of being on some page after following many links, which becomes the page's rank. P.S. I almost feel dirty even answering this question with something like "Google" because eigenvectors are so ridiculously important and ubiquitous. Another cool application is the entire physical world, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham...    Embed Quote
