★As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
1. The definition of "in-place" in page 17 of the third edition should be changed. This definition makes quick-sort to be an in-place algorithm, which is not the case by a standard and more-meaningful definition of in-place algorithm. The space required to store variables and maintain a stack is not counted in the CRLS definition. It can mislead a lot of people to believe that these variables do not contribute to the space complexity, as one tends to understand that an in-place algorithm is optimally (upto a few constants) space-efficient. 2. AVL tree should be included in detail, in place of red-black tree. 3. Suffix tree and suffix array should be included, possibly with a linear-time algorithm, e.g., Ukkonen's algorithm, to construct a suffix-tree. 4. The "selected topics" section covers a lot of advanced topics on algorithm design, but there is no such section for data structure design. For example, the Chapters 27-35 in the third edition contain a lot of topics that are active research areas for algorithm researchers today. Similar advanced topics, e.g., recent advances in succinct and compressed data structures, along with data structures in cell-probe model can be introduced. Of course, such chapters can be appropriately linked to possibly new chapters on algorithm design. 5. The chapter on Linear Programming can be removed.    Embed Quote
