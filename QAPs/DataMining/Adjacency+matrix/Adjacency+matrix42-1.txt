★How can I prove the Pagerank algorithm is correct and works?
If I am not wrong, what you want to prove is the convergence of the Markov Chain to PageRank scores. The transition matrix of the graph is a Stochastic matrix. The PageRank scores form the Principal Eigenvector of the transition matrix. The convergence of the Markov chain to the PageRank scores means that the principal vector is invariant under the action of the transition matrix i.e. the principal eignevector is the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. Now Perron–Frobenius theorem guarantees the existence of such a eigenvector.    Embed Quote
