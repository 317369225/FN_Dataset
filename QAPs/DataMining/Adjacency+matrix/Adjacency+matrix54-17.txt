★As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
That's so nice to hear the news! I have 2 suggests: 1. This one seems to be irrelevant, but I do want the publisher to split the book into 2 fascicules, one for basics and the other for advanced topics. It's a nightmare to carry the single thick book around everyday. 2. You guys may build an open source project or sth else to publish all the example codes (not the pseudo one). It will help those who want to learn algorithm by practice. Thanks again for the new edition!    Embed Quote
