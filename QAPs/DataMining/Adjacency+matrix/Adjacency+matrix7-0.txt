★Is there an adjacency matrix for a connectome other than c. elegans?They claim they have one for a fruit fly http://www.wired.com/wiredscienc... but I cannot figure it out from their data.
The article you point to describes work to map out the shapes and positions of the neurons in the fly brain.  That's the "map" they are talking about.  These guys aren't attempting to pull out the synaptic connectivity graph. I'm not aware of another complete synaptic connectivity graph currently in existence.  The https://eyewire.org/  project may be getting close with doing this for a retina.    Embed Quote
