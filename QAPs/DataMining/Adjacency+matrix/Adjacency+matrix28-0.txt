★What was the math problem Matt Damon's character solved as a janitor in an early scene in Good Will Hunting?
Problem: Find the adjacency matrix A of the above graph G. Find the matrix giving the number of 3 step walks in G. Find the generating function for walks from point i to j. Find the generating function for walks from points 1 to 3. The adjacency matrix L encodes the graph. The entry Lij is equal to k if there are k connections between node i and j. Otherwise, the entry is zero. Problem 2 asks to find the matrix which encodes all possible paths of length 3. Generating function. To a graph one can assign for pair of nodes i,j a series , where an(ij) is the number of walks from i to j with n steps. Problem 3) asks for a formula for f(z) and in problem 4) an explicit expression in the case i=1,j=3. Solution: 1. The adjacency matrix L is 2. [L^2]ij is by definition of the matrix product the sum L-i1 L-1j + L-i2 L-2j +... + L-in L-nj. Each term L-i1 L-1j is not 0 if and only if there is at least one path of length 2 going from i to j passing through k. Therefore [L^2]ij is the number of paths of length 2 leading from node i to j. Similarly, [L^n]ij is the number of paths of length n going from i to j. The answer is 3. The for the summation of a geometric series holds also for matrices: . Cramer's rule for the inverse of a matrix is A^-1 = det(Adj(A)ij)/det(A) leads to det( Adj(1-z L)ij)/det(1-z L) which can also be written as det( Adj(L-z)ij)/det(L-z). 4. Especially, when i=1 and j=3, we get det( Adj(A)13 = 2 z^2 + 2 z^3 and det(L-z) = 1-7 z^2 - 2 z^3+4 z^4. The result can be written as (2 z^3+2z^3)/(1-7 z^2- 2 z^3+4 z^4).
