★What are the important concepts and algorithms that need to be covered in a 10 hour course on basics of graph theory?The course is targeted towards a small set of experienced software professionals who want to gain at least a first level familiarity with graph theory. Further, their inclination is towards applications and not towards proving a lot of theorems.
The above theory outline is very good.  For practical implementations it is important to add join algorithms, since most scalable systems implement transitive closures and edge traversals as some type of (recursive) join algorithm. There is a large body of literature on graph theory but the real-world implementations are bound by the scalability characteristics of relational join algorithms. This does not seem relevant from a purely theoretical standpoint, but from an implementation standpoint it defines most of the current limitations.    Embed Quote
