★Why is there no built-in graph implementation in the Java SDK?Most common data structures are implemented : List, LinkedList, Tree, Map, etc. Why not for Graphs?

So there is no need to implement extra data structure for Graph. For more information on Graph Representation Graph (abstract data type)    Embed Quote
