★What are the important concepts and algorithms that need to be covered in a 10 hour course on basics of graph theory?The course is targeted towards a small set of experienced software professionals who want to gain at least a first level familiarity with graph theory. Further, their inclination is towards applications and not towards proving a lot of theorems.
10 hours is barely enough, but here's an outline: - Different types of graphs:   - directed vs undirected graphs   - weighted vs unweighted.   - cyclic vs acyclic. - Representation of graphs:   - Adjacency list   - Adjacency matrix - Algorithms for graphs   - Polynomial     - Breadth first search     - Depth first search     - Minimum spanning tree (Prims and Kruskal's algorithms)     - Shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm) - Non-polynomial     - Traveling salesman problem (optimal vs suboptimal but polynomial)    - Finding cliques - Fun applications (this could be integrated into the above)   - Social graphs (finding cliques)   - Route optimization (traveling salesman)   - Six degrees of Kevin Bacon (shortest path)    Embed Quote
