★What are the most unexpected places you've seen determinants come up?
Determinants appear as distribution functions in the form of Fredholm Determinants. In intro probability and statistics classes, you learn distributions and densities are usually given as functions of one, two or three variables. For example, the Gaussian distribution and its higher-dimension generalizations have all the nice properties you could ask for: infinitely differentiable, finite moments, symmetric etc. A general distribution function, is not always so simple. The Gaussian Unitary Ensemble from random matrix theory exhibits a distribution in its largest eigenvalues. Since these matrices are unitary, the eigenvalues are real. And since its entries are random variables, the eigenvalues are random. So the eigenvalues themselves are real-valued random variables. If the matrices are properly scaled, the eigenvalues remain bounded. To present it, define the Airy kernel to be where is the solution to the Airy equation  The distribution of the largest eigenvalue in the GUE is The now famous Tracy–Widom distribution was originally discovered via random matrix theory, but appears in many other areas of mathematics as well as physics. The form of the distribution is known as a Fredholm determinant and to make sense of it, one can expand as a series where and the integral is taken over the entire domain.    Embed Quote
