★What is the best easy learning software just to visualize adjacency matrix directed weighted graph?
Cytoscape is my go-to tool - it's very versatile in dealing with different file formats and functional (it's also what the biologists use). Gephi is promising and prettier, but it was still lacking essential functionality when I checked it out last year that made me go back to Cytoscape. If you instead want to programmatically generate graph visualisations, you could check out Cytoscape.js or GraphViz. NetworkX also has some graph visualisation functionality.
