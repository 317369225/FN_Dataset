★Given a graph with 10 vertices and 10 edges. What would be a more space efficient representation, adjacency list or adjacency matrix and why?
I guess this is fairly straightforward. Since the count of edges isn't much, an adjacency list would be preferred. An adjacency matrix has a fixed space requirement of . On the other hand, an adjacency list has a space requirement of . As a rule of thumb, when the graph is dense, i.e. , use an adjacency matrix, otherwise for sparse graphs like the given one, use an adjacency list. As far as time efficiency is concerned, an adjacency matrix is fast if you just want to check if a given edge exists but is slow if you want to iterate over all edges. For adjacency lists, its exactly the opposite. In general, this choice would be determined by the problem you're trying to solve.    Embed Quote
