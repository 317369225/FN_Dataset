★What was the math problem Matt Damon's character solved as a janitor in an early scene in Good Will Hunting?
There were two Math Problems solved by Matt Damon's character in Good Will Hunting. None of them is unsolved or very difficult problem, in reality. Problem 1: For the graph G 1) Find the adjacency matrix A 2) Find the matrix giving the number of 3 step walks 3) Find the generating function for walks from point i to j. 4) Find the generating function for walks from points 1 to 3. Solution for Problem 1: http://www.math.harvard.edu/arch... Problem 2: Find all Homeomorphically Irreducible Trees of degree ten (i.e ten nodes). (A Homeomorphically irreducible (or series-reduced) tree is a tree in which there is no vertex of degree 2. So, the question means we need to join ten nodes together such that all nodes are connected to at least one other node. No cycles are allowed and only one line is allowed between two nodes. Most important property of a homeomorphic tree must be satisfied i.e all nodes must have 1 or more lines connecting to other node and no node can have degree of 2.)
