★Can a network be unambiguously defined other than by its adjacency matrix?Is it possible to compress a network using some of its characteristics?
Well, you run into the same compression issues that you do everywhere else. If you want to represent all the numbers between 1 and n using numbers no bigger than n, then if you make any number smaller you must make some numbers bigger.  A lossless compression scheme consists of some choice of numbers that you are willing to make even bigger in exchange for getting some compression on a particular subclass of "nice" numbers. If you're doing lossless image compression, for instance, you'd like to get some compression on things that look like photos (so: large contiguous areas with identical or slowly-varying colors); in exchange, you're willing to make the representations of things which don't look like photos (e.g. white noise) take up even more space than they did to begin with. The point is that this is domain-dependent.  You probably wouldn't want to try applying lossless JPEG compression to a file full of text or to an audio file. If you want to do the same thing to a graph, you need to identify a particular class of graphs that you want good compression on, and be willing to sacrifice size of anything outside your class.  The smaller your target class, the better your compression can be.  What consistutes a "good" or "bad" graph depends very heavily on your intended application, and what kind of graphs are likely to crop up there. If you provide more information about the kinds of graphs you're trying to compress, someone could probably point you in a reasonable direction to start from.    Embed Quote
