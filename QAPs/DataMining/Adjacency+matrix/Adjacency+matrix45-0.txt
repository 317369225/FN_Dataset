★What is an efficient algorithm to find an island of connected 1s in a matrix of 0s and 1s?
The two questions aren't independent: If the number of islands > 0, that means there exist an island. Hence, you only need the algorithm to count the number of islands a[i,j] is the 0s and 1s matrix island[i,j] if the island number of that cell. head[k] is the "father" island of island[k]. we simply need to loop through the matrix (top down, left to right), and check if our current cell is connected to any previous island to the left and above. There are only 3 cases: - the cell to the left is an 1-cell -> connect that cell to its left's island - the cell above is an 1-cell -> connect that cell to the island of the cell above - both cells are 1-cells -> connect the two island (make 1 island child of the other, by changing head) and mark the current cell belong to that island. At the end, the number of island is the number of elements in array head.    Embed Quote
