★What is the best easy learning software just to visualize adjacency matrix directed weighted graph?
Your question asks specifically about an "adjacency-matrix, directed, weighted" graph. This is pretty specific, especially the "adjacency-matrix" part: that's part of the graph's internal storage, not the graph's structure itself. So I'm going to assume that you already have a program to store and operate on your graph. If you're looking for a system to let the user of your program see this graph, then my suggestion would be to roll your own. If you know basic graphics programming, writing a program to display a graph is really simple: draw circles, add text, draw edges with different thicknesses. Here's one I made using my own graphics library on my GitHub. My graph visualizer showing a directed graph with the shortest path highlighted. If you're looking for a system for you, the developer, to visualize graphs, I would stick with drawing by hand, as Denis Mită suggests. I don't think it would be worth the time to automate this process.    Embed Quote
