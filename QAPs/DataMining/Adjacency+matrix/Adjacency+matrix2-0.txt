★Can a network be unambiguously defined other than by its adjacency matrix?Is it possible to compress a network using some of its characteristics?
By definition, a network is essentially nothing other than its adjacency matrix.  The question then becomes of whether it is possible to compress how the adjacency matrix is stored. In most networks, this is likely to be possible.  Most networks are sparse, in the sense that most nodes are not directly connected to most other nodes.  It is then much better to simply record the adjacencies in the network than to record both the adjacencies and the non-adjacencies, which is what the adjacency matrix does. In essence, rather than storing the whole adjacency matrix as a collection of 0's and 1's, it is better to merely record the locations of the 1's.    Embed Quote
