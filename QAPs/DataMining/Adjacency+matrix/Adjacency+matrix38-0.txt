★How many unique ways are there to cover a 4xN board with tetrominoes?
The key observation is that a valid configuration of the board can be recognized by a Finite-state machine. Think of such a finite state machine as scanning along the board looking at the colors of the boxes in each column. When the finite state machine finds a color belonging to a given tetromino, it only needs to scan at most 3 columns ahead to determine whether the rest of the tetromino has been correctly placed, and it only needs to track a bounded number of "partial tetrominos." Said another way, the FSM only needs to keep track of a 4x5 rectangle at a time (or something like that). It follows that the number of valid configurations of length N can be computed in time logarithmic in N (I will not compute the constant as is the way of my tribe) by applying Exponentiation by squaring to a suitable matrix constructed from a FSM recognizing tilings (essentially its Adjacency matrix). I don't know how standard this idea is in computer science so I don't know how much I should elaborate on this. The Characteristic polynomial of this matrix determines a linear recurrence satisfied by the sequence.    Embed Quote
