★What is the running time of a BFS traversal algorithm if the underlying graph is represented by an adjacency matrix?
The running time of BFS will remain the same no matter what the underlying representation is.You have to access the adjacent vertices for a given vertex just popped off the queue and add the unmarked ones back to the queue.So whether it is adjacency list or matrix, the complexity remains the same i.e. O(V+E)    Embed Quote
