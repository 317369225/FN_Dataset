★Which graph representation is better for competitive programming in C++: adjacency list or adjacency matrix?I want to implement some basic graph algorithms such as - bfs, dfs, dijkstra, mst- prim's and kruskal, max bipartite matching etc.. I want to know which is better representation for graph in terms of easy to manage with time and space - especially for competitive programming.
None of the two representation can be called better than the other. Each representation has some advantages and disadvantages. So if number of vertices is large in comparison number of edges then use adjacency list. Otherwise use adjacency matrix.    Embed Quote
