★How can I constantly update myself with new data structures?I came to know about Trie data structure during an interview  preparation. I did not know until my undergraduate degree. How do I constantly update myself with new data structures?
I've been learning through answers people post on Quora.  That usually leads to me going through Wikipedia.  When you find a cool data structure on Wikipedia, you can usually scroll to the bottom, click the bigger category, and then find more cool stuff.  Here are some cool data structures to get you started in your studies: Bloom Filter XOR Linked List (not really that practical, but still interesting) Suffix tree Suffix array LCP array Binary heap Fibonacci heap Soft heap Relaxed heap Pairing heap Leftist heap Queue Brodal queue Deque Priority queue Stack Hash table / Set Cuckoo hashing Segment tree Binary search tree AVL tree Splay tree Red-black tree B-Tree PR-Quadtree R-Tree Radix tree Hash trie Van Emde Boas tree Fenwick tree / Binary indexed tree Segment tree Interval tree Range tree Order statistic tree Adjacency list Adjacency matrix Rope Skip list Treap Disjoint set Sparse array Sparse matrix Maybe also check out: List of data structures    Embed Quote
