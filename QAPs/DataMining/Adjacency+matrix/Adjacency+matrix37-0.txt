★What kind of problems give an MLE (memory limit exceeded)?I'm wondering because most problems can yield either WA or TLE verdicts, but I have never seen a problem that gives MLE.
To be fair, memory limit exceeded is a pretty rare occurrence. Problems aren't usually set such that you have to optimize for memory. Here's a really simple problem that can yield MLE: Given two strings, both with length up to 10^4 characters, compute the edit distance between the two strings. If you naively implement quadratic-time edit distance, you will hit the memory limit because you're storing a two-dimensional array which holds 100 million integers. There is a solution that uses linear memory - you only need to store two rows of the edit distance table at a time.    Embed Quote
