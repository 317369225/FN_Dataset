★Pattern Recognition: Why is Spectral Clustering named so? What does spectral refer to?
Spectrum, in this case, refers to the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix. Eigenvalues are basically used to reduce the dimensionality of the data points because they help us rank the dimensions (from most important to least important). Similarity matrix basically quantifies the amount of similarity between the data points we have. Coming to the question, spectral clustering refers to using those eigenvalues to reduce the number of dimensions before we apply clustering. Clustering in lower dimensions is faster than clustering in higher dimensions (and less complex too).    Embed Quote
