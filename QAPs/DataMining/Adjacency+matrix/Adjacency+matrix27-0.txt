★How would one find a number of triangles in a given undirected graph?
Take the adjacency matrix, where an entry i,j is 1/0 if the edge from i to j exists/doesn't exist and multiply it with itself. Then take the Frobenius inner product of that matrix and the original, which is a fancy name for the sum of their element-wise products. This idea is similar to how the Floyd-Warshall algorithm works, where paths can be combined by viewing the graph as an adjacency matrix. The runtime of this will be better than the naive algorithm if you use a fast matrix multiplication algorithm.    Embed Quote
