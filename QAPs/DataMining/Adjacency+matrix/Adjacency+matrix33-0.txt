★What are the most amazing applications of linear algebra?for example in the fields of computers science, 3d-animations, quantum mechanics, economics or engineering.
TL;DR: Modern web search engines use many techniques to estimate the relevance of pages. An important one is link analysis based on the concept of eigenvector centrality, which comes from linear algebra. Details The basic intuition behind these methods is that the relevance of a page should be proportional to the total relevance of pages linking to it: Here is 1 if page j links to page i, and 0 otherwise, and c is some non-zero constant. If you squint a bit, you'll see that the equation schema above can be expressed more compactly in terms of matrices and vectors: In the language of linear algebra, this says that the relevance vector R is an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix A of the web.    Embed Quote
