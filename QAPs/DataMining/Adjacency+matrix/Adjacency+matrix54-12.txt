★As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
I'm very satisfied with CLRS already, but as a student I don't have enough experience to judge the quality of the topics. If I were you I would look through algorithms syllabi from various universities and see if there are any topics that they're consistently covering that aren't in the book. This is a class that's being taught at Stanford this quarter: CS 161 -- Design and Analysis of Algorithms -- Course Information And this is a class that was taught at Caltech: CS 38 (Winter 2014)    Embed Quote
