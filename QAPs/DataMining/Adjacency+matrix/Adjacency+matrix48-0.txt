★A density matrix seems to resemble a graph adjacency matrix. Has this similarity been thoroughly explored? Are there any interesting consequences of such a similarity?
This recent arxiv paper from a couple months ago establishes a mapping between the Ising model (used for modelling magnetism in classical statistical mechanis and quantum field theory) and the variational renormalization group (used in Restricted Boltzmann Machines). They find that there are some remarkable similarities between physical systems and deep learning, and that machine learning has potential to be very useful in modelling the behavior of physical systems. A. Mehta and D. Schwab. "An exact mapping between the Variational Renormalization Group and Deep Learning." Since the Ising model is NP-Complete, this also suggests that new types of computers can be built which, by solving the Ising model, can exactly solve NP-complete problems. Whether or not this is practical is up to debate. Barry Cipra. "The Ising Model is NP-Complete." Claude Fabre. "Optical computing: The optical Ising machine." Nature Physics (2014).    Embed Quote
