★How can you explain this diagram of the hierarchical hidden Markov model to a layman in only a thousand words?From Hierarchical hidden Markov model
Imagine you're going on a journey.  At the first place you stop, there are three parts of town you can go to. There's some probability for each part that you might visit there. When you get to a part, it might have several neighborhoods. There's some probability for each neighborhood that you might visit there. There's also some probability you might visit another neighborhood, or return to the place in the part you started from, or you might go to another part of town.   When you get to a neighborhood, it might have several streets in it.  You know what streets are available to visit. There's some probability for each street that you might visit there. When you visit a street, there's some probability you might visit another street there, or return to the place in the neighborhood you started at.   A hidden hierarchical Markov model is like your journey, and in it you know the chances at each stop that you might go to the next stop, or some related stop, and what your allowable possible paths might be on the trip.    Embed Quote
