★What is the state of the art in speech recognition? Are HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) still used both by the research community and companies?
Yes, the underlying models for phonemes in most state-of-the-art systems are still HMMs. The recent application of deep learning in this field only affects the acoustic and language models; the underlying phoneme structure remains unchanged. Recurrent Neural Network offers a promising alternative to HMM, as shown recently by Andrew Ng's group at Baidu: http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567    Embed Quote
