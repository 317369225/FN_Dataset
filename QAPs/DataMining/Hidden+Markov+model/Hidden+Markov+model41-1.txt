★Hidden Markov Models: Why is there no analytical method to solve for HMM parameters?
Many (most?) procedures in statistics are not analytically solvable and involve iterative computation. The estimating equations are simply too complicated to be solved analytically. Even the fairly benign logistic regression, for instance, does not have an analytic solution in the same sense as OLS, even though the likelihood is globally concave. However, it turns out that, as Nelder & Wedderburn showed, an iteratively reweighted sequence of least squares problems (IRLS) using "working variables" which are the result of Taylor series expansions converges to the ML estimator. If the regularity conditions are met the log-likelihood is "sufficiently quadratic" that the second order Taylor series is adequate. Anything that involves a spectral decomposition can be written in a bilinear form, but the actual calculation is itself iterative (using something called QR iteration).    Embed Quote
