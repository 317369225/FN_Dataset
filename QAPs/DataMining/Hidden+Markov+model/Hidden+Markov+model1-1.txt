★How can hidden Markov models be used to recognize cursive handwriting?
I haven't done this but it is an intriguing question. I think I would start by defining pen strokes, the linking pen strokes to letters and finally letters to words. Once you have words, you are then able to use existing technologies. Basic pen strokes probably would be defined as vertical, slanted right, slanted left, horizontal, long, short, convex arc up, convex arc left, convex arc down, convex arc right. Unlike Chinese characters where the start and end of character strokes are defined, you probably can not make these assumptions for Latin letters expect at the very beginning and end of a complete pen path. These would identify the lowest level of nodal points.  Then identify loops, start points, and end points. Next you will have to assign probabilities. In this case,  since you have a data base of writing, I would use frequencies of occurrences for the initial probabilities rather than using training for setting probablilities. I think you can then see where I am going with this. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
