★I am interested in predictive analysis. Apart from Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models what are the main constituents of predictive analysis that one must learn?
That's a broad question; I would start with the question "How to become a data scientist" here on QuoraHow do I become a data scientist? (links to: /How-do-I-become-a-data-scientist), then move on to the Machine Learning Machine Learning (links to: /Machine-Learning) entries in wikipedia Wikipedia for high level overviews.   Hastie and Tibshirani "Statistical Learning" [1] is an excellent textbook that will introduce you to the field, but it will require you to show up knowing linear algebra.  You can get a gentler introduction by looking at the online course notes from Scott Page's "Introduction to Modelling."   " [2]  Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov models are especially important in natural language processing (NLP) (eg: predicting the next word and using it to disambiguate speech with noise) but I wouldn't start there unless that is your domain of interest.   I would start by getting a deeper understanding of regression analysis versus clustering approaches and how they impact the tradeoff trade-off of bias and variance. Both of the works I mentioned above will do that. [1] data mining, inference, and prediction. 2nd Edition. (links to: http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) free download.
