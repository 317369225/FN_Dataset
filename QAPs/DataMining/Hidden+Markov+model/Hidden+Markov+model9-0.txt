★What are the ways of deciding probabilities in hidden Markov models?
There has also been some work recently on spectral local-minimum-free algorithms for learning HMM parameters. See [1] for a 2009 paper about learning HMM parameters with discrete observations, and [2] for a 2010 paper on estimating parameters with continuous observations.
