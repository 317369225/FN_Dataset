★Hidden Markov Models: How do you get the next predicted observed value from a HMM?
Hello, let's forget about 4 mixtures for simplicity, assume only 1 gaussian per state. In this case, there is a different expected observation value (mean of gaussian) for each of the 5 states. I think you are thinking of doing it in the following way (correct me if I'm wrong)   Likelihood of 1st state = height of gaussian1_state1 at its mean value * transition probability (current state -> 1st state)   Likelihood of 2nd state = height of gaussian2_state2 at its mean value * transition probability (current state -> 2nd state)   .. and so on for Likelihood of 5th state.   After you get these 5 likelihoods (L1, L2, .., L5), you do   L1*mu1 + L2*mu2 + .. + L5*mu5 (muX is the mean of gaussian of Xth state, X = 1,2 ,...,5)   to get the expected observation value.   But this method is not accurate because you are directly multiplying transition probability (range [0 1]) with gaussian height (range (0 - inf)) .. so relative contribution by both of them could be something of YOUR choice.    Embed Quote
