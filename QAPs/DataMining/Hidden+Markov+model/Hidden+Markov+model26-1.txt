★What is the probability of the model in the hidden Markov model?as you know the posterior distribution of the hidden Markov model when given observation is: p(model | observation) ∝ p(observation | model)*p(model) p(observation | model) is clear and can be obtained. but Is There any way to find p(model)?
I am by no means an expert on this but perhaps this will help.  Frequently people speak of using "an uninformative prior." I do not know if it is ever possible to define a prior which is truly uninformative. What one can hope for is a minimally informative prior. The idea is to use some measure of the information brought by the data and to use the prior that maximizes the information brought by the data.  These notes are a good start: Page on berkeley.edu Page on berkeley.edu  Bernardo, J.
