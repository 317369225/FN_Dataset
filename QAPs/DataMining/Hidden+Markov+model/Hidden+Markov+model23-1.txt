★What is a Hidden Markov Model - Artificial Neural Network (HMM-ANN)?ANN=artificial neural network
I only know of one relevant paper by Yoshua Bengio: Global optimization of a neural network-hidden Markov model hybrid. There may be (and very likely are as this was never my focus of study) other variants. Essentially the ANN computes the observation vectors for the HMM. I don't think the architecture is very relevant anymore due to the advent of deep learning, which works very well on sequential learning tasks, where HMMs or CRFs were originally the state of the art. It may still make some sense on smaller datasets though.    Embed Quote
