★What is the best Python library for Hidden Markov Models?
Some friends and I needed to find a stable HMM library for a project, and I thought I'd share the results of our search, including some quick notes on each library. We ended up using MATLAB's HMM Toolbox, which provides a stable implementation with nice documentation. Unfortunately MATLAB is nonfree. ghmm, a C library with python wrappers. Easy to install on linux. Installation on my friend's mac proved somewhat painful--through trial and error after getting cryptic error messages from autogen, configure and make, we discovered we needed to install macports, then install swig and python-swig, find-replace "libtool" with "glibtool" in the autogen/config scripts, and remember to add the macports python lib path to the python path. The library appeared well developed, but it had two major problems: no documentation, and no support for multivariate Gaussian emission distributions, which made it useless to us. GuyZ's python code, as below. Guy provided some documentation and examples, and his code had no messy dependencies. Multivariate Gaussians are supported. But we gave up after we experienced unpredictable divide by 0 errors when modifying the number of observations. Michael Hamilton's python implementation, hosted at Colorado State. I haven't tried this--it appears to support only discrete emission probabilities. HTK, a C library hosted at U Cambridge which was easy to install, and is fairly well documented. It appears to be geared towards speech applications. We found references to poorly-documented python bindings called "pyhtk". JaHMM, a Java library. The documentation looks great, and the download comes with a precompiled jar and ant targets for creating a fresh jar, which is helpful. The bad news: the last update of this project appears to be in April 2006, which means it requires Java 5. hmmus, a C lib with python bindings which looks easy to install.    Embed Quote
