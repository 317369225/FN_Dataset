★Hidden Markov Models: How do you implement speech recognition through hmm technology to implement it on matlab?
There are few major components in a GMM-HMM based 'continuous' speech recognition system that is used to recognize a word sequence. These are- 1. Feature extraction 2. Language modeling module 3. Acoustic modeling module 4. Recognition/decoding module Depending on the amount of time you have, it may take some months or more to do all this. If you want to build a simple system that can recognize (say) numbers, commands etc. then you are going to do 'isolated word' speech recognition. If you are doing this for the first time, try to implement  simpler methods such as DTW / SVM. For each block, either you can decide to write the code yourself, or use/adapt some code block written by other people, so that it works for your task. Basically, what is your application going to do? You need to explain it in the question details. Also http://lmgtfy.com/?q=speech+reco...    Embed Quote
