★How can we use the Hidden Markov Model to construct a text classification system based on machine learning?
Did you check if the number of words in speech to text conversion engine is matching with the words in the 'correct' sentence? Step 1: In such case you can create a transition probability matrix with words after speech to text conversion as rows and words in correct sentence as columns(transition probability will just be number of times "which" was spelt as "itch" / # of times itch appeared in your documents) Step 2: Use this matrix as a reference table to replace your words(based on maximum probability) Note: You can always construct this probability matrix even for bi-grams or any n-grams Suppose you have created transition probability matrix with uni-grams, bi-grams, try-grams etc Now to use them for your sentence correction you start with uni-gram transition table pick the highest probability replacement  assign it as temporary replacement word, no check the bi-gram matrix for probability value compare it with the bigram without temp replacement  probability(keep the word as is if the bigram probability of actual word is higher than temp replacement word) I know i have explained in a complex way :) but some tech stuffs are not very easy to explain. I hope my response is clear and helpful?    Embed Quote
