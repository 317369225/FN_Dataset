★What are the differences between Hidden Markov Models and neural networks?
The two component of HMM are: 1.State 2.Observation For the simplest of HMM you have a state corresponding to each observation, in which the current state is dependent of previous state/s.(depends on order of the HMM) The states are hidden but the observation are visible: Say you have States={Horny,Normal,Guilty} and you observation sequence is the video you are watching on you computer: observation={sherlock,friends,porn,lesbian porn,porntube} corresponding state={normal,normal,horny,horny,horny,...} Though the states are hidden you know what will be most probable states. And may be you can predict the next state.(guilty) PS:HMM are a special case of Directed Graphical Models, aka Bayesian Networks. On the other hand Neural Network is broad topic: With respect to you question you must be talking about Multi level perceptron. As with case of HMM the hidden "things" are states but in MLP the hidden things are hidden  units.(which are simple computational units, say a linear combinator using sigmoid function) which combine to form a classifier. On the whole: Neural Networks have hidden computational units and HMM have hidden states.    Embed Quote
