★How can hidden Markov models be used to recognize cursive handwriting?
The problem is very similar to a gesture recognition problem, where HMMs are often the first choice. In (dynamic) gesture recognition, a hand tracker gives you a point (x,y) or (x,y,z) for each frame of the video, and the task is to extract the shape/letter/gesture the user is doing.  In this setting, there are no explicit strokes. The trajectory is usually continuous, similar to your case. Take a look at this video for example (this is for a mouse, but essentially the same): The youtube links has a link to the source code. There are many papers on hand writing recognition with HMM, and on gesture recognition with HMM. One relevant example: http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreport... This is a fun problem. Enjoy!    Embed Quote
