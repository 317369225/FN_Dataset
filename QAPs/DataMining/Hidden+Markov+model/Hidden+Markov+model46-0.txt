★What is a way to recognize human actions using the Hidden Markov Model?What is the observation sequence and what is the hidden states in this model? I already got the features from the silhouettes, and what should I do to these vectors?  Thanks and waiting for the answers!
You try to map position of the body to the sequence of actions. Observation sequence will be the the sequence of silhouette features you computed. For example, the height for the hand or angle of the body at certain moment of time. This would be a sequence of float vectors. The hidden sequence is the sequence of actions itself (man raised, man turned the hand), this is a discrete sequence of symbols. To implement the human action recognition system you can use standard libraries. One needs to feed in the sequence of features (positions of the body) and get the most probable hidden sequence (sequence of actions).    Embed Quote
