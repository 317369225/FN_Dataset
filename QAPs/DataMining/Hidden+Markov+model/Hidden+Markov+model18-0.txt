★How do you find the meanings of hidden states in hidden markov models?When training a HMM, we only give the observed sequence and the number of hidden states. Then how do we know the meanings of hidden states? I found in certain applications such as speech recognition, researchers seem to be very well aware of what each states represents (what letter, or what syllabus, for example). How does this work? Thanks.
You look at them and hope that they make sense in light of whatever theory you have about what you're studying, but you shouldn't count on it.  Interpretability is not something you get for free with HMMs.    Embed Quote
