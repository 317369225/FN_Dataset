What are some must-take courses for a career in data analysis?
I don't know where you are based, but I like Miguel's answer. In Holland,  where I am based, every university student, regardless of major, takes a (dreaded) Statistics 101 course for this purpose. I imagine you could attend something like that in your country as well.    Embed Quote
