What is the best affordable hosted big data analysis service?
I have a strong bias away from hadoop: it makes everything 10x harder than it needs to be.  If you can possibly not use it I'd recommend not doing so; working with data in a single threaded global memory space is several orders of magnitude easier. For 10GB of data, I'd point out that first, you will almost certainly have an in-memory representation that is much smaller than ascii or unicode text.  Plus you can always try normalizing your data (if a field has repeated entries with a relatively small cardinality, store an index into a table of values instead of the value proper.  This is frankly more convenient for lots of learning algorithms anyway). My suggestions: You can shove 16GB of ram into a recent macbook pro for $160-ish [1].  Postgres or mysql will perform damn fast on good disks.  Rent a high ram server on ec2.  Avoid as long as possible wasting endless hours on hadoop and hive unless you absolutely positively cannot do it any other way.  And even then, try another way first =P  Unless this is a learning exercise, in which case, have fun. Feel free to contact me offline if you don't want to share more details here. [1] http://www.crucial.com/store/mpa...    Embed Quote
