What are some must-take courses for a career in data analysis?
For undergrad, Miguel’s recommendation to check out Coursera (Coursera) is a good one. If later you are interested in a graduate program, University of California, Berkeley has a Master's in Data Science program that is also taught online (datascience@berkeley). If you are interested in field-specific data analysis (e.g. educational measurement within the field of Education), I recommend checking out the course offerings within undergraduate programs specifically for that field. Best of luck! :-)    Embed Quote
