★What is the future of data analysis?
Today, a typical project starts with us sitting down with a dataset we got from a customer, trying to find patterns in it. In the future, we start by first linking that dataset to everything else.   Say your dataset is sale of different products from a chain of retail outlets. You connect databases and ontologies that sort brands of soft drinks as similar products, connect surveys on which market demographic drinks what then connect that to age and income demographics around each outlet to see if sale matches expectations. For brands of clothes, the sale from outlets is combined with mining what people have been searching for on the net and talks about on social networks, coupled with geoIP, both to check if local advertisement is having an effect and guiding visibility in the shop towards current buzz. Analyzing sales from a downtown kiosk near the park, you cross-link with weather reports, bus schedules and nearby activies such as outdoor concerts.   When our data analysis starts, the choice of methods is guided by analysis and results done on plenty of similar data sets. You may even be able to get your answers just by doing a meta-analysis of previous studies, before your customer has had time to send you their data    Embed Quote Updated 21 Sep, 2011. 3,012 views.
