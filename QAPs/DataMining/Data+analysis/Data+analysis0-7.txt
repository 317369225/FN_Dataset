★What is the future of data analysis?
Good question and nice link! I think the future of data analysis will shift from small data set analysis to large-scale data analysis. This is due to the advance in technology. Getting a large amount of data is much easier than it was 50 years ago. Analysis of large-scale data brings potential improvement as well as challenges in making inferences. It requires a new set of methodology which is different but connected to what Fisher and Pearson discovered in the 19th century or early 20th. This is just my personal thinking.    Embed Quote
