What are some common fallacies or mistakes made by beginners in Statistics/Machine Learning/Data Analysis or they are prone to make?
A couple that haven't been mentioned: Not understanding the role of random sampling in experiment design and hypothesis testing.  If you don't have a simple random sample, you can't just apply the standard testing results and expect good things to happen. Not doing honest experimental design.  If you compare the performance of a group of individuals at a task before and after training, you can't attribute the change in performance to the training.  You need a control group. Not knowing when to describe and when to compare.  If you're interested in the traits of successful entrepreneurs, you shouldn't ask what successful entrepreneurs are like.  You should ask how they differ from unsuccessful entrepreneurs.    Embed Quote
