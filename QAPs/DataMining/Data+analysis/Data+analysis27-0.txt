How do I perform data analysis / machine learning in Python?
Basics: Visualization: Pandas (for table view), Matplotlib, and Bokeh (if you want interaction with the plots), etc. Data manipulation (cleaning, sampling, etc.): Pandas Loading data from SQL: Pandas can read from SQL too Loading data from large csv (IE pulling it from the disk): Pandas Machine Learning: neural nets / self organizing maps / restricted boltzmann machines: PyLearn2 (pure Python library) and Caffe (mostly C++ code but there's a Python wrapper) are two packages that you can use for your DNN needs. Both are under active development. SVM / kernel methods: Scikit-Learn does support SVM/kernel methods. It uses LibSVM (C++ code) under the hood so the performance is good. A* search: Idunno Markov Decision Processes: Idunno Random Forest: Scikit-Learn other useful ML libraries: there are many others but I don't want to name because I don't know your problem(s). At the minimum, you should have these in your arsenal: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib. They are all included if you install Anaconda.    Embed Quote
