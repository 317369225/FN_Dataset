How do I perform data analysis / machine learning in Python?
Brian Feeny's and Mochen Yang's answers are on point, here's my recommendations: For loading data from SQL, I recommend SQLAlchemy, The Database Toolkit for Python. NumPy - Numpy and SciPy.org - SciPy.org are great resources for generic scientific work in python Scikit-learn is likely what you'd use for generic machine learning work. If you want a powerful and highly configurable option for SVMs or logistic regression, I also recommend that you check out the Python wrapper for LIBLINEAR -- A Library for Large Linear Classification. I would also recommend checking out MadLib (which is a machine learning library implemented in SQL, though accessible through a python library like SQLAlchemy).    Embed Quote Updated 2 Sep, 2014. 389 views.
