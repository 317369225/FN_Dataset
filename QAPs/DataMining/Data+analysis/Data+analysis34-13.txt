★Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?
For structured data, R is much more useful and efficient than Python. It is easy to spend lot of time trying to make sense of how Numpy, Pandas in Python handle arrays, matrices and data frames. Manipulating them in Python has a learning curve. Hovewer, for unstructured data (text), I vote for Python than R. It is easy to write your own classes, inherit from other classes, define custom methods to handle that specific way to parse a sentence and do various manipulations with Strings using various libraries. In short, R is good for structured data like a large table of features and Python is good more for unstructured data that requires lots of pre-processing and feature extraction.    Embed Quote
