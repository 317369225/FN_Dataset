★Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?
Most of the comments about R not being a "real language" stem from the fact that a lot of R code is poorly written. A lot of non-programmers use R, and thus a lot of R code out there is quite ugly. But R, as a language, can be quite elegant. To give Python a run for the money, you need to consider the following when writing R code: Approach R as a functional programming language, not an imperative language. Hacked together for loops and complicated control flow in R look disgusting and break easily. Check out this article for more details: Functional programming in R Use data.table and dplyr packages for data manipulation tasks. Base R is extremely slow and memory inefficient for many tasks, largely because of how data.frames work. data.table, in particular, resolves this issue. Create packages. Write unit tests.Follow the above, and suddenly R starts to become a lot more appealing to work with.    Embed Quote
