What are some good ways to automate data analysis?
Since "garbage in, garbage out" still holds true, data analysis can only really be automated if the data collection and inputting are streamlined and automated. Think industrialization.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  The data should be entered in a standardized format, through simple (or structured) sampling, and complete with no missing data.  Always use the same protocol.  Stick with the one that works, vs. changing to the one that's marginally better.  This is always important, but even more important if you really want to achieve automation. Also follow those 80/20, 90/10 rules.  Automate the easy stuff (80% of the work), but spend your time on the 20% - some stuff you'll probably never automate.    Embed Quote
