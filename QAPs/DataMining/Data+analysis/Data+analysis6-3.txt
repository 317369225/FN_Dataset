What are some good ways to automate data analysis?
Bertil made a lot of excellent points. In my opinion, the best small-to-medium-scale BI framework at the moment looks like this: Hadoop stack, PostgreSQL, Tableau. Tableau is a bit expensive and is difficult to master (owing to a dearth of tutorial resources, not inherent complexity) but well worth the cost if your analysts can learn its feature set. Using the framework Bertil outlined, you can define your organization's goals and write Hadoop routines to capture the relevant data. Those aggregations are stored in the PotgreSQL database, which powers the Tableau dashboards but can also be queried against. Not everything can be automated; you'll need BI / data analysts to investigate aberrations or deviations. Note: Cloudera has released a Tableau connector for Hadoop that allows Tableau to connect directly to Hive (http://www.cloudera.com/blog/201...). I've never used this, so I can't comment on it, but I still see value in keeping a relational database between the visualization tool (what if you switch tools? What if your analyst wants to quickly query something but doesn't know HiveQL?) and the Hadoop stack.    Embed Quote Updated 10 Jul, 2012. 494 views.
