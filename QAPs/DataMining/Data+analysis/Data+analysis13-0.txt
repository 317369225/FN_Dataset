★What are some good resources to learn Topological Data Analysis?
I would be more than happy to pass along a few resources that will help you understand Topological Data Analysis (TDA). I am a professor of Mathematics at Stanford and have been studying algebraic topology for 30 years, and computational topology for more than 10 years. Here are a few papers that will provide a good overview of what TDA is and how it works: Mapper: http://comptop.stanford.edu/u/pr... Extracting insights from the shape of complex data using topology: http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/... Topology and Data: http://www.ayasdi.com/_downloads... In full disclosure I am a co-founder of Ayasdi, however, I have been working on applying topology to data analysis for the last 10+ years and truly believe that this is going to change the way we extract data from insights.
