What techniques can be used to perform exploratory data analysis on high dimensional data?
Here are some machine learning techniques to deal with the high dimensional data in explanatory analysis: -decision trees (CART) -bagging -boosting (adaboost, logitBoost, brownBoost, etc) -random forest -cluster analysis -principal component -C4.5 -Naive Bayes -multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) -support vector machines (SVM) And many many others that i can't remember right now; Most of these methods have gained a lot of attention in recent years, including Random forest, although if you ask me which one is the most suitable for your data? My answer is it depends on your data and the Purpose of your study (classification, regression, etc), although i prefer to use some of them together instead of using one.it usually gives better insight.    Embed Quote
