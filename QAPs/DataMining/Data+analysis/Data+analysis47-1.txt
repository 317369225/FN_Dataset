What is the best affordable hosted big data analysis service?
Someone asked me to answer this, so here it goes. 10 GB of text isn't that large, so you are more compute and speed and accuracy bound here if anything. To me I'd start with the type of analytics against the data you need to do. That requires understanding what you want out of the data and what techniques for working with it are most likely to give you the right answer. There is a tendency in this space to consider word counting text analytics, and while I guess at some level it is, that is frankly a lousy way to understand your information if you really need to understand it. Equally, a bag of words approach can be OK-enough if you are doing something very simple, but usually it is marginal for any deeper understanding of what is actually being communicated or the intent etc.... You also need to consider the nature of the text and if it is formal and well structured or very burst oriented etc. We haven't talked about the context of the text and if there related structured events that provide additional meaning that need to be considered. So do as little as possible to get the insight you need, but don't sell short what it takes to really generate understanding. If you can share a bit more about the nature of the text a couple of us can probably give you more guidance on how/where etc...    Embed Quote
