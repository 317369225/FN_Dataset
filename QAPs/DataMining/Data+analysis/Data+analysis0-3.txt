★What is the future of data analysis?
The future is in automated feature detection and weak signal analysis Current applications require the user to define feature sets and scan manually for weak signals, with problems arising in having noisy labels, spurious features, and overtraining  (yes, a correlation is not a causation) Methods are needed to scan through all known feature spaces automatically and to detect statistically significant weak signals.  Recent advances in this space including transductive learning, deep learning, and miminum path basis pursuit techniques, applied at very large scale    Embed Quote
