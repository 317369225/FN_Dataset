Which are some of the best Data Analysis tools?
This is a relatively old/broad question but I've had some fun with a lightweight statistical analysis tool Statwing | From Data to Insight in Seconds. Really good example of the democratization of statistical analysis/data analysis.. simple data uploads, easy to use interface and an engine that draws its own conclusions about the relationships between different data points that might not be immediately apparent to the untrained eye. Again, exponentially more lightweight than traditional tools (e.g. MATLAB) and there is no export chart functionality yet (platform still in beta... may want to think about exporting the charts as images with a watermark for use in presentations) but if you're in the market for something quick and easy... Statwing is worth a look.    Embed Quote
