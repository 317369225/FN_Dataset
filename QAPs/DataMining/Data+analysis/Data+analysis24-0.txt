Are "big data" and data analysis practically distinct?
My guess is that you received a blank look because you were talking to an engineer.  Big data consists of volume, velocity and variety of data.  Engineers deal with volume and velocity; how do we stole all of this data.   Data scientists/analysts deal with the new variety.  These new data sets consist of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.  In order to do any real analysis the data needs to be processed and given a structure.  Current big data analytic trends include dealing with data sets that are too large to be handled in a traditional EDW.  Most current EDW analytics are done in memory.  This restricts the amount of data which can be used.  For the most part enterprise has skirted this issue by sampling the data and developing models from the sample set.  For the most part this works just fine.  If, however you are looking for subtile fluctuation in the data this becomes much more difficult.  As you probably know, large amounts of data tend to smooth out the data set.  This means that small fluctuations that are observed when using the entire set are much more likely to be real rather than noise.   This gives companies the ability to look for small changes that can optimize returns.  Moving away from the traditional analytics, big data architecture allows companies to analyze computer logs and other machine generated data.  (look up Splunk they are amazing) This type of analysis can predict when machine are likely to fail.  It can also give insight into optimizing load balancing and other types of tuning that was previously only accomplished by an engineer turning a knob until the box purred.  The holy grail of big data is to plug into all the crap written and published on the internet via social media and blogs then turn this data into intelligent, fiscally provident decisions.  For the most part this is an uncracked nut but the tools are there to make it work.    Embed Quote
