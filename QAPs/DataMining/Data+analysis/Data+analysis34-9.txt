★Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?
In general, Python has three merits as follows: 1. As a programming language, Python looks like more conventional and has a simpler syntax than R. It is hard for beginners to be well-versed in R because R has an esoteric syntax. But if you are already familiar with the R, it’s nothing; 2. The performance is a lot, not a little, better. Though R’s library functions run well, its self-programmed loop is several times slower than Python. If loaded with big file data, it will be slower than Python by an order of magnitude. I don’t know how R interpreter is developed. While Python is also an interpreted language, it runs much faster; 3. Python is a more general programming system than R. It can be used not only for developing data computing task, but also for system management, WEB service and other tasks.   Once R is more powerful in doing mathematical statistics, now Python has a special Pandas package and becomes almost as powerful as R, except that it’s still a fresh hand.   In dealing with the common structured data analysis, both Python’s Pandas and R’sdataframe can manage many tasks, though not well enough. The professional player in this field is esProc. It provides more powerful data objects and class libraries and supports cursor-style file computing, drawing with Python in performance and defeating R in speed.    Embed Quote
