What are the best consulting firms specializing in big data analysis?
It depends what sort of problems you would like the consultancy to solve. (Perhaps you can edit your question.) For example, if you are concerned with architectural issues, and not incurring technical debt, I would use Concurrent Inc. (http://www.concurrentinc.com/) by Chris Wensel. If you are interested in figuring out how to monetize your data, optimize engagement, or actually do statistical analysis and machine learning on large data sets, my consultancy MetaOptimize (http://metaoptimize.com) focuses on this area.    Embed Quote
