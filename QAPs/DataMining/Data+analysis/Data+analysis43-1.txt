MySQL: How can MySQL be used for big data analysis?
There are two ways in which MySQL can be used for big data analysis.  First, MySQL can be used in conjunction with a more traditional big data system like Hadoop.  Vast amounts of data can be stored on HDFS and processed with Hadoop, with the output being stored on the MySQL server for analysis.  For example, raw metrics might be stored in HDFS, but aggregated/summarized data is sent to MySQL for analysis. Second, MySQL can be used as a big data store.  Typically MySQL will be sharded to support such large volumes of data.  I work on a sharding software that supports parallel queries over shards and partitions and it supports a proxy for transparent access over the shards.  Shard-Query works best with InnoDB or TokuDB.  Alternatively, storage engines like Infobright (compressing column store) or InfiniDB might be employed too.    Embed Quote
