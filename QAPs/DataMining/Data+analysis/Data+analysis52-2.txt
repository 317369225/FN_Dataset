Is the future of technology based in real-time data analysis?
My experience is eCommerce and digital media. Most companies are unable to deliver actionable insights from the data they have currently regardless of timeframe. Real-time insights are just an optimization in terms of speed to insights but it assumes that you have a way to find the actionable insights or at least know what questions you need the data to answer. The biggest opportunity from a data technology perspective is to help businesses translate analytics into actionable business insights. Then it can be optimized.    Embed Quote
