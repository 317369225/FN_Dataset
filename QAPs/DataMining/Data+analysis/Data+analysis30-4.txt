What are some must-take courses for a career in data analysis?
In the corporate world, Web scale companies--Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo, plus smaller companies such as Zynga, Gilt, et al.--have the broadest and most contemporary approach to data science and analytics. They process lots of unstructured data and look for patterns in petabytes of data. Rather than asking whoever will provide an answer on Quora. I would talk to people at these companies, especially those who blog intelligently on data science topics. Many colleges and universities may have a dated sense of what languages are in demand, for example. I think you can safely ignore C/C++ and not invest a lot of time in Perl, for example, as those have been trending down on Github: GitHub language trends and the fragmenting landscape. Many purists look down on JavaScript, but some of the best shops at the top companies are using Node.JS for a reason. It's evolved and is not your father's JavaScript. Learning how to leverage frameworks/libraries/services is essential. Similarly, there's a clear trend in favor of R and away from SPSS. In general, people often use what they're used to, and what they're used to may have been designed before the internet, the web, Hadoop, etc. Their thinking as a result may be constrained by what they know. When it comes to BI, companies in more mature industries often are just looking for their keys under the lamppost because that's where the light is. The most enlightened approaches to data look for the most telling clues wherever you can find them. What a structured dataset provides you might be a lot less relevant than clues you might find outside that dataset. What they don't know could be a lot more relevant to what you might benefit most from studying. The web companies have their own tech blogs that are well worth looking at; by reading them, you can get a sense of how to futureproof and scope your plan.    Embed Quote
