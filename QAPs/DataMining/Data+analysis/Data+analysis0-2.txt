★What is the future of data analysis?
I hope that the future of data analysis is that we dro more to blend the wisdom of people like Tukey with the power of modern computers. The fact that we can now run, say, two dozen different factor analyses in a few minutes tends to blind some of us to the fact that we should think, and think hard, before running the analyses.  The fact that virtually any statistical method is available and fast blinds some of us to the power of looking at means, medians, 5 number summaries and so on. I think many of us also have become less diligent about checking assumptions before running models: Not just the technical assumptions of a method but the prior question of whether the analysis makes sense. Some people have the philosophy "The computer said it, I believe it, that settles it".  Others seem to think "The computer can do it, let's try it, I might like it" I think these tendencies are quite insidious.    Embed Quote
