What's the best free data analysis and visualization software out there right now?
plotly (https://plot.ly/) plotly is a new, free, entirely web-based data analysis and visualization platform. It's built in part with d3.js. You can upload data like CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, or MS Access files or you can send data to plotly from Python, R, Julia, MATLAB, Perl, or Arduino. All the graphs are entirely web based (you can download to PDF, PNG, SVG, or EPS) and can be easily shared with a short-link. You can also set up sharing and editing permissions for your graphs and data online. Here are a few examples of graphs made in plotly: https://plot.ly/~jackp/1002/ https://plot.ly/~carmeloosh/66/    Embed Quote
