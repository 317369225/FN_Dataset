Data Analysis: What is data analysis?
I believe, and always have, that numbers are a perfect way of communicating. I studied linguistics for a while and spent quite a bit of time of metaphors as the antithesis of communication because in the truest form a metaphor is supposed to relate at some point to something physical like an experience. Unfortunately all of us have different roles and experiences and therefore words and metaphors are messy. I love the concept of binary - 1 or 0, seems kind of perfect this precise state of yes or no, on or off, black or white and nothing in between. If you take a random string of binary you cannot predict the outcome if you run it as a program and hence we have lost the precision. Don't get me started on entropy and decay. So why do I mention this? I believe analysis is necessary because of the first two statements above. There is uncertainty in numbers. You cannot take them at face value. There is a linguistic factor of numbers and it is complex across an organization, divided across roles and responsibilities played within the company and all of those outside the company which equal the translation of all the metaphors used to describe data. Analysts are mathematicians and in a way linguists of data. They cannot interpret data without understanding the definition of what they are looking at both in terms of technical (source systems, ingest, transformation) and business (drivers, priorities, concepts). Analysis is the conversion of numbers into meaningful, actionable output. But that is my 2.5 cents.    Embed Quote
