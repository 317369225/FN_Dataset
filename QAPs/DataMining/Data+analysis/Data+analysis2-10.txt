What are the best big data analysis companies?
Well, I don't have the long list as others, but still would like to share the below good companies that I have been following:- Qburst - http://www.qburst.com/ Informatica - http://www.informatica.com/ Aureus Analytics - http://www.aureusanalytics.com/ Platfora - http://www.platfora.com/ TeraData - http://www.teradata.com/?LangTyp... The mentioned companies have been doing well in their own terms for past few years. If you are still looking for more companies then there are various reference site that you can look out for such as Quora, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Yahoo answers, etc. One of the best things I prefer is to Google it. Hope you find the best!!    Embed Quote
