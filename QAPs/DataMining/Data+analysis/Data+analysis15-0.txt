What techniques can be used to perform exploratory data analysis on high dimensional data?
Many people start exploratory analysis using interactive visualization techniques, such as scatterplot matrices, 2-variable graphing, box and whisker plots, bubble charts etc. Often it can be easier to see relations this way, rather than jumping into the statistics.  Of course, once one has some "visual hypotheses" in play, it absolutely makes sense to compare it to a PCA (principal component analysis). Once the PCA is performed, It also makes sense to graph at least the 1st three components with each other, as well as with the original raw variables.    Embed Quote
