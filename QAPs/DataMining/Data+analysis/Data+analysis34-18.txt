★Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?
R is more of a statistical tool and doing anything descriptive is simple and straight forward. However when I have to use R for large amount data, which is the reality, R pushes us into problem obvious problem of memory. For example, sampling looks simple in r but sampling in r from million of records is a lot of time. R has it's own flaws like other languages. Python is more programmatic and it takes more time to code and then analyse. Basically as analyst I would want to spend more time on analytics than programming. ESP when I have to take a simple sample. To check on outliers. Using r and python is so dependent on our situation of the project.    Embed Quote
