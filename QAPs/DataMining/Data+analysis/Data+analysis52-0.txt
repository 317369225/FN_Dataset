Is the future of technology based in real-time data analysis?
Whom the Gods Would Destroy, They First Give Real-time Analytics But the 33-year-old programmer (who has long since beaten those demons into a bloody submission) sees the difficulty as irrelevant at best. Real-time analytics are undesirable. While there are many things wrong with our infrastructure, I would argue that the waiting is not one of those things. Engineers might find this assertion more puzzling than most. I am sympathetic to this mindset, and I can understand why engineers are predisposed to see instantaneous A/B statistics as self-evidently positive. We monitor everything about our site in real time. Real-time metrics and graphing are the key to deploying 40 times daily with relative impunity. Measure anything, measure everything! This line of thinking is a trap. It's important to divorce the concepts of operational metrics and product analytics. Confusing how we do things with how we decide which things to do is a fatal mistake.    Embed Quote
