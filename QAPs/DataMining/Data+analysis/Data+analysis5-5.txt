How do I learn data analysis for Python?
As I see it, there are 2 things you need to learn: 1- Data analysis techniques 2- Python programming. Depending on your interests, probably one or the other is more shiny a thing to study.  There are plenty of other answers here pointing you to promising looking books and MOOC's to get you started on each of those topics.  My best advice is to not fool yourself by spending too much time just reading about the topic.   Dive in and do some analysis.  Write some Python code and figure out what your bugs are.  No bugs?  That usually means you didn't subject the code to interesting enough test cases. One of the nice things about Python is that often you can get a lot done without having to write a large quantity of code.    Embed Quote
