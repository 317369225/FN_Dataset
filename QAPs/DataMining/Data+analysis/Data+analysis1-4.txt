Data Analysis: What is data analysis?
Data Analysis is the act of trying to learn something from a dataset. Data Analysis is not an end to itself, it is used in service of optimizing or improving other activities. E.g. running a business, sports-betting, gardening, scientific research, etc. The data can be dirty, so data analysis can include cleaning and quality checking. The data can be messy, so data analysis can include organizing and transforming data. The data can be insufficient, so data analysis can include enriching the data. The data can be difficult to store or access, so data analysis can include a broad set of technical skills. The best way to learn data analysis is like anything else -- by doing. Data is all around you, you just need to think about it. Start by looking at data for something you are interested in -- e.g. sports or gardening and become a better sports bettor or gardener through data analysis.    Embed Quote
