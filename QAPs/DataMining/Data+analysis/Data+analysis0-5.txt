★What is the future of data analysis?
I think that there are few trends on the horizon:   A move away from traditional BI tools like SAS.  To replace them will be home-grown languages that have some amount of functional programming.  This is because enterprise software development is moving in this direction as well with languages such as F#, Scala, and Clojure.  Data analysts will be able to use the same tools (i.e. same language, IDE, etc) as enterprise development teams and thereby better access data repositories.  This way enterprise developer skillsets can transfer more easily to the realm of data science especially since some of these languages integrate well with traditional,widely-used ones (F# with C# and Scala & Clojure with Java).  Functional programming constructs also allow for more concise code and a better metaphor for dealing with data transformations from one format to another. Dealing more with abstracting meaning from unstructured data.  There will be more tools and libraries (many open-source) that will help with this. Integrating aspects of machine learning to build more accurate and innovative predictive models. More companies will offer data analysis through cloud-computing platforms.  Cloud platforms will allow for more scale and will allow data analysis to be farmed out to various third parties depending on their data analysis specialty.  There will be more cloud-based APIs to access to do different types of data analysis on structured and unstructured data.    Embed Quote
