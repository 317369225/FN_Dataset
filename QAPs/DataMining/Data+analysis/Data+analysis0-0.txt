★What is the future of data analysis?
My guess, and this is just a guess of course, is that the big breakthroughs in data analysis will come neither from advances in statistical methods nor from ever-more-complex calculations on ever-larger data sets. I think that the biggest gains will come from tools that will allow analysts and others to browse, query, summarize, filter, aggregate, disaggregate, and view their data interactively. The static or minimally interactive tables and charts that are the endpoint of most analyses I see seem very primitive, given the technology we have at our disposal today. Much of the work I see in data visualization seems to me on the wrong path, focusing too much on making things look cool rather than on answering questions. I am with Andrew Gelman on this (see Infovis, infographics, and data visualization: Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go). But I still think this is the area with the greatest potential for changing the way real data analysis is done.    Embed Quote
