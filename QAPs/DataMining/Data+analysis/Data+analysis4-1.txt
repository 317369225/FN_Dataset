However can I recommend: Bime: http://bimeanalytics.com/ Bime is SaaS BI that lets the small guys unlock the value of big data! In a nutshell it combines powerful and cutting edge tools to give you speed of thought analysis with extremely low cost. Additionally Bime was built for the cloud and runs in the cloud therefore the user can access their data and utilise the software on their desktop or online, remotely from the cloud.
