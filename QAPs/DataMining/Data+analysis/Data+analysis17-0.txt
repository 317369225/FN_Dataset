What are the fields where big data analysis is used?
Almost any field has a need to use big data. First understand that many organizations HAVE big data. Think of how data streams from our daily life : phones, computers, credit cards, forms of transportation (cars, buses, planes). From finding a home, car, insurance, gym, or store, to where they eat for dinner. All these are ways people create data by interacting on the Internet or with an organization.  Even right now we are creating data that Quora can collect to discover who we are and what we are interested in--and  better understand their audience. Once you understand how every organization has data, now think of how that data accumulates and grows exponentially over time. There we have BIG data.  Now, why and who chooses to conduct "big data analysis"? To answer your questions as specifically as I can, I would say the fields where big data analysis is used the most are businesses. Businesses of any type have a real incentive to collect and analyze their data because it will lead to a more accurate analyses, which leads better decision making. Any company that really wants to make the correct decisions and cares about operational efficiency, cost reductions, and reduced risk, will have some type of business analysis software. Usually business buy a software that lets them collect the data and use the data to build dashboards and reports that visualize their data in gauges, pie charts, graphs, etc. As a business user myself, I know that they best software for analyzing big data is called SiSense.
