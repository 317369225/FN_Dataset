How do I learn data analysis with Python via projects?
I would start learning the Big Four (4) Python Tools: Numpy (Tentative NumPy Tutorial) - learning this makes it easier to learning scipy and gives you a handle on some basic primitives in Python you will be using later. Scipy (SciPy v0.14.0 Reference Guide) - this gives you access to some commonly used scientific routines and tools. A lot of it quite common for data analysis. Hadoop Streaming with Python (A Guide to Python Frameworks for Hadoop) - this is the most convential way of using Python in Hadoop Map Reduce. So if you want to use Hadoop Map Reduce then it is good to learn this. Ggplot2 for Python (ggplot2 Tutorial) - this is necessary to get a handle on the visualization side. There are many libraries to use but this is my current favorite.    Embed Quote
