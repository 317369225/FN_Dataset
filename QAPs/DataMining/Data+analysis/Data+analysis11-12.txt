What are the best consulting firms specializing in big data analysis?
Hello, as you have discussed above it depends on the project and the involvement you want from the consultant. I have personally worked with InnoQuant (http://innoquant.com), a big data analytics company. They are experts in mobile real-time big data analytics (MOCA) and they offer consulting services, data science, analytics services and training. My collaboration with them was on a project for a large company and the result has been excellent, since as a startup, they have worked with the latest technology and provided great solutions with a level of collaboration and involvement difficult to achieve with other large firms in the sector.    Embed Quote
