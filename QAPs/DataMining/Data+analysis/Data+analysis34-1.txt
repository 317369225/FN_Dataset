★Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?
Full disclosure: My favourite programming language is Python and my every day work programming language is R. I rarely code in Python nowadays. In my humble opinion there's no "better choice". Any opinion raising one on top of the other is biased by whatever practical reason. The reason for choosing one of the two is deeply connected with our objectives and mine are more effectively and efficiently address by R. If I could do it with Python, I would, but I can't. An objective answer to your question is "given my workflow, the best language for data analysis is R". The two reasons for that are: 1) iPython notebooks are not as good (in efficiency and effectiveness) for my workflow as RMarkdown is and 2) I get data from APIs and R has made a better job with those. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
