★What kind of collaboration tools would reduce duplication of R&D effort in data analysis and sharing?
Topic Maps (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top...) could play a key role in harvesting and merging information from the points of view of different research projects and quests. Such technology could unify fragmented pieces of information within given specific fields (which are actually quite huge - eg, bioinformatics), as well as provide serendipity through mapping and merging topics within a more universal knowledge garden that is attended by software agents closely coupled with humans. This could be further augmented by offering tasty pellets not just in the form of scientific kudos, but also through game-like engagement involving populations beyond just the formal scientific community.    Embed Quote
