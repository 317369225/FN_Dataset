Which are some of the best Data Analysis tools?
I'd add that something like Excel, Matlab, Python, SPSS or R is built for broad analysis purposes. They can probably do what you want and more, but they'll require lots of leg work. For programmers and engineers of various flavors, that's probably perfect. If you're looking to analyze business data, you may have lots of different, specific needs. As Sebastian pointed out, you want managers to be able to see and use the data, maybe even build their own reports. If that's the case, you're going to want to look at BI (Business Intelligence) and BA (Business Analytics.) Again, what you pick is going to depend on your needs and the solutions you already have in place. Do you want to do a deep dive into your data, and know everything about Mr. Smith, or do you want to know how your marketing promotion is performing? BI will acquire, clean, query data. BA will let you see where you are (often in real time) and where you are going. I've heard it explained this way: BI is like the black box on an airplane: you can open it up and see exactly what happened when. BA is more like your navigation system and gauges. They use the same information, but BI can get more granular and BA will visualize the data in context and help you make decisions. BI and BA are great complements to one another and will generally connect. For the record, I work for a BA company (Anametrix.) TL;DR, I agree with the others. Define your problem narrowly and it will help you solicit better feedback, and will be a great step in the right direction to help you pick a solution. If BA doesn't sound like what you're looking for, I ran across this link today [http://www.chiefmartec.com/2011/... that might help you pin down your needs a little better :) Best of luck!    Embed Quote
