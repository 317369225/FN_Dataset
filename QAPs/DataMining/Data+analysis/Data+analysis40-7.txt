What are some common fallacies or mistakes made by beginners in Statistics/Machine Learning/Data Analysis or they are prone to make?
My top 5, #1 being the alpha-omega, but the rest are not listed in any particular order other than how I thought of them. 1- ignoring Occam's Razor and thus entering the realm of "analysis paralysis" 2- over-complicating statistical models with extraneous/superfluous variables, parameters, or systems 3- misunderstanding that models don't determine causation, the engineering of the product being designed/analyzed accomplishes that 4- miscalculating minimum sample size and running a/b or multivariate tests with incorrect definitions for statistical significance as a result 5- presenting statistical findings to an audience. unless your audience is other statisticians or engineers, people want to understand scope, impact, and intervalling in plain English.    Embed Quote
