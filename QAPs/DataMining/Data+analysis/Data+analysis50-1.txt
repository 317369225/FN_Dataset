What is the best Python IDE for doing data analysis/science and ML on Macs?
Have you checked ipython? ipython is the best thing since sliced bread* (seriously) It is not an IDE per se. It is much more than just an IDE. here are some of the things you can do with ipython: 0. Run it just as a python interpreter 1. Store your results as an ipython notebook. this notebook can then be exchanged with other people, you can use markdown, text, latex, and every other thing in there! all in one place! 2. Access python documentation easily 3. it has "magics" which are wrappers around functionality we most often need. they are awesome! 4. And now, you can use R and Julia from within the ipython notebook! Yes. And this is not even scratching the surface. use ipython and never look back.    Embed Quote Updated 20 Dec. 1,549 views.
