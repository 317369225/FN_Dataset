Business Intelligence: What data analysis engine should I learn?
BIRT /  Pentaho (FOSS) SAP Crystal Reports ($$ - $$$$) Oracle OLAP / Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition ($$$$) (*Oracle products are free to download & evaluate) If you're pulling from a DB, all of these require some amount of SQL to get the data into your reports.  These can all combine data from multiple sources (flat files, web services, different databases/platforms, etc). For hardcore stat crunching, I second the recommendations for R, SPSS, and Matlab, though it's more of a challenge to integrate these into a server-based reporting frontend. Even good ol' MS Access can create some decent reports against any DB with an ODBC driver.    Embed Quote
