How do I learn data analysis with Python via projects?
I definitely recommend cs109.org. Harvard CS 109 This is the online resource for the Data Science class taught at Harvard. They have the video lectures, problem sets and solutions. The problem sets are mini projects that will give you great introductions to applying python to data analysis and using pandas. I worked through much of the 2013 projects and they were awesome. They are a great way to  learn the python stack in a project-oriented way. The video lectures and labs are good too. See also tons of resources at: How do I learn data analysis for Python?
