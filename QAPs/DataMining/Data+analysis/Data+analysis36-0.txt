At Social Cops - Bridging the Information Gap in Communities, We're hiring Data Scientists @ our Data Station (Data Visualisations - Social Cops) to hack some of the biggest problems in the world through Data. Our data station picks out data from open data sources, adds on a layer of social media data sources and tops it with real time data we collect through crowdsourcing from citizens. We then make this data digestible - map based visualizations, video infographics - we do whatever it takes! And we're kind of fun to work with ;) To hear it from the horse's mouth, why don't you read: Vikas Plakkot's answer to What is it like to work at Social Cops?
