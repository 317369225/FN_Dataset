Which are some of the best Data Analysis tools?
As a caveat I work for Wolfram Research. Mathematica has a number of interesting things it can do in Data Analysis: http://reference.wolfram.com/mat... Mathematica's statistics functionality really stands out in symbolic statistical computing which I don't really see much of elsewhere. The symbolic computing capability allows me to do things I would find almost impossible without a Phd in statistics. The tools for curve fitting and hypothesis testing are pretty easy to use and powerful as well.    Embed Quote Updated 15 Dec, 2011. 1,463 views.
