What are some common fallacies or mistakes made by beginners in Statistics/Machine Learning/Data Analysis or they are prone to make?
Assuming a variable is normally distributed when it isn't. Confusing prediction intervals and confidence intervals. They are not the same. Extrapolating beyond the range of your training data, particularly in the case of time series data. Not distinguishing between statistical significance and practical significance. This is a major issue with Big Data, and is related to ignoring effect size. With a large enough N, virtually everything is statistically significant in the frequentist sense. Failing to realize that the number of spurious correlations grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of a dataset. This leads to a number of mistakes: detecting false alarms in alert systems, adding unnecessary features to a model, making causal assumptions,  etc.  Another issue in the era of Big Data.    Embed Quote Updated 9 Aug, 2014. 1,175 views.
