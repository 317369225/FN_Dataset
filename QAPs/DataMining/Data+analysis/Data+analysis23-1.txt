★What kind of collaboration tools would reduce duplication of R&D effort in data analysis and sharing?
Some examples of building collaboration into tools for data management, from the research literature: "Voyagers and Voyeurs: Supporting Asynchronous Collaborative Information Visualization," by Jeffrey Heer, Fernanda Viégas, and Martin Wattenberg [1] "A Case for A Collaborative Query Management System," by Nodira Khoussainova, Magdalena Balazinska, Wolfgang Gatterbauer, YongChul Kwon, and Dan Suciu [2] Also, I think automated model selection is important to prevent duplication of effort. The state of model selection in machine learning today is not dissimilar to the state of access path selection in databases prior to the 1979 IBM System R paper [3]. Some automated model selection systems are available for limited search spaces (e.g. glmulti [4]), but there's a lot of work left to be done in this area. [1] http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/s...
