★What is the best out-of-sample accuracy test for a logistic regression and why?
I don't think any classification error metric is better than all the others, but I really like the AUC. I really prefer my error metrics to be interpretable. Simple accuracy is the easiest metric and is very interpretable, but becomes increasingly more useless the more unbalanced your classes are. It has a probabilistic interpretation without being sensitive to class imbalance. The AUC is always between 0 and 1. Given a random positive instance and a random negative instance, the AUC is the probability that you can identify who's who. Easy, right?
