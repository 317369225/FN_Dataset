★What would be the best way to implement logistic regression from scratch?I am trying to implement logistic regression from scratch in python but do not know how to start. What would be the good way to go about it. I do know the working of it. I want to know what would be the packages in python that I can use so it can replace Octave or matlab. Anything for a good start at implementing it would be helpful. Please note: I understand the logisitic regression algorithm
Start with simple SGD (stochastic gradient descent), it is just a few lines of code to implement the parameter update equation, you could pick a standard learning rate decay equation. If your code is longer than 20 lines, it is likely you did something wrong. After that, you can implement other different optimization methods to benchmark, like IRLS, BFGS, coordinate descent, LM, etc.  Liblinear implements a couple variations in C/C++, code is very concise and clear to understand. Finally, if you want good accuracy and also simplicity of implementation, you should look at AdaGrad (paper published last year or so), it is a simple modification of SGD, but very effective in both practice and theory.    Embed Quote
