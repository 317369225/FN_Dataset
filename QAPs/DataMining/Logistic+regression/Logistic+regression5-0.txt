★Why is the output of logistic regression interpreted as a probability?
It doesn't have to be. You can think of it as a procedure for fitting a smooth curve to 0 / 1 data, or as a black box for making predictions (if you convert the continuous scores back to 0 / 1 predictions). You don't need to think about probability models at all. But you can interpret the output as a probability by imagining that the data comes from a series of independent coin flips which come up 1 with probability , where is a linear combination of the input variables. Logistic regression finds the coefficients for the linear combination which maximize the probability of observing what you observed.    Embed Quote
