★In scikit-learn logistic regression, what are l1 and l2 values?- The documentation(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/m...) says penalty : string, ‘l1’ or ‘l2’ Used to specify the norm used in the penalization - What values they have? is l1 > l2?
Um, I'm not sure how to describe it any better than what the documentation already states.  L1 and L2 are not reals.  They are the type of norm used as the penalty on the solution vector in the cost function.  An L1 norm will help promote sparsity in the final solution (although, technically, sparsity is promoted through the pseudo-L0 norm, but that's NP-hard to optimize for many types of cost functions.)  The L2 norm will keep the coefficients small in general.  The reason why you might choose an L2 norm over an L1 norm despite not having clear sparsity properties is that it leaves the cost function smooth and convex.  The L1 norm isn't differentiable and therefore harder to optimize.  The reason why you want to use these at all is to add regularization to an ill-posed problem.    Embed Quote
