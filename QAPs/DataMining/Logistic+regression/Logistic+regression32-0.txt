★Why is Support vector Machine hard to code from scratch where Logistic Regression is not?In SVM, each of the feature gets modified by application of kernel function on it, the cost function remains the same as in logistic regression but with modified features. Whereas, logistic regression is SVM with linear(or no) kernel , still why it is said that SVM is hard to implement and an already implemented library like libsvm should be used.
You can do logistic regression with a simple gradient descent, but SVMs require quadratic programming, and those algorithms are tricky.    Embed Quote
