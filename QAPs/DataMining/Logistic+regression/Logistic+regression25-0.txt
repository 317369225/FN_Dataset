★What is the "intuitive" logic behind logistic regression?I have a clear visualisation of what is a linear regression, but It's more difficult for me to have the same understanding level of the logistic regression. Can you give me some "logic" explanations please ?
In linear regression, the dependent variable can, in theory, take any value. But sometimes we have a dependent variable that can only take two variables - this is binomial logistic regression.  We need to change the DV so that it can take on any value. So, we first take an odds ratio - this is just the ratio of the odds (like the name says).  E.g. if the DV is "Voted for Obama" and the IV is "Sex" we would find the odds of a man voting for Obama, and for a woman (and possibly the odds for other sexes) and then take the ratio of the odds.  But ratios can't be negative, so we take the log of the ratio.  This number can be any value.  We then do regular regression on the log of the odds ratio.    Embed Quote
