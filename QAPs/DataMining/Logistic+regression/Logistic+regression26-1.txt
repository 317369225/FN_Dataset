★What's the difference between logistic regression and matrix factorization?Just choose a different function to optimize?
If you are doing multi-class LR (with softmax link function), then they are somewhat equivalent, as Wenqiang Chen pointed out. I want to add that, there is a simple trick to convert a multi-class LR to a MF problem. Suppose each data point has outcome which takes one of the possible outcomes . Then according to the LR equation, . Taking the ratio . Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get . With multiple pairs , we can compute each , and then we get a linear system which can be easily framed as matrix factorization.    Embed Quote
