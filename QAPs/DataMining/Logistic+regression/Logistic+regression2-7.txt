★What are the advantages of logistic regression over decision trees?Are there any cases where it's better to use logistic regression instead of decision trees?
Kinda depends on the data set size. I found some unpredictable results and values for trees at smaller volumes of data over logistic regression. Also for larger amounts of data - performance time and compute will start to matter, trees take a looong time to complete.    Embed Quote
