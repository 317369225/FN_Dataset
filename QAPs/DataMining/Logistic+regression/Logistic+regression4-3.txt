★What is logistic regression in layman's terms?
In simple: it is one of a few ways you can regress models with a discrete, qualitative variable as the Y. Instead of Y being a continuous variable like income or crime rates, Y is now representing discrete outcomes, like "did this person graduate college?", "did this sports team win their division?", "was this person born with HIV?", "Did this movie win an oscar?". These are represented with 0(no) and 1(yes), but sometimes it can go as far as representing multiple outcomes, like "0= didnt make the playoffs; 1=made the playoffs; 2=won the championship.", or "1=The movie of the year was a Horror genre, 2= Movie of the year was a Drama, 3=movie of the year is an Action/Adventure genre, 4=MoY is a Comedy" and so on. It wont be inferred like a regular OLS where a unit increase in X will change Y by some amount of units. Intead it will be thought of in terms of probabilities/likelihood that the outcome will be 0 or 1, or 1,2,3,4,..n. So, it will be like, an increase in X will change the probabilities of Y happening by a certain amount of percentage points.    Embed Quote
