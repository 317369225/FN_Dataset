★Should input data to logistic regression be normalized?Is it helpful to give columns zero mean and unit variance?  Any caveats here?  Theoretical explanations of why or why not are welcome.
Simply put, yes, normalize, usually. If you're just using generic logistic regression, it won't matter, but if you're using any sort of regularization at all (as you should definitely be in a high-dimensional case), that regularization assumes normalized input. Sometimes, however, you'll make your operations a lot more expensive if you do (in the case of sparse data, for instance).    Embed Quote
