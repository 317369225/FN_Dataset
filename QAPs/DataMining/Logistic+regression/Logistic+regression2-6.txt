★What are the advantages of logistic regression over decision trees?Are there any cases where it's better to use logistic regression instead of decision trees?
Some of the distinctions made in the previous answers are rather artificial.  If one is worried that relationships are parallel to the axes, simply add squared and product terms, etc.; SVM does a pre-transformation of the data, and there is no reason not to do so in other models. A parametric model such as the logistic has a major advantage in that it gives you insight into the impact of each predictor variable on the response variable. None of the nonparametric methods really provide this.  CART is nice in that it is easy to implement and easy to explain to nontechnical people. I'd recommend being wary of general statements about predictive ability along the lines of "Method X works well in Setting A, while Method Y works well in Setting B."  As the saying goes, "Your mileage may vary."    Embed Quote
