★What's the advantage of a bayesian network over a simple logistic regression model?
Let us say you have the features and you are trying to predict a boolean variable Y. In this setting, you can think of logistic regression as similar to Naive Bayes. You can derive the equation of logistic regression by assuming that the features are independent over each other. So, you can write the join distribution as [math]P(X_1,X_2,...X_n|Y)=P(X_1|Y)P(X_2|Y)...P(X_n|Y)[/math] So, given a value of Y, are independent of each other. This is a very restrictive assumption and might not reflect the reality. In reality, there might be some dependence you are sure you know is happening() and some which you are sure are independent of each other( ). Therefore, you can use this knowledge to explicitly state theses dependencies. You can now write out all these dependencies in the joint distribution. Thus, Bayesian Network can model a much richer set of dependencies and is more expressive than logistic regression.    Embed Quote
