★What's the advantage of a bayesian network over a simple logistic regression model?
Logistic regression and Naive Bayes are somewhat similar (with an important difference that naive bayes assumes that inputs are independent so model's accuracy will be worse when this assumption is violated; see What is the difference between logistic regression and Naive Bayes? for details). Bayesian Networks can be better because you form a graph of nodes (so you can model the dependencies and causalities). But they require expert knowledge of the domain (knowing how to design the graph).    Embed Quote
