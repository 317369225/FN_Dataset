★Is logistic regression really a good choice for categorical variables?In case, the features are categorical, would the logistic regression be as good as it is for continuous variables as features?
The optimization algorithms do not have a problem with categorical feature variables.  If you ask yourself 'what is really being optimized and over what set of values?' then answer is really simple! We are trying to find maxima of likelihood function over a set of inputs. The key point is to realize that this set (domain of the function being optimized ) contains the values of co-efficients of the logistic function (and has little do with the nature of feature variables ).    Embed Quote
