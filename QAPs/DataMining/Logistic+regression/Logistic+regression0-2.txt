★What is the difference between logistic regression and Naive Bayes?
Naive Bayes is an Generative (sometimes called Informative) Classifier and Logistic Regression is a Discriminative Classifer. Generative (Informative) Classifiers model the densities of classes and select the class that most likely produce the features. In the Naive Bayes case this modeling involves counting. Discriminative Classifiers have a different approach - they try to model class boundary and membership directly, e.g. in a simple 2-feature dimension case this could mean trying to finding the line that best separates the classes (in >3 feature dimensions case it would be looking for the hyperplane that best separate classes). Examples of discriminative classifiers are support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression.    Embed Quote
