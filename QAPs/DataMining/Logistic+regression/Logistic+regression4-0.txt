★What is logistic regression in layman's terms?
Regression allows us to predict an output based on some inputs. For instance, we can predicts someone's height based on their mother's height and father's height. This type of regression is called linear regression because our outcome variable is a continuous real number. But what if we wanted to predict something that's not a continuous number? Let's say we want to predict if it will rain tomorrow. Using ordinary linear regression won't work in this case because it doesn't make sense to treat our outcome as a continuous number - it either will rain, or won't rain. In this case, we use logistic regression, because our outcome variable is one of several categories. Logistic regression works largely the same way linear regression works: it multiplies each input by a coefficient, sums them up, and adds a constant. In linear regression, the output is very straightforward. In the case of predicting heights, our output is simply someone's predicted height. In logistic regression, however, the output is actually the log of the odds ratio. In the example of predicting if it will rain tomorrow, the odds ratio is the odds that it will rain tomorrow divided by the odds that it won't rain. We then take the log of this ratio so that our output is a continuous real number, like with linear regression. This output doesn't make as much intuitive sense, but for some output y, we can apply the following transformation: (exp(y)/(1+exp(y)) To get the probability of the event occurring (we're just reversing the log and the odds ratio here).    Embed Quote
