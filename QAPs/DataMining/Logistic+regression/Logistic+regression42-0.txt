★In scikit-learn logistic regression, what are l1 and l2 values?- The documentation(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/m...) says penalty : string, ‘l1’ or ‘l2’ Used to specify the norm used in the penalization - What values they have? is l1 > l2?
You can also apply a linear combination of both at the same time by using sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier with loss='log' and penalty='elasticnet'. That way you will promote sparsity in the model while not sacrificing too much of the predictive accuracy of the model. BTW: your question was probably: which value should I use for the penalty parameter?: if you don't have a mathematical understanding of the regularized linear models and what a sparse model is then just use the default value (which is l2 in this case). If you have more time, perform a grid search on this parameter as well:   http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modu... But in this case you should first invest time on tuning C for LogisticRegression or alpha for SGDClassifier (the regularization strength) with grid search before trying to change the type of regularization. If you really want to try all penatly schemes you should do a grid search on both alpha and penalty at the same time as the best alpha for one type of penalty is not necessarily the best for the others.    Embed Quote
