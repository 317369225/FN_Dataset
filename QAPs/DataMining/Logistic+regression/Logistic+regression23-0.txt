★What is a conditional logistic regression?
In a Multinomial Logistic Regression, you are essentially building a "Choice Model" i.e. you can think of it as a set of people choosing between a number of alternatives. In the standard form, you model the attributes of the people or the choice makers. In the conditional form, you model the attributes of the alternatives. For example, consider the textbook case of transportation choice in a city. The alternatives are: Car, Bus and Rail. The attributes are Age, Gender, Type of Occupation, Income, etc. of the people making the choice - in the standard form. The coefficients represent the importance of the personal attributes in making the choice. In the conditional form, the attributes are Travel Time, Comfort, Flexibility, etc. of the alternatives themselves. The coefficients are the importance of the attributes of the alternatives to the people making the choice. The advantage of the conditional form is that data in terms of attributes of the alternatives is often more easily available than the attributes of the choice makers - personal information remains one of the more difficult types of data to gather. It is possible to segment the population into groups and model a set of coefficients on each group of people to improve the accuracy of a conditional form model.    Embed Quote
