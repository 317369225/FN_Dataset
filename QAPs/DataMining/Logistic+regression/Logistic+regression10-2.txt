★Why is logistic regression so important for machine learning?
Great answers above, but also: it was a multiply discovered touchstone for several similar disciplines (physics, neuroscience, statistics, etc)...the same algorithm can be fruitfully understood from the perspectives of Maximum Entropy Modeling (the Ising model), Neural Network Modeling (the neuron with softmax function), and Log-Linear Modeling (logit link function in linear regression). And it returns a probability of a class given a vector of arbitrary (and not necessarily independent) feature functions, which enables a range of modeling techniques for Natural Language Processing, for example.    Embed Quote
