★How do I deal with missing data when running a logistic regression?Let's say that of my 7 features, 2 are missing data about 10% of the time.  What's the best way to handle this? Suggestions on other machine learning techniques that are better with missing data than regression are also helpful.
You can interpolate the missing data values if they're only 10% of the set, but as another poster wrote, you should indicate that these are interpolated with a dummy variable. I wouldn't insert column averages into the missing datapoints -- if the distribution of the feature is skewed you'll run into problems. If you're using Python, you can interpolate NaN values in a numpy array pretty easily: NumPy v1.6 Manual (DRAFT)    Embed Quote
