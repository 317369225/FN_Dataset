★How do I deal with missing data when running a logistic regression?Let's say that of my 7 features, 2 are missing data about 10% of the time.  What's the best way to handle this? Suggestions on other machine learning techniques that are better with missing data than regression are also helpful.
It's important that you first establish if your data are missing at random, completely at random, or not at random. If the data are missing not at random, you might have a serious problem with your research. If your data are missing completely at random, you could consider listwise deletion: just remove the cases with missing values from your analysis. (It might be important not to delete them altogether, but just exclude them from further research). If your data are missing at random, multiple imputation is the method to go for.
