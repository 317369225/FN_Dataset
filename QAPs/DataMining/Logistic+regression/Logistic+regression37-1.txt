★What is the best out-of-sample accuracy test for a logistic regression and why?
As William Chen says, it's difficult to give you a 'best' one without knowing anything about your data. The advice to pick one you understand is a good one. If your dataset is unbalanced (you don't have equal numbers of each class), then besides the AUC suggestion you can also take a look at the F-score (F1 score), which is also very commonly-used. Finally, if you are dealing with multiclass classification, one standard thing you could do is calculate the F-score per class and then average the results. If you are again dealing with an unbalanced dataset, you have two options for averaging: macro-averaging and micro-averaging. Micro-averaged F will give you a sense of how well you do on the large classes, while the macro-average will give you a sense for the small classes. See chapter 13 of Introduction to Information Retrieval for details. In summary, as mentioned by William Chen, pick a metric you understand that also makes sense for the task and data you have.    Embed Quote
