★How can I use categorical variables in logistic regression?
The expectation of LR is to have normalized feature vector into unit ball [0-1] therefore a simple solution to giving integer id to each categorical value would not work out. Another working method would be using binary indicators for each value below a new dimensions. That is, suppose you have a category of asset status like rich,poor, moderate. Then add three more dimensions to your data columns for each value and set one hot coding on those new dimensions so set the matching dimension to 1 and keep the others 0.    Embed Quote
