★What is an intuitive explanation of logistic regression coefficients?Can I interpret the coefficients as giving a 'magnitude of importance' to the corresponding predictors?
I am going to assume you know what a regression is. Logistic regression is a regression using the logistic function as the data model.  The logistic function is a sigmoid function commonly defined as: I will explain everything in a single picture and then elaborate.  Here's the picture: To interpret what and means, we can hold the other parameter constant for simplicity.  Let's make , then we have that: From this, we see that changing is roughly equivalent to sliding the function along the x axis. Likewise, we can hold to get: where .  From this, we see that controls the slope.  In particular, as gets larger, the slope of the denominator gets smaller, so the slope of the function gets larger.  This would be the "magnitude of importance" (much like the slope in a linear regression). Also note that the version that has the log function is simply the inverse of this function.    Embed Quote
