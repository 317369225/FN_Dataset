★Why is Support vector Machine hard to code from scratch where Logistic Regression is not?In SVM, each of the feature gets modified by application of kernel function on it, the cost function remains the same as in logistic regression but with modified features. Whereas, logistic regression is SVM with linear(or no) kernel , still why it is said that SVM is hard to implement and an already implemented library like libsvm should be used.
Because calculus is natural to us from school but quadratic programs are not. Because derivation of SVM is more involved in dual form. BTW read the paper Page on uchicago.edu PEGASOS(Ignore the bounds for now). This is no different than logistic regression in looks and idea. Its just sub gradient decent. This is used in practice too. (Tutorials > Support Vector Machines (SVMs))    Embed Quote
