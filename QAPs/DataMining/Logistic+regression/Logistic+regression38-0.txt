★What is simplest way to implement an ordinal logistic regression in Python?
I have come across Logistic Ordinal Regression for python based implementation. However its not giving the same results as I expect. I'm still looking for a solution on this, more specifically I'm looking for an implementation that would provide the same results as Stata. i.e.. If Y has three classes 1,2,3 and for latent variable Y* we required only two cutoffs: cut1, cut2 such that: If Y*<cut1 then Y=1 if cut1<Y*<cut2 then Y=2 else Y*>cut2 then Y=3. In the above code, three cuts are being generated for my case and I'm not interested in the same. Could someone please refer me to right place or help me implement?    Embed Quote
