★In scikit-learn logistic regression, what are l1 and l2 values?- The documentation(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/m...) says penalty : string, ‘l1’ or ‘l2’ Used to specify the norm used in the penalization - What values they have? is l1 > l2?
L^p refers to the way errors are measured: the objective function that the regression procedure is going to attempt to minimize. Typical linear regression (L^2) minimizes the sum of squared errors, so being off by +4 is 16 times worse than being off by +1. Ordinary linear regression (L^2) is used to minimize total squared error, while "robust" (L^1) regression minimizes the total absolute value of error. For many business cases, the loss caused by model error is more accurately represented by an L^1 objective function than L^2. The reason for the preference of L^2 is largely historical: it has an nicer analytic solution because y = x^2 has a useful derivative, whereas y = |x| has a constant derivative (+1) over the regions where it is defined and no derivative at 0. That's a historical artifact from the pre-computational era: with modern resources, there's no reason you can't do an L^1 regression, although it is more computationally intensive. Another advantage of L^1 regression is that it handles outliers better.    Embed Quote
