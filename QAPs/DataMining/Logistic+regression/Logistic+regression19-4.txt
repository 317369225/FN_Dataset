★How do I deal with missing data when running a logistic regression?Let's say that of my 7 features, 2 are missing data about 10% of the time.  What's the best way to handle this? Suggestions on other machine learning techniques that are better with missing data than regression are also helpful.
If missing values are not treated, statistical software like SAS will automatically delete the rows from the dataset. You can exclude such records if:-   1. Missing values are < 10% 2.You have a large enough dataset (satisfying normality) 3.The response rate is enough (deletion of some rows will not affect the response rate much) 4. Data is missing at random from the dataset.   There are various methods to impute missing values:-   A.) Based on business sense:-   1. Replace continuous variables like age, income with column mean/median 2. Replace date variables with highest/lowest/mode 3. Replace ordinal variables with min/max levels   B.) Use other techniques like nearest-neighbour imputation    Embed Quote
