★Why is Support vector Machine hard to code from scratch where Logistic Regression is not?In SVM, each of the feature gets modified by application of kernel function on it, the cost function remains the same as in logistic regression but with modified features. Whereas, logistic regression is SVM with linear(or no) kernel , still why it is said that SVM is hard to implement and an already implemented library like libsvm should be used.
The matrix algebra can get a bit tricky, and like the others said, you need to do some quadratic programming (I used CXVOPT for Python). Nevertheless, it shouldn't take too long to get a linear SVM up and running.    Embed Quote
