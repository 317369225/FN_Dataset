★Support Vector Machines: What is the difference between Linear SVMs and Logistic Regression?
Both are classification methods with linear decision boundaries, but they're motivated completely differently. The basic idea of logistic regression is to adapt linear regression so that it estimates the probability a new entry falls in a class. The linear decision boundary is simply a consequence of the structure of the regression function and the use of a threshold in the function to classify. The decision boundary is much more important for Linear SVM's - the whole goal is to place a linear boundary in a smart way. There isn't a probabilistic interpretation of individual classifications, at least not in the original formulation. Like with any linear regression, every training point has a certain influence on the estimated logistic regression function.  SVM's are actually formulated so that only points near the decision boundary really make a difference. Points that are "obvious" have no effect on the decision boundary. This can be very different from logistic regression, as "obvious" points can sometimes be very influential.    Embed Quote
