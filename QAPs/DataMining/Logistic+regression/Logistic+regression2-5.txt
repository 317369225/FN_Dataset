★What are the advantages of logistic regression over decision trees?Are there any cases where it's better to use logistic regression instead of decision trees?
If we want modify logistic reg to get better accuracy, than  we come to SVM or neural network.  If we want modify decision tree to get better accuracy, than  we come to Random Forest or BART. In both cases we win in accuracy (MSE, AUC, etc) but lost explainability / simplicity.    Embed Quote
