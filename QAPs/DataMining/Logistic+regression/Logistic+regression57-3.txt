★In what circumstances or properties of the data will decision trees perform worse than logistic regression?
In decision trees, I can make the decision on a node with the combination of multiple attributes instead of a single attributes Ex: instead of X1 < 2, i'll use X1+X2 < 2 Now, I can rule out the assumption of axis-parallel boundaries and any anti-axis parallel boundary can be generated And once the model is built, testing of a new point in logistic regression is faster than decision trees. Complexity of finding class for new test point, in decision trees: O(log n)[proportional to height of tree] Complexity of finding class for new test point, in logistic regression: O(1)[just multiply the parameters with data point features]    Embed Quote
