★Is logistic regression really a good choice for categorical variables?In case, the features are categorical, would the logistic regression be as good as it is for continuous variables as features?
Effectiveness really depends on the data and problem domain. Logistic regression in R will convert a categorical variable having k levels into (k-1) binary 0/1 variables and do its stuff. If you want better predictive performance, you could try L1 regularization (not sure how effective it is when all inputs are categorical). You could also try decision trees and random forests. Since it is a binary classifcation problems, there should not be (in theory) problems with categorical features. I believe the randomForest library in R places limitations on the number of levels in categorical variables.
