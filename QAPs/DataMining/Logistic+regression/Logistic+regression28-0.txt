★What are the suggestions for validation for logistic regression?
There is no auto-validation process for any model but maybe you mean automatic cross-validation. I'm not sure. You have a very large number of variables for that many cases and likely have pretty serious collinearity problems as well as potential perfect prediction. You're also looking at individual coefficients, which in a predictive model is rarely a good idea anyway but here is particularly problematic. If you really need to consider that many predictors I would suggest switching to some kind of regularized model such as L2 or L1-penalized logistic regression, or a regression tree.    Embed Quote
