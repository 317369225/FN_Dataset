★What exactly is a logistic regression algorithm in machine learning. What are its applications?Want to know what is logistic regression and what are its applications.
To add to Daniel's answer, Logistic Regression is used to predict categorical variables. Binary(yes/no) where the variable has one of 2 possible categories, or Multinomial where there can be more than 2 categories. Say you have patient data - age, gender, result of blood tests, size of some tumor. You want to predict whether the tumor is cancerous or not. Or you have the scores of students in various subjects and tests, along with their age and other statistics and you want to see if the student would be admitted to a particular university or not. This is an application of binary regression. In the latter example, if you try to regress and find the major the student is most likely to take, that would be multinomial regression.    Embed Quote
