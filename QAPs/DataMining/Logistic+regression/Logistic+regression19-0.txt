★How do I deal with missing data when running a logistic regression?Let's say that of my 7 features, 2 are missing data about 10% of the time.  What's the best way to handle this? Suggestions on other machine learning techniques that are better with missing data than regression are also helpful.
Some options: Replace missing values with column averages (i.e. replace missing values in feature 1 with the average for feature 1). Replace missing values with column medians. Impute missing values using the other features. Remove records that are missing features. Use a machine learning technique that uses classification trees, e.g. random forests, boosted trees, bagged trees, etc.    Embed Quote
