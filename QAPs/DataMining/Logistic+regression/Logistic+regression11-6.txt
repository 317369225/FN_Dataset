★What would be the best way to implement logistic regression from scratch?I am trying to implement logistic regression from scratch in python but do not know how to start. What would be the good way to go about it. I do know the working of it. I want to know what would be the packages in python that I can use so it can replace Octave or matlab. Anything for a good start at implementing it would be helpful. Please note: I understand the logisitic regression algorithm
major issue of logistic regression is learning the weights from training data, once you have the weights, finding the most probable output is straightforward (max operation). for learning the weights, you can use stochastic gradient descent. look through pages 4-8 of the following : http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~elkan/25...    Embed Quote
