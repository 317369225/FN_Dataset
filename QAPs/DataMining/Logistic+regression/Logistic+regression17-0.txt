★How can I use categorical variables in logistic regression?
A categorical variable of K categories is usually entered in a regression analysis as a sequence of K-1 variables(contrast), e.g. as a sequence of K-1 dummy variables. Subsequently, the regression coefficients of these K -1 variables correspond to a set of linear hypotheses on the cell means. When coding categorical variables, there are a variety of coding systems we can choose for testing different set of linear hypotheses.e.g. : After  reading in the data frame over the repository and  creating a factor variable in x.f (1) using R,you can create the coding schemes using a little bit of manipulation. in a matrix with the contrast values for each level of the factor. e.g. > X <- factor(c('A','B','C')) > contr.treatment(X)    B C A 0 0 B 1 0 C 0 1 #assigning the treatment contrasts to race.f (here comparing each level of the categorical variable to a fixed reference level  --dummy coding) contrasts(hsb2$x.f) = contr.treatment(4)   #the regression summary(lm(write ~ x.f, hsb2)) # will give you Residuals(min,med,max), coefficients ,error etc. (1)x can be any categorical property e.g. race,    Embed Quote
