★What's the relationship between linear and logistic regression?What are the similarities and differences?
Logistic Regression is used when response variable is categorical in nature. For instance, Yes/No, True/False, Red/Green/Blue, 1st/2nd/3rd/4th etc.   Linear Regression is used when your response variable is continuous. For instance Weight, Height, Number of hours etc.   Linear Regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = mX + C, means equation with degree 1.   However, Logistic Regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = e^X/1 + e^-X   Linear Regression uses Ordinary Least Squares method to minimise the errors and arrive at a best possible fit while Logistic regression uses maximum likelihood method to arrive at the solution.    Embed Quote
