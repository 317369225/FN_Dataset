★Machine Learning: What is the difference between linear SVMs and regularized logistic regression?
L_2 regularized logistic regression and L_2 regularized linear SVM are very similar. The hinge loss function used in linear SVMs is quite similar to the loss function used in logistic regression. It is easiest to see this when you consider the primal formulation of the linear SVM. I can't comment much on probabilistic interpretations of these methods as it's better to think of them as hyper plane separators (aka decision boundaries) and not something obtained from a generative model. Regarding performance, people think linear SVMs are much better than logistic regression and in my experience they are only slightly better. Linear SVMs are less sensitive to correctly and confidently classified training examples since they incur a loss of 0. Each example has a non-zero influence on the decision boundary of a logistic regression problem.    Embed Quote
