★What is the best way for one to learn logistic regression?I have already learned: Simple Regression Multiple Regression
This book is a good read - Logistic Regression by Klein & Kleinbaum. Lecture Notes | Data Mining | MIT OpenCourseWare - This has good examples on Logistic Regression. Definitely Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course is a great start.    Embed Quote
