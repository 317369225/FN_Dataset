★What's the difference between logistic regression and matrix factorization?Just choose a different function to optimize?
logistic regression is used to forecast the outcome of a variable that is in form of categories -- binary logistic regression would have the category value 0 or 1 and multple logistic regression would have categories that is more than just 0 or 1. eg, 1,2,3,4,etc... Matrix factorization is basically decomposing a matrix into product of matices. various factorization methods are available with multiple applications. LU Decomposition will divide the matrix into lower triangular and upper triangular, etc..    Embed Quote
