★Why is logistic regression used so often in data science?
It is used when scientists are studying binary outcomes. I guess that data scientists often study questions where there are only two outcomes. I think that these are the simplest form of outcome there is. If there are more than two categories, or if the outcome can be measured on a continuous scale, then you have to think a bit harder about what the results of your analysis means.  Human beings are prejudiced towards  thinking about things in either/or terms. Either this or that. Yes or no. As we get more sophisticated, we start thinking about other options and gradations between yes and no. But the simplest form of analysis is to limit the options studied to two. Of course, logistic regression isn't the easiest tool to learn.    Embed Quote
