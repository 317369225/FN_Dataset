★How to apply cross-validation to logistic regression?
As far as I know, If you change your training and testing set before every run, so that different sub sets of the data in hand becomes training set and testing set for every run, all the while maintaining the 80-20 ratio, then this is called the 5- fold cross validation. 4-parts of the data - goes for training 1-part of the data - goes for testing Remember, This again is a part of the whole data that you have. The accuracy reported from this is the Cross validation accuracy. You use the model that gave the best performance in CV on the actual test data. For example, Assume you have 120 samples. Take the first 100 samples as the training and cross validation set while the last 20 will be the testing set. For the first run, first 80 samples would go for training and the last 20 for testing Second run, 21-100 goes for training while 1-20 goes for testing third run 1-20 ans 41-100 goes for training while 21-40 goes for testing Fourth run 1-40 and 61-100 for training while the rest for testing Last run, 1-60 and 81-100 for training while the rest for testing. Calculate the accuracy for all the five runs and report the average accuracy. Points to ensure: 1. Ratio of number of training and testing samples should be the same for all the runs. 2. Training and testing set for the next run should be different from what we had in the previous run. 3. Also, no sample from the training set should go to the testing set 4. The training and testing sets can contain random samples i.e. instead of 1-80 continuously for training, we can consider random 8 samples from every 10 samples, but the first 3 points must be ensured while doing it.    Embed Quote
