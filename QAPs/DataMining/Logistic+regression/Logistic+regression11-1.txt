★What would be the best way to implement logistic regression from scratch?I am trying to implement logistic regression from scratch in python but do not know how to start. What would be the good way to go about it. I do know the working of it. I want to know what would be the packages in python that I can use so it can replace Octave or matlab. Anything for a good start at implementing it would be helpful. Please note: I understand the logisitic regression algorithm
This would depend on whether you wish to do binary or multinomial (aka, McFadden's conditional) logit. But neither one is difficult. You could write the log-likelihood function -- which takes a simple form for logit -- and compute its gradient and Hessian, which are both remarkably simple, and require almost no calculation on top of the logit probabilities themselves. Once you have these, Newton-Raphson is a simple linear update based on where you are now and both the gradient and inverse-Hessian. This nearly always gets you there in a few passes, as the logit log-likelihood is typically unimodal and close to a quadratic form. Any econometrics textbook can provide the basic formulas. I coded this 25 years ago in a pre-release of MATLAB, and it was fast and simple even then.    Embed Quote
