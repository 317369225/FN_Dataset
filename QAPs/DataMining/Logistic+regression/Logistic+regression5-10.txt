★Why is the output of logistic regression interpreted as a probability?
To put it in a simple way. The logistic regression is used to predict yes or No or (0,1) the out come of an event. so if we use the equation Y=mX+C where Y has the value of (0,1) so whatever value you put in X your result will be in (0,1) so this equation will not produce any result for any given value of X. The graph of the above equation would be sigmoid or  "S" shape the values will be clustered at (0,1). So to predict your result in better way we do log transformation i.e., the Logit of  Y so that the values of Y would in the range of (-infinity, + infinity) and we can get the graph in a linear model.    Embed Quote
