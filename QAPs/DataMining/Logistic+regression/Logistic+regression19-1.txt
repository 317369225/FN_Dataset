★How do I deal with missing data when running a logistic regression?Let's say that of my 7 features, 2 are missing data about 10% of the time.  What's the best way to handle this? Suggestions on other machine learning techniques that are better with missing data than regression are also helpful.
The approach I'd take depends on the amount of data I have: lot of data (>100000 datapoints): it's safer to ignore if it's really only 10%, than to do anything else. Or use random forests or something instead of logistic regression. moderate data (1000s of datapoints): There are several simple methods for missing data imputation, and they'll work reasonably given only a small portion of your data is affected. One of the simplest is nearest neighbour imputation, which has implementations in many languages, this will work quickly for moderately sized datasets. Also you can fit a factor analysis model to the complete subset of data, and then use it to impute missing values, or use any other matrix factorisation based imputation to deal with it. A related approach would be learning independent regressors for the variables that are missing based on the ones you always have. It is probably less likely that you'll find a good and simple implementation of this approach. small data: For small datasets where it's going to be hard to learn anyting from, I'd consider either choosing a more advanced method that deals with the problem of missing data, or to actually build a model based on some sort of domain knowledge or assumptions.    Embed Quote
