★How can I improve the precision/recall of a Logistic Regression model?
You should: - check that you data is clean: remove any row / sample with a NaN features, center features and scale them to unit variances - perform a grid search for all the parameters of the model: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modu... If it's still not as good as your would like: try more complex, non linear models such as SVM with kernels or random forest models such as the ExtraTreesClassifier of scikit-learn. Here again grid search for the optimal parameters is very important but will be more costly: there are more of them with non linear models.    Embed Quote
