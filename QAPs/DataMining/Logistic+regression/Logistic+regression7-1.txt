★Why is logistic regression used so often in data science?
It is extremely well understood.  Not only how to interpret its results, but also how to compute results accurately. It can also easily be used both for parameter estimation problems (scientific problems where you don't care about train/test) and for prediction problems where L2/L1 regularization can be used and has some really useful interpretations. And it also has a very easy to digest generalization to multinomial regression, unlike some other famous classifiers.  It can be kernelized and does fairly well in my experience, both from a theoretical and practical point of view.    Embed Quote
