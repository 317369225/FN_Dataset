★What is logistic regression?
Unlike regression which is used for predicting continuous variable. Logistic regression is fitted on the data whose response variable is Dichotomous/Binary i.e. 0 or 1. If the result is not exactly 0 or 1, say its 0.76 then we say that there is 76% chance of the response variable being happening. Now, how do you know how appropriate your model is? Find Sensitivity and specificity of model, plot the curve, see how much area it coveres the more area it covers, the more appropriate your model will be. Simple Application:  Suppose that we are interested in the factors that influence whether a political candidate wins an election.  The outcome (response) variable is binary (0/1);  win or lose.  The predictor variables of interest are the amount of money spent on the campaign, the amount of time spent campaigning negatively and whether or not the candidate is an incumbent.    Embed Quote
