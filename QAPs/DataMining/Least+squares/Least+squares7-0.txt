★What is an intuitive explanation of the least squares method?
In my opinion: Maybe it is similar to design/plan a subway route so that its stations are overall/generally close to every/most important sites in a city? In general, you want the stations to be close to all the important sites, but you can't have the route to be designed so that it stops at every important site (not realistic) since that would cost a lot and the line will be tortuous (statistically known as overfitting). So what the planners want to do is: plan a non-tortuous route that are generally close to every important sites with a smallest total distance between the cite and the closest station.    Embed Quote
