★What is good way to understand this solution for least square estimation?I just cannot understand how the b1 get calculated?
I wouldn't say that there is a simple way of understanding it before deriving it.  The derivation is found by reusing the definitions multiple times. next use the solution for b0 isolating b1 on the right side and everything else to the left side you get You can see that if you solve for b1 now, you're pretty close to getting the answer they have, but they manipulate a few more things. The left hand side can be manipulated  using the definition of ybar to The coefficient of the b1 term on the right hand side is a bit more tricky and is easiest to show using the final solution and working backwards.  It is equal to Using these last two manipulation and solving for b1 gives which is their expression    Embed Quote
