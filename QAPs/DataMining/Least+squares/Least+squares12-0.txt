★When should I choose Partial Least Squares versus Principal Components Regression?PLS and PCR are two different ways to deal with problems like multicollinearity in data. But when should I choose PLS, and when should I choose PCR?
Principled Answer: You should use whichever one has assumptions that are closer to true in your data. (The assumptions underlying the models can be found at [1] and [2].) Real Answer: Just try both and use the one that works better! Both are available off-the-shelf in any widely-used programming language, so it should be no trouble to pop your data into both and see what happens. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par...
