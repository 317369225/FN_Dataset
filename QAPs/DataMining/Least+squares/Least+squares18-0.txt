★What does Gauss' least square method do that improves the accuracy of a model?
The gauss markov theorem doesn't really "do" anything to improve the accuracy of the model, it is just a criteria for qualifying an estimator as BLUE (best linear unbiased estimator). Recall that an estimator is a random variable, which could be a sample average or Y-hat. It just states that IF these conditions hold: 1) Expected (conditional) value of the residuals are zero 2) Finite 4th moments (e.g. outliers) 3) Errors are uncorrelated AND if the error term is homoskedastic ... then the estimator is BLUE. So what the theorem does is it adds in homoskedasticity as an additional requirement on top of the least squares assumptions. But error terms are often not homoskedastic (especially in economic applications). If the term is heteroskedastic, then the Gauss markov conditions fails and we have to use other more efficient estimators (GLS, LAD, NLS). So it only improves the accuracy of the model if the error term is homoskedastic, which is rarely the case. Otherwise not.    Embed Quote
