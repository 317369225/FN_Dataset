★What are ordinary least squares, and how are they used in regression analyses?
Idea behind regression analysis is to find a curve through a random set of data point on which sum of square of normal distance (90 degrees to tangent) is measured from the set of data points is minimum compared to any other curve. Question is why take a square, well distances could be  positive or negative, and we do not a outliners to negate measure taken from other data points and the curve so determined closer to themselves. As such square of distances is taken to avoid unnecessary algebra magic to set in.    Embed Quote
