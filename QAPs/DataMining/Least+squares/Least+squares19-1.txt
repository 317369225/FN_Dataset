★What is good way to understand hypothesis testing for this beta 1 in least squares regression?I just cannot understand when we do hypothesis testing on beta 1 in the slide, why it assume beta 1 has normal distribution for variance is like this?(the mean is typo in the slide)
It is known that if you sum sufficient (more or less independent) variables, that  that sum follows a normal distribution (asymptotically). Probably, this is an exercise on that?    Embed Quote
