★What are some really cool problems that involve "least squares and Eigenvalue problems"?
For machine learning algorithms using eigenvalues, look for the word "spectral". Spectral clustering is one such methodology, and if you want something advanced you can consider spectral methods for latent variable models (see the research of e.g. Sham Kakade). Principal Component Analysis is also at its core an eigenvector-based approach,  and it's quite easy to get started with while being very application-rich. You can also take a look at Google's original PageRank which takes its offset in the idea of "eigenvalue centrality" in spectral graph theory. Least-squares can be used to solve regression problems out of the box, but if you want to extend that you can look at regularised versions (Lasso and ridge regression) or maybe feature selection?    Embed Quote
