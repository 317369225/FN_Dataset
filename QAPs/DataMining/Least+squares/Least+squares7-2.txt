★What is an intuitive explanation of the least squares method?
When fitting a curve to data points, the points will lie on both sides of the curve in roughly equal proportion, i.e., positive and negative deviations. Simply adding the deviations won't work because the sum will be close to zero. You could take absolute values, but mathematically it's easier to square the deviations to yield results that are always positive, which may now be subject to minimization of their sum. Squaring has has the additional advantage of giving relatively more weight to larger deviations.    Embed Quote
