★Do bounded variable least squares have a closed form solution?To my knowledge Least Squares and regularized LS have closed form solutions. Which of the other common LS problems have closed form solutions, if any? I am aware that most of LS problems are convex and have an optimal solution given equality and inequality types of constraints, but that is not my question. If there are some closed form solutions, please provide a source. TY.
Very few other problems have closed form solutions except in certain special cases. For instance, the logistic regression parameters for a table can be solved analytically, and there are some other special cases, but almost no general logistic regression or loglinear models can be solved explicitly. Iteratively reweighted least squares in these problems uses a sequence of weighted least squares problems that converge to the maximum likelihood solution.    Embed Quote
