★What is the covariance matrix of a linear least square solution?Let be a standard overdetermined system where is found through a linear least squares method.  If the covariance matrix is known, how does one calculate the covariance matrix of the best-fit solution ?  Assume that the means of the elements of and are non-zero.  A general solution is appreciated, but one can assume each element of is a Gaussian if necessary.
I hope this is not for a homework question :) The answer is: . Derivation: Let , and let the orthogonal projection matrix be . Recall that the least square solution is given by . Then . Note that I used the facts: , . Now the real question is: when is this going to come up in real life?    Embed Quote
