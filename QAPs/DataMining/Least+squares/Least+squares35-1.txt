★Do bounded variable least squares have a closed form solution?To my knowledge Least Squares and regularized LS have closed form solutions. Which of the other common LS problems have closed form solutions, if any? I am aware that most of LS problems are convex and have an optimal solution given equality and inequality types of constraints, but that is not my question. If there are some closed form solutions, please provide a source. TY.
Stochastic Least Squares, which includes prior knowledge (up the second moment) has closed form, but it just a regular LS with an extra row with the confident ellipsoid descriptor (which is not that different to reg. LS).    Embed Quote
