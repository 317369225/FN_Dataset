★How can I add restrictions to a least squares problem?I know where A^tAx = A^tb linear system for least squares come from. I can derive it. But if i want to add restrictions such as force the solution to pass through one of the points necessarily or limit it to a region or even give weights to the points, how can I express that mathematically? Can any one provide simple examples based on the classic linear system for LS?
As long as all of your constraints are linear, you can express your problem as minimizing subject to for appropriate values of , and .  That's a simple convex optimization problem, and most solvers will handle it just fine. Things get a little bit more complicated if you want to do hypothesis testing or confidence intervals, but there's no real trick to getting point estimates.    Embed Quote
