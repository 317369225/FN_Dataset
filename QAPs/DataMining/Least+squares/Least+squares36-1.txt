★What are the benefits of using estimators derived from L1 (as opposed to least squares) error minimization?
A different perspective: L1 is suitable when the true signal or data is sparse (in some possibly overcomplete basis) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high L2 is suitable when the true signal or data is not-sparse in the chosen basis, and/or is bandwidth limited I also have a blog post: https://charlesmartin14.wordpres...    Embed Quote
