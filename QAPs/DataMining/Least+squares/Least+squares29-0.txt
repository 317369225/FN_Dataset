★How can I create the least squares regression (Minimum mean square error) line in R?
Yes, and it is quite simple. Let us generate some data for our use: 1
2
 > x<-1:20 > y<-10*x+rnorm(10,mean<-10,sd<-10) We add some random noise to simulate variation from perfect linearity. Plot it to take a look. 1
