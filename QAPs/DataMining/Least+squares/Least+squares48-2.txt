★If the system is solvable, is it the same as the least square problem/system ?
A solution to Ax=b is also a solution to A^t A x = A^t b. However, a solution of latter may not be a solution of the former. Example, A=0, b=1. Ax=b, which is 0=1, has no solution, but A^t A x = A^t b is same as 0=0 which has many solutions. If Ax=b has a solution, then a solution of A^t A x = A^t b is also a solution of Ax=b. To show this, let x1 be a solution of A^t A x = A^t b. Now let x2 be a solution of Ax=b that is known to exist. Then x2 is also a solution of A^t A x = A^t b. Therefore, x1 - x2 is in the null space of (A^t A), which can be shown to be the same as the null space of A (why?). Therefore, x1 - x2 is in the null space of A, which means A(x1-x2) = 0, i.e., A(x1) = A(x2) = b. That is, x1 is a solution of Ax=b.    Embed Quote
