★If the system is solvable, is it the same as the least square problem/system ?
If the system is solvable, then either you have one solution or you have infinitely many solutions (i.e., you have an underdetermined system). If you have infinitely many solutions, then you solve the following constrained optimization problem (which is a quadratic program)                                     to find the least-norm solution                                     If the system is unsolvable, then solve the following unconstrained optimization problem (which is also a quadratic program)                                     to find the least-squares solution                                     which minimizes the -norm of the error vector .    Embed Quote
