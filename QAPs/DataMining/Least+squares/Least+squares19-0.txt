★What is good way to understand hypothesis testing for this beta 1 in least squares regression?I just cannot understand when we do hypothesis testing on beta 1 in the slide, why it assume beta 1 has normal distribution for variance is like this?(the mean is typo in the slide)
In applied mathematics you might encounter a noiseless linear model , where the standard least squares estimate does not have any distribution.  For instance, a curve fitting problem with polynomial approximation i.e. consists of monomials . However, in statistics, we have a noisy linear model . Even though the actual parameter is a fixed distributionless quantity, your respones are normally distributed and the least square estimate contains a stochastic component If you compute the mean and variance of the least squares estimate using standard definitions, you obtain the distribution given in the slide. Since is noisy, you need an estimate of its variance in order to verify that is sufficiently larger than the noise    Embed Quote
