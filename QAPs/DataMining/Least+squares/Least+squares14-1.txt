★How do autoregressive models satisfy the assumptions for least-squares regression?
Peter Flom is correct.    An AR model does not satisfy the standard nice assumptions for least squares regression.  However, given fairly standard assumptions, like stationarity, iid errors  with zero mean and a finite variance, and maybe some statement about the distribution of the initial observation,  an AR model can be accurately estimated by least squares.  The least square estimates can be shown to converge to the population parameter values and, for inference, its asymptotic distribution can be calculated.  Instead of asking "How does an AR model satisfy the assumptions for least-squares?"  the more appropriate question is "What assumptions are needed to accurately estimate an AR model by least squares?".    Embed Quote
