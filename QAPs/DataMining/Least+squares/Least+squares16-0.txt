★How should the parameter be chosen in partial least squares regression?
The parameter in PLS is analogous  to the number of components in PCA. In the chemometrics world, there is a common heuristic for selecting the number of components (). 1) Start with 2) Compute and a cross-validated (called a ). If is at a satisfactory level, stop. 3) Else, increment until reaches a satisfactory level of variance explained (typically 0.8 or more), or until the number starts to decrease. ( does not increase monotonically like -- it will often reach a peak) In theory the is supposed to represent "goodness of prediction", and in this context, is supposed to guard against overfitting. But in practice, it has severe limitations. Beware of q2! [J Mol Graph Model. 2002] I'm not necessarily endorsing the above approach, but merely providing a data point as to a standard practice that I've come across.    Embed Quote
