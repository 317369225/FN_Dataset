★What is the partial least squares regression method in simple terms (not in complex mathematical terms)?
The essential idea of partial least squares is similar to that for principal component analysis, but including the dependent variable. That is, given a dependent variable and a (usually large) set of independent variables, how can we come up with a much smaller set of variables while losing as little information as possible.    Embed Quote
