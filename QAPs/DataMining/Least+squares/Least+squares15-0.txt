★What is the difference between the least square estimation and ordinary least square estimation?
Ordinary least squares refers to linear least squares. There is also nonlinear least squares, which allows for a great deal more flexibility in the regression equation. That is, the regression equation is [math]y = f(x, \beta)[\math] rather than a simple product. Generalized addtiive models are sometimes fit by penalized least squares, which would be one kind of (nonsimple) least squares.    Embed Quote
