★What are the benefits of using estimators derived from L1 (as opposed to least squares) error minimization?
L1 is suitable when the error is exponentially distributed. L2 or least squares is good when the error is distributed normally. Usually L1-based estimators are robust to outliers, while L2 are very sensitive to them. In this blog post (http://blog.gregorybegelman.com/... ) I presented an intuitive derivation for the L1 and L2-based objective functions.    Embed Quote
