★Regression (statistics): What is the difference between Ordinary least square and generalized least squares?
Ordinary least squares is a technique for estimating unknown parameters in a linear regression model. It attempts to estimate the vector , based on the observation which is formed after passes through a mixing matrix and has noise added. OLS gives the maximum likelihood estimate for when the parameters have equal variance and are uncorrelated, and the noise is white, uncorrelated and follows a Gaussian distribution (homoscedasticity). Generalized least squares allows this approach to be generalized to give the maximum likelihood estimate when the noise is colored (heteroscedasticity). If the noise has correlation matrix: then the generalized least squares estimate is    Embed Quote
