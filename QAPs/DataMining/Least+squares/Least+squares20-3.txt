★What is the intuitive meaning of the solution to the problem of finding least-squares linear-regression coefficients?
The OLS coefficient can be intuitively thought of as the covariance between x and y standardised by the variance of x i.e. is the covariance between x and y. It measures how the amount of the variation in y (the dependent variable) that can be explained by x (the independent variable). This is the numerator. is the variance-covariance matrix of all the regressors. The diagonal elements is the variance of the independent variables whereas the off-diagonal elements are the covariance between different x's. Think of it as . We use the inverse of this so it is the denominator.    Embed Quote
