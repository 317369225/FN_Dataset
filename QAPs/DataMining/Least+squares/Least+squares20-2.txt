★What is the intuitive meaning of the solution to the problem of finding least-squares linear-regression coefficients?
The results are not arbitrary if you see how they come from. In simple linear regression we seek to minimize Q = Sum (Yi  - (Bo +B1Xi))^2 if you want to write this in a matrix format, one can simplify it to (Y-XB)'(Y-XB)  where Y is the matrix of response variable and X is the matrix of predictor variables with a column matrix of 1 to the left .      Since Q is now (Y-XB)'(Y-XB) minimizing Q is to take partial  derivatives wrt the matrix B {[Bo ;B1]  and setting them equal to zero. Once you do that you get X'X b= X'Y as the normal equation equivalent . Take X'X to the other side and you have the result b= (X'X)^-1X'Y There is no intuitive way of saying if this indeed minimizes the least squares as such but there are things that you can intuitively say using the Hat matrix H= X(X ' X)^-1X about the Data.        Since Yi hat= HY think of The fitted Yhat  is a linear combination of Observed Y values only weighted by hii . Which means the higher the hii, the more important that Yi is in affecting the fitted value.  ( also note that hii does not depend on Yi and is only a function of X)  hii 's themselves can be thought of a measure of leverage or as measuring outlying X observations, the higher hii indicates that the ith observation is distant from the center of all observations, So therefore if that observation is an outlier in that sense, it tends to affect the fitted value more . I hope this makes intuitive sense.    Embed Quote
