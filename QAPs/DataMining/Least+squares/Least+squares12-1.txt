★When should I choose Partial Least Squares versus Principal Components Regression?PLS and PCR are two different ways to deal with problems like multicollinearity in data. But when should I choose PLS, and when should I choose PCR?
Principal Component Regression: the latent variables (=descriptors) selected are those with the maximum variance Partial Least Squares: the latent variables are chosen in such a way as to also provide maximum correlation with the dependent variable In this sense, the choice of what is most appropriate depends on your intuition about the data (in addition to what cross-correlation will tell you). With PLS the descriptors you are using are the descriptors that correlate with the response. It doesn't mean that these are the right descriptors for any dataset (they might just work for your dataset, but not for larger, external sets) With PCR the descriptors you are using are the descriptors that best separate your objects based on PCA. Generally speaking, PLS will work better because you are using descriptors already selected to correlate better with your response.    Embed Quote
