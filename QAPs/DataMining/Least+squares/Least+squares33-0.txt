★Demonstration of a Single function in Minimum Square Method (Least Squares)★ How can I demonstrate (mathematical proof) how you approximate a set of points (xi, f(xi)) (obtained experimentally), by a function g(x) = a1g1(x) +...+ angn(x), where g1(x), ... ,gn(x) are known. What conditions must be imposed so the wanted function is unique?
It depends on how you're measuring the quality of your approximation.  It would be somewhat bizarre to use a scoring function which is not a norm, so we'll restrict our attention to those cases. Every norm is a convex function, which means that any locally optimal solution is globally optimal.  However, not every norm is strictly convex, which is what you want in order to guarantee that there's a unique solution.  The standard (squared) Euclidean distance is a strictly convex norm, and so if you use that, you will have a unique solution.    Embed Quote
