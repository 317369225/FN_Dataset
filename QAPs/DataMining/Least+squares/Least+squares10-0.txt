★What's a good book on constrained least squares optimization and quadratic programming?I have encountered so many problems where I needed to solve a constrained linear least squares problem, e.g. where all the variables needed to be positive or within some range.  The problem does not seem to be trivial so I'm not sure I could work it out on my own.  What are some good books or other resources on the subject?
I recommend Convex Optimization by Boyd. It's a very good introduction to the topic in general and provides a solid mix of both practical and theoretical perspectives. Convex Optimization - Boyd and Vandenberghe The authors have also made the soft copy free for download.    Embed Quote
