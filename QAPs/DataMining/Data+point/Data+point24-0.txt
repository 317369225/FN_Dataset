Do the 2 data points of Letsbuy.com selling out and Exclusively.in shutting down, constitute a shake-down in Indian Ecommerce?
No. Letsbuy was acquired by Flipkart and then shut down. ExclusivelydotIn pivoted into an ecommerce site SherSinghdotcom which then got acquired by Myntra. Private labels allow for higher margins and Myntra probably used the Sher Singh team's creative prowess to drive their other label, Dressberry. (If you check Myntra now, there are less than 30 items from Sher Singh on their site.) The ecomm space is just about getting interesting: 1. eBay and Paypal have split. Which international player (or should I say, Chinese player) will buy stake in eBay and make an entry into the Indian market? eBay has strategic investments in Quickr, Snapdeal 2. Myntra has been acquired by Flipkart 3. Flipkart and Amazon are slugging it out. More Flipkart, less Amazon.But anyhoo! 4. The small time players will either get consolidated or die a slow death.    Embed Quote
