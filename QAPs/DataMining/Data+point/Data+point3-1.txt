How many data points do you need to make a trend?
I was taught in primary school that it takes 3 points to show a pattern. e.g. 2,4,6 (even numbers); 2,3,5 (prime numbers). You get no information on pattern from just two numbers. However there are patterns that can't be established even with three points. e.g. 1,2,3 (is this part of the fermi sequence or just positive integers?) so even that doesn't hold up completely. I agree with you when you say the more data points the greater the understanding. But in a situation where you want the minimum amount of data...well put it like this: From two points you might be able to tell that there is a trend (say) upwards, but you cannot tell the nature of that trend. Is it linear? Exponential? Oscillating? The third point could give you a lot of additional information about your trend that two points simply cannot give. Then again it might not and you might need a fourth point or a fifth to draw any real conclusions. It's not a trivial question by any means. So here is where my argument would lie: You might need a fourth, fifth, sixth point but at some density of data the number of points becomes basically irrelevant and each additional point has less and less informational value for the curve/trend. Extrapolating backwards we can say that the fifth point holds less information than the fourth and the fourth less than the third (broadly speaking). But here is where that breaks down because the third point holds more informational value than the second. The second point gives you a line but the third point plots a curve (or confirms the line). The third point holds more information about the trend than any other point so I would say you should have minimum points before declaring a trend. Before that you can say there is an increase or a decrease but stay away from the word trend because you do not have enough information.    Embed Quote
