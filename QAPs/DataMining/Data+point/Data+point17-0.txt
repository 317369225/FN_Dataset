What's the best WordPress theme or plugin for a business directory with geolocation and custom data points for each entry?
Ive been using GeoTheme for awhile now and I am on the fence with it. It looks good and it works good, but administering it is a pain in the ass. Its really hard to get it all setup and working properly.    Embed Quote
