★What data points lead us to believe there was life on Mars?
Past life on Mars remains a matter of speculation. No scientist claims to have a definite answer.   In the 19th century, seasonal changes were observed and assumed to be due to vegetation. This was followed by the observation of canals, now known to be optical illusions, but for a long time seen as proof of intelligent life.   The first fly-pasts showed a cratered world, very thin atmosphere, unsuited for surface life. The first lander did a set of experiments that are still argued about, but were mostly viewed as evidence against life.  The various rovers also showed a barren rocky surface.   Meantime there was clear evidence that water flowed, at least occasionally.  In the very early history of Mars, it might have had oceans where life might have evolved. And it could possibly still be lingering underground.   Curiosity has gone to a deep meteor crater to have a look at the very ancient rocks and see if there were indeed oceans or just occasional flows.  And if there were carbon compounds of the right sort.   With exceptional luck it might also find a fossil, but these are rare enough even on Earth.    Embed Quote
