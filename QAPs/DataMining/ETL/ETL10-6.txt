★How useful is ETL learning material for kids given the high cost?We have been sold the idea by an ETL sales person. At the face of it we like it but on searching for reviews online, we have not got any useful reviews. Not sure how to evaluate this material for purchase decision.
I was sceptic initially with ETL books, not on the content they have, but on whether my son will use them or not. Surprisingly, my boy got addicted to them, earned more credits in his class owing to the early exposure he had from these books.  It eventually increased his confidence in class and eased him out of the pressure. He learned facts from these books taking his own time. I am not very particular about learning things early, but I am happy that he does not face  any tension or peer pressure to learn things.    Embed Quote
