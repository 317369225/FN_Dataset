★What are the extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools used at Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn?
There were some great answers to this question at the Cloud Tech IV conference a year or so ago. http://cloudtech4.com/ From my notes at the time: Airbnb: Florian Leibert (@flo) explained that they use Apache Mesos and airbnb/chronos to run their ETL jobs. Facebook: they use Scribe to collect the streaming data, which then flows to Puma for realtime aggregation and stats, as well as Hadoop/Hive which they use for deeper analysis. http://www-conf.slac.stanford.ed... eBay: they use http://www.cascading.org/ (specifically the Scala extension) to organize their Hadoop jobs. These aren't exactly the companies you asked for, but there's a lot of crossover and sharing between these companies... for example Florian used to be at Twitter and started developing some of that stuff there. Hope it helps!    Embed Quote
