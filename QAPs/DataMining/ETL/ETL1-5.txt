★Business Intelligence: ETL : which is the best open source ETL tool to start working ? specially if we are kick starting a BI project
Have a look at the Pentaho BI suite, which includes ETL capability.  It is an open source – but not free – product.  They do have a community edition which includes a module called Kettle which will handle ETL. Regarding the previous poster's suggestion to use Access, I think that's a bad idea.  It's not really a good solution if you'll have lots of users or mass amounts of data.  For the database backend MySQL is a great (and free open source) choice.  You can use the Pentaho tools for reporting, design web pages, or use Excel if you wish.    Embed Quote
