★In Big Data ETL, how many records are an acceptable loss?It is often impossible to properly parse and modify 100% of records when you are dealing with large numbers of records in a distributed system. How many records can you afford to lose? How do you determine this amount? How do you make sure you aren't missing 'vital clues'?
the acceptable losses cannot be decided by any technology. Its the business if they can take it. I deposit a check in my bank account and if banker can allow his IT to accept loss of just this record! Not at all possible. Compared to that they lost my survey response, it may be not that bad.    Embed Quote
