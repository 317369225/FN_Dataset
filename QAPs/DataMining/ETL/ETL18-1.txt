★Is there a better ETL approach? Data Warehouse is all about loading data from source to target. Traditionally, source system produces files and an ETL job loads those files into target system. Is there a better ETL approach which is not using file business?
Extracting to file is often favoured as a way of separating responsibilities so that the source system owner writes the extracts.  This does not scale well and stops the Warehouse from being used for near real time reporting or analytics.  A better way is to use database replication to get data changes from the source system delivered to the Warehouse.  Products such as IBM CDC (DataMirror) or Oracle GoldenGate can read database logs and replicate transactions to a target without running SQL commands, triggers or extracts against the source database.  This reduces the impact on the source and gives near real time data to the Warehouse.  Other methods can detect and publish data events as they occur. ETL tools will still be needed to turn the application data into Warehouse data structures such as 3NF or dimensional models.  The replication approach lets the Warehouse process just changed data and not full tables.    Embed Quote
