★Which software solutions provide real-time ETL?
Most real time solutions don't include much of a framework to transform data.  Typically, at best, you'll get a basic decisioning system.  If by "real time" you really mean "multiple times per day", virtually any ETL tool could support this. If by real time you literally mean the moment a transaction is captured in the source, it is moved to a data warehouse, there's few options out there.  I would also be interested to understand the use case more as making business decisions typically isn't a real time activity.  The best example of this I am aware of is Oracle Golden Gate: Oracle GoldenGate 12c    Embed Quote
