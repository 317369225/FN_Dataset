★What is a good library to build a custom ETL tool on?We want to create a ETL tool for our data warehouse, so that the ETL is agnostic of the database technology used in the DW. What are some good libraries (Python or Java based) that can be used as a starting point? The ETL tool should handle a few GBs of data produced in several different sources each day.
With a general purpose language like Python, you should have all that you need to build an ETL system.  I say system because you're going to need a lot more than just the ability to pull data from a source system and put it somewhere else.  Typically, I found that once you get past the basics of ETL, you end up needing a whole lot more, like workflow and failure management to job scheduling, just to name a few.  Pointing the transformed data to a storage agnostic data warehouse should be relatively easy if you follow Thirumal Venkat's advice.  Here are some repositories to check out if you want to build it from scratch using python: airbnb/chronos - This is more like a cron replacement than any thing else.  Jobs are typically scheduled via some kind of bash script but they can be pipelined. spotify/luigi - This is a great system for building a series of pipeline jobs just like chronos but every task is written in Python.  I like this a little bit better than chronos only because it provides the visualizer and its easier to set up. alimanfoo/petl - Great for performing transformations on smaller datasets. pydata/pandas - This has been my go-to for any quick and dirty ETL tool that I've built in python.  It's got many tools to help you with getting all sorts of information out of your data sources. I would start by checking out pandas, build yourself a few proof-of-concepts, figure out what kind of databases you want to support for your data warehouse and then work your way up to building out ETL pipelines using either luigi or chronos.    Embed Quote
