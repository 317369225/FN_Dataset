★Is hibernate a good solution for ETL?Using Hibernate batch processing we can do some ETL operations, but is it a good option to use it in the large volume operations? With systems with a lot of high volume transforming with some logic attached as well, wouldn't Hibernate add extra overhead? I am comparing it with say stored procedure way of doing ETL, or using a tool like Talend for ETL.
I believe using Hibernate in this case is extra memory overhead, and some CPU overhead, if the logic is simple enough. Using Hibernate means creating objects for each row read. These objects probably aren't even needed, so they will fill up the Java heap and just get garbage collected. Without proper GC, the process will run out of memory, but GC will also have CPU overhead.    Embed Quote
