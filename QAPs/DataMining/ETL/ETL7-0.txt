★What are some best practices when writing ETLs?
Hi, based on my experience on several ETL projects, these are the points that come to my mind: Add flexibility to your process by adding parametrization (connections, time periods...). Like you would do in structured or object oriented programming, structure your ETL process in different stages or modules (the more independent as possible). Follow naming and coding conventions along your ETL implementation. Take advantage and make a proper use of the parallel processing features provided by your RDBMS or ETL tool. Take always into account possible errors and data source inconsistencies, and provide the ETL solution with proper error handling. Make sure that you implement a proper logging functionality and any other features that could help monitoring the ETL process. Know and undesrtand the different components, technologies and tools that you have access in your ETL development framework, and depending of the situation, requirement or feature to be implemented decide whether is better to implement it via an ETL tool component, a SQL script, an external program... Have some database performance tuning skills: In order to know which are the most efficient database transformation and loading mechanisms (ej. partition switching, bulk inserts..) and be able to address any performance problem that may come up. Invest time in having a good and thorough documentation. Keep always in mind your overall system and business goals    Embed Quote
