★What is the scope and benefit of ETL testing?
1. Mainly deals with SQL checks on data to ensure that the data flowing in and flowing out are inline with the organizational requirements. 2.  Ensures that data flowing through Data warehouse(DWH) is correctly being transformed and outputted. All the calculations on the data should correctly simulated through testing ; Usually done through writing complex SQL queries. Also ensures that heterogeneous data coming in  is being integrated correctly to give output values that is formed by taking data from different inputs. 3.Ensures that all the data quality checks are applied before DWH system goes live. By that i mean it is ensured that data coming out adheres to the checks and constraints specified by the data modelers. Ofcourse in banking softwares one rogue zero/null can make a world of difference. Scope : Doesn't deal with UI tests ,Most of it is done on SQL interfaces where we can access databases and tables and not the actual interface where the data is being utilized. This is a very open question Please let me know if you would like to know something in specific. Source : I am ETL test analyst.    Embed Quote
