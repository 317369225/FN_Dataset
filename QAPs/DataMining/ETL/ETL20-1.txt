★Which is the best tool to migrate data, ETL or ORM?1. BI/BW  what happens to this stuff that’s already in BI / BW- with HANA in place?
There is nothing called "The best tool". At the end of the day, it depends on - what's your need? and what fits your pocket? Lets say that you are relocating from Euro to US and you need to move all your stuffs. Is it a ship cargo? Or Is it an air shipment? What is the best? - Nothing. Both will get the job done at their own speed. I suggest to use multiple tools within the same process depending on the activity. BTW, ETL is a methodology but not a tool.    Embed Quote
