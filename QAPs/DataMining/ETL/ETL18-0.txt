★Is there a better ETL approach? Data Warehouse is all about loading data from source to target. Traditionally, source system produces files and an ETL job loads those files into target system. Is there a better ETL approach which is not using file business?
You could do a database to database connection for ETL, however, if your source database is a point in time operational system you add risk to the solution by not being able to recreate the source data in the event of a failure or corruption into core. You could also do a message architecture, such as MQ, where you read transactional messages from a queue through a parser into a target or stage table. That isn't going to be appropriate for every source system however.   ETL by definition requires the extract of data out of the source, so unlike a Hadoop solution where the data resides in multiple native systems, you kind of have to take the data out somehow.    Embed Quote
