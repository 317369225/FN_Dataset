★How useful is ETL learning material for kids given the high cost?We have been sold the idea by an ETL sales person. At the face of it we like it but on searching for reviews online, we have not got any useful reviews. Not sure how to evaluate this material for purchase decision.
When we heard about these books, we were skeptical about whether they'd be beneficial for our little one. If not anything, it surely helped our daughter with some good pronunciation. Oh she loves the 'Walter' device. Unfortunately, there are no kids her age in our lane and though we encourage it a lot, she doesn't go out to play much. Since there are not many friends to play with, she used to watch a lot of TV. The books helped her spend time away from TV which is a major plus. Another major plus is that she has developed a fondness for books and reading. I wouldn't say that the books would raise IQ manifold. They would surely help children be occupied with something productive. P.S: We haven't bought the entire set - just the Knowledge and Skills sets.    Embed Quote
