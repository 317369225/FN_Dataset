★What are some best practices when writing ETLs?
From my experience, I would say the below things: Documentation: Make inventory, lineage excels which helps the anyone to know about what all is there in the project. Create a Visio diagram so that the flow is understood by people. Have a high level doc ready and updated with time. Code: Automate things which can be done to ensure more efficiency/quality and less error. Ex. When doing parameterization in informatica or any other software, we have to make a file for it, so make a script which will have you do it. If using RDBMS, which makes use of indexes in order to give you best performance than make sure to get those indexes right. NEVER CONFUSE yourself with keys and indexes. Always maintain the standards. Never try to do things in a complex way as in sql the more complex you go the more lengthy and comped the code becomes. Use shell scripting to make everything independent of human intervention.    Embed Quote
