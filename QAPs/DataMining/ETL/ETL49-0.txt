★How much do ETL solutions cost?I'm looking for the pricing on Enterprise solutions like Data integration leader for Big Data & Cloud Analytics (Informatica).
I did some research into this in early 2014. Prices varied a lot, depending on size of the installation (e.g. users) and features required. However, you can expect first-year charges (license, installation, minimum training and support) in the range of 15k$ to 500k$, with follow-up costs (subscription, maintenance, support) in the range of 1/5 to 1/3 of that. Back then the lower end of that price span included MuleSoft and Pentaho, while the upper end included Informatica and Dell Boomi. Note that you will usually be comparing apples to oranges, so you need to get your requirements straight to determine what you really need. There are also single-seat desktop solutions for 2-5k$ initial investment, as well as applications like Zapier that can do basic ETL and are available for 10-50$ a month. Finally, there are some open source ETL/DI/BI solutions out there, ranging from  Pentaho Community Edition to wetransform HALE Open Source.    Embed Quote
