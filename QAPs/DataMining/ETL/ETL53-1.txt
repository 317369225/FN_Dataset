★What is the best way of implementing an ETL tool using Hadoop using opensource software?What is the best stack to implement an ETL tool for reporting data to a web interface?
I think the answer depends a LOT on what existing tools you have both on the reporting and ETL side. If you have skills in an existing tool that also understands Hadoop then that can be a compelling way to go since you generally need to add/mix/stage or move to an external source as part of an Enterprise ETL processes. BTW  - being able to document who touched what data and why as part of this process is generally a very good idea. If your existing reporting can understand an HBase construct - assuming latency of reporting response is a consideration - and mix any HBase managed data with the other non-Hadoop sources then great. That is not always (or even often) the case so preparing data (some not necessarily all) in Hadoop and then moving it into a more traditional structured store is often required. Make sure you can do all of that without losing visability over who has done what and when.    Embed Quote
