★What are the pros and cons of ETL vs BTEQ?
I think we may need to clarify those two terms first. "ETL" stands for "Extract, Transform & Load", it's conceptual level term, the purpose of ETL is to transform data from one source to one target in the right way and right time. In the backend of "ETL", it means lots of technical products(e.g. DataStage)/programs(e.g. you can develop a simple python program to perform your ETL task), and methodology(e.g. you can refer to <The Data Warehouse ETL Toolkit> for detail). I'm not familiar with BTEQ. It stands for "Basic TEradata Query" which is an utility provided by Teradata for data query, import/export and generate report. It's a specific tool designed for Teradata product, and basically you're still using SQL to manipulate data. So you can see it's hard to compare a concept with a tool. I can list some pros of ETL products here: 1. Most of the ETL products can handle multiple types data sources, like relational data (Oracle, DB2, MySQL etc.) 2. ETL could be "easy" as some SQL scripts, or "hard" as product (Informatica/Datastage) 3. Professional ETL tool provides user interface, user can drag-and-drop the pre-defined stages to build a ETL stream, for non-programmer, it's easier to use and understand. Reference 1.
