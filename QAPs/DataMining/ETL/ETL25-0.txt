★Is there still a market for Cloud based ETL/Data Integration Services?The company I am working with is currently using Hadoop to integrate and analyze data....they are thinking about adding a ETL component/tool to their product in order to focus on "small" data as well as big. Is there still a market for this type of service?
disclaimer: I'm co-founder and CEO of Xplenty (Data integration on the cloud), a data integration on the cloud platform. I think the better question here: is there a good, scalable ETL engine on the cloud that can help you with data integration in a Big Data world. The need to pre-process data has actually grown in the past few years, amidst the deluge of data companies are now faced with. And in order to make sense of it all, these companies need a solid platform that can process that data. Hadoop is a great platform to perform these ETL tasks, and in fact it's one of the main use cases of Hadoop to date. So I don't think ETL is suitable for just "small" data, rather it's even more relevant when discussing Big Data.    Embed Quote
