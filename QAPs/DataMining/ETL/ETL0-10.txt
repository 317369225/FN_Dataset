★ETL Concepts: What are the advantages of using Informatica as an ETL tool over Teradata?As far as I know Teradata is a more expensive solution, as compared to Informatica, but I was wondering about other advantages from an operational standpoint.
Right Question to ask would be why INFORMATICA and not any Database scripting [PLSQL/SQL Scripting/Teradata etc[ ?. The simplest way to answer is INFORMATICA limits developer mistakes, in that it compresses all data integration functions involved in moving data into to a series of transformation objects. Each code component[mapping/session] is a documentation in itself, quite simple to understand with a couple of days training and provides a framework which enables an organization to  launch huge data integration projects without having to depend on an army of expert http://scripters.It also reduces the dead sections that appears frequently in complex scripts where developers add new features by adding a completely new section instead of trying to find where to edit the existing script especially when the scripts have been developed without proper comments.    Embed Quote
