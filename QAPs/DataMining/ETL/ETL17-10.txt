★Why should I use an existing ETL vs writing my own in Python for my data warehouse needs?I've been reading the Kimball Group Reader and they strongly recommend I use an existing ETL. Looking at solutions such as Kettle, SnapLogic, and Talend it seems their GUIs complicate the solution instead of making it easier to model and understand.
I have been working with ETL tools for the last five years, mainly with IBM Datastage, but generally the following points also apply to Informatica Powercenter and SAP BODS (where I have some basic experience) and probably to other ETL tools as well. Development and support performance Available plugins for databases: (e.g. Oracle, DB2, Sybase, Teradata...). E.g. you can easily import table structures from the database (and reuse them for your jobs) Available plugins for various systems (such as SAP R/3, SAP BW) Monitoring tools already available organizing jobs and job sequences (workflows), incl. job scheduling predefined algorithms available (e.g. for delta loading) Reprogramming all this (if you need this) would waste immense resources.    Embed Quote
