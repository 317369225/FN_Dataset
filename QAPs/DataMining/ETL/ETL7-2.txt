★What are some best practices when writing ETLs?
Thanks for the A2A - Not sure there is much I can add, there are some really great answers already.   Obviously the best practices are tool agnostic, each tool will have a set of best practices to follow, and I don't know all of the tools to be able to go into detail.   The only best practice I would add that I haven't seen mentioned in detail is reusability - meaning - don't rebuild the wheel with every project. Victor touched on this with using parameters wherever you can - this takes it a step further. If you build transformations/aggregations/loads/extracts etc in a common frame work - i.e. we always do loads into stage as a 1:1 source to stage - then when adding new sources - all you have to do is change the source name and table name - your done. What would have been 8 hours in development is now more like 2..   So taking the common themes you see in the answers - flexibility, usability, performance, documentation, and reusability - you get a pretty robust framework of best practices    Embed Quote
