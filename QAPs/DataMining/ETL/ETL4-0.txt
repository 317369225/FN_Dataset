★What is ETL (Extract Transform Load) Testing?
ETL, as the name implies, is the method by which data is extracted from one or more source systems, usually databases. Transformed, i.e the format changed, deduplicated, filtered, merged, sorted, enhanced and/or cleaned etc. And, finally loaded into a final destination I.e. a database, report, data warehouse or Enterprise software package.. Tests usually involve an initial data audit and analysis so that you know what the data sources mean and what is their quality in terms of dirty or missing data. Functional testing to prove that the final data being loaded is correct. Also, you need to consider performance and especially performance when your ETL jobs are running together with unrelated ETL jobs in your production environment. Testing under the future expected data capacity is necessary to avoid trouble later.    Embed Quote
