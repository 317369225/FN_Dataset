★What are some best practices when writing ETLs?
Trying to Keep this Simple and General : 1. Define Coding standards & Naming Guidelines for ETL components   1.1 While defining coding standard and naming convention, keep future          maintenance as priority one interest.    1.1 Have naming convention for tables, fields, files, code, Code components, 2. Design the ETL to be maintainable. 3. Move the data in stages, First step is to stage data in your local environment from multiple sources, Second step for calculations and processes and third step to move the data into defined target  3.1 Advantage of this staged move is that it would make it possible for you to        identify the errors at the stage where it happens. This would be very useful       to pin down errors and fix the same on a day to day basis.  3.2 Try to define balancing rules when moving data and capture error messages when the validation rules are not complied with. 4. Call an Error Function or Package to create error messages. Ensure that all error codes custom generated by ETL are tracked in table/file and error messages have a consistent format sentence  structure and word format wise. A consistent meaning for error messages will reduce the cost of maintaining the ETL code components. 5. Design not only for current data volume requirements but also for future anticipated data growth for 2-4 years.    Embed Quote
