★How do I use Python as an ETL - data integration tool?
I wrote an ETL tool in Python utilizing the pyodbc library about 5 years ago and I am still using it for internal projects. When I started I had never heard of the word ETL. I modeled my code after the Ruby on Rails migration library which I had used. Most of the data manipulation was done using SQL (ELT) but the main advantage was that each migration step was a class. This enabled me to create a library of helper classes that encapsulated common tasks like executing a remote query, mapping data types, and subsetting a table based on a join. I also added functionality like rollback and resume a transfer when a database connection reset, the ability to clone an entire ETL script and did some metaprogramming. With Python you don't have to write a lot of code if you intelligently architect a solution.    Embed Quote
