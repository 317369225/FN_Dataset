★What is a good library to build a custom ETL tool on?We want to create a ETL tool for our data warehouse, so that the ETL is agnostic of the database technology used in the DW. What are some good libraries (Python or Java based) that can be used as a starting point? The ETL tool should handle a few GBs of data produced in several different sources each day.
If you are planning to use node.js, you can try agmen-hu/node-datapumps.  It controls data flow and handles errors for you. It has a small number  of interfaces at the time of writing this answer (MySQL, MongoDB, REST, Excel, CSV) but it's  quite easy add new ones and build your custom ETL tool on it.    Embed Quote
