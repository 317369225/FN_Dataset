★ETL Concepts: What are the advantages of using Informatica as an ETL tool over Teradata?As far as I know Teradata is a more expensive solution, as compared to Informatica, but I was wondering about other advantages from an operational standpoint.
Probably first and foremost Teradata is a distributed database and not an ETL tool.  You can certainly do things like data transformation within Teradata, but when it comes to extracting and loading other sources, that isn't really something it does.  Sure it has import and export tools, but that is purely for getting data into and out of Teradata (usually via flat files).  Informatica can basically load data from anything, transform it, and write it to anything.    Embed Quote
