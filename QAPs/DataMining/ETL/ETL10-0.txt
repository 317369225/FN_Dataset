★How useful is ETL learning material for kids given the high cost?We have been sold the idea by an ETL sales person. At the face of it we like it but on searching for reviews online, we have not got any useful reviews. Not sure how to evaluate this material for purchase decision.
First, I should note that I have no experience with such material. Nevertheless, I tend to be suspicious of methods claiming to raise IQ and enhance cognitive powers in small children. Consider the notion that listening to classical music in the womb would make little neonate geniuses. It turned out that the biggest success for this idea was the sale of "baby Einstein" CDs.[1] Keep in mind that as new parents, we are suckers for purchasing "the best" for our kids. We're a prime market for all things baby. In short, I would not recommend purchasing untested, non-mainstream learning materials for young children. Especially if you cannot find unbiased reviews -- something seems fishy. Instead, consider spending your money on more traditional alternatives -- educational techniques that are about as expensive but probably more practical. Music lessons at an early age. Directed tutoring or classroom schooling for preschoolers. A vetted, classical homeschooling or enrichment curriculum. Also, consider physical training, such as swimming or tumbling lessons. Good luck! Don't forget to have fun on your child-rearing adventure! [1] Mozart's music does not make you smarter, study finds    Embed Quote
