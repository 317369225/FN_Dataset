★What are well-known preferably Python based open-source ETL tools?The target is to curate raw MySQL data for data-mining and machine learning purposes with a best alternative opensource ETL tool. Since I am good at Python my first choice is the tools governed by Python. Also, if oyu like to know, I my intended work stack is Pandas, Sci-kit learn, Pylearn2 for the latter mining and ML processes.
Last time I checked, early 2013, there wasn't a great deal out there. I've built a basic data processing pipeline using Celery in the past. The presentation below covers the basics, and parts of it could reasonably be adapted to the tools you want to use. With Python you can roll your own pipeline abstractions that meet the needs of your specific situation. I also include some references to an alternative called data brewery. http://www.slideshare.net/mindso...    Embed Quote
