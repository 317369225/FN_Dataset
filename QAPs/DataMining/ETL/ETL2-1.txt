★How do ETL tools work?
1. Extract data from one or more sources. 2. Transform the data.  This usually means defining a map between sources and targets and how you want data to be transformed.      2.1 Passive or column level transformations are the most common.  Examples are calculations.  For instance, two columns from source A yield new column on target B.  Passive transformations don't alter the resulting number of rows passed to the target.     2.2. Active transformations such as aggregator, sort, filter, and union are examples of row-level transformations which can alter the number of rows sent to the target.    2.3. Some transformations like Lookups can be configured as Passive or Active.  For example, a lookup is defined to return a single value for a target column.  So in this case it is Passive.  If the lookup returned multiple rows to the target it would be Active.  3.  Load result set to one or more targets. Some transformations can be replicated using SQL or procedural SQL; but not as quickly or efficiently.  ETL tools can  typically run on multiple source or target database platforms, so you don't have to hard code your SQL.  Handy if you need to write the same data to different relational targets, or transition from one RDBMS target to another. ETL also allows the orchestration of processes through scheduling, scripting, and automation. In the case of Informatica, sources and targets may be flat files, relational database, web service, Teradata or solutions such as SAP where Informatica has a licensed connector.  Connectors for social media and big data are also coming into play.    Embed Quote
