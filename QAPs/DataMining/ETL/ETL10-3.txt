★How useful is ETL learning material for kids given the high cost?We have been sold the idea by an ETL sales person. At the face of it we like it but on searching for reviews online, we have not got any useful reviews. Not sure how to evaluate this material for purchase decision.
Wheather the books raise IQ or not,,,these are some very well written books keeping in mind a child's psychology. I have a 2.4 yrs old son and i was already struggling about how to make him learn better. With limited options in the local markets i could not imagine of teaching my son more than a for apple and b for ball. just in one week of these books with my son, he knows a for apple, aeroplane, astrounauts, apricot, ant, big A, small a.... I am so far impressed.    Embed Quote
