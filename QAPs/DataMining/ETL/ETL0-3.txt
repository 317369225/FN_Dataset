★ETL Concepts: What are the advantages of using Informatica as an ETL tool over Teradata?As far as I know Teradata is a more expensive solution, as compared to Informatica, but I was wondering about other advantages from an operational standpoint.
Teradata is a database where you store data and etl is code you write to move data from one database to another.  You might be confused because TeradatA at claims that their tool is so fast at transformations you need less etl ( less marting).   I think that may be true but there are some transformations that need  intermediate steps that is difficult to do with straight SQL.    Embed Quote
