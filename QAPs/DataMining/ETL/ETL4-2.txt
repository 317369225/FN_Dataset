★What is ETL (Extract Transform Load) Testing?
Imagine you have a retail store chain (Like Walmart or Reliance Fresh) and you have 300 stores across different cities which have different prices/taxes and different range of products based on consumer requirements. You have a common warehouse and you store all your goods there. Each day you dispatch the required items to different stores based on what was consumed the previous day. At 9PM when each store closes, data is extracted from those stores and moved to a common data warehouse. Now the data is just sales data and has no analysis involved. You transform this data to obtain meaningful data like - profit made per region, goods sold per category, goods sold per region etc. Based on this data, you make decisions like how much more do i need to send to store A and how much do i send to store B? how many toothpastes and how many soaps do I need to send to store A? How much money is region X making for me and where do I need to focus? This meaningful data is loaded to your data warehouse for further use. This process is called ETL. This ETL is automated using ETL tools. An ETL tool executes your ETL strategy . Once you map data from source to target and perform your calculations on it,  you need to test whether you have executed the right strategy or not. So you go ahead and test it against the data you actually expect. Typically, this is ETL Testing. There are other test criteria like performance and efficiency (say you dispatch your goods at 5AM but previous day's data reaches you only at 5.30 because the system performance is slow).    Embed Quote
