★What is ETL testing? What is a suggestion for a center to learn ETL testing in Chennai? What ETL tool has good scope?
Hello... Frankly speaking ETL Testing is more of a review / validation exercise.. You have to understand the tool well to validate / review it.. You can then validate : 1.) Best Practices 2.) Standards followed in the project like Naming conventions, etc 3.) Performance Testing 4.) And ofcourse end to end mapping of columns so that none of them gets wrongly mapped. Few major tools available in Market are Informatica, Datastage, Ab Initio, ODI.. Hope that helps.. -Amir    Embed Quote
