★How robust is using SQL for ETL?
I would say it is good to use SQL for your ETL need but it will trouble you for maintaining or updating it in future. Also time consumed to create such complex SQL queries are huge as compare to writing a jobs/transformations using any good ETL tool. Debuging is another big issue in case of anything goes wrong. Controlling, monitoring, and logging are nightmare in case of SQL way. Conclusion : It is better to use ETL tools for all your ETL needs. I would advice to using open source and free ETL tools like Pentaho Data Integrator (PDI) or Talend Open Studio (TOS).    Embed Quote
