★How useful is ETL learning material for kids given the high cost?We have been sold the idea by an ETL sales person. At the face of it we like it but on searching for reviews online, we have not got any useful reviews. Not sure how to evaluate this material for purchase decision.
Guys don't get fooled into buying these books. These are just not worth it. I have gone through the entire content and books.

Buy and collect those.    Embed Quote
