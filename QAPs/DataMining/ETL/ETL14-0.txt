★What does an ETL Architect in your company do?I am looking for answers beyond "architect, design, and develop ETL solutions"
It probably depends on the organization. I spent many years at a company that acted as a vendor to Fortune 500 companies, specializing in call center and healthcare claim processing analytics. Here are some of the things that the ETL Architect handled - Engage with every new customer to identify all native data sources in the customer's data warehouse that are needed to build the new analytic solution - Map out the ETL process using the new data sources to create a new analytic datamart - Define the ETL and report schemas aimed at optimizing storage capacity and performance - Document the enrichment activity that must be applied to any new data, but delegate the work to a team of ETL designers - Work with customer business users, customer data experts to make sure the solution meets all requirements both in data availability and performance - Share any new learnings internally with the project Engagement Manager, IT organization and Engineering to drive constant improvements to our cloud infrastructure and the product that drives the ETL work and customer experience    Embed Quote
