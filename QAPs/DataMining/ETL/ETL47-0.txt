★How hot and wide is the scope of opportunities with hadoop/BigData for an Informatica (ETL) developer?I am an Informatica (ETL) developer, I want to wet my feet in haddop/BigData. I need to know what opportunities (learning and working) are available where my experience with Informatica,SQL/plsql, AND knowledge of datawarehouse concepts can be usefull?
The biggest problem for an Informatica developer is that you're used to working with structured data.  While there are a plethora of connectors for Hadoop, including ones for Informatica, they are just that: A connection.  They don't put the structure behind the data.  If you wanted to continue working in PowerCenter, then Hadoop would be nothing but another source for you.  It would look and work like any other source qualifier.  But someone would have to structure the data for you within Hadoop (through Hive or something like a CSV file). I would suggest just downloading a Hadoop VM and toying around.  Try the Cloudera CDH VM: Cloudera QuickStart VM    Embed Quote
