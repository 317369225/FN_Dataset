★Which OpenSource ETL tool is easier to use & more agile? Pentaho Kettle/Jitterbit/Talend/Clover/Jasper/Rhino?Easy, meaning any technical person w/out B.I. background can use it. Agile meaning can be used in agile BI implementations
You could also consider Apatar, which is pretty intuitive just like Kettle. Kettle is very easy to start, though it's documentation is not that good. Thus if you'd like a quick start for non-experienced users and you find Kettle sufficient in terms of features I'd go with it. Jitterbit is actualy an integration server while Talend studio is a powefull ETL script generator. Talend studio has tutorials which are actuall must. It's not as intuitive as Kettle or Apatar, but when you get used to it, you would find it feature-rich  and powerfull. The other problems with Talnd is it always has some new glitches introduced with every release.    Embed Quote
