★In Big Data ETL, how many records are an acceptable loss?It is often impossible to properly parse and modify 100% of records when you are dealing with large numbers of records in a distributed system. How many records can you afford to lose? How do you determine this amount? How do you make sure you aren't missing 'vital clues'?
As stated above, the answer is of course it depends. There is a HUGE difference between data loss in a system of record vs a reporting system. It is very different to have data loss when you are (for example) trying to get an intraday risk positions vs storing the actual trades. Data loss in the second is unacceptable. Be very careful here with the assumptions you make. I would respectfully take issue with the following - "Predictable data loss is expected even in accounting (hence reserves for returns / breakage etc.)" That isn't what those accounting concepts are addressing - totally different notion.    Embed Quote
