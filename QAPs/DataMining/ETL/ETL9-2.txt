★Will Hadoop replace ETL?
No not at all, Hadoop is not a replacement for ETL because hadoop is actually a high performance distributed computing program. Hadoop replaces ETL is like saying Linux is a replacement for MS Office on Windows. Hadoop’s architecture is fundamentally superior for supporting many of the most commonly deployed data integration functions. Hadoop has not replaced nor it will replace ETL in the coming time because Hadoop complements ETL for the processing of Bigdata. I found your question very interesting also I would like to share that if you want to have a brief introduction and concepts about Hadoop and ETL then you can have a look over http://alturl.com/txofj where you will also find some descriptive videos which are really very useful.    Embed Quote
