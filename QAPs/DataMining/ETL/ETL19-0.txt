★What are the pros and cons of the ETL tools for big data?- informatica, talend, oracle big data connectors and others?
This is a more of conceptual post. While dealing with big data, I am assuming you are referring to horizontal scalability, like hadoop or mongo db based solutions. It is better to do ELT then ETL. If you do ETL, the transformation will be taken care of by the etl tool. If the tool does not do the transformation in the horizontal scalable cluster, you are stuck with vertical scalability. Also if the etl tool uses a hadoop based environment, it will most likely be the main processing cluster. And almost always data processed by hadoop etc end up in traditional data warehouse as the consumers for the processed data has good integration with netezza, teradata, rqc etc.    Embed Quote
