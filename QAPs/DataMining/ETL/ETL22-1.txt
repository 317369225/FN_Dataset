★How is the scope of ETL testing in USA?Actually i have 1 year of work exp in ETL testing and want to move to USA in future. Presently working in India's brand company. How is the scope and salary there after 3-4 years of work experience ?
Etl testing or any technology for that matter has vast scope in USA. But getting a visa itself sponsored from them is difficult. We  earn the same money here just by switching jobs every year. We need to join big service industry giants like Infosys, wipro or TCS work for 4 years and wait for the  right opportunity to be sent to US.    Embed Quote
