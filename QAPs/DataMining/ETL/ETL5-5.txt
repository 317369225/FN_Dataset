★Are there any browser based ETL tools?Most of the ETL tools are desktop apps and needs to be installed on a desktop or a server. Are there any ETL tools that are developed as web applications?
No I think. And there should not be any 1 in the future too. As ETL is not just a simple application like running animation on the website, you can't expect them to be a simple web app. Consider how difficult it would be to connect to the different Databases from your Browser. Firstly due to the huge computations involved, your browser crashes in an irrecoverable manner. PS: We can have a very light version of ETL tool with basic functionality like from one folder to other without databases in Web Apps. But even these will make browser to suffer a lot.    Embed Quote
