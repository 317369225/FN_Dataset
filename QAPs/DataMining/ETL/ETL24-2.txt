★What will be future of informatica and other ETL tools as Big data getting popular?
SAS have   a very good data integration suite that is primarily used by customers who   have chosen to use the SAS analytics tool. Informatica has a stable product   which is very good for ETL (PL/SQL is still better) and also I Would go with   Informatica as a best ETL Tool. It is personal experience. Now a days   Informatica openings are more compared to DataStage. Acoording to me the best   way to identify opportunities for a specific tool is to read the course   description of Intellipaat on their websites. By doing this you will get a   decent idea as to which tool is used where. I would suggest you to reffer it   once. https://intellipaat.com/etl-test...    Embed Quote
