★ETL Concepts: What are the advantages of using Informatica as an ETL tool over Teradata?As far as I know Teradata is a more expensive solution, as compared to Informatica, but I was wondering about other advantages from an operational standpoint.
Some times it depends on the environment. If Informatica is available it makes sense to use it for ETL purposes. If not Teradata TPT & BTEQ can also carry out the work - only if all the required source data has made it to Teradata via whichever means. Informatica gives an advantage of not having to actually bring everything over to Teradata.    Embed Quote
