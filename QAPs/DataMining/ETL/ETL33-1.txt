★What is the difference on ETL (extract, transform and load) by programming languages and ETL by using tools?
The major differences: Time to develop. Tools are much faster than hand coding. Supportability. Hand coding is hell to read and no one wants to try and find a missed semi-colon in the middle of the night. It also makes it difficult to update. Portability. Is the language used readable by every server that needs to execute that script. If you write it in Python 2 and are now writing it in Python 3, do you have to go back and rewrite the Python 2 code? Functionality. Tools provide standard ways of doing transforms so that every date aggregation is aggregated the same, or every trim is done the same way. Hand coding is susceptible to differences, especially when different programmers are involved. Flexibility. Here hand coding wins out over tools, but not by much. Most tools now a days allow for custom code generation within the tool, so there isn't much you can't do in them. But a few libraries in a couple of languages may be difficult to use in them, where as hand coding doesn't have that limitation.    Embed Quote
