★How do I use Python as an ETL - data integration tool?
Although you could write your own ETL software in Python, I am not sure why you would.  If you have used full ETL suites like Informatica, Data Stage, Talend, etc then you know there is a rich set of functions and features which would be difficult to implement from scratch.  If price is a concern, you can use something like Talend, which has Open Source versions. If your just doing quick and dirty imports, sure, just use python, import your CSV/TSV/etc, convert your formats, re-map variable names, whatever you need to do, and it's no big deal.  But if your doing any sort of enterprise grade ETL, there is much value in using existing ETL tools, and spending your time on gaining more value via other parts in the process.    Embed Quote
