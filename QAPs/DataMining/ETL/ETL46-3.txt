I have been using Clover and and if you are familiar with eclipse, you will find the experience quite satisfying.  Clover's ability to extend using a java like language is as easy as can be.  And if you are Java enabled, you can build java extensions as well. I was up and productive in hours.  There is also a server product which promises to allow automation, but I have not gotten there yet.    Embed Quote
