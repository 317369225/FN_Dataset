★How do I use Python as an ETL - data integration tool?
Python, Perl, Java, C, C++ -- pick your language -- can all be used for ETL.  Tool selection depends on the task.  If I'm working on a one-off project that will not have recurring ETL requirements (read: one-time activity) I use tools like Kettle (a.k.a. Pentaho Data Integrator).  The trade-off in execution time is small compared to the time required to stick-build something in Python or Perl, let alone C.  On the other hand, if I have a recurring ETL requirement for a data set, I'll build the loader in Perl or Python.  The execution speed of the loader tends to be I/O bound (typically the target database is the limiting factor), not CPU bound.    Embed Quote
