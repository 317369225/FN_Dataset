★Does Google have data warehousing jobs? If so, which ETL tool does it use?
A2A.  I haven't worked at Google but I've worked with people who have worked in Google's "data warehousing" equivalent teams. Yes, they have jobs.  They invented map-reduce which at its core is a batch processing framework (aka jobs). Like most extremely large companies, they have multiple tools and frameworks.  Most people working on the largest data sets will use some combination of programming frameworks or tools like Dremel.  Some lines of business with their own IT might use a traditional ETL tool for specific business needs.  They also have released some details of Google Cloud Dataflow which is basically an ETL processing framework.    Embed Quote
