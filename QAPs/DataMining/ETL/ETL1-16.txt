★Business Intelligence: ETL : which is the best open source ETL tool to start working ? specially if we are kick starting a BI project
I've had recent experience integrating MySQL and Informatica PowerCenter Express.  Note: PC Express is not the same as Enterprise PC.  It's personal version of Informatica Developer.  Still you can perform all the basic transformations, create mapping & workflow.  You're limited to 250k rows per day single user free download.   I haven't tried importing the code from pcExpress to PcEnterprise.  I would like someone to reply on that.  It should work as they are built on Vibe architecture.    Embed Quote
