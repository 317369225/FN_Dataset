★Business Intelligence: ETL : which is the best open source ETL tool to start working ? specially if we are kick starting a BI project
Disclaimer: I'm the CEO of Xplenty (Data integration on the cloud) , ETL on the cloud, powered by easy Hadoop. If you're already on the cloud and need a robust ETL engine to use in order to process data in large scales, then I would opt for a platform that you can scale as you grow. There are the "traditional" ETL tool like Pentaho and Talend, which are good, but they are not provided to you "as a service". You will need to set up the instances for the software and maintain the servers. Xplenty is a SaaS ETL, where you do not have to install a thing, and you can create data flows on top of Hadoop within minutes, no coding required, you'll be using a familiar interface, and you'll be u and running in minutes,    Embed Quote
