★Are there any browser based ETL tools?Most of the ETL tools are desktop apps and needs to be installed on a desktop or a server. Are there any ETL tools that are developed as web applications?
SnapLogic does this and more (Application integration, Big Data integrations etc.) We are a completely REST based platform accessible from any browser (tablets etc. included). The key point to highlight is that we have separated the control and execution - you can develop, manage, monitor all your integrations in the Cloud and choose the execution environment to be closest to the data. If you have a few million rows in a MySQL database behind the firewall you don't need to push all that to the cloud to do some processing/analytics and vice versa - if all your applications/databases are in the Cloud, no reason for you to pull that all into your network. Here is some more info on how we do it : SnapLogic Disclaimer: I work here :)    Embed Quote
