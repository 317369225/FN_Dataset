★Which OpenSource ETL tool is easier to use & more agile? Pentaho Kettle/Jitterbit/Talend/Clover/Jasper/Rhino?Easy, meaning any technical person w/out B.I. background can use it. Agile meaning can be used in agile BI implementations
I've worked with Talend and Jaspersoft. Talend is great. It would be my first choice. It's easy to learn, great documentation and has a great community for support. Jaspersoft is more for relational reporting. I believe Jaspersoft is now in partnership with Talend and Jasper's ETL component is Talend Open Studio.    Embed Quote
