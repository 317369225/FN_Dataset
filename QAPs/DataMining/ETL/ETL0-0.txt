★ETL Concepts: What are the advantages of using Informatica as an ETL tool over Teradata?As far as I know Teradata is a more expensive solution, as compared to Informatica, but I was wondering about other advantages from an operational standpoint.
Teradata does have native export and load utilities, and with scripting you can do ETL within Teradata.   Operationally, however, its the concept of using the right tool for the right job. Informatica is a data integration tool and as such provides native functionality for the export transform and loading of data. Teradata is a database, pure and simple. I wouldn't use a screwdiver to hammer a nail, I wouldn't use Teradata for ETL.   Scalability would be a concern. Teradata is either a noded or appliance architecture, so the processing power and data storage within have a hard cap. The other operational concern I would point out is recoverability. If your using Teradata to do both and you lose your TD system, you lose the ability to perform ETL. With a separate system you could set up an active active or active passive failover and still be able to load the data.   I am currently running a TD system with Informatica as the ETL integration, and it works very well.    Embed Quote
