★How useful is ETL learning material for kids given the high cost?We have been sold the idea by an ETL sales person. At the face of it we like it but on searching for reviews online, we have not got any useful reviews. Not sure how to evaluate this material for purchase decision.
ETL books are indeed costly. My son is 6 years old now. We bought the set when he was 3 and half years old. I would say, his knowledge level has increased tremendously. The feedback I get from his teachers is that he tells out many facts when they are in a class  discussion. These books have been re-read so many times that he knows the book by topic. If he has got a question on what colour should a ostrich be given, he reaches out to his books. His pronunciation as well as his  English usage have improved considerably. Investing on ETL books also requires one to invest time. You need to spend at least 15-20 minutes everyday to get the best out of them. My son chooses his books to read them even at vacation. These books provides a lot of activities that parent-child can bond over. Especially, the books from the Skill set are a wonderful tool for such bonding. It's three years since I have bought the books and my son still uses at least one of them every day. We have the English, Knowledge, Skills and Math series.    Embed Quote
