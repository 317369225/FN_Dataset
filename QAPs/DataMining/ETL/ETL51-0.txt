★What is the future of ETL tools like Ab Initio?
This question has been asked for many years now but if you see, Ab Initio is still going very strong. If Ab Initio would have just been an ETL tool, it might have lost the race because of its cost and strict content sharing principle. But Ab Initio is much more than just an ETL tool. With EME (code storage and versioning), Conduct IT (wrapping & dependency handling), Operational Console (scheduling), Data Profiler (data quality), Metadata hub (metadata management), BRE + ACE (Generic code with minimal developer need for code enhancements), Continuous flows and web service features (real time services) and many more tools & features, it is a full-fledged, data and metadata management tool. Before I digress any further, what I mean to say is that Ab Initio is being used heavily & will continued to be used by companies because of the power of the tool and the myriad other benefits it brings along. All its tools are tightly coupled and are very easy to use which is another plus point. And Ab Initio is keeping up with the technological advancements like Big Data and Hadoop by providing fair interfacing mechanisms and is constantly improving. Another important thing that I see today is that the number of people with Ab Initio as a skill have increased quite a lot from past which is another good sign. Being said that, companies who are looking for a single-stop solution and are not short on cash will more than often go for Ab Initio. It will and should continue to flourish in coming times.    Embed Quote
