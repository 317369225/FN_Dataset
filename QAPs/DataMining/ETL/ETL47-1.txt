★How hot and wide is the scope of opportunities with hadoop/BigData for an Informatica (ETL) developer?I am an Informatica (ETL) developer, I want to wet my feet in haddop/BigData. I need to know what opportunities (learning and working) are available where my experience with Informatica,SQL/plsql, AND knowledge of datawarehouse concepts can be usefull?
The sql/plsql is probably more valuable than the powercenter.  Someone has to pull all that data.  There is a lot more to "big data" than etl though. There is statistics, data visualization and creating meaning from all the analysis    Embed Quote
