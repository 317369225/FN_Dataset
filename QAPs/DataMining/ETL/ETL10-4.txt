★How useful is ETL learning material for kids given the high cost?We have been sold the idea by an ETL sales person. At the face of it we like it but on searching for reviews online, we have not got any useful reviews. Not sure how to evaluate this material for purchase decision.
Today's Education has become a very big business opportunity for many, not to forget, there are some serious wolves out there to drain you out of money and yet just give some polished or colored materials which are not helpful. I do agree that there are some very genuine, focused and very responsible institutions and schools but yet are all the children in it?? Not all are!!

In the case for ETL learning material, there is a very good response and feedback from the people I know and who have tested it. Hence, I believe that ETL material would be useful to children.    Embed Quote
