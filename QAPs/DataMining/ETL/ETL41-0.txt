What you're referring to is EAI - Enterprise Application Integration.  Think of tools like Fusion Middleware and Tibco. It does seem like the concepts of ETL and EAI are similar, but there are some clear delineation's on when one should be used over the other.  This article does a pretty good job of pointing it out in detail: EAI or ETL: When you should choose one over the other The TL;DR version: ETL is used for batch processing and transforming data from multiple sources into a single platform.  The transformation can happen across multiple rows of data (IE sorting, aggregating, joining).  EAI is used for real-time integration and performing data transformation on single rows of data at a time.  Use ETL when your problem is with large volumes of data and use EAI when your data problem is with large number of small transactions.    Embed Quote
