★Business Intelligence: ETL : which is the best open source ETL tool to start working ? specially if we are kick starting a BI project
I think Pentaho and Talend are the best open source ETL. Both have been around for at least 7 years and have gone through enough releases to shake out a lot bugs and issues. I like Pentaho because it is very light weight - The community edition of PDI Kettle has lots of nice features. However, a fair criticism of Pentaho is that its components (steps) are not uniform in the way their GUI and presentation. Also, the design tool can be a bit quirky but that is no different from using Eclipse based open source tools including BIRT and Talend.   There is an excellent book by the creator of Pentaho called Pentaho Kettle Solutions - Building Open Source ETL Solutions available on Amazon. This is an excellent primer on ETL as well the tool.   Currently I am doing a data migration from a SQL server proprietary accounting system to NetSuite cloud based accounting system. I have been using Pentaho Community edition, Tortoise SVN source code control, and Navicat. This combination seems to be working quite well and supported rapid development.   STAY AWAY from scripting languages like PERL. Using an ETL tool with a visual presentation and a supporting testing and scheduling framework is key. Pentaho is self documenting - you not need to pore over tons of PERL code.    Embed Quote
