★ETL Concepts: What are the advantages of using Informatica as an ETL tool over Teradata?As far as I know Teradata is a more expensive solution, as compared to Informatica, but I was wondering about other advantages from an operational standpoint.
Teradata is a database. It stores data and allows faster retrieval from large amount of data. It has been designed to take care of large amount of data. Informatica Powercenter is an integeration/ETL tool. It gets data from different sources (flat files or database etc) and loads that data into different targets (flat files or database etc). It does not store anything at all. It just moves data from one place to another. It has been designed to be able to talk to different kinds of databases and change data formats accordingly. Generally you need to transform data while moving it and Informatica can do that. In a data warehousing environment you focus on developing a single point of truth i.e a single point where all the data is placed in integrated form. So there are two things 1. You need to get data from different sources . (informatica) 2. You need a final place to store all data taken from different places (Teradata) 3. You need to be able to see the consilidated data by querying it (Teradata) If you are NOT using Teradata, you end up using Oracle or SQ server etc or anyother database If you are NOT using informatica, you end up using PL SQL, Datastage, Abinitio or any other ETL tool. Informatica is like a transportation vehicle. It moves things around. Teradata is like a warehouse . It stores things.    Embed Quote
