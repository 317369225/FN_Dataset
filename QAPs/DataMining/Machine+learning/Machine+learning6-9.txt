★What are the best graduate schools for studying machine learning?
CMU, Stanford, MIT, University of Cambridge are definitely some of the best places for Machine Learning. For people interested in NLP and machine learning, there are several good schools like Univ. of Colorado (CS), Johns Hopkins, UMASS Amherst apart from the above mentioned schools. I feel one should look beyond the rankings to measure a school's research potential, US news rankings are not really a true measure of the quality of research in the 'lesser ranked' schools.    Embed Quote
