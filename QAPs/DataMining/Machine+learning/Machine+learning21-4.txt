★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
ML theory: Christopher Bishop - Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning.   First time I picked this book up it was pretty daunting, but once you  get a bit of the maths under your belt, I found that it presents clearer  explanations than other texts.  I found it really clearly laid out and  it seems to progress pretty well.  It also covers a lot of stuff.  Linear Algebra: Gilbert Strang videos on linear algebra are excellent, so are the Khan academy ones.  The Gilbert Strang book doesn't seem to get particularly great reviews.  On the basis of reviews, I picked up a copy of Howard Anton's Elementary Linear Algebra which seems to be very highly regrarded.  I would recommend it. I also have David Poole: A Modern Introduction...which feels a bit more......modern than Anton and I have tended to use it more.  Doesn't seem to be a particularly well known book on t'internet, but I find it very clear (more so than Anton). If you want to practise, then there's Schaums Outline of Theory and Problems of Linear Algebra.  (Good for practising but insufficient as a standalone text to the subject) If you have the luxury of having some time before starting on Machine Learning, I would suggest really focusing on linear algebra in a very hands on way (working through structured examples) and getting a good understanding of orthogonality, vector spaces, eigenvectors, transformations.  From my experience, trying to learn the maths at the same time as learning Machine Learning was overwhelming and I would have got a lot more out of ML lectures if I had already got a grasp of the maths.    Embed Quote
