★What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
You need the ability to understand the problem space, create hypotheses that are based on observed patterns and develop features that capture the interactions that the human brain can assess. This is a less mentioned but increasingly important problem, especially when dealing with small, noisy data sets or ones that involve and adversary.    Embed Quote
