★How does Google use machine learning?With Google using ML in plenty of places, what are the least known places where google uses these techinques?
You know how sometimes if you make a typo while searching on Google, Google gives you this message: "Did you mean _____"? That's the result of one of Google's machine learning algorithms. The algorithm detects what searches you make a couple seconds after making one search. For example, suppose you were searching for "Quora" on Google but accidentally said "Qura". After the search, you'd probably realize you typed it wrong and you'd go back and search for "Quora" a couple of seconds later. The algorithm would recognize that you searched for something a couple seconds after searching something else, and it would keep that in mind for future users who make a similar typing mistake.    Embed Quote
