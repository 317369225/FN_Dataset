★What are the best graduate schools for studying machine learning?
If we don't restrict ourselves to US universities, there are several outstanding places in Europe. From the top of my head I'd list Aalto university near Helsinki in Finland, as they had and still have several expert centres on various machine learning technologies. A vibrant community seems to have grown up in the university that Kohonen (of Kohonen networks fame) taught in. They also seem to be Europe's leading university on time series prediction.   There's also NTNU in Norway that's eminent on search algorithms and image recognition while Lancaster in Britain has good people on machine learning applied to the retail industry and logistics. If you find the novel reservoir networks fascinating, the place to go is german universities with ties to the fraunhofer institute.    Embed Quote
