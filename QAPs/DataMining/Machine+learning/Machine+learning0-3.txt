★How do I learn machine learning?
Andrew Ng (Stanford professor) has a full set of course lectures on YouTube: A link to the full playlist is here: http://www.youtube.com/view_play... Edit: Why?  It's a good introduction, taught with the right amount of mathematical rigor for somebody who really wants to get into machine learning (some other online courses are pretty watered down).  Also, it's the first course on machine learning that I took, and it got me excited enough to propel me down a path that led to a Ph.D. in the subject.  So maybe it will work out equally well for you.    Embed Quote
