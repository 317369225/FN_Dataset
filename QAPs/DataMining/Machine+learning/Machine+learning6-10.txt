★What are the best graduate schools for studying machine learning?
If you're willing to trust US News, you can see the top universities for AI [1] and Systems [2] since "Machine Learning" (vaguely defined) is a combination of both. Interestingly the top four are the same, but in different permutations. For AI, they are 1. MIT 2. CMU 3. Stanford and 4. UC Berkeley. For Systems they are 1. UC Berkeley 2. MIT 3. CMU 4. Stanford. Seriously, all four are great schools and you won't go wrong with any of them. So pick the school that has the most interesting professors/projects and fitting environment for you.
