★What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?
Pete and Josh did a great job covering 90% of my interview process, but I figured I'd add one more thought (3 months late to the party): If time isn't an issue and you have some flexibility, I like the "homework assignment" approach: After the standard interview (assuming mutual interest), shove some real data at the candidate, tell them to take some time, implement an algorithm or two, play around, and report back. Speaking to Pete's point, the problems I tend to deal with are less well-known / more open-ended than the Netflix prize, so I can't really ask candidates how they would implement X during the interview. Also, I tend to find a _huge_ gap between solutions that get white-boarded and solutions that actually get implemented. This is mainly because implementing a machine learning solution is itself a learning process--you get feedback from the data and tailor your approach, have new insights, etc--this is another form of "adaptability" that I want to measure in my job candidates. In addition to gauging flexibility and general skill level, homework problems are also a great way to gauge the candidate's drive and interest in the problem, and introduce them to the kinds of work you're doing. Two-way street = win-win. * Hat tip to Mike Driscoll and 3 different graduate advisors for getting me hooked on this approach.    Embed Quote
