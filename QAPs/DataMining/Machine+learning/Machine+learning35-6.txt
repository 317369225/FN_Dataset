★What are the best open source machine learning libraries written in Python?
I recommend checking out the python library ramp, and not just because I wrote it!

It's easy to hook in models and algorithms from the other libraries already mentioned here. If you want an introduction, here's a blog post I wrote: Getting started with Ramp: Detecting insults.    Embed Quote
