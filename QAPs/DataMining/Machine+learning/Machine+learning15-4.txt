★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
I personally find that prediction and classification is far more emphasized in machine learning than statistics. Also statisticians care more about quantifying uncertainty (coverage) than the average machine learner. Here are some thoughts by famous statisticians who are also active in machine learning. According to Michael Jordan, According to Larry Wasserman (Statistics Versus Machine Learning), The short answer is that there is no difference. Statistics emphasizes formal statistical inference (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, optimal estimators) in low dimensional problems. Machine Learning emphasizes high dimensional prediction problems. But this is a gross over-simplification. I also really find his table of equivalent terminology between the two fields useful. You will find a huge degree of overlap between the two areas.
