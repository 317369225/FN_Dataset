★Is machine learning a dead end for startups?
Let me answer your question by asking you another related question: are there ways to make money from machine learning? If you can answer that question with a "yes" then congratulations you have the potential to be a successful startup. At the end of the day, a startup is about business; not technology. As a startup, you would make money from the application of machine learning algorithms; not the machine learning algorithms themselves.    Embed Quote
