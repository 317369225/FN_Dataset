★What are the limits of machine learning?
I guess first off there are many different applications of machine learning.  There are detection problems, classification problems, characterization problem and many more.  The limitations of machine learning depend on which type of problem you're trying to solve.  Having said that... Limitations come about due to two factors: [1] Data [2] Computation If you don't have sufficient data you can't hope to train a system to solve a given problem or type of problem on new unseen data.  If new unseen data doesn't look anything like your training data you are in trouble.  You might have tremendous amount of data but you will be in trouble if it doesn't look anything like new data you hope to apply your algorithm to.  For example, in text processing new words can enter the vocabulary at any time.  Terabytes of text from previous years might not help you deal with a word you've never seen during training.  The impact of unseen words depends on what you're algorithm is trying to do. It's also possible that plenty of data is available, but the number of parameters required to create a model capable of solving the problem you want to solve is beyond the capability of current computing hardware.  In the extreme, you might need a model the size of your training data (non parametric techniques like the KNN classifier are an example).    Embed Quote
