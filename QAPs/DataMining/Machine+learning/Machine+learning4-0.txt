★How does one start writing practical machine learning programs?
Although I wouldn't consider myself "good" just yet, here are some resources I have found useful in getting up to speed. Books: Machine Learning for Hackers: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product... Programming Collective Intelligence: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product... Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product... Videos / Courses: Udacity: Artificial Intelligence (CS373) - Programming A Robotic Car http://www.udacity.com/overview/... Stanford: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng https://www.coursera.org/course/ml Extra Resources: Meetups: Find a local big data / ML meetup. http://meetup.com/ Podcasts: I like All Things Hadoop http://allthingshadoop.com/podcast/ Talks: Hilary Mason's on "Everything You Need to know about Machine Learning in 30 Minutes or Less" is a great overview. http://vimeo.com/43547079 Alternatively, following this simple chart should get you going as well:    Embed Quote
