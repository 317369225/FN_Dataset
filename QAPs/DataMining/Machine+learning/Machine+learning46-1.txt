★What is the relationship between machine learning and the scientific method?Scientists follow "the scientific method" to arrive at conclusions about data, although there has been much debate about what exactly this method consists of. Machine learning also arrives at (tentative) conclusions about data - is there a relationship between the two?
An important point is that machine learning can be used to automatically discover and refine hypotheses, and determine which variables are important.  Instead of using a predefined mathematical model, some techniques will  allow you to construct new hypotheses based on the data itself.  This is  especially useful when dealing with large high dimensional datasets.   The scientific method still applies: if the system you construct using  machine learning cannot be reproduced or is not predictive and does not  generalize to new datasets, then it fails and you go back to square one. See this interview for more on some of the issues encountered with  hypothesis testing on large datasets:  http://sciencewatch.com/inter/au... Machine learning has a lot of overlap with statistics, and both are used  in application of the scientific method.
