★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
There are some production-quality clinical diagnostic systems but their use is limited. This is because human biology is incredibly messy and moving to the clinic adds another magnitude or two of complexity. And of course, the cost of errors in a clinical setting is significant. The learning problem is much harder than most people realize. I had essentially the same thoughts as you about seven years ago. I was a bright-eyed CS graduate so I joined a PhD program in Bioinformatics with the intention of using data/algorithms to "solve the biology problem". I was being incredibly naive and cocky but so were most of the CS professors. I began with exactly the method you suggested: learning Bayesian networks from data, except that I was trying to understand the network of gene regulation rather than disease-symptoms. This is definitely not a solved problem. To briefly give you an idea of the scope of the problem, the number of Bayesian networks with just 25 variables/nodes is . As a comparison, the estimates for the number of particles in the universe range between and . Yes, we have clever heuristics and sampling approaches but, IMO, it's not yet ready for primetime. My conclusion has been that we will need (1) much, much more data and (2) problem-specific hybrid approaches that integrate human input and machine learning. This was the focus of my dissertation but it's still a wide, open problem. I'm certain that as (1) electronic medical records and (2) personal genome sequencing becomes more common in the next decade, we will make significant gains.. but I've been thoroughly humbled by biology and am cautious in my optimism.    Embed Quote
