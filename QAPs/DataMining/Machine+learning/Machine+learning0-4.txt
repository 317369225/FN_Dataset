★How do I learn machine learning?
The textbook "Elements of Statistical Learning" has an obscene amount of material in it and is freely available in PDF form via http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ti... While more niche than general Machine Learning, I recently ripped through "Natural Image Statistics" (also downloadable at http://www.naturalimagestatistic... ).  It's a great read both for its explanations of your standard ML algo's (PCA, ICA, mixed gaussians etc) and for its real-world applications/examples in trying to understand the models used for analysis in our neural vision system.    Embed Quote
