★What is the relationship between machine learning and the scientific method?Scientists follow "the scientific method" to arrive at conclusions about data, although there has been much debate about what exactly this method consists of. Machine learning also arrives at (tentative) conclusions about data - is there a relationship between the two?
Machine learning techniques are "theories" of ways you can explain data, and these theories are formed by application of the scientific method. With machine learning, you typically start by developing a mathematical model to explain the data in the form of an equation.  This is analogous to forming a hypothesis.  You test this hypothesis by implementing an algorithm that fits your data to your equation, and then testing the predictive accuracy of the model for new data.     Embed Quote
