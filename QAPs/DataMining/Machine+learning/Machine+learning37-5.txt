★Why is machine learning used heavily for Google's ad ranking and less for their search ranking?A lot of people I've talked to at Google have told me that the ad ranking system is largely machine learning based, while search ranking is rooted in functions that are written by humans using their intuition (with some components using machine learning). What led to this difference?
Update: Using machine learning algorithms in organic search. Algorithm updates discussed here in 2011. Here they are talking about SVM classification techniques http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2... : "Singhal: You can imagine in a hyperspace a bunch of points, some points are red, some points are green, and in others there’s some mixture. Your job is to find a plane which says that most things on this side of the place are red, and most of the things on that side of the plane are the opposite of red."    Embed Quote
