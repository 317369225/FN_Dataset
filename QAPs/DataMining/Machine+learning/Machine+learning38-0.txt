★Is machine learning overrated or overhyped?
Machine Learning is Statistics in disguise. It seems to be over-rated to a lot of people because they hear about it a lot but don't really know what it is. When you are told how cool something is over and over, you have a tendency to believe it isn't that good. That's how we all are. To answer your question, I must know when something starts being called over-rated. I'm sorry I don't know that. As far I am concerned about Machine Learning, I have taken a few courses on the subject [two online and one on-campus] and I really liked all of them, especially the on edX by Professor Yaser Abu Mostafa. To see if Machine Learning is important to you at all, you should know where it is being used. You are using it completely unaware. Some of the places I can see Machine Learning right now are -- You Facebook and Quora feeds use Machine Learning to give you a personalized experience on their websites. Facebook recognizes you in a photo. It's easier to do with Machine Learning. Almost impossible with Image Processing I guess [I don't know much about Image Processing]. Recognizing the boundaries of a face might be easy to do with Image Processing but figuring out whose face it is, is Machine Learning's job I believe. All recommendation engines [Flipkart's, Amazon's] use Machine Learning to recommend products that you may potentially buy. Machine Learning is almost everywhere on the Internet but right now I can't think of it being used in the physical world [except for self-driving cars but I want something more mature]. If you know about any such application, please suggest an edit.    Embed Quote
