★What is the best machine learning algorithm?
This depends on the problem you're trying to solve. As Zulfikar Ramzan stated below, having well-sampled data with insightful features (or featured engineered to be insightful) is much better  than using any kind of specialized algorithm. 1. Linear/Logistic Regression for continuous values 2. SVM/Kernel-based Classifiers for classification problems. 3. LDA/QDA Gaussian-based classification for samples within the same distribution. 4. K-Means for Unsupervised Learning/Classification. 5. Neural Networks for prediction and classification, for specific types of classification where manipulating/weighting features can give more insight than simple classification. 6. Random Forest seems to work particularly better-than-expected when data is limited for classification/decision problems, by "bootstrapping" existing data in a sense. I've used mainly these algorithms and variants of these (out of many out there). If quickly implementing one of these (after testing different parameters) doesn't work, it is honestly unlikely that another kind of exotic algorithm will work significantly better. As always, "Garbage In, Garbage Out".    Embed Quote
