★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
Computer aided diagnosis systems are not still widely used because doctors usually can not (or in some cases don't want) to spend much time with every patient. So, as result, doctors trust their own opinions first. But that is the classical approach. Now, "more open minded doctors" are changing that by coming up with multidisciplinary approaches (it means consulting colleagues) and introducing new technologies. For instance, symptom checkers as Esagil (http://esagil.org)  or Isabel (http://isabelhealthcare.com) are simple and easy to use, specially the first one has a remarkably friendly interface. None symptom checker is designed to replace the personal care of a doctor. And this is were most people get wrong. All of them are just tools to help backing up or get information for differential diagnosis, which is up to a doctor (your doctor). I recommend to take a look at the Health technology assessment (HTA) project developed by the European Union (http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6...). This is a model of cooperative effort to bring technology closer to the medical community.    Embed Quote
