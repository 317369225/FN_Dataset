★What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?
I ask them to attack some common machine learning problems from the web domain that most machine learning researchers should have heard of.  It can be hard to bring people up to speed on your problem domain during a short interview, so I try to ask more familiar questions like "How would you approach the Netflix Prize?", "How would you generate related searches on Bing?", "How would you suggest followers on Twitter?". I ask them to describe a "Rolls Royce" solution that you could implement in 3 months, then a version you could implement in 3 weeks, and another version you could implement if you only had 3 days.  This tells you how adaptable they are and if they can come up with pragmatic approaches. Most of the things we build need to scale, so I probe them about how their approach would work on large amounts of data.  MapReduce based solutions are nice to see when appropriate. I also ask some theory questions like Josh suggested along with a few real world ML challenges we face to see if they have any creative solutions.  Since my group is very product focused and team members are self directed, I also try to get a sense of whether the candidate can come up with new products themselves that will make a difference for the company and our users. ** Another type of question I often ask involves finding or collecting your own training data.  Most applicants have only worked with toy datasets or data where the labeled examples were provided to them.  I pose a typical machine learning problem they might face, and ask how they would quickly gather additional data to help solve it.    Embed Quote
