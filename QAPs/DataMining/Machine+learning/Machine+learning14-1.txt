★★★★★It's a 10 weeks long basic course on Machine Learning, good for beginners. I might add some credentials by saying- I just completed the course (assignments and all) and landed a job offer, thanks to the concepts taught in the course.  The concepts are all very clearly explained, the instructor Andrew NG, being one of the pioneers of Machine Learning. The assignments are simple enough, but you might have to struggle a bit on the programming assignments- go for this portion only if you've sufficient time (3-4 hours) each week. You need to complete those, if you want the certificate. People who  know linear algebra and probability might find this one a bit slower paced, as it goes through several details of calculations. You can skip those parts or simply look at Caltech's offering of Learning from data (https://work.caltech.edu/telecou...) a faster option. If you're already familiar to the very basic level machine learning concepts, you could simply look at the handouts of the CS229 course (Machine Learning) taught at Stanford by the same instructor.    Embed Quote
