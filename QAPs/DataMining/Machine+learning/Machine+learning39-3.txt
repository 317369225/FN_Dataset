★What are currently the hot topics in Machine Learning research and in real applications?Currently, there are many topics in ML research which are/can be used widely in real applications. I wonder what are key topics which we should focus doing research and studying.
Transuductive and Semi-Supervised Learning is still a huge mystery See, for example, this recent paper in the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) Unbiased Generative Semi-Supervised Learning (2014) Page on jmlr.org which starts off: "Reliable semi-supervised learning, where a small amount of labelled data is complemented by a large body of unlabelled data, has been a long-standing goal of the machine learning community. However, while it seems intuitively obvious that unlabelled data can aid the learning process, in practice its performance has often been disappointing" I provide a basic introduction on my blog: Machine Learning with Missing Labels:  Transductive SVMs I myself was first introduced to this problem in the late 1990s where we tried some naive things at first Effective Operators part 2:  Simple SemiSupervised Learning Today, to tackle this problem, we would like to set up a set of open source, collaborative, data science / machine learning research projects, such as CalculatedContent/tsvm We would like in more depth at transductive / semi-supervised learning,  autoencoders and NMF based convex optimization for pre-training, music recommendations,  deep learning, etc.   ( i.e, deep learning uses pre-training on unlabeled data to learn the best features for the next layer, so we are very interested in methods like convex NMF that are also a kind of auto-encoder ) These projects are designed bona-fide scientific research projects that require collecting our own data and designing experiments that systematically test specific theoretical ideas.    Unlike Kaggle, which is isolated, competitive, and predefined, these projects are meant to be shared, collaborative, and require outside and independent thinking to frame and tackle the problems Each project involves 1.  mathematical understanding and advancement 2.  data science experiments 3.  developing some code I am very open to having collaborators interested in doing novel data science research.  To get involved, join the google group TSVM Google Groups    Embed Quote
