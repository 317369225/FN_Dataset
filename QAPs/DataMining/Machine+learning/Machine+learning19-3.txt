★What were the Top 10 problems in Machine Learning for 2013?
Having worked in ML for some time, I'd say that the biggest improvements will come from the data side (rather than the model).  Finding a way to generate large amounts of data at scale; cleaning training data and classifying/rating crowd sourced judges; automatic data update/downdate algorithms; and the like.  For any of the hard problems, the difference between an off the shelf regression model and a state of the art model is trivial compared to the difference high quality data can yield. Crowdsourcing is cheap and comes in volume, but the quality is shaky.  On the flip side, outside of the Googles and Microsofts of the world, very few people can afford high quality data at scale.  It's a pain point that needs innovation.    Embed Quote
