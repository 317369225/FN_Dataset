★How do I learn machine learning?
Start with the new ISL book "An Introduction to Statical Learning" http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ Very approachable. Do the hands-on lab at the end of each chapter. Michael has done a good job in listing the most relevant materials. But the order is important. MMonk's materials are very good, but dense. My suggested order: [1] ISL Class Stanford/Hastie/Tibsharani at their best - Statistical Learning [2] Prof. Pedro Domingo Coursera [2-Alternate] Prof. Andrew Ng, Coursera [3] Prof. Abu Mostafa, CaltechX: CS1156x: Learning From Data [4] Then mathematicalmonk's channel As everyone was suggesting, hands-on work is essential. Keep R-Studio or iPython in the background and work on data problems when you have a moment. Kaggle Competitions are interesting. My slides from OSCON data The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Kaggle I will post my slides from the pycon tutorial Data Wrangling for Kaggle Data Science Competitions - An etude[1] data mining, inference, and prediction. 2nd Edition.    Embed Quote
