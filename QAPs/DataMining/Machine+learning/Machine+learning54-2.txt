★What are the hot topics in machine learning in 2014?
In addition to deep learning, one possibly interesting thing to keep track of is adversarial machine learning. I attended a talk by Dr. Robert Grossman (which was scheduled just before my talk at Strata NY 2013). He talked about the same and it is available here: Adversarial Analytics - 2013 Strata & Hadoop World Talk. Why is this important? Lot of machine learning systems are being used to keep track of users and their behavior. Consequently, an adversary can influence the learning behavior by feeding in inappropriate data or skewed data or just plain manipulated data. How can systems protect themselves from such attacks? Adversarial analytis attempts to answer such questions.    Embed Quote
