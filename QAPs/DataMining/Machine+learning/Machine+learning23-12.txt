★What is the best machine learning algorithm?
The best machine learning method depends on the target observation space. There is not such thing as a universally best method. Neural networks do well on images and such problems while regression does well on credit score kind of problems. At a higher level the best machine learning method for a problem depends on three things: 1. The problem space.i.e the domain. 2. The sample size available for the problem - N 3. The signal to noise ratio. A high signal to noise ratio favors regression type methods and a low one favors more complicated methods like Tree's etc    Embed Quote
