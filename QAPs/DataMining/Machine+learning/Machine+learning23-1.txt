★What is the best machine learning algorithm?
You did not even specify the problem you are trying to solve: classification, regression, clustering, reinforcement learning, learning to rank... Even for any given problem there is no one best algorithm, it depends on the size of your dataset, how many dimensions, if your dataset is sparse and how your data is structured in general. There is also a tradeoff been classification time, training time and accuracy. This chart from the scikit-learn documentation gives a good overview: The only thing that I would like to add, which is missing from this chart are neural networks. They are mostly interesting for regression and classification if you have lots of data with hidden structure, in other words when the relationship between features and target variable is non-linear. People usually use n-fold cross-validation to figure out which algorithm and parameters work best for the problem at hand. A library like scikit-learn or package like R can be helpful here, because you just change one line of code and use a different algorithm. To squeeze out the last bit of performance you can also do ensembles of different algorithms.    Embed Quote
