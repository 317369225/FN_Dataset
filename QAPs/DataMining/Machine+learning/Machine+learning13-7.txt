★How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people?
Data Mining In shopping marts Suppose you want to find out the best arrangement of items that will maximize your sales? How do you do it? This is done using a very simple technique of data mining called association rule mining. Example Suppose you notice that out of the 1000 purchasers who bought beer, about 700 of them also bought diapers. Now As absurd it may sound, this suggests that there is an association between beers and diapers purchase. So you put them in the same section in the shopping malls and this will increase your sales of both. This is data mining in action.    Embed Quote
