★What are some really interesting machine learning projects for beginners?Preferably written using python. Any other languages is welcomed though :) Please do mention if you are using third party library or any reference regarding the project etc
before starting projects, i suggest you implement some basic machine learning algorithims yourself first.  that will give you 10000 pounds of intuition, which you will surely need when things don't go like you expect them to.  here are some good ones: 1) k nearest neighbors with a few different distance measures.  (euclidean and L1 distance.) 2) quadratic discriminant analysis - this is a fancy name for just fitting a gaussian to each class.  see what regularizing the covariance matrix does to your classification accuracy when the input data is high dimensional (d > 25).  (ps, regularizing is just adding a scaled identity matrix to your maximum likelihood estimate.) 3) multinomial naive bayes for categorical data. 4) ridge regression.  closed-form solutions!  this is easiest to do for 2-class problems. 5) a decision tree.  this is relatively advanced!  also, if you manage to do this, try for a random forest.  ooooo, fancy. 6) a linear SVM.  this is even more advanced.  it's kind of a headache, so don't try without a tutorial.    Embed Quote
