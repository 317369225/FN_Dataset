★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
I took both Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class and Sebastian Thrun's AI class. I liked the Machine Learning one more - even though AI class touches more topics, but it does it in a haphazard way. ML class is narrower, but more practical and focused. It helps to keep a link to Khan's linear algebra videos handy. ML class is running right now - https://www.coursera.org/course/ml Linear algebra: http://www.khanacademy.org/math/...
