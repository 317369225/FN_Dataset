★What are the best blogs about data?Looking for insightful reporting about how businesses are using data, as well as the techie stuff.
Nice -- I've been looking for something like this, but it's a little overwhelming!  If we trust the "wisdom of this crowd," perhaps a vote is in order?  I frequency sorted the links to identify 19 repeat offenders:       3 http://hunch.net       2 http://atbrox.com       2 http://blog.data-miners.com       2 http://blog.okcupid.com       2 http://blog.sematext.com       2 http://blog.smola.org       2 http://dataspora.com/blog       2 http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com       2 http://flowingdata.com       2 http://glinden.blogspot.com       2 http://measuringmeasures.com       2 http://sna-projects.com/blog       2 http://tdunning.blogspot.com       2 http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog       2 http://www.datawrangling.com       2 http://www.drewconway.com/zia       2 http://www.fivethirtyeight.com       2 http://www.hilarymason.com       2 http://www.predictivesignals.com This was computed with the following command (which I'm sure could be optimized): curl --compressed -sLN --url 'http://rest.extractiv.com/extrac... | grep "type\": \"HTTP" -B1 | grep -oi "http://.*" | awk '{ print tolower($0) }' | sed -e "s/\/\?\",//" | sort | uniq -cd | sort -rn * Subdomain normalizations only made a slight difference Not on the list was http://blog.extractiv.com :)    Embed Quote
