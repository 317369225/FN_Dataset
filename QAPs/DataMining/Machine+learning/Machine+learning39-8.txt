★What are currently the hot topics in Machine Learning research and in real applications?Currently, there are many topics in ML research which are/can be used widely in real applications. I wonder what are key topics which we should focus doing research and studying.
I'll stick to just one: Combining machine learning and logic. Probabilistic logic, automated probabilistic inference, and other ideas take a statistical approach to learning certain types of logical relations (e.g. x father of y, y father of z -> x father of z can be learned just by looking at text). It's tough though, and more complex relations are still hard to extract automatically at a large scale. But it's our best tool for finding softer logical relations, that are sometimes incomplete or contradicted.    Embed Quote
