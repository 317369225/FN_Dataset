★What are the must read papers on data mining and machine learning?
These papers on boolean function learning: Exact Learning Boolean Functions via the Monotone Theory Learning Boolean Functions Incrementally The above works are among the first successes in the area of learning boolean functions. The learning model used by them is very interesting : There is the learning algorithm and there is an oracle. The algorithm poses questions/queries to the oracle. The oracle, based on some partial knowledge of the target function or some of it's properties, replies with answers and counter-examples. These answers are then used by the algorithm to decipher the boolean function. It's like playing a guessing game.    Embed Quote
