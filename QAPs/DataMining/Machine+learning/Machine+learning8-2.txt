★What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?
This applies to many technical interviews, but I like to ask people if they have a favorite algorithm. If they don't, then they are probably not what you were looking for. If they do, ask them to explain how it works to you. Now, depending on your level of technical knowledge about the field, you can get into great depth from this starting point. But even if your knowledge is marginal, the ability to explain a complex algorithm is a great indication of both their communication skills and their understanding of the field. Failing that, ask them to explain the kernel trick.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ker... As for ML specifics, ask about what they've done in the past. What tools they use. Are they someone who patches stuff together using Weka, or do they hand roll their own? If your position is in any way like most data jobs, ask them about data cleaning, scaling and all the other painful things that most ML folks have to deal with before they get to ML. Are they comfortable doing the cleaning themselves, or do they only have experience in getting data in a pretty format? Beyond that, it comes down to the particular job that you would like them to do. Talk about the goals that you have and ask them to explain how they would tackle them.    Embed Quote
