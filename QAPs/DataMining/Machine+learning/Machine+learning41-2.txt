★What is the best way to study machine learning?
Stanford offers not only a Machine Learning course, but also an artificial intelligence course online via http://see.stanford.edu/see/cour... (They can also be found in iTunesU).  They're all free of course; I wouldn't recommend you pay for anything!  I should add that I would take a course / refresher in linear algebra before taking these courses if it's been a while since you've worked with matrices. Here is a link to a free introductory machine learning text from 05: http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/... and another from 97: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlboo... My suggestion would be to do a linear algebra course first, then the machine learning class from Stanford, then the artificial intelligence.  At that point, I would find a problem that I'm interested in and try to apply machine learning concepts to solve it.  Once you're at that point, use the texts as resources.    Embed Quote
