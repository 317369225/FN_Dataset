★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
There is a lot of overlap between the two, but they are not identical.  For instance, the error analysis in a scientific calculation (e.g. predicting the orbit of a satellite) is a part of statistics but it has nothing to do with machine learning.  Likewise, an adaptive learning algorithm, for instance that improves the board evaluation in a chess program could be considered part of machine learning, but definitely not statistics.  On the other hand, many of the most common aspects of machine learning such as neural networks, clustering and statistical classification are definitely in common with statistics.    Embed Quote
