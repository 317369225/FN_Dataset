★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
There are a variety of reasons. In most startups, there is a significant amount of market risk, but low technological risk. Even this medium risk level is enough to scare away most potential co-founders who have the appropriate technological qualifications.  The risk profile of an NLP+ML company is particularly high, because  there is technological risk on top of the market risk. That makes it particularly difficult to raise sufficient capital to fund the intial R&D that de-risks the desired technology. So the founders must operate at a loss for even longer. The risk profile of an NLP+ML practitioners is especially low, given that they have spent maybe five to ten years in a stable, low-risk environment like academia or a well-capitalized company. One solution would be improved funding and business structures for speculative but market-driven researchy ventures. Garrett Lisi proposes a Science Hostel (http://sifter.org/~aglisi/sh.html). I propose an NLP+ML incubator / hedge fund, in which a small percentage ownership in all IP goes into a pool that is shared by all participants and investors. This sufficiently de-risks the process of starting your company, but also has a high potential upside.    Embed Quote
