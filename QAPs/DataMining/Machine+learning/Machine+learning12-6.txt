★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
TellApart, the Greylock-backed startup I work for, is actively hiring (and crushing it!).  If you want to flex your machine learning chops to solve major problems for big name clients and drive serious revenue, definitely give us a shout. Data mining and ML are core to our business of "telling apart" valuable customers as part of a data platform for large online retailers.  We've had tremendous success with the first application that we've built on top of the platform, Transactional Retargeting, for major e-commerce players like Diapers.com and CafePress.  And, as they say, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
