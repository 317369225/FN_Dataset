★What are the best machine-learning research groups in Europe?
The Swiss AI Lab IDSIA situated near Lugano and headed by Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber.  In the last 5 years they have had several successes in different machine learning competitions (information shamelessly taken from Deep Learning Blog):- 22 Sept 2013: Deep neural network of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA wins  MICCAI 2013 Grand Challenge on Mitosis Detection (important for cancer  prognosis etc). For more information: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/deeplearningwinsMICCAIgrandchallenge.html 1 Sept 2013: Deep neural network of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA is the  best artificial offline recogniser of Chinese characters from the ICDAR  2013 competition (3755 classes), approaching human performance. For more  information: [1309.0261] Multi-Column Deep Neural Networks for Offline Handwritten Chinese Character Classification 2012: Deep neural network of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA wins brain image  segmentation contest (relevant for the huge brain projects in EU and  US). More information: Deep Learning Wins Brain Segmentation Contest 2012: 8th international pattern recognition contest won since 2009 by deep learning neural networks, http://www.kurzweilai.net/how-bio-inspired-deep-learning-keeps-winning-competitions 2011: Superhuman visual pattern recognition through deep learning.
