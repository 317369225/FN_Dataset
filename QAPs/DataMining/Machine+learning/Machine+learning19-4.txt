★What were the Top 10 problems in Machine Learning for 2013?
1. Deep learning with Neural Nets (The most attractive quality of these techniques is that they can perform well without any external hand-designed resources or time-intensive feature engineering) 2. Active Learning (especially given the power of the web and social data, machine learning systems need to get smart about actively seeking data to improve model deficiencies) 3. On-line Learning (the idea is as soon as one makes a prediction, the prediction is validated, and the model improves) 4. Machine learning for gesture recognition (being able to recognize hand gestures, eye movements, like minority report will be key drivers of the next revolution in HCI, especially in the world of new devises such as Google Glasses and smart TV's)    Embed Quote
