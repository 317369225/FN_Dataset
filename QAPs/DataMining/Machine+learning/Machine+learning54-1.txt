★What are the hot topics in machine learning in 2014?
1.) Deep learning is getting huge, this is basically the idea of programming neural nets to learn deeper layers of abstraction, IE when an apple is seen: this is a red glob of pixels this red glob represents an apple this apple represents a living plant certain animals can eat plants for sustenance apples taste good 2.) Also, hardware is becoming an important factor. Particularly, Quantum computers seem to hold some promise in allowing computers to perform at the necessary speeds to allow for massive boosts in the abilities of AI. 3.) Lastly, robotics is getting huge. In particular, google is acquiring a lot of robotics companies where their robots can operate on many different terrains, and perform many complex tasks on their own.    Embed Quote
