★Why isn't supervised machine learning more automated?
The picture is more complicated because 1. data comes in many different forms, but more importantly 2. there are usually many other surrounding objectives you may or may not care about, other than accuracy. Many of these approaches (SVMs, Neural Nets, Random Forests, PGMs, etc.) have their pros and cons that depend on many variables, for example: - How much data do you have w.r.t. dimensionality? - How "easy" do you suspect your problem to be? Is it likely linearly separable? Equivalently, how good are your features? - Do you have many mixed data? Missing data? Sparse data? Categorical/Binary data mixed in? - Do you need training to be very fast? - Do you need testing to be very fast on new out of sample data? - Do you need a space-efficient implementation? - Would you prefer a fixed-size (parametric) model, or is non-parametric ok? - Do you want to train the algorithm online as the data "streams" in? - Do you want confidences or probabilities about your final predictions? - How interpretable do you want your final model to be? etc. etc. etc. I do agree that for smaller datasets where one does not care much about efficiency, one can in principle automate a large portion of this process. I think Weka is closest to something you have in mind.    Embed Quote
