★What are some good learning projects to teach oneself about machine learning?This is a follow-up question to How do I learn machine learning?.
"Programming collective Intelligence" http://amzn.com/0596529325 (as mentioned by Stelios) is a great book! It was very easy for me to understand and requires minimal knowledge of programming and database. I highly recommend it. It is in python but you don't need to be a python expert to understand. The best way to learn is to code up some of the examples in the book using the language that you are most comfortable with.    Embed Quote
