★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
All of the science/programming/research aside. A lot of what holds technology back in healthcare is the human nature of the profession.  Technology may streamline the process, but people want the attention of a healthcare professional.  Sick people want a physician to physically assess them, make them feel comfortable, and diagnose them. Sick people want a nurse to help them and explain their meds etc.  Also, patients judge the quality of care by hospitality management standards.  I think ML will expand tremendously, but the benefits of it are mostly on the internal system.  Patients may have better outcomes but what they really care about, as inpatients, is feeling good about getting better.  I am eager to see what consumers feel about these systems once they are used broadly in academic medical centers.    Embed Quote
