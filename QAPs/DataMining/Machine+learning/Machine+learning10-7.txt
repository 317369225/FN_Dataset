★Python for Machine Learning?
Python 3 is still in adoption phase,while Python 2 has been there for sometime. It is still  sometime before Python 3 becomes the popular version. In my view you can get started with Python 2 . Python 3 is not really that different from Python 2. I liked the Google's Python Class class best among all introductory material. You can also use Dive Into Python book . As for basics of Machine Learning in Python . You can start with Tutorial: scikit-learn - Machine Learning in Python. Also you can read Stephen Marsland. Besides there is a good collection of hands on books on Packt's websites, if you just want to flex your fingers on numpy,scipy etc.    Embed Quote
