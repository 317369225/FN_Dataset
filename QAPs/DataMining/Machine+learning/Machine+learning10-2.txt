★Python for Machine Learning?
I don't know your purpose. If you want to implement your own "ML alghorithms" prototypes, then you should use numpy/scipy as suggested  in other answers. However remember, that there is a difference betwen "use" and "effective use". For example: Speeding up Python (NumPy, Cython, and Weave) There are also PyOpenCL, gnumpy and other stuff for making computations on graphical card. What's more important - you should have a knowledge in ML (so stress from programming to math ...). Another story is to use scikit-learn and others (text processing - NLTK, computer vision - opencv python binding) to perform some tasks. Personally, I'm interested (at now) in PYMC (Bayesian statistical models).    Embed Quote
