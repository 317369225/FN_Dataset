★What were the Top 10 problems in Machine Learning for 2013?
Scientists are some what successful in helping blind peoples learn 'seeing' images by analyzing and learning sound. I think machine learning would be helpful if we could integrate it here. Having machine learn audios and output some signals for brain that simulate the picture corresponding to the audio. Like if somebody said apple, a blind person would 'see' an apple.
