★Why isn't supervised machine learning more automated?
In the next few years, I believe we will see a lot more automated or user-friendly machine learning tools. For example, UC Berkeley scientists are working on a "frontend" to the Big Data analytics stack named "ML Optimizer" that will automate model selection and parameter tuning. See this link: MLbase. On the other hand, there are also more and more applications that help data scientists with the most common task of data cleaning and feature extraction. These tools are using machine learning techniques themselves to identify and find out how to handle missing or corrupt data and give clues about which variables will probably be useful features for fitting a model.    Embed Quote
