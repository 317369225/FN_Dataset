★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
Insieve Technologies (Insieve: Home), in Bangalore. We are doing http://pugmarks.me, and an upcoming product for content strategy. Everyday, we interact with streams of information. Streams from friends, colleagues, our own product, competing products, thought leaders, publishers, and many more. These streams are dear to us. We are hooked. We ought to have better ways of interacting with these streams of information. We call this multi-stream retrieval. These are example of questions we'd like to help answer: 1) Tell me all the places visited by my friends this year. 2) Look at Sony’s Android product line, and then Samsung’s Android product line. Whats common in their feature evolution, and whats different? 3) What are the top interests among people who work at Intel? 4) What industries and sectors get the most attention from the VCs of India? 5) Whats similar between what I read yesterday, and what I am reading today? 6) Now that I am looking at this resume, what have I read in the recent past that may be interesting to him? To answer these questions we need to build information retrieval systems almost ground up - differently. You'll find us working on many aspects of anticipatory computing, context engines, topic modeling, stream-based indexes, theme detection, exploratory search, data visualization, etc. We are excited, and if you are as excited as us, we'd love to hear from you! There's some more information on our blog. Thoughts and Pugmarks    Embed Quote
