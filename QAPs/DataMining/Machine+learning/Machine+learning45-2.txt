★What are some good learning projects to teach oneself about machine learning?This is a follow-up question to How do I learn machine learning?.
I have spent a lot of time trying to find good resources, and I was surprised to find these set of lectures to be awesome for learning some of the core concepts (Naive Bayes, SVMs, Clustering, PCA, etc.): http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~girola... Code/Data is provided in MATLAB scripts Also, Bishop's book is available for download (somewhere, do not have the link though), and his data sets are on the website: http://research.microsoft.com/en... So you could try implementing the algorithms from scratch and then trying to arrive at the same results.    Embed Quote
