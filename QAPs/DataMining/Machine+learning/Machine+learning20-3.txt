★What are the must read papers on data mining and machine learning?
I tried to avoid already cited material. I added some hardware links for the interested. Supervised and Unsupervised: Arthur Dempster's Paper wherein the EM Algorithm is introduced. You can get it from MIT and other sites for free. http://www.jstor.org/discover/10... Information Retrieval: Nevill-Manning, C.G.; Witten, I.H. (1997). "Identifying Hierarchical Structure in Sequences: A linear-time algorithm". A linear-time algorithm Unsupervised Learning: Coates, A.,  Lee, H. and Ng,A . "An Analysis of Single Layer Networks in Unsupervised Learning." AISTATS 14, 2011 http://cs.stanford.edu/people/an... Generative Models: Applied to Topic Models. Blei, D.M.; Lafferty, J.D. (2009) Topic Models.  http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ble... Hardware: Just because it's good for us to have a notion of what is likely to affect DM and ML. https://www.parallella.org/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW...    Embed Quote
