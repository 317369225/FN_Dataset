★What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?
Machine learning is more focused on algorithm/modeling, and it is based heavily on probability and numerical optimization. So besides asking hand-waving questions, derivations of the simplest forms of the ML algorithms should be asked.   For example, if you want to hire someone claimed to know recommender systems, definitely ask him/her to explain PLSI and SVD models in details on a whiteboard. If time allows, you can bring up a recent paper (clever but easy to read, e.g. a KKDCup report with light math), and ask the interviewee to read and review the method in it, from various aspects such as time complexity, implementation difficulty, possible improvements, etc.   This style of interview is similar to that in interviewing programmers, where they require writing working code to solve data structure/algorithm problems. Obviously FB or MS employees don't solve simple problems in their work, but such problems test the core skills.    Embed Quote
