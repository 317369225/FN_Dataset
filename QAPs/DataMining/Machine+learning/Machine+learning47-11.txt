★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
Debo's point regarding the "impedance mismatch" between data holders and data transformers is an important one. Another factor contributing to the relatively small number of ML/NLP startups is the fact that the practice of machine learning and data science lends itself well to crowdsourcing, as websites such as Kaggle, Innocentive, ChallengePost, CrowdAnalytix and TunedIT demonstrate. It makes sense for a company to pay a relatively small prize to get the best solutions that results from having several hundred data scientists and machine learning practitioners fight it out, until the one with the absolute lowest RMSE is left standing on the battlefield. Like many other people on these websites, I participate not just because of the cash reward that these companies offer, but more importantly to increase my knowledge by applying machine learning algorithms to real data. From the company's perspective, not only do these crowdsourcing websites offer a cheap way to acquire a solution, it's also a good way to recruit talent. There are two active Yelp competitions right now on Kaggle -- one of them is for a cash reward of $500, the other is for a chance to interview with them: Yelp Recruiting Competition    Embed Quote
