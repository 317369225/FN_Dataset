★What is the best machine learning algorithm?
Not only is there no 'best' algorithm, the 'best' algorithm for your particular problem is only as good as the parameters you use as inputs to the algorithm.  Selecting bad parameters can cause any good algorithm to perform poorly.  One method to improve paramater selection is to use another algorithm to tune the input parameters to your main algorithm.  For example using a genetic algorithm to tune the parameters for a Neural Network is a common practice.  There is a good book called Neruo-Fuzzy and Soft Computing, http://www.amazon.com/Neuro-Fuzz...,  that covers these topics and more.    Embed Quote
