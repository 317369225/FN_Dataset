★What are the best graduate schools for studying machine learning?
I think University of Washington deserves a mention here. Looking at the recent hire of Ben Taskar, Emily B. Fox, and Carlos Guestrin, UW seems really serious about going for "the" school for machine learning. UW will also have a big data specialization in their PhD program starting in September 2013.    Embed Quote
