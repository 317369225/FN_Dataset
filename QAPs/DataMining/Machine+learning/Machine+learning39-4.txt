★What are currently the hot topics in Machine Learning research and in real applications?Currently, there are many topics in ML research which are/can be used widely in real applications. I wonder what are key topics which we should focus doing research and studying.
Along with large-scale ML another topic that is becoming popular is small-scale machine learning. With the advancement of smart-phones, now people are trying to run the ML algorithms on small devices. But usually these algorithms consume lots of memory and battery, so data is transferred to some server before running the ML algorithms. Now people are working on how to optimize the ML algorithms to run them efficiently on hand-held or small devices like cameras, robots or smart-phones itself (maybe using GPUs etc). This is another interesting area in ML as well.    Embed Quote
