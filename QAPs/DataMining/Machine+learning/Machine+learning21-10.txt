★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
If you are truly looking for a one-stop reference, the best that I can suggest is Chris Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Re...). Although it is quite difficult to start with, it will cover the majority of your interests until you are well versed enough in the subject to be able to read publications and more specific texts. When in doubt, MIT OpenCourseWare is always a good source -- I believe they even offer one or two machine learning courses at the graduate level. Good general reference/tutorial texts: Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms -- McKay Introduction to Probability Models -- Ross AI: A Modern Approach -- Russel & Norvig Algorithms -- Kleinberg & Tardos    Embed Quote
