★What are the connections between machine learning and signal processing?
To add a bit to Waleed Kadous' answer, machine learning, statistics and signal processing are three pretty similar disciplines.  We all study mostly similar problems, but the specific questions can be a little bit different, and the points of interest don't always completely overlap.  Statisticians tend to worry more about data quality issues, machine learners tend to be very focused on predictive accuracy, and (at least in my somewhat limited experience) signal processing specialists tend to focus more on the limitations of digital hardware.    Embed Quote
