★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
As Alex mentions above, Andrew Ng's Course on Machine Learning is the best I have seen so far and he gives an intuitional feel for the concepts, so its easy to follow rather than looking at plain formulae in mathematics. If you are looking to refresh/clarify linear algebra concepts after going through the above course, Khan Academy could be useful. It also has videos on other topics that might be of interest for machine learning. If you are looking for concepts like PCA etc., you might not find it here.. Another useful resource that can focus on concepts is video lectures.. Machine Learning - videolectures.net.. and search only for tutorials.   There is no one stop shop as the concepts can go deeper and might require special treatment.. All this is theoretical which can clarify concepts. However, if you are a novice and if you want a deep and intuitive feel for concepts then pick one simple problem and implement the solution.    Embed Quote
