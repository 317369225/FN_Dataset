★Why isn't supervised machine learning more automated?
Google's Prediction API tries to do just this.  Of course, garbage in, garbage out still applies.  The predictions can only be as good as the features and the labels allow.  Personally, I am somewhat skeptical of blackbox machine learning.  Understanding your models, your problem, how those models fail, and how to fix those failures is going to be a useful skill for the foreseeable future.  Consider that if ML black boxes work well, this means that doing a proper error analysis, and leveraging domain specific knowledge to engineer around frequent errors with your system is not going to be worthwhile.    Embed Quote
