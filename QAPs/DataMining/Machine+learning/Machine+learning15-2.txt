★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
Statistics is about drawing valid conclusions It cares deeply about how the data was collected, methodology, and statistical properties of the estimator. Much of Statistics is motivated by problems where you need to know precisely what you're doing (clinical trials, other experiments). Statistics insists on proper and rigorous methodology, and is comfortable with making and noting assumptions. It cares about how the data was collected, the resulting properties of the estimator or experiment (e.g. p-value, unbiased estimators), and the kinds of properties you would expect if you did a procedure many times. Machine Learning is about predictionIt cares deeply about scalability and using the predictions to make decisions. Much of Machine Learning is motivated by problems that need to have answers (e.g. image recognition, text inference, ranking, computer vision, medical and healthcare, search engines.) ML is happy to treat the algorithm as a black box as long as it works. Prediction and decision-making is king, and the algorithm is only a means to an end. It's very important in ML to make sure that your performance would improve (and not take an absurd amount of time) with more data. If you combine the two, you get Statistical Machine Learning, which is about prediction made using many assumptions and valid statistical techniques.    Embed Quote
