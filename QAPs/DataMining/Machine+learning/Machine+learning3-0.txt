★What's the easiest way to learn machine learning?
There really is no easy way. If you're only interested in learning the basics then you can get away with online lectures. There's plenty of good ones out there. Here's a few good ones: Mathematicalmonk's youtube videos on Machine Learning Pedro Domingo's coursera lecture videos Abu-Mostafa's course on edX Andrew Ng's coursera course (It's a watered version of his Stanford lectures, so if you want more depth go with this instead -> Stanford Course ) Alex Smola puts his CMU lectures on youtube and has additional lecture content on his website -> Introduction to Machine Learning I personally really like the first two that I mentioned above. If you really want to do machine learning then you'll need to have a good grasp of multivariable calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics, and convex optimization. Gilbert Strang is the guy for Linear Algebra. MIT also has great videos on Multivariable Calculus. For Convex Optimization go with Boyd's free book and Stanford Video Lectures on Convex Optimization. I don't know of any good stats lectures but I'm a big fan of Probability Theory: The Logic of Science by E. T. Jaynes. Once you're comfortable with the math, you can pick up a few books and chew through them. To ease in I'd start with Pattern Classification by Duda, Hart and Stork, it's a nice introduction that will build up your intuition for Machine Learning. After you're done with that pick up Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop, which is really dense on information and covers Bayesian methods. Another good  (and free) book is Elements of Statistical Learning. If after all of that you're hungry for more, check out Machine Learning videos/lectures/talks on videolectures.net    Embed Quote
