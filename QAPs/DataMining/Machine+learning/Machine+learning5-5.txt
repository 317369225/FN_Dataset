★How does Quora use machine learning?
Yes, Quora uses Machine Learning. From the description for their ongoing Codesprint challenge (https://www.hackerrank.com/conte...): Quora uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and moderation to ensure high-quality content on the site. High question and answer quality has helped Quora distinguish itself from other Q&A sites on the web. They seem to use machine learning algorithms mainly for the ranking of answers and possibly also in putting together feeds for each user.    Embed Quote
