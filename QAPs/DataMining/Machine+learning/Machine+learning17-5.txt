★What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
In addition to the excellent responses already posted, I'd like to offer a few more suggestions in reference to the original question: 1. Machine learning requires innate curiosity, so if you never lost the curiosity you had when you were a child, I think you're a natural candidate for ML. Do you question the world around you and strive to find answers? 2. You also should be good at pure problem solving, but an aptitude for mathematics will help you understand the theory behind ML. 3. You should take one or more of the popular free ML classes available online now. Start with the coursera.org ML class by Andrew Ng of Stanford and then move on to the Caltech course which is more theoretical. 4. Participate in one or more of the kaggle.com mock ML competitions to gain experience with all of the above. Happy Machine Learning! Daniel    Embed Quote
