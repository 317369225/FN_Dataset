★Why is machine learning used heavily for Google's ad ranking and less for their search ranking?A lot of people I've talked to at Google have told me that the ad ranking system is largely machine learning based, while search ranking is rooted in functions that are written by humans using their intuition (with some components using machine learning). What led to this difference?
Besides the reasons that Edmond Lau mentioned, I think there's one distinction between the GOALs or evaluation criteria of an ads ranking system and a webpage ranking system. The best ads ranking system should maximize the search engine revenue, given that the search relevance is not hurt (to some extent); and the revenue maximization goal is easier to be optimized using ML approaches. The webpage ranking system is judged by USER EXPERIENCES, say, the utility of the search, or whether it satisfies the users need, which is harder to percept by an ML system, compared to rule based, hand-tuned systems.    Embed Quote
