★What are some good books on machine learning?
Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (aka PRML) by Christopher Bishop is really great, in my opinion: http://research.microsoft.com/en... It's certainly not a light read, but will give you an in depth knowledge of most commonly used algorithms and enough theoretical backing to understand most papers in ICML, JMLR, etc. I forgot to mention The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, which I think pairs well with PRML. It covers a few algorithms that PRML doesn't, and for the parts in common I find it helpful to have two different angles. http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ti...    Embed Quote
