★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
Short answer: The name and tradition Long answer: Machine Learning is statistics that specifically goes well beyond regression, uses almost entirely computational methods, and worries a lot less about rigorous quantification of error and details of the distribution. A good alternate name for Machine Learning would be "Applied Computational Statistics" An example of a distinction, however: Linear regression and indeed almost all types of sufficiently simple regression are statistics. Principal Component Analysis, using some moderately sophisticated linear algebra, is more in the domain of machine learning, though statisticians use related methods often. Bayesian networks are well within the realm of machine learning, and use almost exclusively approximate methods for complicated instances.    Embed Quote
