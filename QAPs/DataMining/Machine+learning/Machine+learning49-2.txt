★What are the best machine-learning research groups in Europe?
To add to this list: Some of the very best ML groups wordwide are in the Netherlands, with faculty like Tom Heskes, Max Welling, Joris Mooij, Bert Kappen, and too many others to name here. But I wonder why not anybody answers that question by themselves by browsing through a few recent conference proceedings, picking the most influential work and check where it came from? That would be a more "data-driven" way than to ask people about their opinion, which is most likely biased by where they graduated from or worked at.    Embed Quote
