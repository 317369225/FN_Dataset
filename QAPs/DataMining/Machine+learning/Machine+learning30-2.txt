★What are some common Machine Learning interview questions?I just completed Machine Learning class offered by Stanford last year http://www.ml-class.org and want to apply for jobs in Machine Learning What are the questions people are usually asked for machine learning interviews?
I think a lot of people dont know how to properly conduct a data science interview - mostly because they dont understand what to look for themselves - how do you ask someone about something you know very little about? First off, Data Scientist is going to be an EXTREMELY different position for a startup vs a large company (i.e. GOOGLE / IBM Research). Most likely, for a large organization, the problems you'll be focusing on are a bit more constrained, versus in a startup, it will probably be like "we need a first version of classification / recommendation / etc" models. In a startup, you'll more likely than not want someone who has both data wrangling skills (depending, Pig / Python / SQL etc) as well as having used standard ML libraries, although this will **somewhat** apply to a large company. The thing is, the large company has resources to do more novel exploration, whereas few startups will take risks to invent something completely novel. Anyway, the right way to conduct a data science interview is to create a dataset (i.e. from a Kaggle, etc) that resembles the problem you want to solve, and have the 'scientist' work through the different steps from start to finish of what they would do - what data would they choose? how would they clean the data? What types of features? How could features be enhanced with domain knowledge? what model would they use? why / why not? what evaluation metrics? (f1 / recall / precision, etc) What are other papers saying about this? What is the academic benchmark for a problem like this? Who in academia has presented papers on this type of problem? etc.    Embed Quote
