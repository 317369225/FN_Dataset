★What are the must read papers on data mining and machine learning?
A few great ones: The Mathematics of Learning: Dealing with Data Tomaso Poggio and Steve Smale http://www.ams.org/notices/20030... Near Optimal Signal Recovery From Random Projections: Universal Encoding Strategies? Emmanuel Candes and Terence Tao http://statweb.stanford.edu/~can... Topology and Data Gunnar Carlsson http://comptop.stanford.edu/u/pr... Semi-Supervised Learning on Riemannian Manifolds Mikhail Belkin, Partha Niyogi http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~n... Stochastic Methods for L1-regularized Loss Minimization Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ambuj Tewari http://jmlr.org/papers/volume12/... and its implementation, in graphlab, described here: Parallel Coordinate Descent for L1-Regularized Loss Joseph K. Bradley, Aapo Kyrola, Danny Bickson, Carlos Guestrin http://www.select.cs.cmu.edu/pub... and also the liblinear implemenation: A Comparison of Optimization Methods and Software for Large-scale L1-regularized Linear Classication Guo-Xun Yuan, Kai-Wei Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Chih-Jen Lin http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjli... Learning the parts of objects by non-negative matrix factorization Daniel D. Lee & H. Sebastian Seung http://www.nature.com/nature/jou... and the modern form of NMF, which I prefer to use: Convex and Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations Chris Ding, Tao Li, Michael I. Jordan http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jord...    Embed Quote
