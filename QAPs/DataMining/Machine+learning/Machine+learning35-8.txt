★What are the best open source machine learning libraries written in Python?
numpy - numerical library scipy - Advanced math, signal processing, optimization, statistics scikits-learn - Classic machine learning algorithms - Provide simple an efficient solutions to learning problems pandas - data analysis mathplotlib - plotting library cvxopt - Convex optimization library MDP - Collection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms opencv - Intel image processing library with Computer Vision algorithms. (But cv module has a requirement  to go to and fro from cvmat and numpy structures. I guess cv2 has this  resolved.) statsmodels - Allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests    Embed Quote
