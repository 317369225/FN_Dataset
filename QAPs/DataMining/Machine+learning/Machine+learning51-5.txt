★What are the connections between machine learning and signal processing?
The basic role of signal processing is extracting some useful information for recognition and other purpose. Then machine learning algorithm will classification or regression based on the output of signal processing But with the coming of deep learning, signal processing ans machine learning has changed. Now deep learning has the function of feature learning. So in many times, we do not need signal processing algorithm to process your original data. We just need to input your original data to the deep learning structure.    Embed Quote
