★What are some common Machine Learning interview questions?I just completed Machine Learning class offered by Stanford last year http://www.ml-class.org and want to apply for jobs in Machine Learning What are the questions people are usually asked for machine learning interviews?
I think that your interviewers will want to see some experience in ML. I guess that this is your first job in this domain so I would suggest working on a small-medium independent open source project which will be "cool" and based upon an ML algo'. Something like a facebook app, mobile app, small web site. This will give you that needed edge over other newbies. By doing so, there is a good chance that they will spend some of the interview time by asking you about your project, which you will know well, instead of asking you more and more "tricky" questions..Good luck!    Embed Quote
