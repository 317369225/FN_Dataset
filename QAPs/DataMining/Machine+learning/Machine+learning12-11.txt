Sumo Logic If you are looking for a huge and rich data set, we have it! :-) SCALE We are building a cloud-based service for collecting, managing, and analyzing the entire spectrum of machine- generated log data. A single Sumo Logic customer can have as much data as Twitter in a single day, therefore our system is and must be truly built to cloud scale. Our analytics are scalable, precise, proactive and community driven. DEPTH We code in Scala and use Cassandra, Hadoop, and graph databases such as Neo4J. We believe in automated testing and continuous deployment. We offer to you a mix of problems ranging from real-time stream processing all the way to large-scale structure extraction and pattern mining. We have the data - what will you build with it? WE ARE SUMO Our founders are techies with deep experience in the Log Management and Analytics domain. We are funded and supported by Greylock Partners. We are located on Castro Street in downtown Mountain View close to Caltrain. We just moved into a new facility, which we were able to extensively customize. We want to work with people who are smarter and more talented than we are. http://go.sumologic.com/jobs    Embed Quote
