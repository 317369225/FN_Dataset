★Will deep learning make other Machine Learning algorithms obsolete?Every once in a while a new algorithms comes and makes all others (in the same domain) seems kind of obsolete when it comes to the same domain. Will deep learning make that related algorithms (backpropagation NN, GMM, HMM, ...)?
The story of deep learning for speech recognition is very telling.  For me there are two take home messages: 1. Pretraining is not necessary.  Excellent performance can be obtained using a simple random initialization. 2. Good labeling is required.  A state-of-the-art traditional speech reco system is needed to generate ground truth at a very high level of detail. While the performance gains for ASR have been huge, deep learning in this context doesn't have much depth.  With random initialization a DNN is essentially an MLP. Pretraining may be more important in other domains where there isn't as much data or where ground truth isn't as well defined.    Embed Quote
