★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
In 1991, the QMR model [1] was proposed as a simple Bayesian approach to diagnosis. In 1994, JAMIA published a survey article entitled "Medical Diagnostic Decision Support Systems—Past, Present, And Future" [2]. In 2005, BMJ published a survey article entitled "Improving clinical practice using clinical decision support systems: a systematic review of trials to identify features critical to success" [3]. Each of these articles has hundreds of citations on Google Scholar. I suspect these articles would provide a good foundation for understanding how machine learning has been used to aid clinical decision making, including diagnosis.
