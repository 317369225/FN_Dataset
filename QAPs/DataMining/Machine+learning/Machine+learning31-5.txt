★Will deep learning make other Machine Learning algorithms obsolete?Every once in a while a new algorithms comes and makes all others (in the same domain) seems kind of obsolete when it comes to the same domain. Will deep learning make that related algorithms (backpropagation NN, GMM, HMM, ...)?
I predict that every 10-15 years Neural Networks will undergo the following cycle: they will be forgotten for 10 years as people get excited about large-scale convex optimization problems and then slowly come back under a new and sexy name (e.g., Deep Learning).  I suspect this will happen as long as Hinton, Lecun, Bengio and their disciples live on (and they're likely to replicate at ever-increasing rates)!    Embed Quote
