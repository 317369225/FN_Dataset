★What is the best machine learning algorithm?
Agree with all! There is no best algorithm, it depends on your objective. However I have something more to say... If you are new to this domain and have no clue, I would suggest start with decision trees.. they are weak learners, however they also require least amount of data preperation and can deal with variety of problems fairly well, missing values, different types of features, etc. You can train a tree and reason about it on how it makes a decision and if you have domain knowledge, you can do a better job at feature engineering or cleaning up the data because you can see how the tree is making wrong decisions and that is because your features are either erronous or misleading. Almost all other modeling approaches leave very little to reason about the model. You have the test results and that is your only way to believe in it :-). But as I mentioned before, trees are weak learners and probably not the best for your problem, all by themselves.. in most cases.    Embed Quote
