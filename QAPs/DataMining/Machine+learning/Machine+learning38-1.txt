★Is machine learning overrated or overhyped?
I don't think there are enough people in Machine Learning. However, there are a lot of useless people in the field. Why? Because it is fancy. I've met academicians who advertise themselves as Machine Learning experts who knows so little about Statistics or hell even Linear Algebra. I keep reading some "NOVEL" approach articles that constantly replicate others' work. Also I keep noticing everybody names things differently so their article might look like new. I've read two articles defining a neural network as; "Multi-planar Neural Network" or "Hyperdimensional Neural Network".  When I saw the name I was like "Wow this must be new, how the hell didn't I hear about that before?" Aaand it's just a 2 dimensional neural network... So I believe, because of acquisitions done by giants like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon people with no or a little academic knowledge are sliding to this area unknowingly and they are defining themselves as ML guys brazenly. This created an atmosphere as if ML was an overhyped area. In fact, I believe this area requires a lot more "real" researchers.    Embed Quote
