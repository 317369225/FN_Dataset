★I want to learn machine learning. Where should I start?
Start from the top. Then dive down.  Occasionally come up for air. Hayek, F. A. v. (1952). The sensory order; an inquiry into the foundations of theoretical psychology. London,, Routledge & Paul. Hillis, W. (1999). The pattern on the stone, Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Minsky, M. (1988). The society of mind, Simon and Schuster. Simon, H. (1996). The sciences of the artificial, The MIT Press. Wiener, N. (1988). The human use of human beings: Cybernetics and society, Da Capo Pr. Or start at the middle.  Then go up and down, down and up, dolphin kick. Durfee, E., V. Lesser, et al. (1989). "Trends in cooperative distributed problem solving." IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering: 63-83. Elman, J. (1990). "Finding structure in time." Cognitive science 14(2): 179-211. Eberhart, R. C., Y. Shi, et al. (2001). Swarm intelligence, Elsevier. Richards, W. (1988). Natural computation, Mit Press. Spitzer, M. (2000). The mind within the net: Models of learning, thinking, and acting Don't start from the bottom and drown.  If you encounter algorithms that are referred to with 4-7 letter acronyms (e.g. FASTHEX), save it for later.  Once you develop a solid foundation, you'll be able to go through most of such papers within minutes (even seconds).  Start by building up your schema so you can better engage with journal articles later.    Embed Quote
