★What are currently the hot topics in Machine Learning research and in real applications?Currently, there are many topics in ML research which are/can be used widely in real applications. I wonder what are key topics which we should focus doing research and studying.
I'll be a little more practical than the other votes on here: - Detecting Fraud and anomalous user behavior - Model Selection :'D - Node Based Learning of Graphical Models - Semi-structured learning using Markov Networks - Link Prediction - Robust PCA and lower dimensional projection methods - As you can see from LEAP & Kinect, gesture detection and human movement recognition is not yet a fully solved problem - Sparsity research, e.g. Sparsity constrained optimization and optimal approaches. sparse things are awesome (sometimes) - Always a nice question, can we make our models learn more effiicently? what if we have a certain set of presumptions about our data? - Clustering Approaches - Manifold Learning - Adaptive Partitioning - Fuzzy Memories    Embed Quote
