★What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
Beside the expert comments i would suggest take the Machine Learning course on Coursera from Andrew Ng.He is one of the best in the business.If you already know basic programming and handful of mathematical techniques( linear algebra , statistics and probability) you should be good to go.    Embed Quote
