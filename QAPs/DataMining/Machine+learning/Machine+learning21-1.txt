★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
When going through my Machine Learning course last semester, I felt like I had the most catching up to do with Linear Algebra. I felt key ideas from LinAlg are harder to remember over time than Probability. I found myself to be mostly working with probability distributions, Bayes' rule, MLEs and MAPs, while the algebra side of it was mostly optimization in higher dimensions, was mostly Matrix calculus. I discovered that the Matrix Cookbook was popular with most students for working with Matrix Calculus as it seems to have a never-ending list of  matrix derivatives: http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/vie... As far as brushing up on the rest of your Linear Algebra knowledge is concerned, I highly recommend Strang's lectures/book: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathe... Highly relevant topics include knowing about rank and inversion, SVD, and also make sure you're very comfortable with eigenvalues and eigenvectors, amongst other things. Finally, with Analysis, I don't think ML requires a formal introduction to Analysis at all. Its important to know higher dimensional calculus well, especially parts related to optimization, such as Lagrange multipliers, the primal-dual form, and in general, the calculus of Matrices, and you should be good to go. Overall, I think the case with Linear Algebra and Calculus is to work your way through an ML book/course, and stop and look at the relevant math when necessary, whereas you need a strong foundation in Probability right from the beginning, and most textbooks on ML tend to talk a lot about probability while skimming over the mathematical details of LinAlg and Calculus.    Embed Quote
