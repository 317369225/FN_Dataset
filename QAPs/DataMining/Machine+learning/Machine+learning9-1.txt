★What are the best talks/lectures related to big data/algorithms/machine learning?
If you are getting started with machine learning I would recommend starting with the (now very popular) videos from Andrew Ng's course, which you can find at Coursera or in several other versions (e.g. Stanford Engineering Everywhere CS229 - Machine Learning). Another great introductory material is the set of videos for Hastie and Tibshirani's Introduction to Statistical Learning (you can find direct links to the videos in this blog post (In-depth introduction to machine learning in 15 hours of expert videos). Finally, I would also recommend going through some of the videos posted to Machine Learning Summer School's from recent year. Here is a playlist including some of the videos from the 2014 School at CMU (including my own) Machine Learning Summer School 2014    Embed Quote
