★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
Machine Learning is AI people doing data analysis. Data Mining is database people doing data analysis. Applied Statistics is statisticians doing data analysis (mathematical statistics is mathematicians doing statistics, a meta-activity analogous to theoretical computer scientists investigating, say, PAC and convergence - which sometimes gets put into machine learning). Infographics is Graphic Designers doing data analysis. Data Journalism is Journalists doing data analysis. Econometrics is Economists doing data analysis (and here you can win a Nobel Prize). Psychometrics is Psychologists doing data analysis. Chemometrics and Cheminformatics are Chemists doing data analysis. Bioinformatics is Biologists doing data analysis.    Embed Quote
