★Is machine learning a dead end for startups?
I think we have not got started yet. I noticed just how bad the automatic transcription of speech to text is on television subtitles. All too often, the automated transcription systems make errors that no human being would make. The systems seem to convert sounds to words, but often fail to recognise that certain word groups are rarely associated.   By exploiting language databases which boosted or diminished the likelihood of subsequent words based on context - the transcription would be much more human and more accurate.    Embed Quote
