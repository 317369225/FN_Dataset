★★★★★I completed 40% of the course on it's first offering (in summer of second year), but couldn't continue. I enrolled for the next year's offering. Didn't even have the time to attend one quiz. I enrolled in this year's June offering and finished it with a statement of accomplishment.[1] I almost wanted to give this course a 4 /5 since I felt the course gets a sudden steep learning curve around the 40% mark (somewhere near the neural networks week).  But then. what is learning, if not for a few complications? I knew calculus, probability and linear algebra at a considerably higher level than when I took the course's initial offering. That is probably a reason why it was easier to manage the course. Was it just 10 weeks? It felt like an year. I was juggling it with work (which I had begun at the same time). It was one of the most hectic periods I have experienced. But I loved it immensely. The programming exercises were a wonderful opportunity to translate the technical details into application. I cannot forget the hours getting stuck on a single Octave command which seemed right, though it wasn't. Good course, really! [1]. 100 %    Embed Quote
