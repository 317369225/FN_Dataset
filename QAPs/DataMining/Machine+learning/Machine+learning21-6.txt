★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
There is a book named "Mathematics for Computer Science". It is also a lecture in MIT. This is the MIT OCW link of that course: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/elect.... This course materials are old by the way. Good news is that you can find the book (composition of all materials) easily by searching. If I am not wrong, the last revised version of this book is 6th May, 2012. You need linear algebra as well. I recommend you for this reason, Gilbert Strang's "Linear Algebra and Its Applications". It may be little bit tough, but it is a great book. If you want to dive into probabilistic approach, you can enroll Probabilistic Graphical Models course: https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm. I heard that it is very good course. Textbook of that course looks very useful: http://www.amazon.com/Probabilis...    Embed Quote
