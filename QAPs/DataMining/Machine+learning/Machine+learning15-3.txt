★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
If you only look at the methods studied in both fields, machine learning and statistics look pretty similar. However, if you look at what the goals both fields are trying to achieve, you see that there is actually quite a big difference: Statistics is interested in learning something about data, for example, which have been measured as part of some biological experiment. Statistics is necessary to support or reject hypothesis based on noisy data, or to validate models, or make predictions and forecasts. But the overall goal is to arrive at new scientific insight based on the data. In Machine Learning, the goal is to solve some complex computational task by 'letting the machine learn'. Instead of trying to understand the problem well enough to be able to write a program which is able to perform the task (for example, handwritten character recognition), you instead collect a huge amount of examples of what the program should do, and then run an algorithm which is able to perform the task by learning from the examples. Often, the learning algorithms are statistical in nature. But as long as the prediction works well, any kind of statistical insight into the data is not necessary. This difference also becomes clear when you look at the role of validation in both fields. In statistics, validation is necessary to be sure whether the conclusions drawn from the data are true or not. In machine learning, proper validation is important to know which algorithm performs best on the data.    Embed Quote
