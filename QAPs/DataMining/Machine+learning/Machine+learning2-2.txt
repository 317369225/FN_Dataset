★What are the best machine learning blogs or resources available?Looking for some regularly updated and high quality content blogs.
Check out Datumbox's Blog: http://blog.datumbox.com/ I have covered several easy to understand techniques which can help you get started with Machine Learning. I also highly recommend signing up for the Coursera Machine Learning course or checking out mathematicalmonk's channel youtube videos on Machine Learning. Don't get frustrated. Machine Learning can be hard at the beginning until you get used to the notation and basic concepts. Make sure you start a side project that uses ML to get motivated to read more and test what you learn. Good luck!    Embed Quote
