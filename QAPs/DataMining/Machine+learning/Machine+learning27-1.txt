★I want to learn machine learning. Where should I start?
To start with Machine Learning (ML) on your own, it's best you pick a problem that you're passionate about, and that ML techniques and tools can help you with. The problem will provide a grounding for all the theory. You can spend years learning the theory in an unfocused way. But focusing on a concrete problem while finding the right tools for the job will give you a sense of progress, and something you can show to others. ML techniques help solve a number of classes of problems: prediction and supervised learning: how to predict something you don't know from something you do know dimension reduction and unsupervised learning: how to organize, present and systematize data anomaly/outlier detection: how to detect what's unusual active learning: how to design experiments on the goYou can solve these problems for different types of data, to real-time or historical data, on large computers or tiny ones. Beware when you read ML literature: it's usually centered on a methodology, not on the problem being solved. Some applications, like recommender systems, contain all of the above problems. Fundamentally, predicting what a user would like is a prediction problem. But at the same time, users and items should both be systematized: using human-made and automatic taxonomies. Some of the users are not giving good opinions, so their data is bad, and should be removed. For new users and new items, one actually has to design experiments, or they will never be tied into the fabric of recommendations. The other approach, which works better if you're working with an expert in ML, would work differently. Your advisor or mentor would give you a methodological problem to work on. This way, you would be contributing to the body of ML techniques. Instead of being opportunistic about technique, you'd be opportunistic about applications. But I don't recommend pursuing this path by yourself.    Embed Quote
