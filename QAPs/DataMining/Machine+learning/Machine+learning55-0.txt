★How can a beginner train for machine learning contests?
I've competed a little.  A few thoughts. Devote time, the winners regularly put 100+ hours into each contest. Take Andrew Ng's machine learning course its the best general introduction out there. Learn a statistical language, R, Matlab*, or Python with SciPY, they all work nicely.  The benefit of these is that people in the community use them, so you can go from reading about an idea to running it by importing a library or two rather than trying to implement algorithms yourself. Read results papers from winners.  These are often posted on Kaggle blog, no free hunch, or in the forums.  Totally essential, many of these will provide code snippets and instructions to show you how to achieve top level performance.  For example Market Maker's paper on the heritage health prize includes snippets of code sufficient to get close to their best results.  A good leg up to have! * Edit: Ben Hammer says not to use matlab in the quora question: How useful is Matlab, for Kaggle, as compared with R and Python?    Embed Quote
