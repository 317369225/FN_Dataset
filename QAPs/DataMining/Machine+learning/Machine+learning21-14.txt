★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
Probability: Conditional probability, random variables, pdfs etc. Whatever you'd learn in your undergrad probability course and a bit more. Some bit of stochastic processes (like markovian processes, etc) Linear Algebra: Data analysis and machine learning builds up ALOT on these concepts. Algorithms: not as important, but still important when it comes to optimizing your solution. some graph theory Basic Linear Programming and recognizing convexity and relaxation. I guess once you have a fair idea of most of these concepts, then its pretty simple to pick up the intuition behind any algorithm and where it would work/ how to improve it/ etc.    Embed Quote
