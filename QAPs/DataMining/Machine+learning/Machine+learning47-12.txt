★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
There are some good answers here. I would add that machine learning and NLP rarely achieve a 100% solution. On the other hand, they can statistically provide some significant improvement to services such as recommendations, news feeds, etc. Good examples of this are Netflix (movie suggestion), Amazon (product suggestion), Facebook (how your news feed is organized). You often find that machine learning is a core component of many tech companies these days, due to the vast amount of data being collected. Thus, it is hard to sell a "machine learning" product as a full solution as it cannot achieve a fully satisfying result on its own. On the other hand, it is great in conjunction with services that provides an overall value (and in many ways, is somewhat inherent to the product). It could be argued that some of what Google does in ranking its search results is augmented by machine learning and NLP. [edit: modified emphasis, thanks Joseph Turian] Two interesting anecdotes: Palantir: A company that believes that machine learning can't provide the full solution. The idea is that computers are great at heavy computation, but they leave the "learning" and pattern recognition to the human. Hunch (www.hunch.com): In the completely opposite sense, this is probably one of the most data-driven, machine learning oriented start ups out there.    Embed Quote
