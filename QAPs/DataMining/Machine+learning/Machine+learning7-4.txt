★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
I'm very heartened and impressed with the considerations posted here to this question, but the magnitude of the problem and challenge is so intimidating that it threatens to goad people into throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  I absolutely agree that a machine won't be able to replace a fully trained (hopefully awake ;) physician, but as several have stated, it holds great promise as a tool to assist physicians and those in health care with faster, better imaging analysis and computation.    Many tools like this have been in place for decades, from the Merck Manual to specialty books like "Decision Making In Pain Management" which are decision-tree style manuals for management assistance with complex cases.  They do not, and arguably should not replace a trained doctor.  They never claimed to be anything other than a tool for the doctor.  This, I feel is the exact way CAD should be viewed: not a threat, just another tool to help you do a better job.    As a pain specialist, I know that a good part of figuring out the key factors in a patient's pain are relatively straightforward and have systems of patterns that probably could be rather easily configured into an algorithm that would lead to a fairly accurate diagnosis and partial treatment.  That being said, it would absolutely NOT substitute for the initial physician's exam (ruling out other factors), my exam (to determine causative factors for the myofascial component) and sheer intuitive,  sensory and experiential judgement of the practitioner.  Without those things, the information coming from the algorithm is rendered arbitrary and, thus, useless, or even dangerous.   What I would like to know is, what products are already being developed or even used for pain management??    Embed Quote
