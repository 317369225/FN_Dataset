★Will deep learning make other Machine Learning algorithms obsolete?Every once in a while a new algorithms comes and makes all others (in the same domain) seems kind of obsolete when it comes to the same domain. Will deep learning make that related algorithms (backpropagation NN, GMM, HMM, ...)?
Actually deep learning is often (usually?) used in conjuction with basic Machine Learning algorithms: Deep network is used for learning a feature map from raw data (or slightly processed/normalized/pca'd data) and then SVM, logistic regression, random forest etc. is used to perform the classification based on the feature vectors produced by the deep network. The feature values s are given by the activations of the final output layer.  For example in the famous "cat detector" paper by Quoc V Le et. al. (with Google) Page on Stanford, they used one-versus-all logistic classifier to do the final classification. Thus Deep Learning might make specialized feature extractors (such as SLIT for images) obsolete over time, but in many other cases it is complementary.    Embed Quote
