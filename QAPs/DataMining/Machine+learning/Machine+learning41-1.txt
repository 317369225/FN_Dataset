★What is the best way to study machine learning?
There are a lot of great courses/text-books out there - Yaser Abu-Mostafa (Caltech) was by far the best professor I ever had in ML and does an amazing job of presenting complex topics simply - see here: Learning From Data - Online Course. If you want to understand ML theory, well, I'd highly recommend you take a look at his materials. Reading about theory is one part of learning a new area - but, actually playing with the technology/algorithms is the best way to hammer home concepts and learn practical skills. I would say do the following: Obtain a copy of a programming language that allows for quick manipulation and visualization of data and has lots of built-in functionality - i.e. Matlab and not C++. The visualization piece is key - always display intermediate results to ensure everything is working as expected. Often the biggest 'aha' moments occur by studying what the algorithms are actually doing. Matlab is great for this. Obtain some real data-sets (e.g. Netflix challenge, Caltech-101/256 Image Database, etc) Start experimenting with simple classifiers (nearest-neighbor variants). Often these work surprisingly (and frustratingly) well when compared to more complex techniques. Play with different generative and discriminative techniques - understand when and why they fail and try to extend algorithms to address failure cases.    Embed Quote
