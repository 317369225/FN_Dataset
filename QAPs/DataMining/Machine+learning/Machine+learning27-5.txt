★I want to learn machine learning. Where should I start?
Don't waste too much time on learning individual topics like linear programming and then quad programming and so on. Many students make this mistake. Just make sure you understand Linear Algebra properly, and then start studying the convex optimization book by Boyd and Vandenberghe. Also, it is extremely important that you implement each and every algorithm, in the later chapters, by yourself (without using any of the tools like CVX) --- at least chapter 9 if you don't have much time for later chapters. Also, learn the frist order methods like subgradients. You can then read some papers on convex relaxations. What is important in machine learning is the problem formulation. If the underlying optimization problem is convex, you can use the techniques you have learned to solve it. If it is non-convex, you use relaxation approaches to reduce it to a convex problem. For general non-linear (non-convex) optimization, you can perhaps read Numerical Optimization by J. Nocedal and Wright. This book covers many algorithms for non-linear (again non-convex) optimization. This is a tough one; I read it during my undergrad, and now don't remember much of it and also don't know much about the state of the art in general non-linear optimization. But having read it, I do know that it is a great book and might help you learn/understand some advanced stuff.    Embed Quote
