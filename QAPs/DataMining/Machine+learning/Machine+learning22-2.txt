★What are some good machine learning jokes?
This is not about machine learning as such , but here are "some Geoff Hinton" facts which are very funny!!! Lifted from Fun Stuff Geoff Hinton doesn't need to make hidden units.   They hide by themselves when he approaches. Geoff Hinton doesn't disagree with you, he contrastively    diverges Deep Belief Nets actually believe deeply in Geoff Hinton. Geoff Hinton goes directly to third Bayes. Geoff Hinton discovered how the brain really works.    Once a year for the last 25 years. Geoff Hinton never takes the plane. He doesn't even take the hyperplane.  He prefers to ride on a quasi-spherical Riemannian manifold. Markov random fields think Geoff Hinton is intractable. If you defy Geoff Hinton, he will maximize your entropy in no time.   Your free energy will be gone even before you reach equilibrium. Geoff Hinton can make you regret without bounds. Geoff Hinton can make your weight decay (your weight,   but unfortunately not mine). Geoff Hinton doesn't need support vectors. He can support   high-dimensional hyperplanes with his pinky finger. A little-known fact about Geoff Hinton: he frequents   Bayesians with prior convictions (with thanks to David Schwab). All kernels that ever dared approaching    Geoff Hinton woke up convolved. Most farmhouses are surrounded by nice fields.     Geoff Hinton's farmhouse lies in a hyper-plain,     surrounded by a mean field, and has kernels     in la grange. The only kernel Geoff Hinton has ever used   is a kernel of truth. After an encounter with Geoff Hinton,    support vectors become unhinged and suffer   optimal hyper-pain (with thanks to Andrew Jamieson). Geoff Hinton's generalizations are boundless. Never interrupt one of Geoff Hinton's talks:    you will suffer his wrath if you maximize the bargin'. Others prove theorems. Geoff Hinton proves axioms. Geoff Hinton once built a neural network that beat Chuck Norris on MNIST.    Embed Quote
