★What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
As for the interview, I think the basic knowledge of statistics, math and machine learning is needed. For example, you will be asked about MLE and MAP. Also, linear algebra is very important in ML area, such as SVD. In my view, first you need to have a good understanding of ML, and then you can dig deeper into its advance concepts.    Embed Quote
