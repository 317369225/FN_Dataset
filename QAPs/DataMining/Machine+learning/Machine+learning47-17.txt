★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
Fundamentally, the technology does not work that well at scale (much less Internet scale). Any startup that wants to use NLP in a product faces a high hurdle in simply providing a reliable and valuable user experience much less being able to create a scalable business on top of it.    Embed Quote
