★Is machine learning overrated or overhyped?
It's "overhyped" in a way. It's overhyped because the phrase "Machine Learning" invokes unrealistic images in people's minds. "Machine Learning" sounds like Wall-E learning what love is, and that's not what we're referring to when we say it. But, does that mean it's overrated? Nope. Not at all.    Embed Quote
