★What are Kernels in Machine Learning and SVM?I'm trying to get into SVM, but I cannot get the idea of kernels. What are they and why do we need them?
Here is an even shorter visualization of what an SVM does. Basically the trick is to to look for a projection to higher dimensional space where there is a linear separation of the data (others have posted much more detailed and correct answers so I just wanted to share the vid, not made by me).    Embed Quote
