★Is machine learning a dead end for startups?
Fast. Good. Cheap. Pick any two. (@Project management triangle) Let's say 100 companies, research groups and startups around the world are working on solving a given problem using machine learning. Who will solve it fastest? Who will provide the best results? Who will do it cheapest? Will the fastest solution scale? What if a million people want to use it? Will the best quality solution involve a massive data collection effort, with hundreds of man-hours of data munging and curation? Will the cheapest solution work with real-world data? And being cheap, will it ever be able to earn enough to pay back its costs? Anyone who believes there's no scope remaining for innovation (in any field) should remind themselves of these other classic @Predictions Quotes Remember that machine learning is about recognising things, by training-by-example rather than by programming. It is nothing to do with sentience, and sci-fi singularity nonsense. Machine Learning is complicated to do right. It is difficult to obtain good data, to build good models, and to produce results without being too general or too specific. Production quality results may require teams of highly educated specialists. These don't come cheap. Even if a company does produce a best-of-breed machine learning solution, they may consider it a competitive advantage, and not make it publicly available. Or it may be so tailored to the originator's use case that it can't be generalised. The fundamental goal of technology is provide the illusion of simplicity. Something that just works, 100% of the time, with its user neither knowing or caring how it works underneath. Machine learning is still a long way from achieving any of these. So the good news is, opportunity abounds...    Embed Quote
