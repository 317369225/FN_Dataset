★How does one start writing practical machine learning programs?
If you prefer R, then "Machine Learning for Hackers" is extremely recommended for beginner. Else if you prefer Python, I recommend "machine Learning in Action". Both of these two books are fairly easy to follow up. You would take no more than two weeks to go through each of them.    Embed Quote
