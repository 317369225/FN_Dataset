★What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?
You should ask him about ML algorithms with use cases and let him explain them case by case with the algorithms. What was the case ? Why he selected that algoritm to accomplish what.. Did he used a toolbox like WEKA or just implemented algorithms itself. From my experience: It's very important that candidate have joined all lifecycle of a software project not just ML part.  Ask him about PMML standard and NoSQL experience (HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB etc). It's very important to have information and know how about data stream mining for text classification in the knowledge flow environment. Best of luck, Guney    Embed Quote
