★How does one start writing practical machine learning programs?
I can only emphasize the comments by John Coogan. The pointed book "machine learning for hackers" is such a great material for starters. You can follow in twitter to the authors, @drewconway and  @johnmyleswhite, they usually point cool stuff. Same with @hmason (the one in the video also pointed by Coogan)    Embed Quote
