★What is the relationship between machine learning and the scientific method?Scientists follow "the scientific method" to arrive at conclusions about data, although there has been much debate about what exactly this method consists of. Machine learning also arrives at (tentative) conclusions about data - is there a relationship between the two?
Machine learning tries to classify an unclassified entity or predict a future state of a system based on past behaviors. The scientific method tries to establish an objective realm of knowledge free of any subjective influences.  It is being conceded that the process of machine learning is very dependent on constraints imposed on the problem definition - assumptions about data distribution and independence being the most fundamental. Any Coursera intro to aspects of statistical inference and computational methods of pattern recognition emphasize these constraints. The Scientific Method as codified by Bacon, reified by Popper and challenged by Kuhn stands as more of an article of faith than a real milestone in the advance of reason as a principle of human achievement. Atheists and fundamentalists can tweak machine learning code together. Creationists and Evolutionists however will not be reconciled by appeal to the scientific method. If you can understand this conundrum you qualify as at least a fledgling philosopher of the cyborg era. Humans will never obey their own representations. That is what Plato meant and what Confucious misunderstood. That is why Lao Tzu made fun of Confucious and why Heraclitus is not honored in the Halls of congress. It is interesting to note that humans cannot even understand the process of representing the world to themselves well enough to protect their own children from the side effects of their own romantic fantasies. If you just wanted investment advice put your money on realtime data stream interpreters that keep humans in the loop.    Embed Quote
