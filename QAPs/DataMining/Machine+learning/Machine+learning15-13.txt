★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
Machine learning produces predictions.  As far as I can tell, it is not very good at drawing conclusions about general principles based on a set of observations. Statistical estimation such as regression can be and are used to generate  predictions, but this is not its primary purpose in a scientific setting.  Statistical estimation produces estimates (informed guesses) of parameters (variables) which are assumed by some theory to be latent (unobserved) fundamental properties of some phenomenon. Statistical estimation lets the practitioner make inferences (conclusions about a larger set of phenomena based on the observation of a smaller set of phenomena.)  For example, in a regression model the practitioner can estimate the effect of a one unit change in an independent variable x on a dependent variable y,  If the effect size is distinguishable from zero, the practitioner might conclude that x covaries with y.  This, combined with other requirements (a theory explaining how x affects y; assurance that it is not y that affects x; the model is not missing/misspecifying any other causal variables) can allow the practitioner to conclude that x causes y to some degree. I  have yet to see how ML can be used to make causal inferences.   Estimation of regression and other statistical models can be part of a  way to make causal inferences.    Embed Quote
