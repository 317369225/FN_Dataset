★★★★★It is a great place to start. My first introductions to Machine Learning was through Prof. Andrew Ng's course. If done wrong, Machine Learning is a lot of dry math and Andrew ensures that people don't get repulsed by machine learning techniques. He starts with a gentle introduction, and even before that he talks about where ML is applied in day to day life. A lot of people think ML is some abstract mathematical technique that gets employed in sophisticated engineering circles, but from Andrew's introduction we get to see how it is applied in a lot of products we use everyday (email spam filters, for instance). He gives a brief introduction to Linear Algebra then teaches you to handle the necessary software (Octave) as well. This makes the course self contained and that makes it stand out from other ML courses online. He gradually goes from the most intuitive concept of gradient descent and gives sufficient introductions to advanced ideas like Artificial Neural Networks and Unsupervised learning, which leaves you with sufficient foundations and curiosity to pursue the field further with confidence. I would highly recommend people to do the assignments. In case there isn't enough time for that, spend a couple of hours every week for a few weeks and finish watching the lectures. But do not stop with this course if you want to explore the field further. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a fantastic place to start your foray into the field of Machine Learning.    Embed Quote
