★What are the limits of machine learning?
Information theory provides an eloquent answer to these questions. The probability that you will find the exact text of the Declaration of Independence in an endless stream of random symbols (infinite time complexity) that are required to reproduce an exact copy of the Declaration of Independence is exactly 1:1. Consider this the slowest computational algorithm for finding information, as the time it would take to produce an exact copy of the Declaration of Independence cannot be determined with certainty. There are no theoretical limitations of machine learning capability until you apply an algorithm to a Turing machine with computational limitations. A Turing machine with no limitation in computational processing could theoretically solve any problem in a symbol space because it has as much time as it needs to solve that problem using random symbol permutations to validate the problem's solution using a supplied proof. If you want to test Machine Learning algorithms, you need to make an educated guess on how long it will take to solve the problem that you've applied the algorithm to solve. Then if the time does not meet your expected calculations, I'd make some changes and re-test until you are able to explain why it is that your implementation is not producing the expected result. There are better answers out there, but hopefully this suffices in the short term.    Embed Quote
