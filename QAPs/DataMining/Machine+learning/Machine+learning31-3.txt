★Will deep learning make other Machine Learning algorithms obsolete?Every once in a while a new algorithms comes and makes all others (in the same domain) seems kind of obsolete when it comes to the same domain. Will deep learning make that related algorithms (backpropagation NN, GMM, HMM, ...)?
No But the real question here is actually:   " is all (machine) learning non-convex"  ? Deep Learning itself is not that well developed, and there is still a lot of work to be done using the more traditional methods of convex optimization and compressed sensing For example, recent work shows it is possible to make a simple, convex formulation of NMF Advances in Convex NMF:  Linear Programming which is essentially a form of compressed sensing for matrix factorization and is very similar to a sparse auto-encoder This leads one to suspect that all auto-encoders might be better if they were sparse and convex For example, since RBM style autoencoders use the log partition formulation , they might be to be reformulated using a method in the spirit of the convex approximation to the Bethe Free Energy: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2624.pdf A good example is the WellSVM method for Semi Supervised and Weakly Labeled Learning.  Here, they take a seemingly fundamentally non-convex problem--the Transductive / SemiSupervised SVM problem, and convert it to a readily solvable min-max problem by a convex relaxation Learning from Weakly Labeled Data Page on esat.kuleuven.be This is a combination of old school techniques (i.e. cutting plane method) + new school understanding of convex optimization Now that does not mean that all learning is simple or that we can just discount  non-linear and non-convex methods.  Still... As to the more complicated Deep Learning networks, I am not yet convinced that " all learning non-convex" because convex optimization itself is a very broad field and it has even been shown that it is possible to reformulate a seemingly very non-convex problem, the molecular electronic Schrodinger equation as a convex optimization (although  can not be solved using standard methods of semi-definate programming) see:  http://news.uchicago.edu/article... If quantum chemistry is convex, why not machine learning?    Embed Quote
