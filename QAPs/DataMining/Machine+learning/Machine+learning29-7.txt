★Why isn't supervised machine learning more automated?
Automation is hard when it comes to feature generation, because some features require clever transformation requiring outside knowldege. For example there is a Kaggle competition I have not done yet, were they predict if a person would survive the Titanic using their records. One big predictor will likely be ethnictiy, which is not explicitly present in the data but can be determined using NLP techniques and a corpus using their last names. (supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised) that can generate new features. I gurantee certain ethnic groups were at a disadvantage but you need to transform the data to see this using an external knowledge source about things such as phonetics and morphology of name spaces.    Embed Quote
