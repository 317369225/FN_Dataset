★What are the limits of machine learning?
There are also some important results from the field of Compressed Sensing Noisy Time Series III: Theoretical Foundations of Compressed Sensing Under what conditions can we re-construct a sparse (or S-sparse), noisy signal f(x) with just a few (m) measurements?    To address this, we have...the Candes-Romber  Theorem (2004) , that states that: Suppose we choose m points randomly out of n.  Then, with high probability, every S-sparse signal   can be reconstructed from , so long as for some absolute constant C. This is saying that we can reconstruct a sparse signal with just a few random samples.  We also have a number of bounds, due to Tao and others,  on the error of our reconstructed function f(x), under certain, well defined, theoretical conditions.   See my blog for more details    Embed Quote
