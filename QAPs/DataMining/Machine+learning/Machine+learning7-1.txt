★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
There have been some very good answers. I will try to summarize my experiences: 1. Machine Learning algorithms work well in a setting where the size of datasets is fairly large. This is a problem in the clinical domain due to privacy issues such as HIPAA etc. 2. Clinical decision making is highly suited for rule-based systems because of the nature of the data, such as ICD-9 codes, medications, etc., which are discrete fields [often boolean] in the Electronic Medical record. Also, rule-based systems have performed extremely well in the past. 3. Every hospital has its own "local language" in terms of abbreviations, administrative setup and other specific details. These cannot generalize across organizations. 4. Physicians using these systems do  not like opaque decision making software which does not show the reason why a particular choice was made. [Decision Trees will be intuitive but SVMs wont]. 5. A good clinical decision relies on knowledge extracted from heterogeneous data sources, such as structured data, [diagnosis codes, procedure codes, medications] unstructured data, [clinical notes] image data [x-rays]. Although AI has advanced individually in each of these fields, there is lack of techniques that can intelligently fuse these together.    Embed Quote
