★What are some good machine learning jokes?
Courtesy of @ML_Hipster and @bigdatahipster I just got kicked out of Barnes and Noble for moving all their classic statistical theory books to the religious section. They call me Dirichlet because all my potential is latent and awaiting allocation Do Neural Networks Dream of Strictly Convex Sheep? Shout out to all those algorithms creating fake Twitter accounts to follow me. You predicted I'd be cool before I was cool. #falsepositive I got this vintage Dirichlet prior at the thrift shop for like $5. There's some light updating on a few corners but otherwise it's like new. Batch algorithms: YOLO*, Online algorithms: Keep Updates and Carry On  (*You Only Learn Once) Tech joke accounts are so mainstream. I'm setting up a @DeepMLHipster account where I tweet ironically about tweeting ironically about ML.    Embed Quote
