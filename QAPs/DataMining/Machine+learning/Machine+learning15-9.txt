★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
I followed Geoffrey Hinton's Coursera's course on Neural Networks and Machine Learning, and there's a phrase of his that stuck with me. He said that machine learning and statistics both handle huge amounts of data. He said however that statistics handles problems where the dimensionality of the problem is of the order of 100 but to go much beyond that, to go to the millions, you need machine learning. When he said this phrase, I think by dimensionality of the problem he was refering to the number of free parameters you needed to, given the data, capture the feacture that you wanted to capture, or solve the problem you wanted to solve. So for comparison, if I give you data that I secretly generated according to a gaussian distribution but I don't tell you the mean and variance that I used to generated the data, then the problem of finding what mean and variance would fit the data that I give you better, that is a problem of fitting two parameters. Notice that in this way of thinking of "given some data, how many parameters do I need to capture a certain feature", then the number of parameters that you need depend not just on the data but also on the feature that you want to capture. So according to what I understood from him, if this number goes to the millions, the technics of statistics just don't work. EDIT: I used here "machine learning", but I think he had in his mind "neural networks"    Embed Quote
