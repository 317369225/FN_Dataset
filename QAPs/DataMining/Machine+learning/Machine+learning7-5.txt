★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
Ironically the differential diagnosis in the other answer gives an example of the kind of reasoning that statistics/ml is very good at and people are not. Note that in the example, there are a large number of potential causes of particular symptom, each with a different background prevalence in the population, which is followed up by a fairly well defined set of questions (with mostly discrete answers) and procedures to gather supporting evidence in a way to reduce uncertainty. This kind of reasoning is modeled by graphical models and decision theory. I think the reason computers are not used is the following: 1. The actual practice of building and testing a system like this built on top of research results and putting into place in life or death medical situations would be extremely difficult. This kind of productization is always difficult because research is viable if a system "often works" but products generally require "(almost) always works", the difference between these can be vast. Even if on average the system was much better than a human (which it might be), Doctors are generally liable even for a single very bad decision. The computerized system would most certainly have these cases, who would you sue? 2. Such a system would be very good about reasoning about complex cases but would be useless at handling things outside its model. Basically any outside information that humans have would not be available. For example if you can tell by looking at someone that they are a drug addict, that might be very important information, but that would not be possible for the computer. Despite these problems I think it might be possible to build a system which could do exact probabilistic reasoning and had a vast database of precisely gathered probabilities, which could play a supporting role for doctors similar to how a calculator is used by people to support arithmetic calculations.    Embed Quote
