★Who are the rising stars in machine learning?This is a follow-up question to Who are the rising stars in theoretical computer science?
David Sontag (David Sontag) is a professor at NYU who focuses on applying machine learning to medicine (which is my particular research interest). The man is brilliant and quite young. I actually met him when we both attended at talk by Vinod Khosla at The Rockefeller University (Rockefeller University) about the future of technology in healthcare. I randomly struck up conversation with him in the bathroom after the talk and proceeded to be amazed by everything he had to say. He's definitely someone to keep your eye on.    Embed Quote
