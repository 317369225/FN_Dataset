★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
My company, Votizen is currently hiring a founding engineer, the listing is here: http://votizen.com/jobs/ We're working on both fixing democracy, and disrupting the $8B lobbying market. There are a lot of political/democracy startups right now, but we've got the right approach, the right industry experience, and we've convinced some serious investors to back us, like Peter Thiel, Sean Parker, Keith Rabois, Aydin Senkut, Chris Dixon (entrepreneur), Eric Paley, Mark Goines, Tim Connors, Dave McClure, Steve Blank, David Cowan, Eric Ries, Tom Shields, and Shervin Pishevar. My co-founder David Binetti created http://usa.gov and has been in the space for 15 years, he knows what works, and what doesn't. Since it's an early role, we need a generalist, but NLP/ML is crucial to several of the problems we're solving. The application is on the link above, or you can write me.    Embed Quote
