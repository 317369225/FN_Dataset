★How do I learn machine learning?
See this talk by Jeremy Howard : At Kaggle, It’s a Disadvantage To Know Too Much and “Getting In Shape For The Sport Of Data Science” Start by practicing on toy datasets in MATLAB and walking through simple examples in Statistics and Neural Network Toolbox Below two books are standard introduction texts. They are complementary,   the first one is written from a statistician perspective with lots of data analysis examples and the second one is focusing on algorithms. Both are graduate level texts requiring knowledge of algebra, statistics and calculus. It would also help to take a  class on optimization but not strictly necessary. The texts are: 1)  Hastie, Tibshirani & Friedman, The elements of statistical learning : http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ti...  2) Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning: http://research.microsoft.com/en... For a more gentle read you may want to check out the textbook by Mitchell (edit:  and his lectures, thanks to Willy Kuo) The most coherent and concise lecture notes are by Ng,   also see his courseSome applications and advanced topics: Language analysis course and notes Deep learning: ANN + UFLDL + CNN + ELM tutorials Robotics and Game AI Cognition and Neural models Lifelong learning    Embed Quote
