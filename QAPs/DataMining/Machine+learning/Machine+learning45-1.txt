★What are some good learning projects to teach oneself about machine learning?This is a follow-up question to How do I learn machine learning?.
Best way to learn is to implement it yourself. When you read through a topic in a Machine Learning book, it's very easy to fall into a trap of thinking that you got it. But if you try to re-derive the proof to that trivial theorem, or implement that simple algorithm yourself, you will often find that you can't. This process of going back and forth until you can leads to actual understanding. So my suggestion for a project is: start writing your own little Machine Learning library. Alternatively, you can go through papers that you find interesting, and attempt to reproduce their results.    Embed Quote
