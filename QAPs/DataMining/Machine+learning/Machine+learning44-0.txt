★What is a good book on machine learning / data mining to give to a layman?Specifically, I am looking for a book for people who are interested to know why this is interesting, but not to implement any actual programs.
Although it is missing all of the figures, this book is awesome: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/... Also, check out the lectures that I uploaded to github: https://github.com/josephmisiti/... the PDFs/exercises in there are very informative. Good luck.    Embed Quote
