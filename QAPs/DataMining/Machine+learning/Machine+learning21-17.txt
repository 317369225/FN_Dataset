★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
I am now taking the initial steps, and I found this post by Ravi Mohan to be very useful: http://pindancing.blogspot.in/20... I completed the AI class http://www.ai-class.com. It was very interesting but I clearly missed many insights for want of deeper math knowledge. Working on it now.. A few online courses that might help: Logic: https://www.coursera.org/course/... Probability: http://itunes.apple.com/us/cours... AI basics: http://www.ai-class.com ML basics: https://www.coursera.org/course/ml (ml-class.org in its previous avatar, but now redirects) This upcoming course might be useful as well: Statistics by Sebastian Thrun: http://www.udacity.com/overview/...    Embed Quote
