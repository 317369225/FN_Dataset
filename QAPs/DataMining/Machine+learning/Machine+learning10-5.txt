★Python for Machine Learning?
There are many modules in python for ML type of stuff. (What are the best open source machine learning libraries written in Python?) Mainly to really appreciate the numpy and scipy modules you should read a bit about linear algebra. BTW you dont learn python for ML, you actually learn ML and use python. Take a basic or advanced course on ML. For resources on Machine learning you can take andrew ng's ML class from coursera for a start(also do the programming assignments). For more advanced resources on ML Best machine learning Resources(for non-experts :P)    Embed Quote
