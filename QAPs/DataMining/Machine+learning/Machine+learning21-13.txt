★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
Mathematics is the basic source of Machine Learning. Machine Learning is an intercross subject. These mathematics courses such as Linear algebra, Probability and Statistics, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Functional Analysis, Topology, Manifold theory are related to it.   If you want to study it well you have to spend most time reading many books and resources, and you need a good platform to practice, especially if you want to create some your own algorithms or solutions.   Most people I know only knew the concepts of Machine Learning or only knew how to call the algorithms which were writed by others after had studied it.    I want to recommend the Stanford Machine Learning video resource (http://itunes.apple.com/us/itune...) which is the best one for beginner.   In addition, these books as blow are very good mathmatics reference books: [1]Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fourth Edition by Gilbert Strang [2]Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis (6th Edition) by Richard A. Johnson and Dean W. Wichern [3]Principles of Mathematical Analysis, by Walter Rudin   It is well known that these mathematics courses and algorithms are very abstract and are very difficult to study. Fortunately, we have MATLAB, via it we can learn mathematics and complex algorithms by debugging programs. Therefore, I also recommend MATLAB to you.    Embed Quote
