★What are currently the hot topics in Machine Learning research and in real applications?Currently, there are many topics in ML research which are/can be used widely in real applications. I wonder what are key topics which we should focus doing research and studying.
The three current hot topics in ML would be: 1) Deep Learning: Mostly, the computational capacity proved as a barrier in the past. With advancement in HPC, the neural networks can now learn from deeper layers and this definitely is the term to watch out for. 2) Hybrid Models using Machine Learning: Most practitioners have an unsaid consensus that pure ML may not be a viable way to solve problems as it can be expensive yet not 100% accurate. Owing to this, hybrid models (combination of traditional CS principles married to ML models) are fast catching up. 3) Interdisciplinary Application of ML: This has been a hot topic for a while. But of late, researchers have started to look beyond the usual (BFSI or Retail sectors) to apply ML.    Embed Quote
