★What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?
I think you are putting too much emphasis on the algorithms and programming and not enough on understanding of the problem and the business side. I notice that some of my PhD students fails immensely in thinking out of the meaning behind the numbers they are crunching, specially if the problem is open and ill-posed. Try to ask questions about "suppose you want to increase ROI on a digital marketing campaign. What steps will you take and the adequate data processing methodologies do you envisage?" Another thing is being able to spot bias statistical analysis. It may seem obvious, but you will get surprise by some answers. I think the industry is too much focus on computer science geeks. There are plenty of talent from other fields as long as they have the curiosity and cleverness to learn ML. As a Physicist myself, I coordinate in my company a bunch of people from all areas, and I can tell you the physicist are the best (if you allow some time to climb the learning curve).    Embed Quote
