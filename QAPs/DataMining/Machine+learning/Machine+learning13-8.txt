★How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people?
Machines do not learn like people.  Machines don't have five senses all mapped together to form a sense of the real world.  They are more like blind, deaf, paralyzed entities with good, fast brains.  Everything has to be reduced to the only kind of thing they can sense, called "data", and usually arranged in way they can understand. What a machine learning program can do is assemble all this data as if it were a landscape, and it wants to climb as high as it can.  It tries all kinds of paths until and keeps climbing a long as the path goes "uphill".  The machine may also tolerate some downhill if it cannot find an uphill direction.  The machine designer makes up the things that determine "uphill" from "downhill".  The landscape is called a fitness landscape and may be far more complicated than a real landscape.  For example, it may have many dimensions, not just the 3 that we live in.  If the landscape is not well designed, the machine may stumble around forever and not find anything higher than a molehill.  Or it may find the nearest mountain, but ignore a much higher one next door.  But humans also make those mistakes. Evolution works along the lines of fitness landscapes, too.  In that case, the height of the mountain is equivalent to survival and procreation.    Embed Quote
