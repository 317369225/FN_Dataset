★What are the most interesting open-source projects in artificial intelligence and machine learning?What projects should people be paying attention to and studying?
Nupic (http://numenta.org/nupic.html) by Jeff Hawkin's company Numenta. It is an implementation of Jeff's neuroscience-inspired theories of how the brain (specifically, the neocortex) work, as described in his book On Intelligence and in his academic papers. The main theory is called the Cortical Learning Algorithm. The Nupic project proceeded in secret for many years, but was released as open source last year to invite a wider audience to contribute.    Embed Quote
