★How do I learn machine learning?
I think the easiest way to learn any skill is the same: entering the learn-practice loop. You learn either by taking ML course in MOOC or read a decent book. You practice by digging into http://kaggle.com, or any other projects interest you. Machine learning is relatively hard in that beginners need to find a way to make each iteration biteable. If you want to learn web development or C++ programming, you may go any online course or any book in amazon. But for machine learning, most of the book recommended, like PRML, can't be read thoroughly for beginners. They could be finished in several iterations. Otherwise, one can easily get frustrated. The same apply to most real time project(the practice part). If you understand the above and find your own method of getting into 'the loop', you'll be learning like a machine :)    Embed Quote
