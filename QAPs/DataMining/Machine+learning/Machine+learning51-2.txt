★What are the connections between machine learning and signal processing?
There are a few areas of overlap. Let's talk about the theoretical, and then the practical. Theoretical There is one person who really stands out as a bridge between machine learning and signal processing, and that is Claude Shannon. Shannon's work on Information theory is important to both fields. In particular, measures like entropy and mutual information that were originally thought of as being for how to transmit signals over distances also have many applications in machine learning, including decision trees (for example, ID3) as a form of compression, and measuring the compactness of a description. Practical At a practical level, machine learning and signal processing are frequently combined. The most common relationship is that signal processing is used as a preprocessing step before the application of machine learning. For example in speech, signal processing (things like the short-term fourier transform) is used to produce the spectrogram such as the one below ("nineteenth century"): From there, machine learning techniques like hidden Markov models (possibly with neural network based observation models) do the classification. Signal processing approaches are also used extensively in image processing and object recognition for vision.    Embed Quote
