★How does one start writing practical machine learning programs?
In today's world, unless you specifically want to rewrite established algorithms, I would suggest you focus on implementing some of the many machine learning algorithm APIs. Many are free at low volume levels and you can create your own specialized web crawler (e.g., find all of the classic chevy 3100 pickups for sale). This can be taken as deeply as you have the time to invest. At first, your crawler would be little better than a Google search. Over time you could teach it to move beyond the level of a browser-based search. You could work on getting the crawler to parse the text of the pages where such vehicles are listed to recognize attributes (classifiers) that are of interest. This is still in the simple search space, but teaching the crawler the interrelationships between your base attributes will begin to lift your results above standard search results. Teaching your crawler to examine the images would be another, more challenging enhancement. Teaching it to recognize the specific models and years, through feature extraction, would teach you some things as well. In short, you learn how things work by implementing the technology. Today's tools are so sophisticated that you can begin working with machine learning in simple settings and build to very advanced levels. You do need to understand the underlying mathematics. Many of the horror stories of machine learning implementations can be traced back to a lack of understanding, or misapplication, of the base algorithms.    Embed Quote
