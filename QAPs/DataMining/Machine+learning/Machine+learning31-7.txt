★Will deep learning make other Machine Learning algorithms obsolete?Every once in a while a new algorithms comes and makes all others (in the same domain) seems kind of obsolete when it comes to the same domain. Will deep learning make that related algorithms (backpropagation NN, GMM, HMM, ...)?
My guess is that won't. In theory, when we talk about how good an algorithm is we are mostly talking about certain favorable properties of it given certain assumptions - this translates to good performance off-the-shelf in the average case. For example we talk about SVMs being very strong classifiers in general; implying that if we were to try it out for some data, more often than not we would end up with good results. Possibly not the best, but good. Apart from doing well in the average case the algorithm may have it own niche which is an added bonus. But for a specific case, depending upon the precise domain, the kind of data you have and the quantity of data you have other algorithms might do better. For ex. I have seen cases where something as simple as Multinomial Naive Bayes has trumped SVMs, has done better than preprocessing text data with LSI, etc.    Embed Quote
