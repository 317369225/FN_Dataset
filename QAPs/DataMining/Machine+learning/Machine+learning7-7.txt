★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
Great article with great links: "Most engineers and computers scientists with whom I’ve spoken  conceptualize medicine as primarily a rational, evidence-based,  problem-solving enterprise focused on well-defined conditions, rather  than a discipline that in my experience owes more to scientism than  science, is far more ambiguous than most engineers tend to recognize,  and is founded on relationships, connectedness, trusted advice,  reassurance, and frequently the off-loading of significant  responsibilities from patient to doctor." from http://blogs.forbes.com/davidsha...    Embed Quote
