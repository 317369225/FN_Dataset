★What are some good learning projects to teach oneself about machine learning?This is a follow-up question to How do I learn machine learning?.
I  highly recommend the Programming Collective Intelligence (http://amzn.com/0596529325) book if you  are more of coder type than the theory guy. It teaches you the basics  without beating around the bush. It has got number of projects into it given along with the code. I suggest you try implementing them yourself and you will learn a many things. But that will not be enough. If you want to apply those techniques effectively you need to understand them inside out. I have found this book very useful (http://alex.smola.org/drafts/the...) . It takes you from basic concepts to advanced once step by step and logically connecting each step with good mathematical rigor.    Embed Quote
