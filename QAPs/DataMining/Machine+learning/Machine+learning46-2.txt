★What is the relationship between machine learning and the scientific method?Scientists follow "the scientific method" to arrive at conclusions about data, although there has been much debate about what exactly this method consists of. Machine learning also arrives at (tentative) conclusions about data - is there a relationship between the two?
This article by Gelman and Shalizi is about Bayesian methods and the practice of science, but I think applies to your question about machine learning: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~ge... The basic idea Popper had is still right. One proposes a hypothesis and then attempts to falsify it. With Bayesian or machine learning methods you are starting with a whole family of hypotheses instead of just one, and then using that formalism to select the best members of the family. But once you have those best hypotheses you still have to try and falsify them, because maybe you chose the wrong family to begin with.    Embed Quote
