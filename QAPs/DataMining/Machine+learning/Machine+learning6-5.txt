★What are the best graduate schools for studying machine learning?
Some of the most interesting theoretical and applied research in statistical machine learning, IMHO, is coming out the Toyota Technological Institute (TTI) at the University of Chicago. Both deep theory as well as really practical software that one can actually use in industry. This includes, for example, the development of the SVMLin program (by the late professor Niyogi) for transductive learning, Machine Learning with Missing Labels:  Transductive SVMs   the Pegasos solver (Primal Subgradient Solver for L1 SVMs) , Steven Smale's work in the theory of learning (Smale has a Fields Medal), plus work on maximum margin matrix factorization, latent SVMs, and so on. Also, recall that Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was invented at Chicago.  There is also some great work at Chicago in general on large scale parallel computing (the Swift language, something other than map reduce) among other things.    I myself am not at Chicago anymore so I can't say how good the graduate program is for students (or budding entrepreneurs), although Chicago has always been primarily a graduate research institution.    Embed Quote
