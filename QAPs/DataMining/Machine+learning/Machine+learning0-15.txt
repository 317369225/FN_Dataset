★How do I learn machine learning?
Wow!  The most important book in the field is missing Vapnik "The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory" http://www.amazon.com/Statistica... http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi... Vapnik basically invented modern machine learning .  SVMs. VC Theory.  Transductive Inference.  Kernel Learning Even if you can't follow the math..read the prose.. Also, read Smale (you know, that guy at University of Chicago who has the Fields Medal, the Wolf prize, and wrote your undergrad text on Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems) http://www.ams.org/notices/20030... Finally, read the late Niyogi http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~n... plus my blog (shameless post) Machine Learning    Embed Quote
