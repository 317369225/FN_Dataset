★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
Personally, I see Machine Learning (ML) as a field distinct from statistics. Most ML approach do, however relies heavily on concepts in statistics. But that doesn't necessary imply that ML is basically statistics with a fancier name. Case in point: neural networks has nothing to do with statistics. However, statistics is actually "closer" to mathematics (but not considered to be a part of mathematics field). In that sense, statistics is "purer" than ML. Statisticians often do not heavily emphasize implementation details and dealing with efficiency. ML people often have to implement their approach and make sure it runs within reasonable time. Therefore, there is more emphasis on efficiency and how to approximate a solution. I tend to think that ML was branch off from computer science (CS) and when artificial intelligence (AI) took off. As the dataset grows larger than ever, ML started to become more like statistics as ML people started stealing (I mean borrow) ideas from statistics (resulting in Statistical Machine Learning). Modern ML of today has ideas rooted in physics, calculus, statistics, neuroscience and etc. Some ppl say ML is basically sub branch of AI with focus on learning. In turns, AI is a sub branch of CS. Most fields in CS are a combination of science, engineering and art and ML is no different. You can do ML in a pure-scientific way (Read: lots of proofs) but I do not consider that as a ML research. I would say that it's more like doing mathematics research. If you like a simplistic visualization of what I just said (Read: TL/DR): Machine Learning = science + engineering + art Statistics = science + art I could be way off the mark here but this is what I think.    Embed Quote
