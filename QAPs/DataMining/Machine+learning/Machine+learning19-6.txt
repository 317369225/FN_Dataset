★What were the Top 10 problems in Machine Learning for 2013?
Future research will be on large scale learning. This will involve hybrid solutions based on cloud storage and real time streaming engines. Some 10 years ago, the availability of data was the limiting factor but now the availability of optimized algorithms and scalable architectures are proving limiting factor. A hybrid solution based on new architectures and combing techniques with statistical data analysis, computer science and machine learning will form the basis of most of the research efforts in next few years    Embed Quote
