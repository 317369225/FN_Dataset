Search results for you query are retrieved and ranked by various algorithms like Page rank, Vector Space, Relevance feedback, tf - idf scoring etc... So in order to mix these results and get the best set machine learning is used to assign a specific weight to each of these ranking schemes and finally use that to get a relevance scoring and give you the best set of results ( Last time I checked bing was using 46 such variables Microsoft LETOR 4.0).
