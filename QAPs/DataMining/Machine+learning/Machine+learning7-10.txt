★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
I think the reliable automation of diagnosis to the point that it could replace an actual physician is still in the science fiction realm, and will remain there for some time yet.  However, in my work which is directly related to clinical technologies and automation I learned that we can make a tremendous progress by automating measurements (diagnostic tests) that one needs to make to come up with an accurate diagnosis.  If we focus on not replacing physician, but rather on making his/her job easier by providing more precise/accurate measurements, faster and with fewer false-positives and false-negatives, then the "automated diagnosis" is not so futuristic anymore.  The problem is that practically all clinical diagnostic tests are unreliable, some more so, some less.  Even many genetic tests leave a wide "grey area", and many commonly used test have high rate of false-positives and -negatives.  The problem frequently stems from high biologic variability intra-subject, inter-subject, due to external factors and due to the method of measuring of this biologic signal.   In addition, computer technologies can be used to take much more data into account per subject than was previously possible.  The increased amount of data can both increase the precision, and provide new insight into the disease/condition.  In conclusion, the computer science community can impact the healthcare and diagnostics by focusing on making better measurements, rather than trying to replace what is actually working very well - the intellect and experience of highly trained and dedicated professionals.    Embed Quote
