★Why are there so few machine learning and natural language processing startups?Do PhDs actively avoid starting companies? With so many applications in the research literature and so much progress being made, what is stopping people from starting companies based on these technologies? There seem to be many companies in India and China working in this area but nearly none in Silicon Valley.  Why?
The question is not properly framed. ML and NLP are technologies that can be used to create a product/solution that solves a user/customer need. They are used in conjunction with a lot of other technologies to create a "whole" product. The end product is what any company usually strives to be known for - not for the technologies it uses to build the solution. ML is used by many companies for problems ranging from content-recommendation, video/image pattern recognition, search, Q&A services, ad-targeting etc. None of these companies would like to be known as just a "ML/NLP" company (except when hiring ML experts). The scaling issue raised in other answers is a red herring. There are many ML techniques that scale fine, and there are many companies that have ML needs that dont need Google-size scaling.    Embed Quote
