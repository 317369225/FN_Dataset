★What is the best machine learning algorithm?
The question is so stupid that if i was to run a supervised learning algorithm on all the questions in Quora it would rate this as the best of the best case scenario to classify it as a stupid question. On the other hand if I was to run an unsupervised algorithm on all questions in Quora then I would distinctly find that my clustered data with all the stupid questions would be centered around this question. Cmon dude. Do you know any Learning algorithms at all or are you trying to save yourself some time by just going through what you feel you might need more often than not ??? Quit that attitude. Like Zulfikar Ramzan says you use what you find useful to solve your problem. This question is like asking yourself which part of my body is the best. Without any of them you are seriously impaired.    Embed Quote
