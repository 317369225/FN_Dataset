★What is the relationship between machine learning and the scientific method?Scientists follow "the scientific method" to arrive at conclusions about data, although there has been much debate about what exactly this method consists of. Machine learning also arrives at (tentative) conclusions about data - is there a relationship between the two?
I think there's a very close relationship between data mining and the scientific method.  Both try to explain observed phenomena by proposing and validating possible causal mechanisms.  Both  depend heavily on the goals: 1) maximizing signal (what is known), 2) minimizing uncertainty (what is irrelevant and/or unknown), and 3) disentangling dependencies among components in the proposed mechanism that generates the data in order to a) identify the signal(s) you care about, and b) identify the cause for that signal. But machine learning seems a bit different. Almost all theML  methods I've seen do not care about C goal (discovery).  Identifying the origin of the signal that has been observed and elucidating its mechanisms are of secondary importance at best.  Most/all of the ML I've seen seems to emphasize optimization between known connections more than discovery of new ones.    Embed Quote
