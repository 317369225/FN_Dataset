★What are the best graduate schools for studying machine learning?
Like Danny says, ML is a very big field. One cannot really generalize now.  Barring CMU which has stalwarts in several sub-areas like graphical models, semi-supervised learning, learning theory, most other schools have their core competencies. For instance, Alberta has a great RL [Reinforcement learning ] dept. Please note that we are talking about the best schools and  so,  even though the aforementioned schools have faculty in other  areas too,  the area that stands out  in case of Alberta is  RL . For graphical models, Berkeley and Cambridge and UCL (mainly due to Gatsby Lab)  [Thanks to Danny for the edit] do great work. U of Toronto is pretty amazing,  mostly for theoretical ML and ML techniques applied to Vision (they work on  all levels of Vision). Similiarly, for ML in NLP, UMCP is  one oft-overlooked place.  It has some great people  and they do good work. [Philip Resnik, Doug Oard, Jimmy Lin, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Hal Daume III and more]. UMass Amherst has Hanna Wallach now and together with Andrew McCullum and his group, they are gonna be in the news for several good reasons in the future.   If you are statistically inclined,  take a look at UBC too.  These are just a few examples and i hope the point that  classifying some school as good/awesome/mind-blowing in Machine Learning is just not gonna cut it anymore is clear. Update: About UBC, Nando De Freitas left for Oxford btw, and Kevin Murphy for Google.    Embed Quote
