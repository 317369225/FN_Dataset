★How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning?What books, topics, resources are one stop for learning all mathematics necessary to start learning Machine Learning?
It depends on your goals you want to achieve while learning ML. Goal 1: To understand what is ML, how to apply different algorithms to the task, how interpret the output,common pitfalls etc : You will need to have a grasp on linear & matrix algebra,probability and optimization. You don't need to take a deep dive into each one, but study basic things like eigen vectors,conditional probability,distributions, bayes theorem.Additionally learn the concepts of overfitting, cross validation. Resources Video Lectures : Machine learning on coursera ( not only the  one by AndrewNg, there are few others as well) Books : Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell. It includes the necessary linear algebra and probability too. Goal2:Why the current algorithms are designed in a particular way, How do they fundamentally differ from each other: If you are more interested in the theoritical aspects like how kernels of  a support vector machine are defined, or how deep learning neural networks are designed or how to tweak the existing algorithms to make a new one,then you might want to extend your mathematics to functional analysis, topology , advanced optimization. Resources : Video: Advanced Machine learning, Caltech (Prof. Mostafa's Lecture) Books : Mining of massive datasets by ullman, Any good books on advanced linear algebra, topology but they wont connect it to machine learning.    Embed Quote
