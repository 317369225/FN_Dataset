★What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?I am a learner sitting at home and learning linear algebra. Very interested in working in Machine Learning someday, but not sure: a) What technical skills are needed for an interview/job. b) Any relevant mandatory work experience. I have taken an initiative to at least start rather than just think about doing it so any suggestion/guidance would be very helpful and appreciated.
This is undoubtedly 'The' place to begin - https://www.coursera.org/course/ml Good Luck !    Embed Quote
