★What are currently the hot topics in Machine Learning research and in real applications?Currently, there are many topics in ML research which are/can be used widely in real applications. I wonder what are key topics which we should focus doing research and studying.
I like Josephs answer but I'd add ensemble methods, in particular Random Forests and gradient Boosted regression trees. Random forests are conceptionally simple but are very powerful and robust black-box methods. Also, Random forests naturally adapt to quite a lot of different tasks: missing values, mixture for categorial and continuous variables, multi label, structured labels, loss-based learning, ....
