★Why isn't supervised machine learning more automated?
One issue is that "best practices" aren't quite standard enough yet. The trick is to come up with something that's "off-the-shelf" enough to be easy but allows enough customization to be useful. Decision Trees and Linear Regression can work with pretty much any dataset-it's easy to just throw these algorithms at whatever you have. You could certainly make a program that lets you easily create an ensemble of these, and that's pretty much available off-the-shelf with scikit-learn (scikit-learn: machine learning in Python) Neural Networks, SVMs, and Deep Learning take significantly more preprocessing. For SVMs I think the preprocessing is fairly standard at this point, so someone could just write a tweakable program to do so. For Neural Networks it's harder, and for Deep Learning it's currently very difficult.    Embed Quote
