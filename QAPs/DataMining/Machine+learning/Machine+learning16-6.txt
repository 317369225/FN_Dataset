★What is the beauty of Machine Learning?Why all of a sudden all programmers are interested in Machine Learning?
What got me interested was the realization that there are major limits to what we can explicitly program into a computer.  For computers to reach their full potential as tools, they need to have the ability to figure some things out themselves.  There just aren't enough programmers to build software for all the potential applications.  Also, many things, like natural language or vision, can't be programmed at all.  They are just too nuanced and can't be defined precisely.  The only way computers can tackle these problems is by learning.    Embed Quote
