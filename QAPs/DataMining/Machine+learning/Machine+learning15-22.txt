★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
Adding to Jacob's answer: Statistics is the basis for all machine learning, so the distinction really is in naming and tradition. Statistics tends to deal with things that can be calculated well. Machine learning tends to deal with things that are not as easy to fully calculate. In machine learning you rely on things like training and iteration, where you try minimize error. You may get different results each time you train. With stats you carry out definitive calculations and get definitive answers that generally doesn't change. Of course this is a broad generalization and you could easily find counter-examples on either side, but it gives a general flavor.    Embed Quote
