★Will deep learning make other Machine Learning algorithms obsolete?Every once in a while a new algorithms comes and makes all others (in the same domain) seems kind of obsolete when it comes to the same domain. Will deep learning make that related algorithms (backpropagation NN, GMM, HMM, ...)?
There are at least two senses in which deep learning will not make other ML algorithms obsolete: 1. For many applications, far simpler algorithms like logistic regression or support vector machine will work just fine, and using a deep belief network will only complicate things. 2. While deep belief networks are one of the best domain-agnostic algorithms, if one has domain knowledge then many other algorithms (such as HMMs for speech recognition, wavelets for images, etc.) can outperform them. There is some work being done to incorporate such domain knowledge into neural network models, but it is certainly not yet enough to fully replace all other models and algorithms.    Embed Quote
