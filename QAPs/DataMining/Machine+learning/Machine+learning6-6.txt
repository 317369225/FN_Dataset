★What are the best graduate schools for studying machine learning?
Stanford, CMU, Cornell, MIT and Princeton are well known, especially Stanford. It also tends to be well worked upon in a school which does a lot of work in Statistics, AI, Algorithms and Mathematics. The NLP (Christopher Manning and Daniel Jurafsky) and Network Analysis (Jure Leskovec) groups at Stanford are well tied with the ML (Andrew Ng) group, and together they publish a ton of work. From Statistics, we've got Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman who deal with the statistical aspect of it. All 7 of these professors are big names in this field. Not to think I'm biased, but do check out these pages and their respective publications to get a very good sense of how comprehensive their work is: http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs... http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ti... http://www.stanford.edu/class/st... http://nlp.stanford.edu/ http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/ http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/mann... http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/ http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/ http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~jhf/    Embed Quote
