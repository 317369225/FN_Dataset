★What is the beauty of Machine Learning?Why all of a sudden all programmers are interested in Machine Learning?
It pays the bills. Sorry if this doesn't fit your definition of beautiful. Most people get into machine learning because its the most sought after skill in the industry. It involves a lot of number-crunching that computers are remarkable at, and so has low barrier to entry for programmers who can tame the machine well. ML also solves problems in industries where programmers are typically already employed, so there's the proximity factor. There's no denying that the algorithm-design and math in machine learning is beautiful, but thats not why programmers are interested in it. If this were so, programmers would also be interested in algebraic topology. Why is it so highly demanded in the industry? What hitherto unsolved problem does it solve? Well, thats a different question and you'll find an excellent answer here: Pararth Shah's answer to How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people? Machine Learning/ Big Data is today what HTML/web-development was in 2001. Only, I suspect it will last longer.    Embed Quote
