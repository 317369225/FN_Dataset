★What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?
Ensembles of learning algorithms. In principle depending on the agregating algorithm choosen no single class/pred algo method should provide a better result. Caveats: Ensembling algorithms is more an art than a science. You expect in princple that the errors in some algos are corrected by the good ones via the ensemble. Diversity of methods employed is therefore key.  However it is complex as per overfitting and making sure pred/class via regression is properly done and this is really a complex task.    Embed Quote
