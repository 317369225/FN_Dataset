★Why isn't supervised machine learning more automated?
There have been attempts to do the same (Refer examples below) and the practice is progressing towards the trend.  This being said here are the current challenges to automation. 1. Feature Engineering : This is probably 70% of the effort for Data Science. This is difficult to automate as this requires human judgement. While , it is probably a matter of time when the heuristics associated to creating the right feature set can be put into software , it does not exist today. 2. Computing power :Although we have a lot of compute power today , And, theoretically you could just compute your way out of all the decisions a data scientist needs to make by traversing all paths for creating the model ,We still do not have as much compute power available that can replace the data scientist. Note that optimizing a Deep Learning Model can be as compute intensive as decoding an RSA Cryptography key.  You need a Data scientist to navigate the model building process in an optimal way.
