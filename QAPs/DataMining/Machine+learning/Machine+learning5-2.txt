★How does Quora use machine learning?
I recently completed my class of Machine Learning on Coursera delivered by Prof. Andrew Ng, Stanford Univ. From whatever the knowledge I've gained thorough the course I can now see that Quora does use Machine learning. 1: When showing a question, on the right side we do see Related Questions. That is a very trivial clustering problem which can be addressed using K-mean, at least on basic level. In clustering problem we try to find some kind of homogeneity in a data set and divide them in a finite number of clusters. 2: When we follow a new question it again recommends us some new and related topics to follow. Such recommendation can also be generated. I had a programming exercise during the course on creating a basic recommendation system using collaborative filtering. A somewhat modified approach can be applied in this case also. My above answer is totally based on the knowledge I gained through the course. Machine learning is my latest crush in computer science and our romance is still starting up. So kindly don't mistake me of being a expert in the field if there is something wrong about the points I made above.    Embed Quote
