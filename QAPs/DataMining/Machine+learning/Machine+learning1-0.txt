★What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?
Identifying the top 10 algorithms in the abstract is a pretty complicated exercise unless there is a clear dimension to make the comparison. Popularity? Usefulness? Research merit? Let me tackle this from a pretty subjective point of view: If I were interviewing you for a Data Mining position what would be the top 10 algorithms I would expect you to know in order of priority? Linear regression Logistic regression k-means SVMs Random Forests Matrix Factorization/SVD Gradient Boosted Decision Trees/Machines Naive Bayes Artificial Neural Networks For the last one I'd let you pick one of the following: Bayesian Networks Elastic Nets Any other clustering algo besides k-means LDA Conditional Random Fields HDPs or other Bayesian non-parametric model Again, a pretty subjective list, but I think it is quite representative of what you need to do real data mining work in industry.    Embed Quote
