★What's the easiest way to learn machine learning?
I'm starting my second year as a CS student in Amsterdam and over the summer I worked on  Andrew Ng's Coursera course and I can't recommend it enough for the following reasons: Andrew Ng is a brilliant lecturer and makes even a topic as complicated as this easy to follow. The course is very well organized to help students with time management. Weekly lectures are split into 6-20 min videos, which makes it really easy to watch one or two and take notes whenever you have a spare moment on your hands. The amount of material covered per week is is very balanced and will not overburden you. I only heard about this course three weeks into it but was still able to catch up with the rest of the group and meet about half of the given deadlines. The course is also very well gamified to increase student motivation. You really, really want to finish the programming exercises in time to avoid the 20% penalty to the exercise score! The course forums are a great place to get help either from fellow students or community TA's if you get stuck with a programming exercise. This is the first ML course I've taken and in addition to learning the basics of ML techniques, thanks to this course I was able to brush up on my previously quasi non-existent matrix calculations skills, brush up on linear algebra, learn more about statistical analysis and even learn the programming language Octave. I have to say that this makes me more than satisfied with what I got out from this one single course.    Embed Quote
