★What are the best graduate schools for studying machine learning?
First, I have a language bias in my answer; I'll give higher priority to places with strong people at the intersection of machine learning and linguistics. Other folks have given the obvious answers: Stanford, Berkeley, CMU, Columbia, UW, and MIT.  These guys are in a class by themselves. There are many folks in the next tier (in no particular order): TTI, Alberta, UBC, Madison, Edinburgh, Duke, UT Austin, UMass, Michigan, U Penn, ETH, UCSC, Hopkins, Toronto, UCSD, Brown, UCL, Georgia Tech, Cambridge, Oxford, Cornell.  A handful of very good professors and a good track record of turning out excellent PhD students.  And there are probably some that I've forgotten (sorry!). But, as other commenters have said, it is your individual fit with an advisor that matters more than anything else.  There are many great professors who are the world expert in their fields who aren't at machine learning powerhouses (e.g., Yisong Yue at Caltech, Mark Johnson at Macquarie).  The bottom line is to find the professors who do the work you want to do and to go wherever they are. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Maryland and Colorado, who have an excellent track record of hiring professors named Jordan Boyd-Graber, which is in my opinion the most important criteria for comparing universities. :)  Also, I'm looking to hire 4-5 graduate students for fall 2015.  (Link to apply to CU Computer Science.)    Embed Quote
