★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
20n (http://20n.com) is hiring in SF. We build algorithms that engineer bacteria and yeast! 20n’s technology will make industrial biotech into a computational science. We are building a machine learning and data mining system that predicts what DNA inserts allow the engineering of yeast and bacteria to ferment out valuable chemicals, instead of beer. We demonstrated the system works by creating a bacteria that excretes Tylenol. We are looking at polymer materials and important therapeutics next. We have a three year runway from DARPA (remember: the people who brought you ARPAnet, GPS, mother-of-all-demos, and the self-driving grand challenges). The startup is a spinout from Berkeley with a core CS technical team and great biotech collaborators lined up. We are looking for experienced machine learning people who want to work on substantive projects with an impact way beyond the digital world. In the next three years, we will create a thousand new microbes creating chemicals of fundamental importance to industrial biotech, pharma, and the chemical industry. What can be more exciting than having the output of your machine learning system go directly into building new living things?! Check us out at http://20n.com or email jobs@20n.com.    Embed Quote
