★Natural Language Processing: What startups are hiring engineers with strengths in machine learning/NLP?
BloomReach (in Mountain View, California) is hiring. We have an amazingly strong team of about 20 engineers in machine learning, NLP, and search (a large fraction PhDs), drawing from Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, and many other companies in the Valley. We're early stage, well-funded, and work on data problems at web scale (usually with Hadoop), including query language models, clustering, and a proprietary ranking system, as well as some interesting graph optimization algorithms. Our product is widely deployed and generating revenue. We're looking for very strong, practical engineers who enjoy problems in this space, ideally with background in search, information retrieval, or systems and infrastructure -- but unusually talented candidates of any kind are welcome. Message me or check our (brief) website for more details. See also What is BloomReach doing? (And yes, as of 2011-11-03, this is still current, and we're still growing!)    Embed Quote
