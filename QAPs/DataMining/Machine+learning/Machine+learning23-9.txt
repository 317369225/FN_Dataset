★What is the best machine learning algorithm?
There is no "best" algorithm, but it is a serious research question whether some methods tend to perform better than others for large classes of problems. I find this fascinating. Rich Caruana and Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil have done some study of this topic. Comparing SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes, random forests, and other methods on 11 supervised learning problems using 8 performance metrics: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~carua... Prof. Caruana also gave a talk on this project: Which Supervised Learning Method Works Best for What? An Empirical Comparison of Learning Methods and Metrics Of course, techniques have changed even since 2006 and the "best performing" method is not necessarily the most useful one.    Embed Quote
