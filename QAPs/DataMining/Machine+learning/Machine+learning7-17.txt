★Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
Every doctor or medical student on this thread thinks like "computers will replace them", it looks like they are afraid of this, but Computer aid in Medicine is NOT for replacing doctors. It's for "assisting" to the diagnosis procedure. Every owner of these answers thinks the whole world has a healthcare quality like in US. There are lots of countries that don't have enough doctors, even in developing countries. So, maybe computers will help %20 of the classic cases, like flu, diarrhea etc. With this, well trained doctors don't lose any time for basic, everyday diseases, and they will have more time for curing hard ones.    Embed Quote
