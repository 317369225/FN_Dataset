★How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people?
Step 1: You know how to multiply two numbers? "Yes!" Suppose a person X doesn't. Can you give him a step-by-step process so that for all multiplication problems he gets in the future, the method gives the correct answer? "Yes! To multiply two numbers, do the following steps ..." (And they'll describe the conventional multiplication algorithm.) Step 2: You know how to recognize me? "Yes!" Suppose a person X doesn't. Can you give him a step-by-step process so that whenever he sees anyone in the future, he can tell whether it's me or not? Obviously they can't. If they try to describe your face, it's not correct. Because the description of your face will never be complete, and it will always be possible to construct a face (maybe artificial) that satisfies those properties, but it doesn't resemble you. They can identify you not because of some step-by-step fool-proof method to do so, but because they have a lot of your images in their memory which they can map your new image to. This process involves uncertainty, and involves learning from experience - new people will not be able to recognize you unless they've seen your face (in reality, or in photograph). Machine learning (and artificial intelligence in general) imitates this natural process of learning from experience to infer in the future.    Embed Quote
