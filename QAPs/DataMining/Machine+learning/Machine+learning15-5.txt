★What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
Another point of view: CE Rasmussen, CKI Williams, "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning.", MIT Press, 2006 Much of the basic theory and many algorithms are shared between the machine learning statistics and machine learning community. The primary differences are perhaps the types of the problems attacked, and the goal of learning. At the risk of data and models oversimplification, one could say that in statistics a prime focus is often in understanding the data and relationships in terms of models giving approximate summaries such as linear relations or independencies. In contrast, the goals in algorithms and machine learning are primarily to make predictions as accurately as possible and predictions to understand the behaviour of learning algorithms. These differing objectives have led to different developments in the two fields: for example, neural network algorithms have been used extensively as black-box function approximators in machine learning, but to many statisticians they are less than satisfactory, because of the difficulties in interpreting such models.    Embed Quote
