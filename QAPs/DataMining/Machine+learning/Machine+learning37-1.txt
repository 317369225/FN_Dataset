★Why is machine learning used heavily for Google's ad ranking and less for their search ranking?A lot of people I've talked to at Google have told me that the ad ranking system is largely machine learning based, while search ranking is rooted in functions that are written by humans using their intuition (with some components using machine learning). What led to this difference?
Edmond Lau's answer is great, but I wanted to add one more important piece of information. When I was on the search team at Google (2008-2010), many of the groups in search were moving away from machine learning systems to the rules-based systems.  That is to say that Google Search used to use more machine learning, and then went the other direction because the team realized they could make faster improvements to search quality with a rules based system. It's not just a bias, it's something that many sub-teams of search tried out and preferred. I was the PM for Images, Video, and Local Universal - 3 teams that focus on including the best results when they are images, videos, or places.  For each of those teams I could easily understand and remember how the rules worked.  I would frequently look at random searches and their results and think "Did we include the right Images for this search?  If not, how could we have done better?". And when we asked that question, we were usually able to think of signals that would have helped - try it yourself.  The reasons why *you* think we should have shown a certain image are usually things that Google can actually figure out.    Embed Quote
