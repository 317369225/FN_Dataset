Computational Complexity Theory: Is the traveling salesman problem solvable?
The traveling salesman problem is NP-hard, meaning that if P doesn't equal NP (and it probably doesn't, according to most computer scientists) there is no exact algorithm to the traveling salesman in polynomial time, and in particular, there is no chance of there being an efficient solution that scales and which works on all graphs. However, just because there is no exact algorithm doesn't mean that the problem isn't "solvable" in a weaker sense. Even if you can't find the very best solution, you can still get close, and for real-world problems, this is still very useful. (This humorous video makes that point.) For example, there is the Christofides algorithm which can always achieve an approximation ratio of 1.5 when the graph satisfies the triangle inequality (a very plausible assumption in practice). For more general graphs, approximation to within any constant is still NP-hard. You can check out details for the state-of-the-art approximation algorithms, heuristic algorithms, and so on, on the wikipedia page. In particular "Modern methods can find solutions for extremely large problems (millions  of cities) within a reasonable time which are with a high probability  just 2–3% away from the optimal solution." These approaches ought to fail for contrived problem instances though.    Embed Quote Updated 22 Feb, 2014. 1,197 views.
