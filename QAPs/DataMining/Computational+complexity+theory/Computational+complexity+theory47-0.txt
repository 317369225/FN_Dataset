I want to continue my studies in theoretical computer science because of my love for number theory, algebra, logics and linear algebra but I'm really not interested in computational complexity theory. Is there any branch of theoretical CS that will suit me?
There is much more to theoretical computer science than computational complexity theory. Another important area of theoretical computer science is that of program semantics. The study of program semantics depends heavily on notions from mathematical logic (and philosophical logic) but also on universal algebra, category theory, topology and set theory. One place to start exploring this topic is Glynn Winskel's book The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages I would of course also recommend my own textbook Transitions and Trees - An Introduction to Structural Operational Semantics.    Embed Quote Updated 9 Dec. 665 views.
