★Computational Complexity Theory: How would you explain P vs NP problem to a child?
Let's say P and NP are both buckets full of pieces of paper, each having a question written on them. Both buckets combined, they contain all questions you can ask, have asked and ever will ask. The P bucket will always fit inside the NP bucket. In P are questions you know the answer to or you can ask a friend to answer for you. Because you already figured them out, you can answer them quickly. In NP are questions you simply cannot answer right now and still need to think really hard about, before you finally can. But if you figured out the answer, you have to put them in the P bucket. Some day, your NP bucket will be empty and everything will be in the P bucket. Some people believe that some questions in the NP bucket will always stay in the NP bucket, but nobody really knows for certain that this is true.    Embed Quote
