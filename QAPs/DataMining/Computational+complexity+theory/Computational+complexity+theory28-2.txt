★Computational Complexity Theory: How would you explain P vs NP problem to a child?
Assuming the child has played Super Mario... You know how sometimes you can get stuck on a stage in Mario, and you spend hours and hours and hours trying to get to the end of the stage, but you just can't seem to figure it out? But then your clever and more experienced older friend comes over and shows you how to very quickly get past the part you were stuck on. Suddenly, even though you had struggled with it for a long time, it now all becomes clear and seems really easy! This problem is an example of what some grownups like to call an "NP-complete" problem. They care about this so much that they'll give you $1,000,000 (Millennium Prize) if you can figure out a fast way to beat any stage in Mario without the help of your older friend! Grownups have hard problems, too, but they don't have clever older friends to help them with their problems :( --- This answer is based on the recent paper [1203.1895] Classic Nintendo Games are (NP-)Hard, which is actually co-authored by Alan Guo, who has also written an answer to this question! Heh.    Embed Quote Updated 25 Jun, 2013. 1,191 views.
