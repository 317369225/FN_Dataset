★What are the biggest problems in "semantic web" today?  What's wrong with it?...and what opportunities are there for startups?
I agree with Yury (and thanks for the kudos on SearchMonkey!). The bottom line is to find a feature/product that helps users, but could not be implemented without the use of semantic web technologies. In other words, use your knowledge and understanding of semantic web as a way to gain an unfair technical advantage over your competition, not as a way to build up your company. As an example, the key problem SearchMonkey set out to solve was that while there was enough academic research and there were  significant experimental products out there, none targeted a specific end-user need. So, at Yahoo!, we decided to build a combination - a user experience that surfaced relevant information in-situ, and a comprehensive semantic backed to support such an experience. We were very careful to not talk about the latter when talking to the users - why should they care we had the world's largest triples store or RDFa repository? We pushed through the user experience and shipped it within 9 months (from glimmer in the eye to live to all users in 9 countries). Since then, of course, Yahoo! Search has suffered for various reasons, and the search simian is now officially dead. On a funny sidenote,  almost 1 year to the day of SearchMonkey launch, Google launched their own version of a semantics-enabled user-facing product, with the same launch partners - Yelp and LinkedIn.
