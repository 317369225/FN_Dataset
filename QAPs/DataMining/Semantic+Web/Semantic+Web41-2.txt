★What is the relationship between the field of ontology and the semantic web?
Since you have asked just for the relations here:     An ontology is a graphical way of representing knowledge in a particular domain. The representation defines the relationships between the entities in that particular domain for which the ontology is defined. For example, a simple graph might consist of three nodes with 1 parent and 2 children. The parent could be "Camera" and the children could be "SLR" and "Point-and-shoot". Such an ontology represents the knowledge in the photography domain with a simple directed graph.     The semantic web leverages the power of ontology and the ontology's ability to represent knowledge, to create a web of documents where each document is also attached with another component (let's call it metadata) that defines what is the document about? This aboutness is a highly debated topic in the internet community and there doesn't seem to be a well-defined standard that is unanimously accepted as the best way of representing aboutness of a document. Representation of the aboutness of a document uses ontology. For example, you may want to specify that the mention of all "SLR" entities inside the document belongs to the photography ontology defined above. So in that case, any computer that visits the metadata of a document knows that all "SLR" inside the document is a type of camera. Of course, ontologies can get much more bigger and complex for various different domains and it is highly debated about how it is necessary to have one single uniform ontology for everyone.     In summary, ontology is a building block of the semantic web and is a strong mechanism that uses various standards to represent knowledge.    Embed Quote
