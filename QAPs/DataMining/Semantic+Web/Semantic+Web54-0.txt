★Is the semantic web a silver bullet for all my problems modeling the world in a relational database?
there are some cases where using an Resource Description Framework database instead of  Relational Databases  provides an advantage: the graph model or RDF is simple but expressive enough for most tasks and it makes data merging much easier (as compared to a relational model) similar to the above, incremental integration is easier with RDF. Your model/schema can evolve at a much lower cost (as compared to a relational model) the Semantic Web is based on the Open World Assumption [1] which makes it easier to work with incomplete information global identifiers (URI) for all entities makes it easier to integrate bits and pieces from disparate data sources (removes, or at least reduces ambiguity) on top of all that, you get the added value of inferring new implicit facts (triples) from the existing knowledge base - you don't get that with RDBMSs. The querying is also more powerful (implicit answers can be matched too) [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ope...    Embed Quote
