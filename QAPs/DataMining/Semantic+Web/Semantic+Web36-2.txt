★Which digital content curation tools/services leverage semantic web / linked data principles?
IMHO Zemanta is not a curation service, allthough it enriches the content by  related entities/links. Please see this question and the following answer for more info about curation. What features and factors will determine the defacto content curation platform? BEST ANSWER: According to Wikipedia, the definition of digital curation is: "the selection, preservation, maintenance, and collection and archiving of digital assets[1][2]." With respect to your question I think there are a number of features/functions that are essential for a platform to become the winner in the upcoming curation wars.  These are: Curation must be as simple and convenient as bookmarking The platform must be capable of curating anything with a URL (not only specific services like Twitter, etc.) The platform must be capable of presenting the information in a logical, visually pleasing way The platform must be capable of broadcasting the curated content (not limited to viewing the content in a single location (e.g. the curated content must be embeddable in other platforms like blogs, posted to Facebook, tweeted, etc) The platform needs to automate certain activities (like capturing URLs one tweets) The platform must allow the curator to tell a story The platform must allow others to subscribe to the curated content and receive updates in real time (like an RSS feed) Ability to collaborate with other curators on a topic is essential Curation must be possible using any device (PC, Tablet, Mobile, etc) Curated content that has been embedded must update in real time as the curator updates the primary collection of content The curated content should accrete SEO benefit to the locations in which that content is embedded The curated content needs to drive traffic, both to the curator herself as well as to the locations in which it is embedded Once content is curated, it must persist in perpetuityAdditionally, the ability to conduct a deep search within the platform to find related content curated by other users would be a plus.    Embed Quote
