★What is the semantic web standard for UDDI?
there is no standard - there was some work on semantic extensions to UDDI [1], but just like UDDI itself, it wasn't very successful the related work on standards for Semantic Web Services like WSMO [2] and OWL-S [3] wasn't very successful either and has been suspended [1] http://tigertech.memphis.edu/eec...
