★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
In my opinion*, and from experience working at both http://import.io and as a front end coder, linked web data is unlikely to get a foot hold in adoption rates until the business case is made and understood by the people in charge of specifying and/or building websites. Education is the key. Just ask the average Web Design agency project manager, "what is 'structured web' or 'linked web data'", and they might say something about RDF or micro-formats, but they may admit that close to 0% of their clients understand the benefits. The benefits of adding semantic meaning to your data for the agencies is pretty much limited to.. will it give me better google results? This is also why so few sites have API's For the foreseeable future, I think the vast majority of the web will stay,  unstructured and unlinked. Tools like import.io are letting people structure the web for themselves, as and when they need it, to make there own version of  'linked data' applying their domain knowledge to fix current issue of the Unstructured web for themselves. If the site owners are unable, or unwilling to spend the money to structure their data, then I'm afraid we will never see even a partially structured web. I am sure the 'head' of the data world will become structured eventually, but the long tail is unlikely ever to be authored as 'structured web data' any time soon. *Personal Opinions are my own not, my employers.    Embed Quote
