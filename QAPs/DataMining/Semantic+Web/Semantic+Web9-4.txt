★Is Schema.org good or bad for the Semantic Web?Google, Bing and Yahoo have launched a site called schema.org, "to create and support common ways to represent web page metadata" (you can read the news right here: http://www.informationweek.com/n...), but it doesn't use RDF... so, is it good or bad for the Semantic Web? Or maybe it IS a semantic resource, but is not good for Linked Data project...?
Very few people today, web professionals or otherwise, are acutely aware of the Semantic Web. So in that sense Schema.org is a great thing. Cringe at its limitations, but Microdata is more comprehensible than both RDF and Microformats, dropping a metaphorical rope down to the people most likely to begin tagging data immediately. The potential SEO implications will push businesses to learn too, and quickly, especially if Google, Bing, and Yahoo offer even the slightest advantage in their SERPs. In adopting Microdata, the Schema.org syndicate is going to get the Semantic Web rolling. I find it particularly ironic that the same web community that's out evangelizing "execution over ideas" and "minimal viable products" on a daily basis can get tied up for a decade sorting out its own sock drawer.    Embed Quote
