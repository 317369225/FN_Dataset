★Are people afraid of founding companies in the Semantic Web space?There are too many standards; we haven't thought of integration yet. We have just scratched on the surface and the objective of any start-up company is to succeed in the fast-pace route; to ramp up and lay a strong foundation. Is this all possible if one ventures into the semantic web space with a plan of starting a company?
We're doing all kinds of interesting stuff at Revelytix http://revelytix.com as a startup.  The key is finding a market and building innovative products and I think there is always a market for technologies that make it possible to find, integrate, and analyze the ever-growing sea of data that companies (increasingly) are lost in.    Embed Quote
