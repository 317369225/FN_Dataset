★Does the semantic web need ontology?
Since there is no definite answer yet for what "Semantic Web" means as of now, I am constraining my answer keeping a particular use-case in mind which leverages the convictions of the semantic web. I think the question of whether one needs an Ontology or not really depends on the end objective you are trying to realize with semantics. For a particular use-case which requires basic understanding of the semantic meaning inside a text, it might be very easy to leverage just the semantic tagging for your decision making. You may be able to understand the semantics of the structured data just by looking at how the information is represented without delving too much into the details of the actual knowledge to which the semantic representation is associated. While for another use-case which requires more complex reasoning and making inferences, knowing how semantic concepts are interrelated and constrained will definitely require you to understand the knowledge model behind the semantic tags. For example, to be able to conclude for a given knowledge base that "Cameras can be owned only by a photographer", it is required for one to know in advance the Ontology representing this knowledge base that constrains the "owned_by" property of the Camera only to Photographers. So, in my opinion, deciding if an Ontology really is needed or not is dependent upon whether the use-case and the end-objective requires one to have a thorough understanding of the underlying knowledge base or not.    Embed Quote
