★Is Facebook going to be the Semantic Web?With OpenGraph API, the new Related Posts (on Pages) and mentions, is Facebook going to be the Semantic Web giant?
It may want to, but it is not actively working towards it. First, there's a lot of spam among social objects. There are duplicate terms that are drawn from Wikipedia, Pages, and website generated objects. For example there's a Tron:Legacy object generated by Wikipedia, Pages and IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes, and who knows who else. Pages and sites do not follow any naming convention when it comes to semantic term generation, so you may be linking Tron: Legacy, Tron: Legacy (2010) from IMDB, Official Tron: Legacy Fan Page from a Page. Second, you cannot link content of your posts to a semantic object unless you already liked it, and unless you are fully aware how to add a linked object in your status or link status, and only Facebook.com website and bookmarklets support that. Unless some automatic semantic linking is introduced along with a broad availability of manual linking through API and mainstream support from apps, it will never become even remotely embraced by the hundreds of million users    Embed Quote
