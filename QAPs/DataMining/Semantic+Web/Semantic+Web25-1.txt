★Are there any MOOCs about Semantic Web?
OpenHPI (openHPI) initiative of the Hasso-Plattner Institut offered a MOOC this time last year, with Dr. Harald Sack taking center stage for the 6 week course titled "Semantic Web Technologies": https://openhpi.de/course/semant... The course might run again in the future, and if it does, that is a very good place to start as Dr. Sack went into great depths with respect to the concepts of Semantic Web, with focus on the technological aspects their application in the present day Web. It was a thoroughly enjoyable course, and being my first MOOC, it sure held my attention and interest well enough to complete the course and get a well earned certificate (Semantic web technologies_certificate_compact_29943) The course covered topics such as: Knowledge representation with W3C standards such as RDF, RDF Schema, OWL, and rules storing RDF data in triple stores and using SPARQL to query RDF data publishing Linked Data and semantic annotation of webpages using RDFa and microdata foundations of Description Logic and reasoning Semantic Web based applications, such as Named Entity Mapping and Semantic Search. EDIT: Looks like the original course won't run again, but there is a slightly advanced course planned by Dr. Harald Sack in May 2014: Knowledge Engineering with Semantic Web Technologies. The description of this course gives an impression that even here, beginners can get in and start learning about the Semantic Web.    Embed Quote
