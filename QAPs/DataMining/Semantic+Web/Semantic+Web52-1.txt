★Semantic Web: What is the easiest OWL-aware triple storage to work with?I need a small database (under 1,000,000 records) to integrate metadata from multiple heterogeneous sources, apply OWL ontology and run SPARQL (or similar) queries. The main criteria is ease of use - ability to get the results quick. Second most important criteria is logical power, but I guess reasoner+sparql is all I can get.
I have personally used Sesame OpenRDF. You can choose the native store option for a small database and store OWL/RDF triples. While RDF reasoner is out of the box, you will need an external reasoner that leverages OWL vocabulary. (I have not tested using an external reasoner yet).    Embed Quote
