★How do you explain semantic web to a nine-year old child in one sentence?"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself." —Albert Einstein
let me try. Imagine a massive tree with many large branches and sub-branches. Theoretically, you can start from any leaf or small branch and get to any other leaf or branch in the tree by climbing up the hierarchy to a common parent branch. This is the concept of linked data to me. The new version of the web. The older version, web 2.0 resembles stars in the sky. there can be some amount of clustering but no deliberate connection between things. Quora itself is a great example of a linked data "tree". Questions invariably link back to a part of the main ontological tree http://www.quora.com/Technology/...    Embed Quote
