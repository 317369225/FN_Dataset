★Semantic Web: What are the most interesting enterprise SemWeb companies?The companies that are bringing innovative SemWeb products to the enterprise  marketplace.
My favorite Semantic Web company was Metaweb Technologies which is the technology behind Freebase (they were acquired by Google in 2010). Bluefin Labs is also doing interesting work in the Social TV analytics domain using a slew of sophisticated techniques from the semantic web, NLP and machine learning. Finally, Kosmix is a startup company working on building a media platform called Social Genome that organizes web content by topic. They were also acquired by Walmart.    Embed Quote
