★What are the best examples of the semantic web being used by newspapers, magazines, and TV websites?
Roger Macdonald already provided excellent pointers, let me try to add a few more in summary, publishers (newspapers, magazines, etc) can benefit from the Semantic Web (especially Linked Data) in a twofold way: consuming existing Linked Data (like BBC Music is doing with MusicBrainz and DBpedia). Data journalism also fits here publishing Linked Data, in order to make their content more discoverable (SEO) in addition to the BBC and The Guardian which were already mentioned, I can add: New York Times, see their ISWC'2010 talk [1] and the chapter on "The Role of Community-Driven Data Curation for Enterprises" from [2] Reuters, same chapter from [2] Kluwer, chapter "Standardizing Legal Content with OWL and RDF" from [2] also check out the chapter "Use of Semantic Web technologies on the BBC Web Sites" from [2] for more info on the BBC [1] http://data.nytimes.com/ppt/iswc...
