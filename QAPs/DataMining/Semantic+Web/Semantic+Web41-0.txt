★What is the relationship between the field of ontology and the semantic web?
The semantic web is a general term for a collection of technologies that strive to provide web context that contains meaningful data (versus markup which tells a web browser how to lay out a page and is not intended to provide meaning). In other words, the semantic web wants web content to contain data that some agent or inference engine can extract meaning from (and presumably, do good things with on your behalf with). An ontology is one of the components of a semantic web implementation. An ontology, generally speaking, provides definitions of terms one might find in a (web) document that has been formatted to contain semantic data. Ontologies are generally associated with a domain, e.g., one would expect medical terms to be defined by a medical ontology. Effectively, when a document uses a term, e.g., "Address", it does so in the context of a specific ontology, and that ontology provides the authoritative definition of what "Address" is. Pairing the term "Address" with its ontology gives an inference engine some basis from which to ascribe meaning to that term. Otherwise, its just a sequence of characters. So, check out ontology on wikipedia. Also, take a look at Dublin Core as an example of an ontology.
