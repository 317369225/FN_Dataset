★How do you explain semantic web to a nine-year old child in one sentence?"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself." —Albert Einstein
It's easy for Google to search for a "red fox" or a "grey wolf" but Google hasn't (quite) learned to search for all red animals or every other color of fox. To do this it needs lots of lists of word-classifications (all color-words, all anmial names)... and that's what the Semantic Web movement is trying to compile.    Embed Quote
