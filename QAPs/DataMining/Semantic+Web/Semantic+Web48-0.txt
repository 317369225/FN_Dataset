★Are people afraid of founding companies in the Semantic Web space?There are too many standards; we haven't thought of integration yet. We have just scratched on the surface and the objective of any start-up company is to succeed in the fast-pace route; to ramp up and lay a strong foundation. Is this all possible if one ventures into the semantic web space with a plan of starting a company?
The semantic web is a collection of technologies and standards.  And they are very interesting.  But I would never found or invest in a company that is solely based on working with some new technologies. I'd only found a company with a very strong point of view on the marketplace...who are the customers, what problems are you solving for them, how big will that market be, how fast is it growing, and when? So, the big question is what are the killer applications of the technologies.  Find a great answer there, and it would definitely be worth starting a company to get those applications to your target customers.    Embed Quote
