★Is there any open source project for semantic web?
I'm looking at OSF: the Open Semantic Framework, a full stack: OSF can integrate and manage all types of content — unstructured  documents, semi-structured files, spreadsheets, and structured databases  — using a variety of best-of-breed engines. All external content is  converted to the canonical RDF data model, enabling common tools and  methods for tagging and managing all content. Ontologies provide the  schema and common vocabularies for integrating across diverse datasets.  These capabilities can be layered over existing information assets for  unprecedented levels of integration and connectivity. All information  within OSF may be powerfully searched and faceted, with results datasets  available for export in a variety of formats and as linked data.    Embed Quote
