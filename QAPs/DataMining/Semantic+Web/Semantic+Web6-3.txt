★Will the Semantic Web be fully realized?The computer science is done. Will the internet go the way of the Semantic Web, whether to the W3C standards or some new standard like MicroFormats?
I think the concept of semantic web will slowly evolve in small SILOs for domain specific applications. Each domain will start adopting the semantic web standards and start building semantic capabilities into their tools/products. It will then take few years for all these SILOs to kind of talk to each other and allow semantic web to be a big whole chunk connecting everything. If you are asking if we will have the whole internet as a semantic web? I don't think so for atleast the next 20 years.    Embed Quote
