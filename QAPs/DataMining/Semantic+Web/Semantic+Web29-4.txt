★How do you explain semantic web to a nine-year old child in one sentence?"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself." —Albert Einstein
"Researchers try to model the world in a formal and consistent way. They have not yet found a solution. How would you do it?" I hope the 9yo will at some point, after discussing hopefully creative and imaginative considerations, realize that the world cannot be modeled in a formal and consistent way, so he/she will ask me then "But why are researchers still trying to model it this way?" But this is another question on Quora ;-)    Embed Quote
