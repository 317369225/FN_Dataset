★What is required for "semantic web" to take off?
Most importantly is has to be made clear what semantic is supposed to mean. To me it seems that the most successful semantic web applications and services use very limited, weak semantics. By "weak" i mean that the expressiveness is limited, which makes it easy to combine the data with information from other sources. But it makes it harder to apply any type of inference. Basically, there are two extremes: * limited loose semantics (typical for "linked data") makes for easy implementation and re-use. * strong formalized semantics allows for powerful reasoning, but makes it hard to combine information from different sources. We can not expect to achieve both - at least not with formalisms like OWL, which are based on classical logic. Classical logic is rigid to the point of being brittle - a single contradiction rising from a rash assumption (like "humans have two legs") will break the entire knowledge base (without an easy way to find the contradiction). So, my point is: a successful semantic web app is either powerful, but limited in scope and hard to integrate with other systems, or it's "dumb" but easy to integrate and use. For the semantic web to be successful, we need to decide which type of success we want.    Embed Quote
