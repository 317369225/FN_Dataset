★What is the state of semantic web?- Are there any web applications that are based on semantic web? - what are current trends in the job market?
The Semantic Web is working fine. Any normal Web Browser -- being a 'direct navigation' engine -- allows the user to be linked to any Topic as deemed appropriate. The Domain Name System (DNS), being deeply integrated into web browser Technology, is fundamental to the integration of Content into the appropriate User Experience and/or Context (i.e., the Domain Name). For example: whereas books.com provides information about commercial books, movies.com provides information about commercial movies -- if well Designed, each will use a framework/ontology that is specific to the user's needs. For more on how this works, see an article I wrote about 5 years ago -- see http://index.tagseo.com/2012/07/... -- in that article, I explain how sites like Twitter (product) or Facebook and/or hundreds of other sites based on Natural Language Information Retrieval would eventually replace old-fashioned Generic Search Engines.    Embed Quote
