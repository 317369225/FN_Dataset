★How do you explain semantic web to someone whose professional frame of reference is in order-taking, delivery, humoring customers, or catering in the food service industry?
Tell her that the Semantic Web is a concept wherein:     Her mobile phone would be able to detect where she is located at any particular moment and then be able to find out the nearest restaurants. In addition, mention that her phone would also provide all the menus of these near by restaurants for her to order food. She would be able to click on any menu item and order it right on her phone instantly. If the waitress still looks normal and believes that all this is possible, add more excitement by saying that once she orders her menu, it will flash back the approximate time required for the order to be ready and will suggest another near-by place which is suitable for her to spend time while the food is being cooked. If she is still in her senses and her head is not spinning, finally complete by saying that she could pay her money by clicking another button on her phone itself after enjoying her meal at the restaurant :-)    Embed Quote
