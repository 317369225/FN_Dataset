★How do you explain semantic web to a nine-year old child in one sentence?"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself." —Albert Einstein
Timmy, you know that book your little sister has that's made out of a pillow and has animals in it? That book is the internet. When your dad reads it to her and points to the words under the pictures and sometimes makes goofy noises to act like the animals, that's the Semantic web (words) making it easy to know what the picture is for Dad.    Embed Quote
