★Is Facebook going to be the Semantic Web?With OpenGraph API, the new Related Posts (on Pages) and mentions, is Facebook going to be the Semantic Web giant?
I really doubt it.  One major point of the Semantic Web is that "anyone can say anything about anything", which works against the idea that there even could be one company that becomes "the Semantic Web". And anyway, that kind of openness is not really compatible with Facebook's DNA, from what I've seen.  They are a walled garden, and they mostly want you inside their walled garden, creating ad impressions that they can sell.    Embed Quote
