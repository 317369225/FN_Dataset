★What is required for "semantic web" to take off?
It has already taken off. Facebook is probably the largest "Semantic Web" platform in the world. Facebook is a walled garden, though, and this is probably the fate of the Semantic Web as we know it. The big problem of the Semantic Web are the creation costs and benefits. As long as the "garden wall" restricts the set of possible annotations/statements to a well-known domain, adding information can be made very easy to the end-user (see Facebook). However, if you expect an unbounded network like the current Web to be transformable to an inherently semantically annotated one, you definitely neglect that most content on the Web is not well-structured, and most people don't care about properly annotating it either. Personally, I do not see the "Semantic Web" in its current materialization to become a "Web 3.0", i.e. a "successor of Web 2.0" anytime soon. It may serve as a technical tool, though, like AJAX and HTML5 do.    Embed Quote
