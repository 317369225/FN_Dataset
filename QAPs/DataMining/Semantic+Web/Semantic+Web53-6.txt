★How do you explain semantic web to someone whose professional frame of reference is in order-taking, delivery, humoring customers, or catering in the food service industry?
As its name implies, the Semantic Web adds a layer of meaning onto the Web, that computers can understand and process to give you better answers when you query the Web, or even predict the questions that you are going to ask. Essentially, it makes your computer a much better agent at your service. That was the short answer that you requested. The long, precise answer would have to detail the various layers involved in the Semantic Web, including the trust layer and more.    Embed Quote
