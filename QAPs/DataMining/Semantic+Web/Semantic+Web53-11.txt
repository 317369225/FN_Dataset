★How do you explain semantic web to someone whose professional frame of reference is in order-taking, delivery, humoring customers, or catering in the food service industry?
begs the question; why a waitress..? *lets it go* The semantic web is: you needing a service your browser then: checking your location opening times of all places within a pre-defined area around that location pricing checking for discount codes against that pricing giving you the address of the closest and cheapest place to access that serviceAll with one click (2 at the most) without having to visit any websites comparison or otherwise.    Embed Quote
