★Semantic Web: Is there a need for a curated central repository for ontologies?
Yes, am I'm not the only one that thinks this would be a good idea.  To quote from the mission statement: The charter of the Open Ontology Repository (OOR) Initiative is to the promote the global use and sharing of ontologies by: establishing a hosted registry-repository; enabling and facilitating open, federated, collaborative ontology repositories, and establishing best practices for expressing interoperable ontology and taxonomy work in registry-repositories.where, An ontology repository is a facility where ontologies and related information artifacts can be stored, retrieved and managed. I am a member of ONTOLOG and working with some of its members on a variety of initiatives, but I am in no way qualified to expand on this answer.  I will cross-post this question to the discussion forum.
