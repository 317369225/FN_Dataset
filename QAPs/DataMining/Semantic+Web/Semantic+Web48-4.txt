★Are people afraid of founding companies in the Semantic Web space?There are too many standards; we haven't thought of integration yet. We have just scratched on the surface and the objective of any start-up company is to succeed in the fast-pace route; to ramp up and lay a strong foundation. Is this all possible if one ventures into the semantic web space with a plan of starting a company?
I started a company based on Semantic Web technologies called BigSwerve. We did not simply mark up content at the presentation layer using standard vocabularies, but rather we used an RDF triple store to manage the content.  Two camps of people refer to both of those as being the "Semantic Web."  One defines presentation while the other defines storage.  Choosing to base such critical components of my startup (from both a technical and cultural perspective) on such esoteric technology was one of the biggest mistakes that I made. Technically, RDF triple stores have their own query language called SPARQL.  This query language is an ORM that translates SPARQL queries into SQL queries.  With de-normalized triples this simply didn't scale well.  We also had to implement critical portions of the SPARQL language because they were not implemented in the framework at the time.  Big waste of time. Culturally, engineers love to work with shiny new objects.  But they hate getting frustrated with shiny new objects with a scant body of knowledge.  And essentially this is what the Semantic Web, in reference to RDF triple storage, amounts to today.  It's a shiny new toy with vocal support from well known people, but the resultant value isn't clearly proportional to the work involved.  So to answer your question:  Are people afraid?  Not sure, but they should be.    Embed Quote
