★How will search engine optimization change with the advent of the semantic web?How will SEO be affected/changed with Semantic Web gaining more prominence.
Microformats and RDFa are both interesting semantic advances as Christoph Möller points out. The next phase is likely to be leveraging something like Metaweb, which Google acquired in 2010. Here's a quick video explaining Metaweb. With this information Google can get better at matching words to real word objects, and understand how those objects are connected. The implication for SEO is that Google may get better at understanding query intent and matching it to the right page. It can do this through a better understanding of words associated with that 'object' and tracing the associations (links) between objects (web pages). My perspective is that it will help Google better define topical 'neighborhoods' and enhance the ability to assign trust and authority correctly.    Embed Quote
