★What are the biggest problems in "semantic web" today?  What's wrong with it?...and what opportunities are there for startups?
It is a problem of the founders of these startups  - over promise and lack of focus - leading to the useless "arms race" of advanced technology as opposed to good interfaces that add value to end users Semantic startup founders like to burst into the tech scene with promises of grandeur, no doubt fueled by the built up of testosterone caused by months and years of pitching how they are going to kill Google. Semantic web has some amazingly useful possibilities - like creating a far easy way to learn concepts from Wikipedia and Quora. But instead of starting with a useful ideas, these delusion of "right off the bat grandeur" has lead to over development of technologies and severe under investment in user interfaces and value.    Embed Quote
