★How will search engine optimization change with the advent of the semantic web?How will SEO be affected/changed with Semantic Web gaining more prominence.
Basic answer: Traditional SEO tries to improve the ranking of a Web resource describing a product or service for a BROAD audience, e.g. you want to be among the top 5 results for 'lawyer in miami'. You do this by combining a lot of art and science so that the big search engines judge your content most relevant for a given query. When using Semantic Web technology for SEO, you use small chunks of structured data inside your Web content for articulating the individual strengths and features of your particular offer. This makes it much easier for search engines and novel services to find relevant offers for very specific needs (e.g. 'a lawyer near my current position that accepts credit cards and whose office is still open'). So the fundamental novelty is 1. you use structured data for sending the details of your offer over the Web, making it much easier for someone to honor the particularities of your business, 2. you optimise each individual page for a very specific audience, and 3. the data on multiple pages (e.g. vendor and retailer site) in combination will influence the visibility of an offer. For example, structured data on the datasheets page of a brand manufacturer will lift the visibility of each shop site that lists this item. So instead of SEO in isolation, we will have a 'supply chain for Web visibility', in which the various stages of production must collaborate to maximize the visibility of the end product.
