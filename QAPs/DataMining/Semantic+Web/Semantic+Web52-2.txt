★Semantic Web: What is the easiest OWL-aware triple storage to work with?I need a small database (under 1,000,000 records) to integrate metadata from multiple heterogeneous sources, apply OWL ontology and run SPARQL (or similar) queries. The main criteria is ease of use - ability to get the results quick. Second most important criteria is logical power, but I guess reasoner+sparql is all I can get.
Have you tried or looked at | CommonCrawl -- Owl2Java - A Java Code Generator for OWL This is another very powerful source but not what you were asking for. I would love to learn more -- this is right up my Alley and things related to my own startup.    Embed Quote
