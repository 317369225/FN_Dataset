★What are the biggest problems in "semantic web" today?  What's wrong with it?...and what opportunities are there for startups?
    I think the biggest problem in the Semantic Web space is to convince people to play the Standards Game. We have so many different standards including RDF and RDFa, and many enablers such as SPARQL, but these are sadly embraced only by a minority of the community in the semantic web space.     Just to give you an example, less than 5% of the websites today are in RDF. Most of them who are publishing data on the web don't even know what Ontologies are and how can one leverage ontology to bring more meaning and knowledge to the vast amount of information that is being dumped online.    While there is quite a lot to be yet realized in the standards space, I think this also gives Startups a nice opportunity to think about it.     Few open problems according to me are: 1. How can you build a process model that encourages people to adopt well-defined standards before they publish the data? 2. Can a Startup make a dent in this space by thinking of another way to express relationships besides just Triples? 3. Can you convert the SILOs of content such as Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn into a semantic web format and then build a knowledge base? 4. How would you combine Ontologies and normalize them to create one single Ontology given a large set of them provided by different publishers of different domains? This single Ontology could be used in building a web-scale semantic search engine. 5. How about creating a large Database product (like Oracle for now...) to manage the efficient storage, query and retrieval of Semantic Web data including all representations and interlinking? 6. Can you think of efficiently placing semantic web data on a large cloud computing infrastructure like Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure? 7. Startups can think of efficient data structures for the current standards of Semantic Web.    Embed Quote
