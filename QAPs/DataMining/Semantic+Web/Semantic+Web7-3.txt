★What are some hot startups working with the semantic web?I'm looking to see who's innovating and providing consumer products in the Semantic Web space.
I'm a founder of Fogbeam Labs (http://www.fogbeam.com) where we are working to bring the Semantic Web into the enterprise to enhance collaboration, knowledge sharing / transfer / discovery, and analytics.  We develop all Open Source products, developed in a true open source fashion with community involvement - all our code is on GitHub, everything is licensed under the ALv2, and we have open mailing lists, issue tracker, etc.  No "fauxpen source" here. We have several products in varying stages of completion, and will be offering commercial support around "branded" commercial releases of a number of other projects, especially a number of ASF projects related to the Semantic Web. Our "flagship" product, if you can say there is such a thing, is Quoddy - our Enterprise Social Network offering.  Quoddy is an ESN like Jive or Yammer, but with deep hooks for integration with other entrerprise apps, and with semantic integration built in.  fogbeam/Quoddy Another product we offer is called Neddick, and it is an Information Discovery Platform ( think "Reddit for the Enterprise), which also features semantic integration, semantic concept extraction and semantic search. We'll be rolling out a number of additional products over the coming months, all related to semantic integration, collaboration, knowledge management, analytics/BI, BigData, SOA/ESB, and related areas.    Embed Quote
