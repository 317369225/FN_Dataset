★Are people afraid of founding companies in the Semantic Web space?There are too many standards; we haven't thought of integration yet. We have just scratched on the surface and the objective of any start-up company is to succeed in the fast-pace route; to ramp up and lay a strong foundation. Is this all possible if one ventures into the semantic web space with a plan of starting a company?
No. Semantic Web is the future of database technology and information exchange.  Any company that wants to be competitive in 10 years is already experimenting with semantic web technologies and climbing the experience curve. It took thiry years for RD systems to become fully integrated with the corporation and it will like take thirty years for the potential of the semantic web to be fully realized. In 2011 we saw 35% year revenue growth in revenue and market-size for the companies providing semantic web services and infrastructure.

By this standard Larry Ellison should not have founded Oracle!  When Ellison grabbed his team of programmers and built the first version of the Oracle relational database, RD systems were still in research papers.  They did not have applications and no one knows what they were for.  They lost your data, they were slow, they were extremely expensive; you needed a mainframe to run them!  Your secondary storage was a tape drive. In semantic web, the technologies are at least standardized, where as at the beginning of relational database adoption, there was no standard query language and each vendor's software used a different language.    Embed Quote
