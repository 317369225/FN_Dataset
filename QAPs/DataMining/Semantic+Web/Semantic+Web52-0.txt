★Semantic Web: What is the easiest OWL-aware triple storage to work with?I need a small database (under 1,000,000 records) to integrate metadata from multiple heterogeneous sources, apply OWL ontology and run SPARQL (or similar) queries. The main criteria is ease of use - ability to get the results quick. Second most important criteria is logical power, but I guess reasoner+sparql is all I can get.
OpenRDF Sesame is easiest to work with, but it will not scale with more than 50m triples.  For more than that use BigData or OWLIM.    Embed Quote
