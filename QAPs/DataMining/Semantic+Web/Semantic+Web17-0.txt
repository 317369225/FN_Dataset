★What are the biggest problems in "semantic web" today?  What's wrong with it?...and what opportunities are there for startups?
Labeling. The very word, Semantic, leads most people to gloss their eyes and fade out. Semantic to most means 'splitting hairs' which will alway relegate something labeled as such to the realm of academics and geeks. Put it under the hood into something that 'just works' like a search suggest feature or friendship recommendation service and that makes it much more palpable.    Embed Quote
