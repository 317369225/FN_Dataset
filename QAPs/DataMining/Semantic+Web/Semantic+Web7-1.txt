★What are some hot startups working with the semantic web?I'm looking to see who's innovating and providing consumer products in the Semantic Web space.
I work for Revelytix (http://revelytix.com) and we're doing innovative work in Semantic Web, but targeted at enterprises for data integration and analytics, not at the consumer market.  Products in development include: Knoodl (collaborative ontology creation) - integrated wiki, discussion, etc http://knoodl.com OntVis (ontology visualization) - this is a wholly new (and we think better) approach to visualizing and exploring ontologies than exists anywhere http://semanticweb.com/ontvis-ad... Spyder (relational to RDF data) - first implementation of the in-process R2RML specification for mapping relational databases to RDF and supporting data dumps and dynamic SPARQL to SQL translation.  Beta is imminent.... Federator (federated SPARQL) - uses SPARQL 1.1 and the federation extensions to federate SPARQL endpoints.  Coming soon... Rex (RIF rules engine) - implements the RIF rules spec to provide rules-based entailment over RDF graphs.  Coming soon... Revelytix was just named to Information Management's list of 40 Vendors to Watch (http://t.co/I8sgOZH).    Embed Quote
