★Should we still believe in Semantic Web?I've read Semantic Web may have failed (Three reasons why the Semantic Web has failed). If it has failed, why? And what should we expect for the future?
I disagree with ter Heide's conclusion, for a number of reasons, although he does make a few valid points in his article. Perhaps the most important reason that I believe that declaring the Semantic Web a failure is premature: we've only just started. After false starts, weak adoption and multiple (and sometimes conflicting) ontologies, it's no wonder that we haven't yet seen TBL's dream accomplished. However, we've still come a long way, baby, and the process is accelerating. I've always believed that a Semantic Web is possible with existing technology. But it takes time to build. Human implementation of semantic markup can speed that process tremendously, but it isn't essential.    Embed Quote
