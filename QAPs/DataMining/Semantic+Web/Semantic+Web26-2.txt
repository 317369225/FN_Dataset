★What are the best examples of the semantic web being used by newspapers, magazines, and TV websites?
Several of the answers already have highlighted specific use. Newsweek is another example in practice. All stories have authorship and other metadata marked up w/ RDFa. For example this story: http://www.newsweek.com/2011/02/... Has this information available via machine processing: http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa... Sites like Time, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes have committed to supporting Facebook's OpenGraphProtocol (http://opengraphprotocol.org) to indicate what the primary subject of a page is as well. One of the benefits, at least for public-facing sites like Newsweek is that external sites can provide custom organization of the content by extracting the details and presenting a temporal, geographic, topical or other scheme for finding content. Rachel Lovinger and I were on a panel last weekend at the Association of Alt Weeklies Web Conference in SF (http://www.altweeklies.com/aan/C...). We highlighted some of the goals and challenges of adopting these technologies in the publishing industry. Some thoughts: Information extraction and reuse User-driven organization of content Linkage to related content Filtering information through trusted sources to manage volume and encourage relevancy SEO traffic support Text summarization and outlining Improving ad placements by factoring in context Improved search Support for multiple channels (web sites, aggregators, mobile devices, tablets) Embedded licensing and portable metadata Rachel and her crew at RazorFish have produced a great read on the future of publishing in the digital world: http://nimble.razorfish.com    Embed Quote
