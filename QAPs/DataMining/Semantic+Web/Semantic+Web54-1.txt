★Is the semantic web a silver bullet for all my problems modeling the world in a relational database?
The short answer is probably not. Semantics are modeled using ontologies. Ontologies are very flexible making it possible to make knowledge computational. Ontologies are represented as triplets of (subject, predicate, object). Mapping the triplets to a relational model is simple but not terribly efficient. Since ontologies are essentially graphs, the traditional problems of mapping graphs to the relational model come into play. Even with this limitation, using ontologies to model your domain is still worthwhile. They will give you the flexibility to codify your problem fully. Once you have an ontology, you can decide what subsets of the model are needed to solve your use cases and translate those to your relational model.    Embed Quote
