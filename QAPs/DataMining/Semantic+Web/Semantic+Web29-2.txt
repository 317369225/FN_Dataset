★How do you explain semantic web to a nine-year old child in one sentence?"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself." —Albert Einstein
@9yr old: The web is like all of the stories in the bookshelf, but before they've been written; all the writers and tellers and illustrators make them into a semantic web: worlds - sometimes overlapping - for you to discover and explore. @14yr old: If the words "Semantic web" in your question is the web, the definition would be me presenting an explanation to you.    Embed Quote
