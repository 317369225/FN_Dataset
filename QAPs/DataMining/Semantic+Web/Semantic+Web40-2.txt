★Semantic Web: Is there a need for a curated central repository for ontologies?
Well, I suppose it depends. Would you say there is a need for a curated central repository for web pages? No, of course not: Everyone should just put the ontologies out there and some generic or ontological search engine will find them and present them. And if someone needs to know which ones are well curated, they'll figure out how to rank the ontologies automatically, just like Google does for web pages. Yes, of course there is: Have you ever tried to find an ontology on the subject you care about? Let alone find all the ontologies that address that subject, or at least all the tolerable ones. And heaven forbid you need to know which ones are best. It's a train wreck. I hear both answers every time the question comes up. And there is definitely value to a targeted consolidated repository, and of course there is value to curation. These were the motivations for MMI's Ontology Registry and Repository (ORR, not the same as OOR that Joel mentions) for marine concepts. And I think the biomedical community gets a large amount of value out of their Bioportal NCBO BioPortal repository. And so on. But such solutions do cost money. The challenge is in convincing funders of their value proposition—slowly those wheels turn, but they do turn. As for a single central repository that's curated, well, there's always Google for that.    Embed Quote
