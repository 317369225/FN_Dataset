★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
I don't know what others feel about this, but I think Semantic Web/LinkedData makes sense only when its principles are applied to big data. After all, the main objective behind Semantic Web / LinkedData is to foster interoperability and connect SILOs of big data. One of the reasons why they may have not spoken much about Semantic Web is probably because most of its principles are still under debate and discussions - bringing it up in an event as large as strataconf might have welcomed contrarian views and opinions about the idea. To answer short, I feel Semantic Web/LinkedData is closely related to data, and more so bigdata where it has huge potential but requires a lot of time for realization.    Embed Quote
