★What are the best Twitter accounts on semantic web?
Marin's list is an excellent one, and I would certainly add him as well: http://twitter.com/marin_dimitrov However, it's obviously a relatively short list given the large number of Twitter users actively involved in the semantic web, and you may want to check Twitter lists that already aggregate users that tweet on this subject.  I actively maintain one such list, and am constantly adding to it as I discover new users through references in tweets and blog posts: http://twitter.com/aaranged/sema...A shorter, good list is provided by semanticweb.com: http://twitter.com/SemanticWeb_c... As for just individual users, I would augment Marin's list with at least the following: http://twitter.com/kidehen http://twitter.com/titticimmino http://twitter.com/mhausenblas http://twitter.com/neumarcx http://twitter.com/kendall http://twitter.com/FrankVanHarmele http://twitter.com/bengee http://twitter.com/RWWNote that the last entry, RWW (ReadWriteWeb) tweets on a variety of new technology subjects, but these frequently include semantic web and semantic-web issues.    Embed Quote
