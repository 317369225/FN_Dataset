★How do you explain semantic web to someone whose professional frame of reference is in order-taking, delivery, humoring customers, or catering in the food service industry?
I would like to take a slightly contrarian view here: you don't. When someone's professional frame is what describe, they are interested in solving a business problem. What matters is to articulate the value proposition - in business terms - that your solution is generating and what business case it solves. Often the technical details don't matter so much - your client will trust you because they have engaged you. What matters is the value proposition and the solution of the business problem. That usually creates the technology pull....and in my view, one should always generate technology pull rather than a technology push.    Embed Quote
