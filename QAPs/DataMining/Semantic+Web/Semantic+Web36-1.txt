★Which digital content curation tools/services leverage semantic web / linked data principles?
Apture helps publishers to enhance their content with digital media. Our first product, Apture Editor, allowed sites like NYTimes, Washington Post, etc to find & curate media into articles and blog posts. (You can see examples on http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com) Apture Highlights (www.apture.com/extension) flips it around by letting users curate information for themselves by highlighting any phrase of text on a page, which pulls up semantically relevant media without causing the user to leave the page using databases like Freebase, WEX, Wikipedia to provide linked data behind the scenes. Highlights has been adopted by publishers like Economist, Scribd, TheNation, etc... see demo here: http://www.economist.com/node/18... (Disclaimer: I am CEO/Co-founder of the company). Zemanta, Evri, and AdaptiveBlue are also in the space, though some no longer offer products to publishers.    Embed Quote
