★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
While the Semantic Web involves Big Data in theory, in practice the current set of Big Data tools such as Hadoop are incapable of massively scaling these data models, limiting practical use cases to Small Data.  This is a well-known limitation of the current Big Data tool chain.  The Semantic Web is a graph analysis problem; parallelizing graph analysis requires solving a particular algorithm problem (disjoint distributed joins) that has not been solved yet.    Embed Quote
