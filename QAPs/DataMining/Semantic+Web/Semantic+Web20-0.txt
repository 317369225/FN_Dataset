★What are existing applications of semantic web technologies?
ThisWeKnow.org (http://www.thisweknow.org)  org  is a very simple example of the use of semantic web technologies to integrate a bunch of public government data from various agencies. The user interface is focused around communities so it’s something that the general public can readily understand (ex: “What does the US government know about my town”).  Under the hood it uses an RDF database to manage all the data. Even though the site is really basic it demonstrates many of the key values that semantics web technologies can provide, such as: Graph Data Model: Simplifies the data warehousing problem (just keep linking data together)   Search: Searching triples not text so there is some meaning to things (Washington is a person not a state).   Browse: Walk the links between data (facets)   Inference: Concepts can be easily mapped (this is the same as that). The site needs work.  it was implemented as part of the Apps for America 2 contest but since then development has been relatively idle except for some occasional hacking that makes it a bit buggy at times.
