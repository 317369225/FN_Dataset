★Is Schema.org good or bad for the Semantic Web?Google, Bing and Yahoo have launched a site called schema.org, "to create and support common ways to represent web page metadata" (you can read the news right here: http://www.informationweek.com/n...), but it doesn't use RDF... so, is it good or bad for the Semantic Web? Or maybe it IS a semantic resource, but is not good for Linked Data project...?
This Creative Commons (CC)'s page http://wiki.creativecommons.org/..., has a useful FAQ on the relationship between schema.org, Microdata, RDFa and various other metadata standards such as Creative Commons' own metadata standard :The Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI) which they write "... is the first independently developed industry-specific framework designed to work with schema.org". Further they write (bold=underlined by me): "In addition to using and recommending RDFa, CC was a significant contributor to the development of RDFa. We think RDFa is clearly the best technology for adding structured data to the web. Additionally, RDFa 1.1 is arguably just as simple and concise as microdata, while benefiting from years of open development, testing, and deployment. We wish schema.org had chosen to use RDFa 1.1. However, without use by tools, metadata is nearly useless. Search engines are the fundamental tools of the web, and the three largest search engines have agreed to collaborate via schema.org on metadata vocabularies that some or all will utilize to provide enhanced search results."   In short: Adopting schema.org is about being pragmatic and driving the adoption of metadata standards by bringing the immediate (potential) benefit of better indexing by the two dominant search engines.    Embed Quote
