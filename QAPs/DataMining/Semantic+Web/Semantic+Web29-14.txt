★How do you explain semantic web to a nine-year old child in one sentence?"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself." —Albert Einstein
Hey son thats not so easy to explain, but as you know Firefox and what it shows and what links are, I'll try. Behind the scenes, the internet is just made of words, and Firefox uses these words to make what you see on the screen - the semantic web is the internet, where all the meaningful words in the background invisibly have a link (Firefox won't show it) that points to the definition of those words, so all the words mean the same thing regardless of you using Firefox, Safari or some other program and where Firefox for example shows you an event, it might allow you in the future to drag it to your calendar directly.    Embed Quote
