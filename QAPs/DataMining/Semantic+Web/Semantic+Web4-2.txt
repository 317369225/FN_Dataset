★What is required for "semantic web" to take off?
While I think Quora is too short for an answer to this question (there is a whole big discussion going on in the industry on how to help semantic web gain momentum), I do feel there are 2 quick needs, which if met, will enable the "semantic web" to accelerate now: 1. Educate: I feel that lot of people are still not educated on what semantic web is all about and what problems is it intended to solve. We need to educate more people on its benefits and purpose. 2. Standards: We need well-defined standards in the realm of the semantic web space that enable their adoption into various tools and applications. We do have various standards coming up now, and many more will need to be developed and enhanced.     When you finally have all the required standards and people who are educated in the benefits of semantic web, I am sure the same people will come forward and adopt the idea of semantic web in whatever they are developing; this alone will act as a recursive effect that will accelerate the pace at which semantic web will spread and grow by connecting all SILOs everywhere.    Embed Quote
