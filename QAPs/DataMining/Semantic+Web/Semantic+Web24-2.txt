★Who's doing what in the semantic web?
Rather broad question but also quite interesting. Seems there are people trying so many different things, not sure where success will be found though. Examples of use cases I have seen: Sentiment analysis trends as relates to stock market trends Case management for Leads/Tickets/Comments, etc Trend Insights Semantic Search on top of regular search Auto-Content creation based on existing content Political conversation tracking with filtering to reduce flame wars so you can focus on intelligent conversation Many many other areas, usually incorporating features/elements of the above. Basically, looking to understand a large scale (millions of people) conversation at speed to allow proper interaction with the appropriate audience in the most effective manner. -ROI is in there somwhere ;-) Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
