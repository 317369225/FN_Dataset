★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
The artificially disjoint and disconnected nature of the BigData, LinkedData, and SemanticWeb labels speaks volumes about how dangerous labels can be when left solely in the hands of marketeers, really! The BigData moniker reflects the fact that across all data generation realms and consumer profiles, the historic realities of structured data heterogeneity and data location disparity are now coming to bear. We are still seeking to Find the proverbial needle in the haystack, but at InterWeb scales rather than local enterprise of desktop scales. The physics of data access, integration, and dissemination is being inflected by the InterWeb. What was unthinkable is now possible. We have URIs that double up as Data Object Identifiers and powerful Data Conductors. We also have the ability to leverage logic as the foundation for conceptual (rather than syntactic) schema. We can now implement Linked Data graphs that collectively evolve the InterWeb into a Global Data Space of discrete interlinked Data Objects. What changed the world by connecting documents is extending its impact to Data. At the end of the day, we are still trying to solve the most important problem of all: reading and writing data in granular form across disparate data spaces without compromising security or performance or sense-making.  BigData, LinkedData, and SemanticWeb are three monikers artificially separated by marketeers and marketing agendas. The confluence of terminology is imminent and unavoidable :-)    Embed Quote
