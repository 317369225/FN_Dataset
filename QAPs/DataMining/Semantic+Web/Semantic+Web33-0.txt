★Semantic Web: What happened to evri?First it was a semantic web search startup, now it seems to be a pap journalism aggregator. Is this what they call a pivot?
We're still around and still sort of a semantic web search startup at heart but right now our focus is in using the semantic tools to build a new kind of news experience that combines aggregation, curation and social graphs along with the core Evri technology. We're spending most of our time on our iPad app, which we're very excited about.    Embed Quote
