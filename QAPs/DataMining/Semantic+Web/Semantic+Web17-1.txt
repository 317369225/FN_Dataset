★What are the biggest problems in "semantic web" today?  What's wrong with it?...and what opportunities are there for startups?
I think the lesson of the last five years is "semantic is a feature, not a product space" Yahoo was first with significant/useful semantic search feature (SearchMonkey), then Google and Bing added the similar functionality. Facebook is recently doing a lot of stuff in semantic space (Open Graph, likes, Facebook Connect), etc. I would not be too focused on "semantic" thing. It belongs to solution space, not to problem space. In most cases, your best bet is start from a big problem: education, energy, health & food, corruption, environment, war and terrorism, transportation. Then think how you can apply your skills and technology to advance solutions to one of these.    Embed Quote
