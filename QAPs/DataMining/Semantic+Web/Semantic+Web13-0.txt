★What comes after the Semantic Web?
I recently read a book called Handbook of Research on Web 2.0, 3.0, and  X.0: Technologies, Business, and Social Applicationsby San Murugesan  (ed) Which made a case for a progression like Web 1.0 ("Info-Centric") -> Web 2.0 ("People-Centric") -> Web 3.0 ("Machine-Centric") -> Web 4.0 ("Agent-Centric") Agents being rule-based programs that find a best option based on a set of rules, somewhat like movie and book recommendations or travel deal websites. The idea is that once data is more machine readable, machines will be able to act as agents not just for one niche website, but to find what you are looking for on the entire web.    Embed Quote
