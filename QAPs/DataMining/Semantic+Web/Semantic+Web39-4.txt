★How will search engine optimization change with the advent of the semantic web?How will SEO be affected/changed with Semantic Web gaining more prominence.
The problem web search engines have always had with metadata is that it's easy to game.  Even in the 1990s, search spammers put misleading words and phrases into the metadata fields for keywords and description tags, so no one could trust them.  I'm not sure how to avoid this with microformats and RDF. However, search engines are already using semantic tools on the visible text of web pages as part of relevance ranking.  The simplest is pluralization: a site about shoes should be found even if the search word was "shoe"; likewise a site about geese if the search word is "goose".  That's good for recall (finding all the pages that match the query).  However, relevance ranking means making fine distinctions among many fairly-equal results, so search engines are likely to rank pages high for that search if they have other goose-related terms such as duck, swan, or anatidae.  The semantics is knowing which terms are related and how.    Embed Quote
