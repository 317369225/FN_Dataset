★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
There is  a clear connection and mutual interest, no doubt. The best piece I came across concerning this question is Pat Helland's ACM Queue article 'If You Have Too Much Data, then “Good Enough” Is Good Enough' [1] where, towards the end, he states that a  'new theory for data' is needed. I then followed up on Pat's article in 'Towards Networked Data' [2], essentially suggesting the theory should be based on the Linked Data principles. The recent introduction of Schema.org (see also Is Schema.org good or bad for the Semantic Web?) is a game changer and needs to be taken into account for this matter. So, the BigData future is bright, the big search engines have now acknowledged the usefulness of structured data and Linked Data can serve as the glue to publish and consume Web data. Just as HTML is the backbone of the Web of Documents (but there are many other formats such as PNG, SVG, etc. used in the content), I expect RDF to play the same role in the Web of Data (while acknowledging the fact that there are many more formats incl. OData, GData, microdata, etc. used). What I am missing is the data processing part. The current question and discussion seems very data-oriented (no problem with this ;) but one needs to also ask the question: how to find, access, clean, reconcile, query, or simply 'use' the BigData. This is where I think we need to have a more abstract view on the 'two clouds', as I tried to render in a slide set [3]. [1] http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?...
