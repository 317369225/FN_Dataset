★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
We researched Semantic Web use in 2009 and Hadoop/Big Data use in 2010 (see our publications at http://www.pwc.com/us/en/technol... and http://www.pwc.com/us/en/technol..., and I too was struck by how separate the Hadoop and Sem Web development communities are from one another. They're different worlds, really. Christian Kohlschütter makes a good point--you can't structure everything, so brute force statistical processing is one way to extract some value from large volumes of log files, for example. At the same time, many who are focused on Big Data are seemingly indifferent to semantics. But relationships between things, language patterns and context generally are essential to connecting the silos of data that are proliferating. Semantic Web tools are generally difficult to use and need lots of improvement.The ontologists who do use them have been toiling away mostly in obscurity for years, but we're beginning to see a shift toward semantic search, for example, and ontologies will be at the center of this shift. Watson, Wolfram Alpha, Endeca, Pandora and Siri are all early examples. This post on how Watson works was illuminating for me: http://writingfordigital.com/201....    Embed Quote
