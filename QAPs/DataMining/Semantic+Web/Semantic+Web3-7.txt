★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
I think there will be contrasting perspectives on this, but i. I'm more of a big data supporter and iI'm still very indifferent to the idea of the semantic web. With Moore's law Law speeding computers towards Artificial Intelligencetoward artificial intelligence, big data is leaping ahead at a dramatic rate, regardless of semantic structure... I use a bunch of semantic tagging (there are some great benefits), but every time i even think about adding them i I feel like i'm going back to 1998... Maybe i I need a DeLorean DMC-12... :)
