★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
Most of the data available is unstructured. So, no, Big Data isn't the Semantic Web. We potentially *mine* big data (as a resource) to later on create something that can be used in the context of the Semantic Web. See my answer on Why the current obsession with big data? for details ( Christian Kohlschütter's answer to Why the current obsession with big data? )    Embed Quote
