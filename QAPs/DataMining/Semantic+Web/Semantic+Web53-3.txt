★How do you explain semantic web to someone whose professional frame of reference is in order-taking, delivery, humoring customers, or catering in the food service industry?
If the service person was in a restaurant taking an order for example, then explain it as: If the customer asks for 'steak'; You would then prompt for cooking style – 'rare/medium rare/well done'; You also know that there are appropriate 'sauces' that would compliment the steak, and; Then you know that the best red wine to have with 'this steak' and 'this sauce' is a Shiraz. This is a semantic relationship that only a human knows, but a computer can make this relationship connection if it can read the data on a web page and interpret that there 'should' be a semantic data relationship between the two items. A big part of the semantic equation is to aid a computer in making a relationship connection between two completely separate data models (such as 'steak' and 'sauce') and then help it to produce 'meaning' that better defines the relationship between the two items so that a third item can be introduced (i.e. the red wine).    Embed Quote
