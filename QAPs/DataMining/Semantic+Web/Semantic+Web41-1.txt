★What is the relationship between the field of ontology and the semantic web?
An ontology is a specification of types of entities and their properties and relations. For instance, a (simplified) ontology for medicine might include diseases, symptoms, drugs, and a relation between diseases/symptoms and disease/drugs. The semantic web is a set of technologies and standards for representing knowledge, including languages for representing ontologies (OWL, eg).  It may be considered an effort to get shared standard ontology languages, ontologies, and knowledge out on the web and interconnected, as opposed to earlier efforts at knowledge representations which tended towards small closed-world systems.    Embed Quote
