★What are your thoughts on the "Semantic Web" ideology?
The Semantic Web is merely the latest, and most successful, expression of knowledge representation technologies.  Knowledge representation has been slowly evolving since Aristotle.  It is "slowly" evolving because it is hard science.  It will continue to evolve and improve as we better understand what "knowledge is".  Heck, we are still in the "crawl-stage" of knowledge management as we barely understand data, metadata and information management.  So, if you take the DIKW pyramid (data, information, knowledge, wisdom) as your learning curve - we are barely out of the data stage.  Best wishes!    Embed Quote
