★Is 'big data' indifferent to the semantic web, i.e. linked data?Presenters and participants at this year's Strata Conference http://strataconf.com/strata2011 had little if anything good or bad to say about the semantic web. The absence of dialogue  between the two struck me as odd as they apparently have much in common.
As I see and understand, there are two pre-dominant efforts in the field of Semantic Web: 1. Information extraction from knowledge 2. Knowledge extraction from information, and In my experience, most efforts are dedicated towards #1. Depending on your approach and perspective the roadmap to building intelligent pathways are quite different. One path requires building cumulative artificial intelligence roadmaps while the second requires focusing more on aligning towards specific intelligence roadmaps of a particular user or group of users.  Aligning towards specific intelligence roadmaps requires much more than big data management and engineering techniques. As an industry, we are still in the early stages of understanding big data. As such the applications of information (or knowledge extraction) are still in relative infancy. In short, I'm not surprised by the lack of coverage of semantic technologies at the Strata Conf.    Embed Quote
