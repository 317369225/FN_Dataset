★What is the state of semantic web?- Are there any web applications that are based on semantic web? - what are current trends in the job market?
The Semantic Web is here now and being used every single day.  You probably used it in the past few days, and just didn't know it. And that's the whole point... by and large, "The Semantic Web" isn't something end users interact with any differently than the rest of the Web.   The "Semantic Web" refers to techniques and technologies that allow machines (computers) to do a better job of finding, sharing, integrating and working with, knowledge.  This, in turn, enables applications that feel "smarter" to the end user, but the average end user will likely never know if the app they are using is based on Semantic Web technologies or not. That said, any time you Google a restaurant or something and you see a "Rich Snippet"[1], you are probably using the Semantic Web. If you really want to access the Semantic Web directly, go to http://dbpedia.org and run through their online SPARQL query tool and do a few sample queries.  When you realize that you can do things like asking for "all musical artists born in the 20th century in a city that is the capital of a country in Africa", you'll realize just how powerful the Semantic Web is, and what kinds of new, knowledge-enabled apps will be coming down the pipe in the future.
