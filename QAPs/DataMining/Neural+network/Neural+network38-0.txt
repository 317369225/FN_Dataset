★What are some advantages of using neural networks over decision trees?references to benchmarks on specific datasets would be very helpful
Rich Caruana and Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil, "An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms," The Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML2006), June 2006, pp. 161-168. http://www.scribd.com/doc/113006... A number of supervised learning methods have been introduced in the last decade. Un- fortunately, the last comprehensive empiri- cal evaluation of supervised learning was the Statlog Project in the early 90's. We present a large-scale empirical comparison between ten supervised learning methods: SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes, memory-based learning, random forests, de- cision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and boosted stumps. We also examine the eect that calibrating the models via Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression has on their perfor- mance. An important aspect of our study is the use of a variety of performance criteria to evaluate the learning methods. https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course...: Random forests have many advantages compared to alternative classication methods: • It has been widely shown that random forests are one of the most accurate existing classication methods • It can deal with a huge number of features • It runs eciently on large datasets • It can help estimate which variables are important in classication • It can be extended to an unsupervised version to work with unlabeled data. • It is relatively robust to noise Some disadvangates attributed to random forests are: • They tend to overt noisy data. • Not as intuitive as some other classication methods • Might take a while to build the forest (but once it's built classication is very fast)    Embed Quote
