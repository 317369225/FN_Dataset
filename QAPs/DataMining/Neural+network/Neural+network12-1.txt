★Artificial Neural Networks: What is an intuitive explanation of Convolutional Neural Networks?
Suppose you have a set of hand-coded rules for a classification task. Then, you can rewrite them in terms of AND and OR operators. For instance, the XOR problem (y = +1 in first and third quadrants, and y = -1 in the second and fourth quadrants) can be written as follows: - ((x1 > 0) AND (X2 > 0)) OR ((x1 < 0) AND (X2 < 0)) => y=+1 - ((x1 > 0) AND (X2 < 0)) OR ((x1 < 0) AND (X2 > 0)) => y=-1 Now convolutional neural networks have a sequence of alternating convolutional layers and pooling layers. The convolutional layer acts like an AND operator: the following filter for a grayscale image +1  -1  0  +1 is analogous to saying that the value of pixel (1,1) is high AND (1,2) is low AND (2,2) is high. An image patch that satisfies these conditions will have a high inner product with this filter, and other patches will have lower inner products. The pooling layer acts like an OR operator: if the outputs of any of the convolutional filters in the previous layer is high, then max-pooling gives a high output.    Embed Quote
