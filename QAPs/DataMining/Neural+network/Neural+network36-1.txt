★Can you train neural networks in parallel?For instance, could I split my data set into two halves, train two networks with the same architecture, and then combine them somehow?
Yeah you can. It is called training phase parallelism and the concept is introduced by Jeffrey Dean. DeepLearning4j is one such open source implementation. I have made my own implementation of Jeffrey Dean using Graphlab and Mesos. Of course it needs some more developments. Here is the link jsaisagar/Deep-Learning-Over-Graphlab    Embed Quote
