★Why aren't artificial neural networks used for everything?Artificial neural networks are pretty decent general-purpose problem solvers. Of course you wouldn't do colliding galaxy simulations with them or anything ridiculous like that, but it seems that in AI they have a very good applicability range. So what are the reasons why it isn't more widely used (e.g. problem forumulation/translation to ANN, hardware to run is too expensive, they're too slow, etc.)?
Sometimes logistic regression and simple tree (C 4.5) can generate equally good results on not so complex dataset while Neural Net may run MUCH slower.    Embed Quote
