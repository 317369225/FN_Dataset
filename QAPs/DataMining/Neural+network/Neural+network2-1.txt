★What is the best neural network library for Python?I am currently testing Neurolab http://code.google.com/p/neurolab/ and I am pretty happy about that. However, I would like to know if there exist other libraries and your opinion about that. It would also be great to know machine learning libraries with other classification algorithms, such as decision trees, k-means, nn, etc.
In addition to PyBrain that was mentioned in one of the other answers here, there are few more: Fast Artificial Neural Network Library: This is not written in python but it does have a python binding - Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (FANN) Orange: - This is a library and a GUI completely written explicitly in Python - http://orange.biolab.si/ Neurolab - This is a python library for neural networks.  http://code.google.com/p/neurolab/    Embed Quote
