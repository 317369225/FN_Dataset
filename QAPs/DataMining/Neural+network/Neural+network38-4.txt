★What are some advantages of using neural networks over decision trees?references to benchmarks on specific datasets would be very helpful
Decision trees can be useful for interpreting the relative importance of different features (what was the first decision in the tree?).  I think logistic regressions with LASSO are actually better at this. ANN's are "universal approximators".  With a sufficient amount of data and time and the right ANN architecture you should be able to approximate whatever function generated the data with an arbitrary amount of accuracy. The downside is that ANN's are "black boxes" as far as interpretation goes and generalization is a problem (it's very easy to overfit your training data).    Embed Quote
