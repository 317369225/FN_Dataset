★What is a convolutional neural network?
You can think of convolutional neural networks as using multiple copies of the same neuron in different places. It's a bit like writing a function once and using it multiple times in programming. Just like you are less prone to make a mistake if you only write the function once, the network is better able to model the data when it learns to do something once and uses that in multiple places. Convolutinal neural networks, as pictured above, are a particular way of using lots of copies of the same neuron. They only work on special kinds of problems. You see, in order to use multiple copies of the same neuron in different places, you need to know that it useful to use the same function in multiple different places. We can do this in vision problems because we understand something about the symmetries of images: it is useful to do the same thing in lots of different places! For example, it is useful to detect horizontal edges in lots of different places. So, we use the same neuron, applied to patches all around the image. This typically results in a locally-connected network, as described by Martin, because we only have each neuron look at some inputs. But this isn't intrinsic. In theory, each neuron could look at the entire image, translated different amounts. Or, in certain generalizations, the same neuron looks at the entire input, transformed in ways other than translation. You might enjoy my blog post, Conv Nets: A Modular Perspective.    Embed Quote
