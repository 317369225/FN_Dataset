★How do I understand convolution neural networks and deep convolution neural networks for unsupervised and supervised learning?1) is there any good references for CNN and deep CNN? 3) what's the each layer? 2) How is the deep CNN for feature learning and what the pre-training is?
FOLLOW UP WITH THESE RESOURCES. Page on deeplearning.net 2.Papers from Yoshua Bengio,Andrew Ng,Yann Lecun, Geoffrey Hinton and their Phd students.
