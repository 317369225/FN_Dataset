★How do I create a neural network for Alzheimer's detection?
First of all, I congratulate you on wanting to get involved with the important area of medical  diagnosis and detection. However, I do believe that you are on a fool's errand in trying to calculate length of life left. If it could be done with any accuracy, every actuary and life insurance company would be doing it in order to calculate exposure to claims. So would every hospital as that information would be vital for deciding budgeting issues. Perhaps, you should make these your first port of call and see what they do at the moment to use that as your starting point. Sorry, I can't be of more help. Nonetheless, I wish you well in your endeavour Thanks for the A2A, Abu    Embed Quote
