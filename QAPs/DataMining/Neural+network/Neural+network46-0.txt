★What do you mean by a neural network?
A neural network is nothing but a simulation of actual neurons in your brains. Actual neurons in your brain are vastly interconnected, much like a mesh network, hence the name. A model of a single neuron is made to interact with each other to see the result. Think of it like getting artificial players in a video game simulation to play each other, except here each player is modeled as a neuron, so it behaves like one (Inhibation etc.). Behavior of individual neurons and their network architecture is pretty easy to find online.    Embed Quote
