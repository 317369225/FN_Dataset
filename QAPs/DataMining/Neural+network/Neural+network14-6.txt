★Why aren't artificial neural networks used for everything?Artificial neural networks are pretty decent general-purpose problem solvers. Of course you wouldn't do colliding galaxy simulations with them or anything ridiculous like that, but it seems that in AI they have a very good applicability range. So what are the reasons why it isn't more widely used (e.g. problem forumulation/translation to ANN, hardware to run is too expensive, they're too slow, etc.)?
They aren't used for everything because despite the cool things they can do to solve some problems they are realitively stupid compared to real neural networks. In fact, the use of the term "artificial neural networks" is a misnomer. They are a poor representation of biological neural networks, missing most of the granularity of the operations in real neural networks.    Embed Quote
