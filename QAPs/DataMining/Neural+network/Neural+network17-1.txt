★How big is the largest feedforward neural network ever trained, and what for?
A Scalable Simulator for an Architecture for Cognitive Computing (presented at SuperComputing 2012 two weeks ago and part of the IBM SyNAPSE project): Abstract: Inspired by the function, power, and volume of the organic brain, we are developing TrueNorth, a novel modular, non-von Neumann, ultra-low power, compact architecture. TrueNorth consists of a scalable network of neurosynaptic cores, with each core containing neurons, dendrites, synapses, and axons. To set sail for TrueNorth, we have developed Compass, a multithreaded, massively parallel functional simulator and a parallel compiler that maps a network of long-distance pathways in the Macaque monkey brain to TrueNorth. We demonstrate near-perfect weak scaling on a 16 rack IBM Blue Gene/Q (262144 CPUs, 256 TB memory), achieving an unprecedented scale of 256 million neurosynaptic cores containing 65 billion neurons and 16 trillion synapses running only 388× slower than real-time with an average spiking rate of 8.1 Hz. By using emerging PGAS communication primitives, we also demonstrate 2× better real-time performance over MPI primitives on a 4 rack Blue Gene/P (16384 CPUs, 16 TB memory). Note that the brain isn't a feedforward neural network, but recurrent, so this network isn't feedforward. IBM SyNAPSE project is awesome, you'll find plenty of information here: a cognitive computing project from IBM Research. This summarizes pretty well their vision: SyNAPSE: IBM Cognitive Computing Project - Overview: ************************************************************************** Another project: SPAUN (Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network) A Large-Scale Model of the Functioning Brain: ABSTRACT A central challenge for cognitive and systems neuroscience is to relate the incredibly complex behavior of animals to the equally complex activity of their brains. Recently described, large-scale neural models have not bridged this gap between neural activity and biological function. In this work, we present a 2.5-million-neuron model of the brain (called “Spaun”) that bridges this gap by exhibiting many different behaviors. The model is presented only with visual image sequences, and it draws all of its responses with a physically modeled arm. Although simplified, the model captures many aspects of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and psychological behavior, which we demonstrate via eight diverse tasks. Chris Eliasmith, Terrence C.
