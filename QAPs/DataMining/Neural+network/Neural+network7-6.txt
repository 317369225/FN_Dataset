★How do I create a neural network for Alzheimer's detection?
If you just want to do diagnosis, then a full blown neural network is a bit overkill. A support vector machine will do nicely - pick some stuff that you (or the appropriate literature) thinks are good indicators and provide (equally sized!) sample classes for patients that are not ill and patients that definitely are.    Embed Quote
