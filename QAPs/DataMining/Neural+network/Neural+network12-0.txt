★Artificial Neural Networks: What is an intuitive explanation of Convolutional Neural Networks?
Each convolution slice (within one of the first layers) looks for a specifik feature (such as a straight line at 30 degrees slant, or a short curve to the left going from green to mauve). Lower layers combine these features into more complex things, such as mouth-like shapes, or wheel-like structures. Even further down, near or at the output layer, these complex features are combined into objects such as faces, cars and cows. It's based on a simplified version of how the visual cortex works.    Embed Quote
