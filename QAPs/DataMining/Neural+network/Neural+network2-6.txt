★What is the best neural network library for Python?I am currently testing Neurolab http://code.google.com/p/neurolab/ and I am pretty happy about that. However, I would like to know if there exist other libraries and your opinion about that. It would also be great to know machine learning libraries with other classification algorithms, such as decision trees, k-means, nn, etc.
Scikit-Learn is great if you want to get started. Theano has some interesting tools available for the purpose of machine learning. If you are interested in Deep Learning then I think you should use PyLearn2 instead of PyBrain which has been abandoned by the developers.    Embed Quote
