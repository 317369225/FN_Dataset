★What problems in artificial intelligence cannot be addressed using artificial neural networks?How about using deep belief networks? Some relevant links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art... How can knowledge representation be done in neural networks?
One of the downsides of neural networks is that a trained network does not give you much (if any) information about what is going on inside the network. The network maps inputs to outputs, but the mapping process itself is a black box: it is hard to determine the rules that map the inputs to outputs.   One of the problems mentioned in the Wikipedia article is natural language processing. One could use a neural network for natural language processing and the resulting network may perform well, but the network would not provide any insight into the underlying processes of natural language processing. This is not a problem when the goal is to just have a working system (which is of course a very legitimate goal). However, in the field of artificial intelligence the goal might also be to have a better understanding of the underlying processes of a given problem. The black box approach with a neural network is then not very useful. Related to this point is when a researcher is interested in testing a specific model for a given problem. A neural network is then also not useful when it is not part of the model.    Embed Quote
