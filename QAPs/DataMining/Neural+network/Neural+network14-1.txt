★Why aren't artificial neural networks used for everything?Artificial neural networks are pretty decent general-purpose problem solvers. Of course you wouldn't do colliding galaxy simulations with them or anything ridiculous like that, but it seems that in AI they have a very good applicability range. So what are the reasons why it isn't more widely used (e.g. problem forumulation/translation to ANN, hardware to run is too expensive, they're too slow, etc.)?
Because there's generally better solutions available for most problems. While in theory multilayered neural networks can approximate any function, in practice you need a huge amount of training data and processing time to even approach something useful. In most cases it makes more sense to just use a human designed heuristic solution or alternatively a more modern machine learning approach such as SVMs or RandomForests.    Embed Quote
