★How does deep learning work and how is it different from normal neural networks and/or SVM?And also, how does one go about starting to understand them (papers/blogs/articles) ?
There are several ideas about what is going on LeCun has tried to understand Deep Learning in terms of modern spin glass theory "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Deep Learning" IMHO, this analysis is probably not sufficient Beyond this, it is has been suggested that Unsupervised Deep Learning Networks implement a form of Variational Renormalization Group Theory http://arXiv.org/pdf/1410.3831v1.pdf Others have suggested that Deep Learning is learning local group structures "WHY DOES UNSUPERVISED DEEP LEARNING WORK? - A PERSPECTIVE FROM GROUP THEORY" Page on arxiv.org although this is probably equivalent to saying that the RG flow map has either a good  fixed point or several useful cycles. This is probably all correct--and in addition to these, I suspect that  Deep Learning algos is related to Spin Funnels from protein folding Why does Deep Learning work? and some other deep areas from theoretical physics like Renormalization Group theory Why Deep Learning Works II:  the Renormalization Group The point being, for some reason, computer scientists and machine learning researchers think that Hopfield Backprop Networks are non-convex. Who said they were non-convex ?!   We have known for 20 years that spin funnels are most likely not only convex but sharply peaked.   Which is why I suspect the current multi-scale DL NNs are effectively spin funnels--and the when we train a deep learning network, we discover the spin glass of minimal frustration.  Now they are hard to train without overtraining--and this seems to have been solved now.    Embed Quote
