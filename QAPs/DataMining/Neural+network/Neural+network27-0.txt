★How do you interpret Neural Network results?Ive watch quite a few youtube videos on neural nets and even pumped some data through them. Can someone give me an example of how one would intepret these results, preferbly in a business setting (ex: users defecting from a website, credit default, purchasing xyz product)
If you are using a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) or similar, you probably entered customer characteristics as input and some desirable customer behavior as output (money spent on store, a credit default flag, etc). In case the output is a continuous variable (money spent), you will use the trained network to have an estimate of customer expenditure as soon as you get the client record, without the need to actually observe the purchases. You can decide on how much you will invest (in terms of special offers and extra goodies) to this client. If your output is a flag, you will have the "probability" of the client defaulting to be used in the moment of credit concession. You will set a cutoff point and deny service to people below this point, and scale the available credit proportional to the neural network output. If you are using a Self-organizing map, the output will be a graphical representation of important customer segments, developed using algorithms (so, less cognitive bias than a hand-drawn segmentation).
