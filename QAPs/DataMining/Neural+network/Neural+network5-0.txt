★What are neural networks?
The term of "neural network" refers to, as the name suggests, a biologically inspired sub-field of artificial intelligence modeled after the brain. While the functions vary, the concept, which was introduced in the fifties with the likes of the shape sorting perceptron, is to run data through a field of interconnected states that parallels neurons and synapses found in nature. Data is usually broken down into binary form, and fed through these layer(s). While some algorithms are self training, all nns work through automated training of these synapses (think stochastic optimization)to perform certain operations, so the produced output of running any given input from the training data is optimal, or as accurate as possible. The idea is that these networks can pick up on patterns, and learn how to handle certain types of data. Many variations stand for different applications, such as phonetic processing or, more popularly, visual processing. In my opinion, it seems that these nets would work best in intertwined sets of processing and function, or better yet, as a complement to other AI systems.
