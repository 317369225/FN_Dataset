★Why aren't artificial neural networks used for everything?Artificial neural networks are pretty decent general-purpose problem solvers. Of course you wouldn't do colliding galaxy simulations with them or anything ridiculous like that, but it seems that in AI they have a very good applicability range. So what are the reasons why it isn't more widely used (e.g. problem forumulation/translation to ANN, hardware to run is too expensive, they're too slow, etc.)?
Because actual neural networks (i.e. the brain) still does better at solving interesting problems than artificial neural nets.   We call these superior machines/slaves "statisticians." But that's probably not what you are asking!  You are probably wondering instead why people are not using artificial neural nets to deal with simple problems that these tools can solve.   The main reason?  People aren't as smart as you imagine we are, even if we are much smarter than bots! Neither human nor machine can currently ask all the questions that we can  answer.  Nothing probably ever will.  Having technology, and applying it to something, are two separate steps in technical progress. In other words, it's easier to invent a hammer than to find nails.  Many things people take as nails, are not really nails (1). We can probably explain the above problem in terms of computational complexity.  If I have a lot of time on my hands (which I do)... and is getting paid as much as a professor in Computer Science or Statistics departments (not really), I would try. Have a nice day robophile!  Your day will come, but it's not today.  :) REFERENCES: 1. if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail    Embed Quote
