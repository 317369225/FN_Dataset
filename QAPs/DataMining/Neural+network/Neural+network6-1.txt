★What is a convolutional neural network?
Short: They are Neural Networks that are sparsely (not fully) connected on the input layer. This makes each neuron in the following layer responsible for only part of the input, which is valuable for recognizing parts of images, for example. A bit elaborated: In order to recognize parts of an image, we would ideally like to segment that image into meaningful parts. If we consider an image as a matrix, each subset of that image might represent an object (a pattern). Let's assume that every neuron in the input layer takes a separate pixel. There would be two approaches to this - bottom-up (combining pixels into meaningful patterns) and top-down (splitting the whole image into meaningful parts). How does the "not fully connected" part work here? Simple, since if we connect every neuron in the input layer to every neuron in the next layer, we would consider the whole image in each following neuron. Therefore, this would be the top-down approach - you take everything and eventually null some connections to isolate certain parts. While, if you would connect a subset of input pixels to the next layer (for example, a subset could be a 3x3 pixel square), you take the bottom-up approach, connecting parts of images into meaningful patterns, resulting in a model that generalizes better.
