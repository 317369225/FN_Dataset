★What are the toughest neural networks and deep learning interview questions?
There are no such things as *toughest* interview questions. However, I do have some questions to test whether candidates really understand deep learning. Can they derive the back-propagation and weights update? Extend the above question to non-trivial layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, etc. How to implement dropout Their intuition when and why some tricks such as max pooling, ReLU, maxout, etc. work. There are no right answers but it helps to understand their thoughts and research experience. Can they abstract the forward, backward, update operations as matrix operations, to leverage BLAS and GPU? If a candidate shows early signs that he/she is an expert in DL, it's not necessary to ask all those questions in details. We can discuss one of their papers or a recent hot paper or something that is not necessarily DL.    Embed Quote
