★Are neural networks still popular in modeling?Neural networks can model almost any system given the right parameters (no, of layers, no. of nodes, etc). But, determining them is a very hard problem. So are they still popular in modeling? What problems are basically modeled using a neural network? I know that they are used to model the neurons and problems in pattern recognition and machine learning but, are they used to model anything else?
Yes. They are all the rage as of January 2015.  Google "deep learning".    Embed Quote
