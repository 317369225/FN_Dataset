★Has anyone tried cyclic wiring of the neural network?What I mean by "cyclic wiring": Connecting some output neurons directly to the input ones. This could provide term memory or perhaps simulate kind of "consciousness" :). I just can't find any experiments with this.
I have tried to do exactly that with DBN-RBMs for analysing time-series (blood pressure and insuline-glucose). What I was trying to achieve was building a regression model that was capable of tracking and 'forecasting' hiper/hipo tensive/glycaemic events. For this particular implementation, the results improved slightly (about 5% improvement in MSE) so that the effort and complexity added did not pay off. Despite this setback, I am convinced that this approach is promising for analysing time-series (If I happen to have the right dataset :-)). I hope this helps.    Embed Quote
