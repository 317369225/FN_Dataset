★Are neural networks still popular in modeling?Neural networks can model almost any system given the right parameters (no, of layers, no. of nodes, etc). But, determining them is a very hard problem. So are they still popular in modeling? What problems are basically modeled using a neural network? I know that they are used to model the neurons and problems in pattern recognition and machine learning but, are they used to model anything else?
Popular? Not really, especially compared to their peak in the 80's and early 90's. The main issue is that a neural net does not provide any readily-interpretable information about your data in general. SOM variants are, I believe, still used for visualization (I think there's a startup founder here who's company does basically that).    Embed Quote
