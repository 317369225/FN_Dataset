★What problems in artificial intelligence cannot be addressed using artificial neural networks?How about using deep belief networks? Some relevant links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art... How can knowledge representation be done in neural networks?
Artificial Neural Networks are not really valuable except for to inefficiently simulate what Neural Networks are capable of.  Biological Neural Networks comprise an extremely parallelized computer that realizes the one class of algorithms that could benefit from such an extreme level of parallelization.  This algorithm can be mapped to serial computers, with some reduction in efficiency, but artificial neural nets are not the optimal such mapping.  Using a serial computer to model a system where individual units each manage their relationships with other individual units results in the loss of benefits afforded by such a system.    Embed Quote
