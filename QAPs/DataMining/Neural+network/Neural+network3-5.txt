★Is there a recurrent neural networks toolkit?Is there a toolkit for recurrent neural networks? I'm interested in using them for time series classification. The idea of a recurrent neural network is that sensor values are fed to the network one by one, so there is no embedding. I.e. the network has an internal state to represent past events. So far I have found: http://jsalatas.ictpro.gr/weka/
PyBrain http://www.pybrain.org has a nice implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) along with implementations of more popular and upcoming form of  RNNs in the field of Deep Learning for classification and prediction tasks: LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks. It also provides implementation for multi-dimensional RNNs.    Embed Quote
