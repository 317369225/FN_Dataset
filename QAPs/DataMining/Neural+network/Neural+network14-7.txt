★Why aren't artificial neural networks used for everything?Artificial neural networks are pretty decent general-purpose problem solvers. Of course you wouldn't do colliding galaxy simulations with them or anything ridiculous like that, but it seems that in AI they have a very good applicability range. So what are the reasons why it isn't more widely used (e.g. problem forumulation/translation to ANN, hardware to run is too expensive, they're too slow, etc.)?
Remember the old cliché, "To a hammer, everything looks like a nail"?  There is no "best" algorithm; each problem demands a different approach, and every algorithm/methodology involves a trade-off of some sort.  If there was a Super Duper Magical Algorithm that performed best in every imaginable context, then the field of machine learning would be finished.  Stanford and MIT's A.I. departments could shutter their doors forever.  Anyone wishing to predict the stock market, or crack cryptographic/capcha images, or automatically diagnose cancerous lesions from MRI/CT imaging data......could just copy/paste some lines of code posted on StackOverflow, plug in their own inputs, and be done with it. It is the very nature of intelligence and learning, along with the "no free lunch" theorem, that makes machine learning a lively and very difficult field.  I don't predict the discovery of a "silver bullet" algorithm any time in the near future.    Embed Quote
