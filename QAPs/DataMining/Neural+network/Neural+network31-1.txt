★Has anyone tried cyclic wiring of the neural network?What I mean by "cyclic wiring": Connecting some output neurons directly to the input ones. This could provide term memory or perhaps simulate kind of "consciousness" :). I just can't find any experiments with this.
In addition to the two answers given, I'd like to direct your attention to the Hopfield network. It's a recurrent neural network like Benjamin mentions, and I think could also be a bidirectional associative memory like Lucian's post says. It's meant to [simplistically] model human memory. It's derived from the Ising model of statistical mechanics (electron spins inside a magnet and how they interact with each other). Also, the Boltzmann machine is the stochastic version of the Hopfield network and is non-deterministic.    Embed Quote
