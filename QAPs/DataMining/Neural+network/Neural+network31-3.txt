★Has anyone tried cyclic wiring of the neural network?What I mean by "cyclic wiring": Connecting some output neurons directly to the input ones. This could provide term memory or perhaps simulate kind of "consciousness" :). I just can't find any experiments with this.
I believe that this is called a recurrent neural network. Check the citations here (Recurrent neural network) for some examples of experiments using them.    Embed Quote
