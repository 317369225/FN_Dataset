★What NLP problems has deep learning or neural networks been applied to successfully?I know there has been significant work in language modeling. I have also seen some unified approaches (paper). I am more interested in things like entity, relationship extraction.
I would add speech recognition to the list provided by Ke Tran. Neural networks are successfully used in state of the art speech recognition systems where they can be utilized as language models [1], acoustic models [2] and phone duration models [3].
