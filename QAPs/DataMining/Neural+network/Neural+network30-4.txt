★What NLP problems has deep learning or neural networks been applied to successfully?I know there has been significant work in language modeling. I have also seen some unified approaches (paper). I am more interested in things like entity, relationship extraction.
My 2 cents: Paraphrase Detection: Dynamic pooling and unfolding recursive autoencoders for paraphrase detection. Document Modeling and Retrieval: Semi-supervised learning of compact document representations with deep networks Machine Transliteration: A Deep Learning Approach to Machine Transliteration Update: I recently came across this page that has an extensive bibliography for deep learning in every possible domain including NLP.
