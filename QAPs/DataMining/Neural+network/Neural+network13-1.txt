★Machine Learning: What would a neural network with schizophrenia look like?Alternately, what does a neural network without schizophrenia look like?
First, it is important to understand what schizophrenia is, beyond the simple definition above. Schizophrenics suffer hallucinations such as hearing voices. Anyone can experience the same kinds of hallucinations by staying awake for 48 hours. Hallucinations are dream fragments like you would have during normal REM sleep, except while awake. Understandably, having this happen all the time can make it difficult to function normally. All placental and marsupial mammals have REM sleep. Nobody knows why. One possibility is that REM sleep is when your daily memories (stored mostly in the hippocampus) are copied to long term memory in the (larger) cerebral cortex. The analogy in computers would be copying memories from cache to RAM, or from RAM to disk. A very simple neural model would therefore be as follows. You would design a neural network with a memory hierarchy consisting of a small number of fast adapting synapses (short term memory), and a larger number of slow adapting synapses (long term memory). Then you would cycle the neural network between two phases representing wakefulness and sleep. In the waking cycle, you would train the network normally, which means providing some input and adjusting the fast adapting synapses to reduce the output error.  During the sleep phase, the input and output neurons would be isolated from the environment, modeling loss of consciousness and sleep paralysis. Then you would play back the day's memories from the fast neurons by randomly stimulating their inputs and train the slow adapting neurons to produce the same outputs. Now we are ready to model the hallucinations that occur during schizophrenia in our (vastly oversimplified) model. We apply random inputs during the waking phase instead of just the sleep phase.    Embed Quote
