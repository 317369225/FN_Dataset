★What is the best neural network library for Python?I am currently testing Neurolab http://code.google.com/p/neurolab/ and I am pretty happy about that. However, I would like to know if there exist other libraries and your opinion about that. It would also be great to know machine learning libraries with other classification algorithms, such as decision trees, k-means, nn, etc.
It really depends a lot. Personally I'd go with pylearn2 for deep learning. You really want GPU support to get shit done fast. Pybrain is nice, but way too slow for me personally.    Embed Quote
