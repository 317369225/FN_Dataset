★What problems in artificial intelligence cannot be addressed using artificial neural networks?How about using deep belief networks? Some relevant links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art... How can knowledge representation be done in neural networks?
Artificial neural networks have advantages in pattern recognition and discrimination functions but are not so good at digital computation.  Furthermore, they must learn from doing and being rewarded when they are correct.  Any problem that cannot be implemented in a learning model is going to be a problem for a neural network.    Embed Quote
