★What is the best open source neural network library?e.g. http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/
It depends on the programming language. I would suggest Weka http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/w... which comes with Java libraries and a graphic interface to experiment also with different classification and clustering algorithms.    Embed Quote
