★Are neural networks still popular in modeling?Neural networks can model almost any system given the right parameters (no, of layers, no. of nodes, etc). But, determining them is a very hard problem. So are they still popular in modeling? What problems are basically modeled using a neural network? I know that they are used to model the neurons and problems in pattern recognition and machine learning but, are they used to model anything else?
Recall that there are some NN architectures that do not need the number of nodes to be specified beforehand. For example, Growing Neural Gas or Fuzzy ARTMAP (and tons of other FAM-derived networks), and even Kohonen's SOM have some growing variants. "To model anything else": yes; look, for example at bidirectional associative memories; they might be used for recalling a correct word starting from a misspelled one or retrieval by content (as a hashtable does; however, unlike hashtable, the BAM can get a slightly misspelled version of the key and still find the associated answer). The MAXNET network can be used for getting the maximum value from a set of positive values; Hopfield network can be used for function optimization (e.g. salesman's problem, which is not just a toy-problem). And I guess that there are few others usages of NNs. The main idea of this answer is: not all NNs are feedforward NNs trained with backpropagation.    Embed Quote
