★What is the best neural network library for Python?I am currently testing Neurolab http://code.google.com/p/neurolab/ and I am pretty happy about that. However, I would like to know if there exist other libraries and your opinion about that. It would also be great to know machine learning libraries with other classification algorithms, such as decision trees, k-means, nn, etc.
The best "all purpose" machine learning library is probably scikit-learn. It implements many state of the art algorithms (all those you mention, for a start), its is very easy to use and reasonably efficient. The problem is that it is not very easy to tweak; the high-level documentation is good but the lower level stuff is not so apparent. It is an excellent tool if you have a dataset and want to test some various "off the shelf" algorithms on it, but it is not so useful as a basis for research. If you want to explore specifically neural networks and want to build them "by hand" and experiment unusual stuff with them (different activation functions, recurrencies, etc.), then PyBrain is a good choice. You can build your network layer by layer with the components you want and manipulate them, all very easily. The limitations is that it only does neural networks, and also I find it quite slow. I never used Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (FANN) but it is quite widely used; it is a C library with Python bindings and is designed to be fast. It is not really a machine learning library but I want to mention Theano. It is actually a powerful symbolic computing library coupled with a C code generator for numerical evaluation. It is not easy to use, but it is extremely flexible and powerful and runs dead fast (you can even use CUDA, and it is completely transparent).    Embed Quote
