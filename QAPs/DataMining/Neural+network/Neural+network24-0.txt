★What is the new generation neural network?
Nothing much new here. The algorithms used for training neural nets have been discovered decades ago. Even convolutional neural network which gives the best performance on image data has been proposed in 1980. In last couple of years neural nets have been reinvented mainly because now we have the computational capability and enough amount of data to train the whole network without overfitting. Large systems provided us the capability to go even deeper and train the parameters for neural nets having several layers(6-7 or even more). That's why the whole community is mad about deep learning. Most popularly used neural nets today are convolutional neural nets, deep belief nets, stacked auto encoders and their variants.    Embed Quote
