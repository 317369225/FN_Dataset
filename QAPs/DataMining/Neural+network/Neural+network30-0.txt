★What NLP problems has deep learning or neural networks been applied to successfully?I know there has been significant work in language modeling. I have also seen some unified approaches (paper). I am more interested in things like entity, relationship extraction.
Some successful applications of neural networks off the top of my head: Statistical machine translation (see the best paper [1] award at ACL-2014) Sentiment analysis: Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank, Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents (Quoc Le and Tomas Mikolov) POS tagging: Learning Character-level Representations for Part-of-Speech Tagging (Cicero Dos Santos and Bianca Zadrozny) Parsing: Parsing With Compositional Vector Grammars (Richard Socher John Bauer Christopher D. Manning. Andrew Y. Ng) Discourse analysis: Representation Learning for Text-level Discourse Parsing (Yangfeng Ji and Jacob Eisenstein) [1]: Fast and Robust Neural Network Joint Models for Statistical Machine Translation.
