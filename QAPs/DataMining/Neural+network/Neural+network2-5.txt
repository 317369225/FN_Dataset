★What is the best neural network library for Python?I am currently testing Neurolab http://code.google.com/p/neurolab/ and I am pretty happy about that. However, I would like to know if there exist other libraries and your opinion about that. It would also be great to know machine learning libraries with other classification algorithms, such as decision trees, k-means, nn, etc.
I have been using PyBrain for long enough now. It is very helpful and many algorithms are already implemented in there.  It's extremely flexible to use and gives good performance too. You should check it out. My second bet is scikit-learn. But like Alexandre mentioned Scikit is best for all purpose Machine Learning but not awesomely fast in Neural nets.    Embed Quote
