★How can neural networks learn to solve math problems?
IMO, an ANN never learns to solve problems, it just learns to predict the output. By learning over all training data, it learned to fit or classify the input. After that, the ANN can fit the training data well just like a complex function or curve or something the like. When you feed the trained model a new input, it just match the input with the pattern it learned, then produce a new value with a high probability to be correct. As for math problems, ANN just found or approached the functions  by learning, then it can predict values with acceptable probability or accuracy to be correct, nothing more.    Embed Quote
