★Is there a recurrent neural networks toolkit?Is there a toolkit for recurrent neural networks? I'm interested in using them for time series classification. The idea of a recurrent neural network is that sensor values are fed to the network one by one, so there is no embedding. I.e. the network has an internal state to represent past events. So far I have found: http://jsalatas.ictpro.gr/weka/
Try using the Matlab Neural Network toolkit. It has implementations for layer recurrent neural network (layrecnet) and non linear autoregressive neural network (narxnet). You can start the toolbox with the command nnstart in Matlab. Dynamic networks http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/... Neural Network Toolbox http://www.mathworks.co.uk/produ... You can also use RapidMiner with windowing or tapped time delay (they are the same thing), which is the same as narxnet in matlab.  It is unclear that recurrent neural nets (layrecnet) are superior to feed forward neural nets with a tapped time delay (narxnet). In the latter, you have a feed forward network and feed the last D examples as separate features, plus you also feed the past D values of your label. The advantage of this is that you can use it with any machine learning algorithm, not just neural network but also support vector machine. This is how you setup your data with a delay of 3, where X(time,feature) is the input and Y(time) is the output.
