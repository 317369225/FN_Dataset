★How does deep learning work and how is it different from normal neural networks and/or SVM?And also, how does one go about starting to understand them (papers/blogs/articles) ?
I think a nice way to sum it up appeared in LeCun's slideshow (@Page on nyu.edu) - in regular applications of neural networks and SVMs, you hand-craft elaborate feature extractors that create suitable higher-level features from the raw data, actually you spend most of your time on tuning that. In the deep learning paradigm, high-level feature extraction is part of the automated solution. This can be framed in a variety of ways - either simply as extra layers of your neural networks (that are somewhat specialized to avoid the vanishing gradient problem; ConvNets), or e.g. as "dimensionality reduction" (like PCA but more awesome; auto-encoders). I think a good point where to start exploring is a work-in-progress survey paper by Schmidbauer ([1404.7828] Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview).  Aside of LeCun's slides above then, a nice slideshow focused (much but not exclusively) on NLP applications and RNNs is Socher's tutorial (Richard Socher - Deep Learning Tutorial).    Embed Quote
