★How do convolutional neural networks work?Especially, what kind of benefits does convolution give you?
u learn ur features(weights of the network) on a small image say 8X8 and create say 200 learned features for input 8X8 image. (say u train the autoencoder) say you have trained the network on different 8X8 randomly sampled images from the large image. (autoencoder training) Now u have features learned from 8X8 image. u will now use this features which takes 8X8 input. take all possible 8X8 images of larger image and for each 8X8 image u get 200 features. ineffect u can do it by convolving weights with the larger image. and thus the name convolutional network. U can also reduce the comupational complexity by pooling(mean or max pooling). (feature generation usable to say classification) http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/i... http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/i...    Embed Quote
