★What is the difference between recurrent neural networks and recursive neural networks?
I think we are dealing semantics. There are many different architectures of back propagating neural nets. In general these are recursive networks. Recurrent networks are recursive networks and the difference between them is not well defined. Some would say that if you can unfold the network such that it becomes a true feed forward network, then it is recurrent. I am not satisfied with this definition. I experimented with a recursive network to perform power management for a hybrid vehicle. Conventional network traing if these networks is very difficult because of the back propagation loops. Training a recurrent network by unfolding it is much easier. It is not clear to me that the efficiency of a recursive network is better than a feed forward network in executing the task that we were using it for. It did however produce results that were closer to the Stochastic Dynamic Programming solution which was considered optimal.  than did the feed forward network. I did not publish the results as the vehicle this was to be applied to for testing was accidentally destroyed by an inattentive operator before the algorithm was applied.    Embed Quote
