★Are neural networks still popular in modeling?Neural networks can model almost any system given the right parameters (no, of layers, no. of nodes, etc). But, determining them is a very hard problem. So are they still popular in modeling? What problems are basically modeled using a neural network? I know that they are used to model the neurons and problems in pattern recognition and machine learning but, are they used to model anything else?
Yes. Neural networks have grown extremely popular recently in the guise of "Deep Belief Networks," due to work by Geoff Hinton, Andrew Ng, and others. They've been applied successfully to computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. See: To what extent are neural nets used for solving current learning problems, like ranking, spam filtering, image recognition, speech recognition, etc?    Embed Quote
