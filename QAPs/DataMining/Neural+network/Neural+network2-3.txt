★What is the best neural network library for Python?I am currently testing Neurolab http://code.google.com/p/neurolab/ and I am pretty happy about that. However, I would like to know if there exist other libraries and your opinion about that. It would also be great to know machine learning libraries with other classification algorithms, such as decision trees, k-means, nn, etc.
There are just a few which have ample number of features. PyBrain - http://pybrain.org is one which is natively python. Also, http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/ (FANN) has python bindings.    Embed Quote
