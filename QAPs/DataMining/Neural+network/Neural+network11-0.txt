★How do convolutional neural networks work?Especially, what kind of benefits does convolution give you?
Convolutional neural networks work like learnable local filters. The best example is probably their application to computer vision. The first step in image analysis is often to perform some local filtering of the image, for example, to enhance edges in the image. You do this by taking the neighborhood of each pixel and convolve it with a certain mask (set of weights). Basically you compute a linear combination of those pixels. For example, if you have a positive weight on the center pixel and negative weights on the surrounding pixels you compute the difference between the center pixel and the surrounding, giving you a crude kind of edge detector. Now you can either put that filter in there by hand or learn the right filter through a convolutional neural network. If we consider the simplest case, you have an input layer representing all pixels in your image while the output layer representing the filter responses. Each node in the output layer is connected to a pixel and its neighborhood in the input layer. So far, so good. What makes convolutional neural networks special is that the weights are shared, that is, they are the same for different pixels in the image (but different with respect to the position relative to the center pixel). That way you effectively learn a filter, which also turns out to be suited to the problem you are trying to learn.    Embed Quote
