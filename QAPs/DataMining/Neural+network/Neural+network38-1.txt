★What are some advantages of using neural networks over decision trees?references to benchmarks on specific datasets would be very helpful
Neural network is proficient to give the better classification by sing non linear boundaries. In addition it is even easy to overcome overfitting by some regularizer settings. In addition, there are lots of things ML stuffs that NN might be a solution. Feature selection Density estimation Classification Anomaly detection Reinforcement learning Self learner NN with recurrent NN Time series based learning (like stock price prediction) It comes with some disadvantages like parameter settings (learning rate, regularizer coefficient, # of hidden layers, # of units, Selection of activation functions). takes long time to be trained well relative to other methods like Decision Tree. In addition decision tree is not good for online learning (your data is coming continuously and you need to update your model) since any data includes some exceptional situation will force your tree to be fall apart and need to be constructed again. On the other side, NN is capable of reflecting the information of new instance on a model very efficiently by just changing the weight values.    Embed Quote
