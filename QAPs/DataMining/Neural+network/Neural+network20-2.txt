★What are the toughest neural networks and deep learning interview questions?
Both neural networks and deep learning topics are based out of grounding philosophies from mathematics and cognitive processes; Essentially, they are philosophically "deep" (no pun intended). So, the toughest question, in my opinion would be to explain why and how deep architectures are conceptualized and designed  the way they are.. For example, it has been shown that the visual cortex is well-studied and shows a sequence of areas each of which contains a representation of the input, and signals flow from one to the next (there are also skip connections and at some level parallel paths, so the picture is more complex). Each level of this feature hierarchy represents the input at a different level of abstraction, with more abstract features further up in the hierarchy, defined in terms of the lower-level ones.   Now thats essentially, a deep architecture with hues of neural network philosophies. Can you mathematically frame this?    Embed Quote
