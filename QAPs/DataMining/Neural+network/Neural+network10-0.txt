★Are neural networks still popular in modeling?Neural networks can model almost any system given the right parameters (no, of layers, no. of nodes, etc). But, determining them is a very hard problem. So are they still popular in modeling? What problems are basically modeled using a neural network? I know that they are used to model the neurons and problems in pattern recognition and machine learning but, are they used to model anything else?
Neural networks are enjoying what Juergen Schmidhuber calls a 'second renaissance' [1].  Model interpretability is still an issue which is why many people stray away from using it, but you can't argue with the classification performance they've been giving for the past couple years.  The popular networks these days are Deep Belief Networks, Autoencoders, Convolution Networks and their recurrent counterparts. One aspect they share in common is that they contain several layers.  It's been proposed that deeper networks have more representational power than single layer networks and can therefore solve more difficult tasks.  The large breakthrough was the fact that many of these networks are now trainable.  Things like layer wise pre-training and improved second order descent methods have partially resolved vanishing gradient issues with backpropagation.
