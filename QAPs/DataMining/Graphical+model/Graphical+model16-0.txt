★What textbooks are you using to teach probabilistic graphical models?I know about Korb, Koller and Pearls's books, for example, but some of them are better for self-learning than for teaching.
I have been following Koller's book. You are right, it is better for self teaching. But if you want to have some book to assist yourself while teaching, I would suggest to use the book structure in Koller's book first (pg. 10). Depending on the subjects you want to emphasize on, the materials should vary. But the video materials in Coursera are extremely good even if you are going to teach (I am presenting the whole subject before my prof, so it is kind of semi-teaching).    Embed Quote
