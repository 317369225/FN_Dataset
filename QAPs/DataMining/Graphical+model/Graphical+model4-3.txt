★What are some interesting use cases of graphical models?
Graphical Models as David said above is a general framework more than a specific algorithm. That said, there are some application it was used as is. One cool example is that of Microsoft Office's Answer wizard. Some of the variations were independently invented/discovered in some application areas. For example, HMMs for speech, MRF for low level vision problems, Kalman Filtering for tracking etc. One figure that helped me to understand the connections is due to Sam Roweis and Zoubin Ghahramani, found in Kevin Murphy's tutorial.    Embed Quote
