★What programming language should I use to implement complicated NLP model (Probabilistic Graphic Model)?Specifically, I was implementing an extended Conditional Random Field model which is able to extract more features, and inference with constraints. Currently, I'm using Python for the implementation, but the training process is really slow. Too slow to be used practically. Has anyone had similar experience with implementing complicated NLP models and share some of your stories.
Python should do the job well. Maybe you can further optimise your code an model to have practical performance. If still in problem, go for C/C++.    Embed Quote
