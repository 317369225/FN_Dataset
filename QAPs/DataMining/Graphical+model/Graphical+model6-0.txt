★What are some popular software packages for graphical models?Follow-up on Software Packages for Graphical Models by Kevin Murphy.
BUGS: Accepts DAG networks and uses Gibbs sampling for doing inference. There are two versions of this that one can use. The first one is WinBUGS which as the name suggests works only in Windows. And then, there is an open source version of this package called OpenBUGS. For a non-trivial example of using BUGS, you can go through one of the lingpipe article [1] where he uses BUGS for a Bayesian estimation. JAGS: Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) is similar to OpenBUGS (open source alternative to BUGS) but the primary difference is that it is written in Java. Infer.NET: Infer.NET is a software developed by Microsoft Research Cambridge. The tutorials and examples are pretty well written. For example, here is the LDA implementation [2]. I haven't used this much, but it is supposed to be very flexible and be able to support many different kinds of models. It is also supposed to scale very easily. Stan: Stan is another package which is very similar to BUGS. However, it differs in its inference mechanism which uses what is called as a No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) [3]. This is a library primarily written in C++. Factorie: Factorie is another package. However, as the name might indicate, it supports parameter estimation and inferencing only over Factor graph models. This package has been applied to many different problems in NLP.
