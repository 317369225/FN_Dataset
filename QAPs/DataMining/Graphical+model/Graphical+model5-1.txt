★Have quantitative funds discovered the use of graphical models yet?This is a follow-up question to Are "quantitative" funds actually still using linear factor models with fixed weighting?.
Of course they have discovered it. They are quite relevant to finance as a generic way of modeling structured domains. in quant trading the structure is in both the  cross-sectional dimension (i.e. dependence between different stocks, etc.) and the time dimension (hmm style regime models, etc.) the thing is, most statistical models are probabilistic in nature and have a graphical model interpretation, so even your vanilla linear factor model practitioners are in fact using graphical models (possibly without thinking too deeply about it.) For example, look at the people who built renaissance -- all speech recognition researchers who basically specialized in graphical models. graphical models are no magic bullet and one can be similarly successful with more ad-hoc approaches that exploit similar properties of the data.  they tend to be used (when appropriate) in places where the researchers have deep background in statistics.    Embed Quote
