â˜…Are there any tools that will take a graphical model specified in the BUGS language and output a visualization of that graphical model?
In the paper "Visualizing Graphical Probabilistic Models" [1], the following tools are examined: Bayes Net Toolbox Hugin Expert BayesBuilder WinMine BayesianLab Netica MSBNx Analytica GeNIe/SMILE In the paper "Visualizing and Understanding Large-Scale Bayesian Networks" [2], the NetEx tool (built as an extension to Cytoscape) is described. Unfortunately, none seem to take BUGS specifications as input. [1] http://www.cs.uml.edu/~cchiang/P... [2] http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.ph...
