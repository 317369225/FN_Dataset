★Is stanford probabilistic graphical model class too detailed for someone whose everyday job is not core machine learning?
I am a Stanford graduate student applying the contents of both courses in my research, and I have done well in both. Although both courses contain a number of easy topics amongst the harder ones, I feel strongly that the PGM  (Koller) course requires much more mathematical maturity from the student, than the ML (Ng) course. I suspect that it will simply be more economical on your mental energy to master the ML course before spending too much more time with the PGM course.  A number of more subtle ideas in the PGM course may require solid foundations, not covered by the lectures, to recognize and benefit from.    Embed Quote
