★Which is better for Computer Vision research direction, Neural Networks or Probabilistic Graphical Models?
I am answering this from the point of view of a computer vision person. The main reason, I think, why graphical models seem to abound in the vision literature while neural networks do not to that extent is because a graphical model is a nice framework for encoding domain knowledge. To take an example, the world consists of a small number of objects, and these when viewed from a camera, in the presence of light, give you an image. A probabilistic graphical model is a convenient way of formalizing such an intuition: just have nodes representing objects, nodes representing light sources, nodes representing pixels, and voila! On the other hand neural networks are more like a general purpose algorithm that you can just apply to a computer vision task. They don't really provide much opportunity for encoding intuitions and prior knowledge; indeed their strength is supposed to be the fact that they don't need any prior knowledge. If and when neural networks do become this sort of black box that can just solve any computer vision task, I assume everyone will just shift to neural networks. Till then, many computer vision researchers would like to code in the intuitions that they have, and some fraction of them will do so using graphical models. That said, there isn't really a dichotomy between graphical models and neural networks; one merges smoothly into the other. Plus, from a computer vision perspective, both are useful tools and worth knowing about. So if I had to give advice I'd probably say, know about both and then choose whatever you like for the problem at hand? This is a science after all, how approach X works for task Y is always going to be an important question, for all X in the race and all Y worth knowing about.    Embed Quote
