★How are probabilistic graphical models used in image understanding?In Daphne Koller's course she mentions this several times but I'm having a hard time understanding how that might work. If possible please provide links to introductory papers.
Thanks for the A2A. Graphical models are extensively used for image and language understanding. Hopefully with you understanding the basics here is an interesting set of slides from MPI https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/filea... Here is another tutorial (i have not read it fully) but is something which could help you http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian...    Embed Quote
