★What resources on graphical models are recommended for machine learning students wanting to enter the field?I am a second year phd students and I really want to learn graphic model, at the same time, I have some graduate students who also wanting to learn this. Could anyone kind enough to recommend some good resources?
Update:  I recently got a chance to see the  video lectures by Sam Roweis on Graphical models   and then the ones by Zoubin Ghahramani ,they are  very good.  I would say that one should start with the videos and then refer the books for the meaty mathematics of it all .  That should give you a great headstart. If it helps ,  http://videolectures.net/mlss06t... Alongwith the answers, the way i learned a little about Graphical Models is by seeing Course pages at CMU,Berkeley and Princeton( the best one is at Princeton by David Blei. ) The scribes at Princeton are good and serve as a nice starting point. Also, Daphne's book is a little on the theoretical side and also really big.  Its a comprehensive coverage .   According to me, the book by David Barber( Bayesian reasoning and Machine Learning) , available for free at his website( he teaches at UCL) is the best bet. He has explained a lot of ML concepts keeping Graphical models as the base and its pretty intuitive, and serves the purpose too( and has good exercise problems, although no solution :( )    Embed Quote
