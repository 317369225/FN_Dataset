★Which is better for Computer Vision research direction, Neural Networks or Probabilistic Graphical Models?
What others have forgotten to mention is that right now there are a lot of good research labs (e.g. Google, Baidu) working on deep learning. That definitely says something about how promising deep learning field is. Furthermore, these labs have money, exceptional software engineers and great computing facilities, making them capable of doing learning in large scale and fast. Hence, it would be relatively hard to publish papers and compete with them in application domains in which they are doing research.    Embed Quote
