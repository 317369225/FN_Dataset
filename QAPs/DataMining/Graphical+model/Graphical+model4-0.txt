★What are some interesting use cases of graphical models?
Graphical models are not a machine learning method in themselves as much as a formalism for describing and extending machine learning methods, so asking for a use case of "graphical models" is a bit like asking for a use case of machine learning. You can, for example, describe the familiar hidden Markov model as a directed graphical model, just as you can describe factorial HMMs, products of HMMs, or HMMs with more fine-grained structure such as profile HMMs. The same goes for mixture models, linear dynamical systems, naive Bayes classifiers... If you have your problem described as a graphical model, there are efficient message-passing algorithms for doing inference that can be applied in a "black box" fashion in many cases. This allows you to take textbook methods and add/subtract variables and arcs to suit your problem and easily derive the necessary rules for inference and/or learning, or even apply generic code to completely new models and problems.    Embed Quote
