★What is the best toolbox/module to learn probabilistic programming? I would like to be capable of designing my own graphical models. And see quickly the effect of changes.Infer.net seems promising but I would also like to know about other options like BUGS etc. Pro and Cons of using them. and also with a perspective of being usable for building applications. BTW infer.net is not free for commercial applications.
The site Probabilistic Programming shows a list of language extensions that might be more supportive in writing PGMs. There is a large variety of languages discussed there (Scala, Python, Scheme/Church, C++...). Not sure which one of them is free for commercial use, though. It is an increasing interest towards this domain, most likely as a response to Probabilistic Programming for Advanced Machine Learning (PPAML) program started by DARPA, so you should keep an eye on its progress.    Embed Quote
