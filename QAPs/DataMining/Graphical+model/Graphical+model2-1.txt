★Is the brain a graphical model?Hinton, for example, suggests it is in his paper, "What kind of a graphical model is the brain?" http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinto... This is a follow-up question to How does the brain search memory?.
I found this interesting paper which applies mathematical models to the Brain. http://portal.acm.org/citation.c...     Also, when you read the book by Jeff Hawkins " On Intelligence ", it is interesting to see how Jeff creates a hierarchical model of the neo cortex. There is also an online forum for this book with interesting discussions. Check It out. Though I am not from a neuroscience background, I was able to understand the model that Jeff explains in this book because of the simple cogent explanation.     In short, I don't feel there is a deterministic answer to your question because from what I have read and understood, this field of understanding how the brain works is still in the nascent stage. I would be interesting to see what others think about this.    Embed Quote
