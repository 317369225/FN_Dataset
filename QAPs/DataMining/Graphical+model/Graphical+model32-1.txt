★What is good way to understand the two formulas regarding this given probability graphical model?
Formula (5) appears to be simply the property of marginal probabilities plus some of the model structure. I think conditioning on allows you to use some conditional independence present in the model between and .  I am not sure of the conventions in their graphical model representation but it should be something like that. Can you maybe clarify what you are confused about in the other part? Graphical models can be very terse and hard to read especially if you have not already been working with similar problem structures. It might help to write out the (quite verbose) likelihood by hand just to kind of get a feel for the structure of this model.    Embed Quote
