★Which is better for Computer Vision research direction, Neural Networks or Probabilistic Graphical Models?
PGM combines both graph theory and probability theory and do work better with limited data and even under missing data (at random). PGM also need descritization of continuous data prior learning of networks and later inferring from these learned networks. WIth PGM one will be able to understand how the underlying variables interact each other in producing the results Neural networks on the other hand (with my limited knowledge) , i believe till now is not able to provide/visualize the way in which the variables under study are interacting as by PGM. Please do correct me if i am wrong by saying the above. Saying so, it doesn't mean ANN are not powerful. Both PGM and ANN does model the conditions good and as brilliantly told by Bharath, it depends upon the problem and the user to see which to use    Embed Quote
