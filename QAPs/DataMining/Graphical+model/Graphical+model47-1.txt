★What are some research groups studying representation learning methods for NLP, including deep learning, spectral learning or graphical models?I am looking for some visiting opportunities, and my research currently explores representation learning methods for NLP tasks, i.e. parsing. I wonder which research groups are accepting visiting students, and also match my research field. Any suggestions shall be highly appreciated!
