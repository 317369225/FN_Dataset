★What are probabilistic graphical models?
Probabilistic graphical models (PGM) provide a declarative representation for modeling probabilistic systems. A PGM encodes the dependencies between random variables used to model a probabilistic system. It tries to model the joint distribution of the random variables representing a probabilistic system and the graph structure naturally lends itself to formulating the joint distribution of the random variables used to model a probabilistic system. Below is a simple example of a probabilistic system containing five random variables. Every node denotes a random variable: Difficulty (D), Intelligence (I), Grade (G), SAT (S), Letter (L). We use the PGM to model the joint distribution . First, using the chain rule of probability, we get * * * * Now, using the PGM, we note the following: 1. Intelligence (I) is independent of Difficulty (D). 2. Given Intelligence (I), SAT (S) is independent of everything else. 3. Given Grade (G), Letter (L) is independent of everything else. Hence, the above observations inferred from the structure of the PGM let us model the joint distribution as below: * * * * If the idea seems simple, don't worry, because the idea is simple; the difficulty lies in computing the joint distribution formulated above. I won't delve into the computational aspects of PGMs as the topic is quite elaborate. You could refer Daphne Koller's course on PGMs at Coursera to get a deeper understanding of PGMs. [Image courtesy]: Example 5: Bayesian Network 'Student Model'    Embed Quote
