★What is the best toolbox/module to learn probabilistic programming? I would like to be capable of designing my own graphical models. And see quickly the effect of changes.Infer.net seems promising but I would also like to know about other options like BUGS etc. Pro and Cons of using them. and also with a perspective of being usable for building applications. BTW infer.net is not free for commercial applications.
We used SAMIAM (Sensitivity Analysis, Modeling, Inference and More) in Daphne Koller's class on Probabilistic Graphical Models (Coursera). It has a nice GUI as well as programming facility. You can create your own graphical model, change the probabilities of events and watch how it affects the probabilities of other events instantaneously, its fun. But that's a very basic feature, I'm sure it has advanced features, just that we didn't need them for the class.    Embed Quote
