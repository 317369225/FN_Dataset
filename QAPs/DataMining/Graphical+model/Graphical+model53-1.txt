★In a directed graphical model, learning is easy but inference is hard. Is this true?
Maybe.  With inference you sometimes have to 'undo' things and 'go back' in order to reach synthesis. With a directed model this is harder, though may be possible with enough steps. Maybe there needs to be something like a hopfield network or recurrent network where we can feed data back into previous inputs.    Embed Quote
