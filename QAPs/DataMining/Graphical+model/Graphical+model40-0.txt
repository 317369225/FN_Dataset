★What is an intuitive explanation of the "explaining-away" problem in directed graphical models?
Explaining-Away is basically a pattern of reasoning where one cause of an effect explains that effect entirely thereby reducing (need not eliminate) the need to verify other alternative causes. Imagine an 'observation' 'Ob', say "you scored 100/100 in Math". It could have had two (for the sake of simplicity) causes, viz 'C1' - 'the question-paper was too easy' and 'C2' - 'you are too smart'. Now, 'Ob' could be because of either of those two causes (or both) i.e. you scored 100/100 because either the question-paper was way too easy or you're just too smart or both. Confirmation of one cause, say 'C1' i.e. 'paper was too easy' doesn't provide any evidence for the other alternate cause 'C2' ('you are too smart'). But, in a probabilistic scheme of reasoning, confirmation of the first reasoning 'C1' ('paper was easy') SHOULD REDUCE the probability of the other cause ('you are smart') even though both can be true simultaneously. This is called "Explaining Away". I mean to say if I know that you scored 100/100 and also know that the paper was way too easy, I tend to assume you're not very very smart even if you actually are.    Embed Quote
