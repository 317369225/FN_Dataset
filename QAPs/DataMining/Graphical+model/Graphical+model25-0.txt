★What is coupling in graphical models, and why can it make inference intractable?By coupling, I mean the coupling of (at least) two random variables, i.e., nodes in the graph.
Let us consider an undirected graphical model (Markov Network). This consists of a graph structure - with nodes corresponding to variables and edges corresponding to dependencies between variables, and a probability distribution over the set of variables. One inference task (called marginal inference) requires computing the probability distribution of one of the variables, by summing-out all the other variables from the joint distribution. Now. intuitively if the graph has a single connected component, then to find out the distribution of one variable will amount to looking at all the other variables. Whereas, if the graph contained several connected components, then the nodes which are in a different connected component than the given node do not influence this node, and so the inference is faster. So fewer the number of edges, more the number of connected components on the average, and smaller the inference cost. In general, it can be shown that the inference cost is exponential in tree-width, that is a linear function of the size of the largest clique in the graph structure.    Embed Quote
