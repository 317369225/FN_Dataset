â˜…Have quantitative funds discovered the use of graphical models yet?This is a follow-up question to Are "quantitative" funds actually still using linear factor models with fixed weighting?.
As Brandon points out in the comments, financial services firms are quite comfortable with massive Monte Carlo simulations, so the computational costs of graphical models is not a deterrent. I was exploring the use of graphical models in the fixed income analytics group at Bear Stearns in 2005. The particular application was co-evolving the term structure model with an inflation curve, and the model was a Markov Random Field. To be honest, the literature was really confusing back then, and I never got anything implemented. The company Gene Network Sciences (now the GNS Healthcare division of Via Science) developed a scalable Bayesian inference engine called REFS and spun out a hedge fund called Fina Technologies [7]. A quick search seems to indicate only a small amount of penetration of Bayesian methods into the quantitative finance realm; where there is coverage, it seems to be in risk modeling. For example, on the popular quant discussion board Nuclear Phynance, I could only find one thread on graphical models [1]. There is more discussion on Bayesian methods generally [2]. In both cases, general skepticism is presented. There's also a lukewarm reception on the Quantitative Finance Stack Exchange [3]. There seem to be a few books on the topic: [4], [5], [6]. My experience with the literature of quantitative finance is that it can be segmented into two distinct groups: papers by physicists and papers by economists. The former brought in techniques from partial and stochastic differential equations, while the latter brought in techniques from statistics and time series analysis. Because Bayesian techniques are more prevalent in the social sciences than in the hard sciences, I suspect they are creeping into the literature from the economist side of the world.
