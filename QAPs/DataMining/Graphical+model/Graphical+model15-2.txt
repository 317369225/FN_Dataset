★What are the best tutorials, videos and slides for probabilistic graphical models?
I would recommend Eric Xing's yearly PGM class. 10708 Probabilistic Graphical Models not because I am a TA of this course :). This course covers not only the basics of PGM such as Bayesian net, MRF, EM, variational inference, but also advanced topics like Bayesian nonparametrics and spectral methods. The organization of the lectures are very easy to follow, from modeling to inference and learning, then to advanced topics. It is a very good source to seek comprehensive understanding of this field.    Embed Quote
