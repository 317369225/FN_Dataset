★What resources on graphical models are recommended for machine learning students wanting to enter the field?I am a second year phd students and I really want to learn graphic model, at the same time, I have some graduate students who also wanting to learn this. Could anyone kind enough to recommend some good resources?
The Daphne Koller book is the newest most comprehensive thing available: http://www.amazon.com/Probabilis... I really like the book "Graphical Models in Applied Multivariate Statistics" by Joe Whittaker. This book is older (1990s) and less comprehensive and has a statistical rather than machine learning perspective. However, it is much more readable and intuitive for lowly computer programmers such as myself (the Koller book is an immense beast of a reference book). In the past I never recommended this book because it cost $300 (I read it when I was a student with access to a university library). However it is now apparently available as a paperback for only (!) $70: http://www.amazon.com/Graphical-... Michael I. Jordan was supposed to publish a graphical models book, and I have a draft from some years ago that was pretty complete and quite good, which he distributed for classes. He never seems to have finished it, which is too bad because we could have had a nice Berkeley/Stanford rivalry going in graphical models text book industry (in addition to basketball or football or whatever it is they currently rival each other at).    Embed Quote
