★How does structural equation modeling relate to graphical models?
They represent slightly different things, with some overlap. Structural equation models are similar to directed graphical models, but they are generally only linear-Gaussian, while directed graphical models can have any exponential family conditional distribution. Structured equation models are also more directly related to causality, while directed graphical models concern themselves with conditional distributions. Due to some technicalities, structural equation models can have cycles, unlike directed graphical models. Also, structural equation models tend to be less Bayesian.    Embed Quote
