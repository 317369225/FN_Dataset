★What is the best toolbox/module to learn probabilistic programming? I would like to be capable of designing my own graphical models. And see quickly the effect of changes.Infer.net seems promising but I would also like to know about other options like BUGS etc. Pro and Cons of using them. and also with a perspective of being usable for building applications. BTW infer.net is not free for commercial applications.
Hi, I currently work on Figaro (p2t2/figaro), a probabilistic programming language embedded in Scala. Avi Pfeffer, the creator of Figaro, is also writing an excellent book on practical probabilistic programming that is geared towards the beginner who wants to learn this new field (Practical Probabilistic Programming)    Embed Quote
