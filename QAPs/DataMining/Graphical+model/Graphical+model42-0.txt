★Graphical Models: What is the relationship  between belief propagation and junction tree?what is the relationship  between belief propagation and junction tree ?
Belief Propagation is an algorithm for inference in Graphical Models, whereas Junction Tree is a representation of a graphical model. You probably meant the Junction Tree Algorithm Belief propagation is a method for propagating "beliefs" about the marginal distributions of nodes and edges across a graphical model until the beliefs converge. For trees, beliefs can be propagated along the edges of the graph, and the obtained solution will be exact. In practice, this is also done when the graph  has cycles, it can be shown that the solution obtained may be wrong, and that this algorithm may sometimes not converge (several modifications exist to handle such cases) A Junction Tree(see Tree decomposition) is a special clique tree representation of a graph which satisfies the Running Intersection Property. The Junction Tree Algorithm involves performing belief propagation on this Junction Tree instead of on the original graph. The junction tree algorithm is an exact inference algorithm for any graph, but the complexity of this algorithm is exponential in the "tree-width" of the graph (the size of the largest clique when the given graph is triangulated)    Embed Quote
