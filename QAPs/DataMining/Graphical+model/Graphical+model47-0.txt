★What are some research groups studying representation learning methods for NLP, including deep learning, spectral learning or graphical models?I am looking for some visiting opportunities, and my research currently explores representation learning methods for NLP tasks, i.e. parsing. I wonder which research groups are accepting visiting students, and also match my research field. Any suggestions shall be highly appreciated!
From deep learning perspective: IDIAP Research Institute Ronan Collobert et al You should try their SENNA system, a state-of-the-art multi task NLP tagger using deep learning techniques. They have also made their  word embeddings public, along with senna. Also a supporting paper: R. Collobert, J. Weston, L. Bottou, M. Karlen, K. Kavukcuoglu and P. Kuksa. Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12:2493-2537, 2011.    Université de Montréal, Informatique et recherche opérationnelle (Lisa lab) Yoshua Bengio et al A solid review paper from the bengio et al. May not directly talk about NLP, but most of the concepts still apply.  Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Pascal Vincent, Arxiv, 2012. Another interesting paper which talks about representation learning for language modelling: Yoshua Bengio, Réjean Ducharme, Pascal Vincent and Christian Jauvin, A Neural Probabilistic Language Model. JMLR 2003. They have also released their Word representations for NLP Univeristy of Toronto: Machine Learning Group Geoffrey Hinton et al Even though their primary focus is not NLP, one can still find interesitng applications of deep learning for NLP Interesting Paper on semantic indexing of text articles: Semantic Hashing: Ruslan Salakhutdinov and Geoffrey Hinton International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 2009 The Stanford group: Andrew Ng, et al Main Page - Ufldl Suggested paper from the group: Richard Socher, Jeffrey Pennington, Eric Huang, Andrew Y.
