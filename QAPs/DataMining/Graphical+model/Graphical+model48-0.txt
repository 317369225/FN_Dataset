★How can you characterize a geometric random variable using graphical models?
I don't think there exists a Bayesian Network to represent exactly this set of conditional independence relations. My reasoning, 1. For X2 dependent on T, we need a path (not containing a V-node) between X2 and T. 2. For X2 to be independent of X1 both conditioned on T and unconditionally, there should not exist any path between X2 and X1. 3. Therefore, to satisfy 1, we need that X2 be directly connected to T and X1 be disconnected from both X2 and T 4. This violates the requirement that X1 not be independent of T.
