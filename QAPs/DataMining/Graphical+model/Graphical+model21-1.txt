★What programming language should I use to implement complicated NLP model (Probabilistic Graphic Model)?Specifically, I was implementing an extended Conditional Random Field model which is able to extract more features, and inference with constraints. Currently, I'm using Python for the implementation, but the training process is really slow. Too slow to be used practically. Has anyone had similar experience with implementing complicated NLP models and share some of your stories.
If speed is the sole problem, remain with Python and implement the algorithms in C (or C++ without too many objects). I have experience with NLP but never hit a performance bottleneck, and with image processing in Python, there I need to run all the "low level analysis" in C.    Embed Quote
