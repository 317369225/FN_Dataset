★Are probabilistic graphical models commonly seen/heavily used in practical/everyday data mining?
Assuming you mean probabilistic graphical models, the answer varies significantly depending on the application. For text analytics, for example, they are actually very common (see, e.g., Conditional random field). In other fields they might not be pervasive, but they are still a great paradigm to know in order to have a very good starting point on how to perform inference on a model, where the complexities may lie, what approximations you might perform (if needed) and where those will fail.    Embed Quote
