★How can graphical models be applied to distributed reasoning in multi-agent systems?Bayesian Networks + Multiagent systems
There is a lot of literature on Petri nets as used in the analysis of multi-agent systems. see for instance [1,2]. Add in distributed reasoning explicitly and there are more papers on this than one can hope to read [3]. To narrow the topic a bit, it can be helpful if you define what it is about distributed reasoning in multi-agent systems that you wish to address. Distributed graphical models are covered in [4,5] and if you want to focus on say, the problem of information fusion, the paper A multi-agent systems approach to distributed bayesian information fusion ought to be right down your alley.   [1] Page on mecs-press.org [2] Nested Petri Nets - a Formalism for Specification and Verification of Multi-Agent Distributed Systems [3] Page on scholar.google.no [4] Y.
