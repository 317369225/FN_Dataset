★Is stanford probabilistic graphical model class too detailed for someone whose everyday job is not core machine learning?
The probabilistic graphical models course (https://www.coursera.org/pgm/aut...) offers a different perspective on machine learning. Its focus is more on the models, e.g.:  How do you represent a real-world problem using a probabilistic model? How do you combine evidence to get an estimate of the probability of some event? How do you learn a graphical model? How do you decide under uncertainty?This is a somewhat broader context, with less focus on learning and more focus on modeling and real-world uses. If you already took the other course, I suggest you try this one. I believe it will require time, effort and math, but they will have been well spent.    Embed Quote
