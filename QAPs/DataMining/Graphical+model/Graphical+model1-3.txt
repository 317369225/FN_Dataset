★What are some applications of Probabilistic Graphical Models?
Some examples from Daphne Koller's course on Coursera: -object detection in a picture (this pixel is part of a cow, this is grass, etc) -medical diagnostics (given the symptoms and tests so far, here are the likely diseases) -modeling risk for insurance (given what I know about you, what is my confidence that you are a safe driver) -robot inferring it's location on a map from unreliable sensor and previous belief of location -message encoding and decoding after transmission over noisy channel -recommendations (what movie do I think you'll like given the movie ratings you and other people have provided)    Embed Quote
