★Why does moralization in a directed graphical model preserve conditional dependencies between parents in the undirected graph?
After moralization, the resulting undirected graph structure often denotes fewer independencies than the original directed graph.  However, if you use the original conditional probability distributions as the factors in the new undirected model, then the probability distribution is the same and therefore still satisfies the conditional independencies of the original graph. For example, suppose you have the following Bayesian network:   A --> B <-- C This graph structure corresponds to the following factorization of the probability distribution:   And implies the following  independence statement: Let's convert this into an undirected model by defining , , , and .  By basic substitution, we can rewrite the factorization as follows: You could also simplify this model by folding the unary factors into the three-way factor: ; thus,  . This new factorized representation corresponds to an undirected graph with a single clique over A, B, and C.  The new factorization and graph do not imply any conditional independencies.  However, when the model is the result of converting from a Bayesian network, as we have done here, then the probability distribution itself still satisfies the same conditional independencies as before. In general, the probability distribution represented by a graphical model may satisfy additional independencies not implied by the graph structure.  If you really want a solid understanding of this, then I highly recommend the 2009 textbook by Koller and Friedman.    Embed Quote
