★What are some good implementations for probabilistic graphical models?In particular, I want to be able to create and visualize belief networks, and apply various algorithms like variable elimination, belief propagation, junction tree, loopy belief propagation and other approximation algorithms. (any language, but active support is a plus)
I found a set of functions under the name UGM (Undirected graphical models) implemented by Mark Schmidt quite useful. You can find a variety of decoding, inference and parameter estimation method here. http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/S...  Kevin Murphy, his adviser has a collection of codes which has CRF, HMM etc. http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/So... Hidden Markov models: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/So... Bayes net: https://code.google.com/p/bnt/ 2D CRF (for images , similar to discriminative random fields(DRFs)) can be adapted from: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/So... Fully-connected CRFs with code: (NIPS 2011 paper) Efficient Inference in Fully Connected CRFs with Gaussian Edge Potentials Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian inference in graphical models http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/ R has kalman filters/discrete HMMs etc http://cran.r-project.org/ Yair Weiss has published a lot of work in graphical models and made available most of the implementation: http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/    Embed Quote
