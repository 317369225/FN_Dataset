★What is it like to take CS 228: Probabilistic Graphical Model at Stanford?How time consuming it is? And how rewarding is the class? Also, with Daphne Koller not teaching it, is it worth taking it?
I would recommend taking it! I took it with prof. Koller, but the new professor seems like very interesting as well. At least for this coming quarter, I know one of the TAs and he will do a great job! The class was quite time consuming for me, and I think for most other students as well. In the past, the class was a somewhat relentless combination of weekly quizzes and programming assignments, along with biweekly theory psets and a final. This was combined with the fact that the material could be quite dense and conceptually difficult. It was probably the most difficult CS course I have taken at Stanford. All that said, I also think the class is pretty rewarding. Probabilistic graphical models are a cool way of thinking about the world and conditional independence. The course helps stretch and strengthen your intuition about probability and helps expose you to several other useful topics, like markov chains, and some sampling techniques. Ultimately, the class made me more confident and comfortable thinking about a wide range of ML problems, so I am glad I took it. Hope that helps!    Embed Quote
