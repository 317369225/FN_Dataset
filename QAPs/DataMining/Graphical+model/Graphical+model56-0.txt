★Can a 3D graphics model of a monument be freely used in artwork?Say, for instance I create a Leaning Tower of Pisa in Maya or Blender, by referring to photos. Are there any legal/copyright-related implications of using this model in my CG art? Also, are there any cultural expectations or standards regards to the level of accuracy? (For my purpose, it's enough to get just the approximate shape right)
If you create just models , and doesn't give any textures that are copyrighted then its fine , unless you are not recreating some copy-righted characters.    Embed Quote
