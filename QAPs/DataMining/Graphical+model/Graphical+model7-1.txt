★How are probabilistic graphical models used in image understanding?In Daphne Koller's course she mentions this several times but I'm having a hard time understanding how that might work. If possible please provide links to introductory papers.
Towards Total Scene Understanding: Classification, Annotation and Segmentation in an Automatic Framework Page on stanford.edu This paper was one of the best and extreme uses of graphical model in a single framework which I have read. In my limited reading I found this papr illuminating. My advice for reading any graphical models paper would be detaching inference/learning and modelling.    Embed Quote
