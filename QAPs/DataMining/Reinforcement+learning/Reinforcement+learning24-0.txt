★Who are the most prominent researchers in reinforcement learning?The kings of deep learning are easily identifiable (Andrew Ng, Yann Lecun, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio). It seems like only a small amount of their research relates to reinforcement learning (as opposed to more traditional domains like classification). Where is the most promising reinforcement learning research being done?
Professor Michael Littman at Brown University (previously at Rutgers University) does some great RL work!    Embed Quote
