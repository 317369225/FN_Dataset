★Machine Learning: What will be the coolest areas to apply deep learning and reinforcement learning in the next 5-10 years?
Ofcourse Robotics! By the expected advances in the hardware side: -GPUs, Multi-core CPUs-, deep learning will soon become scalable and applicable to real life scenarios that require real time processing.  We will see robots (really): understanding human speech, Scaling up end-to-end speech recognition responding to its environment in natural language Rapid Progress in Automatic Image Captioning recognizes each and every object appear in the scene [1409.4842] Going Deeper with Convolutions See this work, for a slight and innocent preview, where a computer learns to play Atari (using reinforcement learning): http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih...    Embed Quote
