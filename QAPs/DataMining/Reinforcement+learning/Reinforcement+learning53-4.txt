★Robotics: Why Traditional way of modeling and control are still in use in Robotics, even though we have sophisticated algorithm like Reinforcement learning?Might be modelling the Robot and derive the equation of motion and design the controller looks sexier, but  Reinforcement  learning which make the system to find and learn its own model and make system to control itself is far more better. So why traditional way of modelling and control is still in use?, is it because it looks sexier ?
What you are speaking of falls in the category of adaptive controls. The concern with adaptive has always been possible convergence on unstable, conditionally stable or non-provably stable control laws or non-convergence. Adaptive systems may then require human supervision limiting their value and also lacking tools that enable understanding it in time to intervene if required. So design methods that enable conventional control law design and/or system identification for choosing the gains within a given loop design are favored. Complex multivariable systems may be harder to design for but are even less predictable in an adaptive scheme.    Embed Quote
