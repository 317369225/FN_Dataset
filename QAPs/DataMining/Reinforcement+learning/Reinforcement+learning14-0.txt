★How do you explain Inverse Reinforcement Learning in layman terms?I am trying to explain IRL (Inverse Reinforcement Learning) to people with not much ML or CS background and finding it difficult not to introduce deep ML concepts. How do you do it?
Reinforcement learning is the method of finding an optimal action policy for a known reward function. However, for most real world application, the reward function itself is not clear. The inverse RL  is to deal with this situation. For the IRL now you have an "optimal action policy" i.e. the expert demonstration which is easier to obtain. The goal of IRL is to find the reward function.    Embed Quote
