★What are the disadvantages of reinforcement learning? And what would be a good alternative to use cases where it's used?
Reinforcement learning is rather a broad area. I like to see RL as the problem in which an agent wants to find the policy that maximizes its reward while behaving in an environment. You can find several specific settings: model-based or model-free, complete or partial information, Markovian or semi-Markovian or adversarial environment assumption, single or multi-agent scenarios, etc. As well as several algorithmic framework, like value function based vs. policy-gradient vs. policy search algorithms, POMDP vs. PSR vs TD-nets, etc. In a more abstract level, there are RL problems that can be formulated as supervised learning, and the other way around. Is this what you mean?    Embed Quote
