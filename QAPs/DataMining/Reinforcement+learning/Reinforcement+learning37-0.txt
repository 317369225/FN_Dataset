★Can reinforcement learning be used to forecast time series?
It's not the ideal approach for pure forecasting. In reinforcement learning, there is an agent acting on the outside world, observing effects and learning to improve its behaviour. In contrast, a time series forecast setting has a passive observer which do not interact with the environment. If you are training your AI on historical data, you can't use reinforcement learning since you can't change the past.   A practical example: If you say, want to trade on the stock market, then both time series forecasting and reinforcement learning may be used to predict a future stock price. But reinforcement learning would have the agent buying and selling stocks and taking into account that those actions influence the future stock price.    Embed Quote
