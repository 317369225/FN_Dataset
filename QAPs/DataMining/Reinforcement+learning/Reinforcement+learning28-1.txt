★What do you think of reinforcement learning? Would it be the next "miracle" like deep learning?
I think reinforcement learning is soon going to feed in on the successes of deep learning. The goal of reinforcement learning is to be able to train a agent to perform optimally in a stochastic dynamic environment- what is the sequence of actions the agent must take in order to maximize the expected cumulative reward. In order to do this, it must estimate the action value function Q(s,a). The action value function of a policy represents the expected reward of the agent if it takes action 'a' in state 's'. The well known Q-learning algorithm does this precisely (6.5 Q-Learning: Off-Policy TD Control) Now the issue is that in most real world problems, the state and action spaces are large and also continuous and it becomes difficult to estimate the Q value for each point in the state space. To deal with this, function approximation techniques are used (8. Generalization and Function Approximation). Earlier only simple linear function approximators had been used, and picking state-action features were hard and hand engineered. But now there is a trend of using neural networks and deep learning to learn the action value functions. There has been work by folks at Google DeepMind in this area. They have trained an agent to play a suite of arcade video games called Atari. The agent directly receives the raw pixel input from the game screen and learns the value function using deep neural network. You can read about it in the paper Page on arxiv.org    Embed Quote
