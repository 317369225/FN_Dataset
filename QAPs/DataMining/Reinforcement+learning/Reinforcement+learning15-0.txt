★Prototypes: What are some good resources to implement reinforcement learning?This is a follow up question to How do I learn machine learning?
Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning is the standard text and is actually quite readable. They cover a range of algorithms, from dynamic programming MDP solvers to Monte Carlo, TD, Q-learning, etc. Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis' Neuro-Dynamic Programming is a bit more dense but generally has more proofs of convergence of the various reinforcement learning algorithms. I notice you asked about implementing, not reading. As far as I know, there isn't really a "just use this and you won't need to know how it works" solution for RL. Picking (or designing) an algorithm and formulation of your problem is the hard part.    Embed Quote
