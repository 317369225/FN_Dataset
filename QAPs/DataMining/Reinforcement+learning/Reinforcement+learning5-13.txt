★Machine Learning: What will be the coolest areas to apply deep learning and reinforcement learning in the next 5-10 years?
One area Machine Learning can flourish if it is done right is in the cloud. Imagine, if you will, a cloud of machine learning algorithms of your choice, that you can throw as much computing power against as you can afford. Anything from robotics to financial analysis to  mechanical design to high energy experiments to molecular dynamics to web analytics... the list is endless. I am putting this idea here to inspire someone to do it before I get around to it. I don't care if someone else implements this and makes millions. The value to the world will be significant. And all I ask is an honorable mention.    Embed Quote
