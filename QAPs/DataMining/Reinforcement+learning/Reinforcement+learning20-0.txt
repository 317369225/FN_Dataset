★What are the most important papers from the last few years in reinforcement learning?
I found very interesting the works on Off-Policy Gradient Temporal Difference, deep-learning + RL, Optimistic Optimization and Predictive State Representation. In particular, I would suggest (in random order): Fast Gradient-Descent Methods for Temporal-Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation.  By R. S. Sutton, H. R. Maei, D. Precup, S. Bhatnagar, D. Silver, C. Szepesvari and E. Wiewiora Closing the Learning-Planning Loop with Predictive State Representations. By Byron Boots and G. J. Gordon Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning. By V. Mnih, K. Kavukcuoglu, D. Silver, A. Graves, I. Antonoglou, D. Wierstra and Martin Riedmiller From Bandits to Monte-Carlo Tree Search: The Optimistic Principle Applied to Optimization and Planning. By R. Munos    Embed Quote
