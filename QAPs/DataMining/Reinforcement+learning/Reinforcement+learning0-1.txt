★What is reinforcement learning?
This is what I have learned from my machine learning course! While teaching an agent to learn something there are three main ways. Supervised Learning : When teaching an agent something you provide him with an answer sheet, where agent can see the answer after it's own calculations. If answer is right it will do the same thing for that particular range of input. Unsupervised Learning : There is no answer sheet and agent is all on his own. It will try to curb itself with the heuristics or measurements it is configured with Reinforcement Learning : Whenever agent provides with right answer, trainer tells him "good agent" and if it provides wrong answer, trainer reprimands hims by saying "bad bad agent". In the end agent tries to earn more rewards.    Embed Quote
