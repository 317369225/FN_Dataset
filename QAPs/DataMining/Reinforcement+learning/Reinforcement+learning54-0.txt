★In the phrase "playing Atari with deep reinforcement learning" what does the deep stand for?I only understand the deep in the context of the depth of neural networks. I am writing a PhD proposal about reinforcement learning and need to be careful about my wording.
Deep stands for Deep Learning. Basically, the  visual features of the Atari games (for a frozen scene (state) of the game) are learnt using Deep Neural networks having convolution layers that are rich feature learning models for images. And it so happens that for Atari games, such a feature construction is somewhat sufficient for summarizing the knowledge for a state representation, in case you are concerned about the Markovness aspects of the state, for applying the Reinforcement Learning Algorithms modeled on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Reinforcement Learning, then, is done, using suitable gradient based methods, on the constructed features for the state space, based on suitable reward functions, states and the MDP dynamics that you define or set out to learn. It might be possible to incorporate gradient based RL methods into the deep network to simultaneously learn to augment the feature models of the states based on their interpretations in the RL context.
