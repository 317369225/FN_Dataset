★Robotics: Why Traditional way of modeling and control are still in use in Robotics, even though we have sophisticated algorithm like Reinforcement learning?Might be modelling the Robot and derive the equation of motion and design the controller looks sexier, but  Reinforcement  learning which make the system to find and learn its own model and make system to control itself is far more better. So why traditional way of modelling and control is still in use?, is it because it looks sexier ?
Because traditional methods still work very well, are well mastered and so easy to use.    Embed Quote
