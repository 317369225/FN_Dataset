★Where can you produce lesions to a brain (or genetic knockouts) in order to prevent reinforcement learning from operant conditioning?is mu-opioid signalling necessary for reinforcement learning? what about the nucleus accumbens? in other words, what are the necessary circuits for operant conditioning?
