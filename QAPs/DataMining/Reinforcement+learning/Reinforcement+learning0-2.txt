★What is reinforcement learning?
Reinforcement learning involves teaching the machine to think for itself by using a system of rewards. Say you have a robot whose movement you intend to control in a predefined path. You want the robot to learn to move along this predefined path without any help from you. So, you define a system of rewards : For every correct step taken by the robot a reward is made and for every incorrect move a reward is taken away. Essentially, you teach the robot to understand that the reward is good for it. The robot eventually learns, reinforced by it's several rewards and it's mistakes the actual path. (You might want to skip to the last 30 seconds to see the robot make it's victory walk. Mostly it just tries to recognise its limbs) For another example, you might want to look at this : P.S. - I haven't ever used ML. I attended some introductory lectures and those are my only credentials. The above is what I have understood as a result of those lectures. I hope the answer is helpful.    Embed Quote
