★Artificial Intelligence: What is "prioritized sweeping in reinforcement learning"?http://www.nature.com/articles/n...
Prioritized Sweeping (PS) is a method for solving Markov Decision Problems. Other methods include Policy Iteration on on the dynamic programming (DP) part of the spectrum, monte carlo (MC) method on the other side of the spectrum and Q learning a variant of TD (Temporal Difference) methods which sit between being full DP and MC. TD methods are generally fast and have real time performance but at the expense of accuracy while DP methods are accurate but slow generally. PS is a way to get the both fast performance and good accuracy. PS does this by using histories to prioritise which DP sweeps to make and also guide exploration. Implementation wise this constitutes using a queue to keep track of states whose backups are of high priority. See the nice paper by Andrew Moore for full details Page on berkeley.edu    Embed Quote
