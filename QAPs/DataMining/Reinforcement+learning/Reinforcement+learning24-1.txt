★Who are the most prominent researchers in reinforcement learning?The kings of deep learning are easily identifiable (Andrew Ng, Yann Lecun, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio). It seems like only a small amount of their research relates to reinforcement learning (as opposed to more traditional domains like classification). Where is the most promising reinforcement learning research being done?
Juergen Schmidhuber is probably one of the giants in the field of deep reinforcement learning. Innovations like LSTM networks came out from his lab. Although it's not reinforcement learning, it's still one of the major milestones in temporal processing. Apart from that, Google DeepMind seems to be doing some awesome work in that area. They recently built a system that learnt to play pong on it's own!    Embed Quote
