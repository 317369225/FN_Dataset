★What do you think of reinforcement learning? Would it be the next "miracle" like deep learning?
Personally, I do not think so. Learning is not a "new" thing in control field. Using feedback to adjust the input is indeed a way of learning. Some branches which extend and enhance the "feedback learning mechanism" such as neural network control, adaptive control,etc. have been investigated for decades. However, in application, the performances of those methods are still not as ideal as expected. Control field needs a "substantial" breakthrough. Unfortunately， it is not reinforcement learning.    Embed Quote
