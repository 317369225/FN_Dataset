★What reinforcement learning systems are running in the real world?
Reinforcement Learning is primarily MDP. A very common problem studied in this context is the Multi-armed bandit problem. This has seen several applications in the real world (especially for web companies): 1] Content Optimization for Yahoo! Front Page ( How the Yahoo! homepage predicts your clicks ) 2] Ad Format Selection on Web Pages ( Automatic ad format selection via contextual bandits ) These are just two examples, I am sure if you search bandit problem you should find even more applications along these lines.    Embed Quote
