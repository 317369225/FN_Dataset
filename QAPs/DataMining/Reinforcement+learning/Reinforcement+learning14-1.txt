★How do you explain Inverse Reinforcement Learning in layman terms?I am trying to explain IRL (Inverse Reinforcement Learning) to people with not much ML or CS background and finding it difficult not to introduce deep ML concepts. How do you do it?
Having read Abbeel and Ng's paper once before, the most lay explanation to IRL I can think of is that of a dog trying to solve a multi-class classification problem using only cues from its owner and being rewarded for the actions it then takes. There can be multiple owners. Ideally, the dog should realize situations where the "Expert"(/Owner) outperforms its natural reaction to the situation. What this means for the dog is that it should not learn the ideal action. That is, it should not memorize a cause-effect, rather learn what reward it can get from the possible actions. Therefore what the dog is essentially doing is that is trying to maximize the overall reward it can earn for a given training set of situations and actions the owner would ("in this case flag the dog") take. (Bit of twisted example, but I did write a couple lines about dogs and wolves in my notes :D ... A fascinating difference between pet dogs and tame wolves)    Embed Quote
