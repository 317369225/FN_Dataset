★How would a failure of the dopamine signaling pathways involved in reinforcement learning manifest?Could it result in the self-harming behaviors sometimes observed in certain forms of autism?
I have not studied neuro-science but I have read a lot about it (and have some personal experience) because of personal circumstances. I think it's an interesting question and let's see where we get just be reasoning: From what I understand, dopamine rewards us for going on the hunt for something we like. So when we fulfil a craving of any kind, it is the dopamine that makes us feel good about it. But it is only the *hunt* for it that we are rewarded for, it is serotonine (amongst others) that actually makes us feel happy for instance. Self-harm, as I understand it, is a means to have some control over your life. Self-harming is something that the person decides to do entirely by itself and could be rewarded by dopamine as it is something that that person really wants in perhaps an otherwise strange and seemingly uncontrollable world. However, for self-harm to be effective (seen from the person who does the self-harming) there still needs to be a reward system in place. I can see how a failure of the dopamine delivery system could lead to an act as desperate as self-harm. If nothing feels good anymore, if everything seems to be against you, self-harm might seem 'attractive' as a last resort to have ultimate control over what happens to you. But if there is no reward system to actually provide that relief, I would imagine that it loses its appeal sooner rather than later. This is my reasoning and I am sure I'm not aware of any other processes or mechanisms that make who we are and what we do, nor do I claim to understand other people. Still, I hope this might provide some help in finding the answer. Best of luck with your search.    Embed Quote
