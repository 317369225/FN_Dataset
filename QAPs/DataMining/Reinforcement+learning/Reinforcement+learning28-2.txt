★What do you think of reinforcement learning? Would it be the next "miracle" like deep learning?
If it is going to be the next "miracle" like deep learning (DL), I am definitely not seeing a proportional hype/awareness yet. DL is so big today that many people with little (or no) exposure to ML have heard of DL. Its something like the popularity of Genetic Algorithms of the yesteryears. Or even neural networks when they were introduced. In comparison, many practitioners (in the industry) of data mining/ML do not consider Reinforcement Learning for serious applications, or in some cases, aren't even aware of its existence. Personally, I think this is unfortunate - it deserves more attention.    Embed Quote
