★What are some practical applications of reinforcement learning?
I disagree with Ivo: RL does not assume that you know the model of the environment. In fact, one of the biggest contributions in the field has been the understanding of how Temporal Difference learning successfully merges Monte Carlo updates and Dynamic Programming. Also, the problems that RL tackles  cannot in general be solved by A*: RL problems are specified by a Markov Decision Process, which in some cases can be shown to be equivalent to a shortest-path problem but which are much more general. For instance, if you decide to take an action at some given state, the outcome is not necessarily deterministic, as most search algorithms assume, but stochastic; you might have an infinite number of actions available in each state, which graph search algorithms cannot deal with; the number of states (nodes) themselves might be infinite; you might have different reward sources along the way, instead of just one reward for reaching a "destination" state; etc. As for Ben's question, Satinder Singh has compiled a short list of RL successes. It can be found here: http://umichrl.pbworks.com/w/pag.... If you don't have time to read about all of those results, I recommend that you look just at the very impressive helicopter control and aerobatics done by Andrew Ng et al (they have videos somewhere, possibly youtube). Hope that helps! Bruno    Embed Quote
