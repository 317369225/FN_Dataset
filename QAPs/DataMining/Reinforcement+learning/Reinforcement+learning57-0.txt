★What are the advantages of reinforcement learning algorithms such as LinUCB over other online CTR prediction algorithms such as online logistic regression?
Reinforcement learning algorithms balance exploration and exploitation. Exploration is trying different things to see if they are in face better than what has been tried before. Exploitation is trying the things that have worked best in the past. Standard supervised learning algorithms don't perform this balance. They generally are purely exploitative. (Bayesian algorithms implicitly balance exploration and exploitation by integrating over the posterior.) In the context of ad serving, an algorithm like LinUCB (often classified as a bandit algorithm, which is a subclass of reinforcement learning) is more likely to try a wider range of ads when they have not been viewed very often. This means it will better estimate the true CTR and should, over time, lead to more clickthroughs as the algorithm shifts to exploitation.    Embed Quote
