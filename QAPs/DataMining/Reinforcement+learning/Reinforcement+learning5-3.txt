★Machine Learning: What will be the coolest areas to apply deep learning and reinforcement learning in the next 5-10 years?
Great observations.  Speech recognition, image recognition, expression analysis, object recognition, natural language processing, robotics and predictive analytics are certainly certainly all areas that will directly benefit.  With more data available from smart devices (IoT), it will revolutionize manufacturing, automotive and data security.  Perhaps more interesting are new the deep learning applications that will transform industries like medical, education, retail and agriculture.  Consider the impact of machine learning and expert systems has already had on our finance and retail industries.  I predict deep learning will have 10 times more impact. IoT provides more data to integrate, analyze and optimize. For example, we have all seen the success of of automated theorem proving.   Imagine when new facts and rules are generated from observed data.  What new resolutions in those models might be possible?    Embed Quote
