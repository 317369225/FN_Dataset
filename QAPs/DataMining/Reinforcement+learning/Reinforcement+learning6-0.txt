★What frameworks are available for reinforcement learning?Weka, Scikit learn and some R packages are libraries which can be used for supervised and unsupervised learning. Are there some open-source libraries devoted to reinforcement learning?
RL Toolbox is a C++ based, open-source, framework for all kinds of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. You can find it in the following link: Reinforcement Learning Toolbox It can be used for all types of reinforcement learning tasks, it provides most of the common RL algorithms but also general interfaces for implementing new algorithms. Although not formaly a framework, this other link provides a Java implementation of commonly used RL algorithms. Reinforcement Learning    Embed Quote
