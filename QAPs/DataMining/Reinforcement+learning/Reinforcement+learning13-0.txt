★How important is reinforcement learning among machine learning techniques?How is it used in solving real world problems, for example among technology companies?
I'm no expert, but when I think of RL, I think anywhere where a software agent takes actions that improve based on feedback and on-line performance is key, is a problem for which RL could make sense as an approach. RL seems to be surprisingly general. It can be useful whenever a company might want to understand the effects of uncertainty on operations (e.g. optimization problems in the face of randomness). One specific real world problem could be finding an optimal way to manage a fleet of vehicles in the truckload shipping industry (inventory replenishment could be affected by randomness in demand, for instance). Another possible application could be self-driving cars improving their knowledge of optimal routes (on-line performance would definitely be key for this problem. ). Although it might seem like applications of RL are more confined to cutting edge research right now, I really believe we will see more common uses (uses that will reach consumers directly) of these techniques in the upcoming years.    Embed Quote
