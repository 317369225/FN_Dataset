★What are some good graduate schools that are doing research in the areas of reinforcement learning and Deep Learning?Hey Guys looking for suggestions on good graduate schools that are doing research in areas of reinforcement learning or Deep Learning
Andrew Ng at Stanford, Yann LeCun at NYU, and Yoshua Bengio at U. of Montreal are heavily involved in deep learning. Michael Littmann at Brown and Leslie Kaelbling at MIT are well known in reinforcement learning. Geoffrey Hinton of U. of Toronto is one of the most prominent in deep learning, however he's not accepting any more graduate students as he's working with Google these days.    Embed Quote
