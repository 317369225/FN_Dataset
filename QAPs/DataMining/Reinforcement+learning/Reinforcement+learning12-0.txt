★Artificial Intelligence: What is "end-to-end reinforcement learning"?http://www.nature.com/articles/n...
I think that by end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL), they mean that they directly applied RL to train the deep network. Deep learning had already been applied to high-dimensional RL in previous work but the network was used to learn a compact representation of the space and then RL was applied on this compact state space. In this paper you mention, the authors used RL to train the deep network, without making first a compact representation of the state space. So, with this approach, they directly learnt the features of the state space which were useful to discriminate between the possible actions of the learning agent.    Embed Quote
