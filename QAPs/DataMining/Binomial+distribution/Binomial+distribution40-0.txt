Carl Friedrich Gauss: How would you explain the Gaussian distribution in layman's terms?
Consider the classic bean machine: The balls fall from the upper hole and each time they hit a pin, there's an equal chance of going left or right. You can notice that there's only one way for a ball to reach the first column: However there are four ways to reach the second column: And six ways to reach the third: Because the machine is symetrical, after some time it will look like this: If you do it many times, and with a bean machine with many columns, it will eventually look more like a Gaussian distribution: In nature, every outcome that depends on the sum of many independent events will approximate the Gaussian distribution after some time, if respected the assumptions of the Central limit theorem.    Embed Quote Updated 6 Aug, 2013. 59,479 views.
