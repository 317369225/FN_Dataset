★What are some good jokes?
A couple won the award for the happiest couple of the year. The interviewer: what's the secret to your happiness marriage? Husband: it's simple, I make the big decisions and my wife makes all the small decisions. The interviewer (to wife): and you are happy with this? Wife: Very much. I decide about what to buy, where to invest, what tv show to see, what to cook, where to go for a vacation etc etc. Basically all decisions that impact the house. The interviewer (puzzled, to the husband): then what do you do? Husband: I decide who wins the  football world cup, when the third world war will be fought, how do we battle climate change  etc etc. I decide all things that impact the world.    Embed Quote
