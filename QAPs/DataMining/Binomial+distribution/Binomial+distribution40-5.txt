Carl Friedrich Gauss: How would you explain the Gaussian distribution in layman's terms?
It rather depends what you mean by "explain". Quora User's bean machine is an excellent example of why it looks the way it does (as a limit of the binomial distribution), but Jens Adler Nielsen's point about the central limit theorem is crucial to why it's important. I'd also want to add something about the independence of the mean and variance, which makes it easy to work with (and so a convenient approximation to choose when possible, even when you know the real distribution isn't quite Gaussian).    Embed Quote
