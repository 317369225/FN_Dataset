★How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
I recently interviewed for a Software Engineer position in Mountain View. My situation was similar to yours in the sense that I have not been using much classic algorithms or programming for a while (I have been doing mostly research during the last 6 years). So, I also prepared a lot (you  can find some details about my preparation in my answer to What should I expect in a Software Engineer interview at Google and how should I prepare?) and in the end things did go well. Don't worry if you cannot get all the problems solved right away. As long as you have some ideas to try for each problem, the interviewer will help you to narrow down your options. And, even if you get stuck, most likely your interviewer will give you a good hint to help moving on with the problem. Furthermore, even if one or two interviews don't go as well as one would expect, you might still get a job offer: the key seems to be to have one ore two interviewers REALLY liking you (even if some of the other interviewers were not impressed with you). Now, regarding the preparation, I would advice you to practice solving exercises as much as possible. Try to get some friends to help you with this, mock interviews are very helpful (you can also buy mock interviews with "real" interviewers at careercup.com). This will give you a better feeling of how the real interviews will go (and it is also more fun to have somebody asking you the questions and testing your answers than just doing this alone :)). Something else that I consider very important is to practice in the blackboard or paper (not with your computer). Finally, it would be really helpful if you could have some interviews with other companies: this would be a very good test to find out how prepared you are and it will also help you to be more relaxed during your Google interviews. Hope this helps, good luck with your interviews!    Embed Quote Updated 20 Jun, 2012. 10,159 views.
