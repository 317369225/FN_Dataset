★What are some good jokes?
Two old timers are sitting in their rocking chairs on a hot summer day. One of the fella's dogs is sitting on the porch licking himself. The first guy, noticing this, turns to the other and says, "man, I wish I could do that." The other guy looks at the dog, thinks for a moment and replies, "I dunno... I think he'd bite you."    Embed Quote
