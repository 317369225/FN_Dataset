X flips a fair coin n times, and so does Y. what is the probability that they get the same number of heads?
Let's generalize the problem to the chance that two people, each tossing a fair coin n times, will toss the same number of heads. Collectively, the two people make 2n flips. We can interpret these flips as movements on a grid. We'll start at (0, 0), and each time a coin is flipped, we'll move to reflect the outcome. For the first n flips (the first person's actions), we'll move one step to the right whenever the coin lands heads, and we'll move one step upward whenever the coin lands tails. For the remaining flips, we'll reverse our behavior, moving up when we see heads, and to the right when we see tails. The nice thing about this formulation is that, for any series of outcomes in which the two players flip the same number of heads, we'll end up at the point (n, n). The question, then, is how many of the 2^(2n) different paths we could take actually end at (n, n). But this is simply (2n choose n), the number of different ways to select exactly n of our moves to be upward. Hence the probability that the two players flip the same number of heads is .    Embed Quote Updated 15 Dec. 3,696 views.
