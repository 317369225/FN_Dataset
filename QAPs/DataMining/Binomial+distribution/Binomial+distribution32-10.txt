★What are some good jokes?
A pirate walks into a bar, but he has a steering wheel coming out from the front of his pants.  The bartender is obviously confused:  "Sir, you DO realize you have a steering wheel coming out of the front of your pants, right?"  And the pirate goes, "Arrgh, it's driving me nuts."    Embed Quote
