What are some second-order distributions?
I'm not familiar with the term "second-order distribution". Perhaps what you're referring to is families of distributions parameterized by two parameters. An example of that is the family of normal distributions.  The two parameters of that family are the mean and the standard deviation Some other families of distributions parameterized by two parameters are Binomial distributions parameterized by p, the probability of success on one trial, and n, the number of trials Negative binomial distributions parameterized by  p, the probability of success on one trial, and r, the number of successes Gamma distributions Beta distributions F distributions When you've got a doubly parameterized family of distributions, you'll need two statistics, typically the mean and the variance, to estimate the parameters. The family of exponential distributions has only one parameter the rate of events, and so only one statistic is needed to estimate    Embed Quote
