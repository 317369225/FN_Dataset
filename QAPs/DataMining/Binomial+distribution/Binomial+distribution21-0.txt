Why does a binomial distribution converge with at least a 20? Why can't it be less or more? An explanation with the coin tossing example would be helpful.
20 is not special. As N increases, the binomial looks more and more like a normal distribution. At some point, the difference is so small that you don't care anymore. Whoever told you "20" is just saying that "for most applications, at N=20 you don't care about the error anymore". This is similar to the arbitrary threshold of 0.05 for "statistical significance". A more precise statement would be something like "if you want to guarantee error bounds within X, you need n >= N" (where there is a difference N for every value of X and p). 20 is a useful "rule of thumb" because the precise calculation is more complicated.    Embed Quote
