If I flip a coin (heads or tails) 1,000,000 times, shouldn't the fraction of heads and tails approach 50% equally?
This is a standard statistical mechanics question that everyone gets on their first assignment.  (I sure hope I get it right!) So let us say that we're flipping a coin times.  The probability to get heads is given by the binomial distribution which is written as and is equal to . Notice that since this is a fair coin, the probability of getting heads is the same as the probability of getting tails (which is heads). To see how strongly favored getting 50% heads and 50% tails is, let us consider expanding around 50% heads and tails by using The binomial distribution gives This doesn't look particularly enlightening with all those factorial symbols floating around.  Since we're considering a lot of heads and tails, we'd like to approximate the factorials using simple functions. The appropriate approximation is called Stirling's formula and is given by which gives (after a little bit of algebra) This probability distribution is a normal distribution (the central limit theorem rears its head) with a variance of The normalization of the normal distribution will come from the terms in the Stirling approximation. The probability that you get exactly half heads and half tails for perfectly fair coin is which is 0.08% for N=1,000,000.  The better way to determine whether a coin is fair is to say what ranges of heads and tails correspond to a fair coin. With  , a fair coin will probably give the 67% of the times if you flipped a coin 1000000 times,  the results would give between  499,500 and 500,500 heads or tails.  For a bit more leeway, you get immense more confidence, so if you want to determine that a coin is fair 99.7% of the time, the results will be between 498,500 and 501,500.    Embed Quote Updated 15 Feb. 1,727 views.
