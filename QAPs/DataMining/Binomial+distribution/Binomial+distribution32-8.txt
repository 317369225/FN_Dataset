★What are some good jokes?
A man walks into a bar and sees another man sitting beside a little tiny man who's playing a really small piano. He walks up to the man and says, ''That's amazing, how did you get that.'' The man pulls out a bottle and tells him to rub it and make a wish. He rubs the bottle and a puff of smoke and out pops a genie who grants him one wish. The man thinks and says, ''I wish I had a million bucks.'' The genie says, "OK, go outside and your wish will be granted." The man goes outside and all he finds is ducks filling the sky and roads. He goes back in and tells the man what happened. The man says, ''I know, do you really think I wanted a 12 inch pianist.'''    Embed Quote Updated 23 Jun, 2013. 4,276 views.
