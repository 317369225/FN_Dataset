★What are some good jokes?
A woman is working as a receptionist when a dog walks in the door carrying their "Help Wanted" sign.  Slightly bored, the woman looks at the dog and says, "So, you want the job?"  The dog barks and wags its tail. Humoring it, the woman says, "Alright, well, one of the qualifications is you need to type at least 60 words per minute."  The dog barks, grabs a letter off her desk, then heads over to a typewriter and knocks out the letter, perfectly punctuated, formatted, and way over 60 words per minute.  Impressed, the receptionist continued. "Okay, well, the next requirement is the ability to send and receive faxes." The dog barks, takes the letter over to the fax machine, preps it, sends a fax, and receives one, all perfectly.  Further impressed, the receptionist says, "Alright, well the last requirement for the job is you need to be bilingual." The dog barks, wags its tail, clear its throat, and goes "Meooooooooow!"    Embed Quote
