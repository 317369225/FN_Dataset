★What are some good jokes?
There was a knock on a man's door. He answers the door and sees a giant snail at his feet. He screams, picks up the snail, throws it across the yard, and slams his door. Three years later there's another knock, and when the man answers, the snail yells in his face, "Hey! What was that all about?!"    Embed Quote
