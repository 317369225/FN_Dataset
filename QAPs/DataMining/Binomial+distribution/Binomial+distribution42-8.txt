★How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
I'm interning at Google this summer, so I only had 2 phone interviews and not the whole on campus barrage of interviews that they might put you through. What I can tell you though is this. Google isn't interested in whether or not you can solve the algorithmic questions that you're talking about. They're way more interested in your approach to the problem. Are you someone who will just give up and say it can't be done? Or will you reason through the problem and approach it one step at a time. I think that makes all the difference. Your interviewer generally ends up guiding you to the right solution as long as you're taking those small steps. If you can look at a problem and come up with at least a couple of ways to try and solve it, then you're in good shape.    Embed Quote
