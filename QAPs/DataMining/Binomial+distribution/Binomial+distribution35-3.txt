X flips a fair coin n times, and so does Y. what is the probability that they get the same number of heads?
The number of ways X can get i heads is . Hence the total number of ways X and Y can get the same number of heads is: We can simplify this sum by using some rearrangement and combinatorial arguments: Consider the number of ways to select n students out of a group of n boys and n girls. This is easily seen to be . But we can count this in a different way. We can first decide the number of girls (i) out of the n. This can range from 0 to n. We can choose i girls and n-i boys in ways. But this sum is just S. Hence . Since there are 4^n outcomes for X and Y tossing n coins each, the probability is Alternate method: The probability is same as the probability of Y getting as many tails as X gets heads (since heads and tails are identical). Now, if Y gets as many tails as X gets heads, they should get n heads combined (X has i heads. Y has i tails and hence n-i heads). The number of ways of getting n heads from 2n tosses is and hence the probability is .    Embed Quote Updated 16 Sep, 2013. 1,607 views. Asked to answer by Ravi Chandra.
