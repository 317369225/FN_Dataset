Why does a binomial distribution converge with at least a 20? Why can't it be less or more? An explanation with the coin tossing example would be helpful.
In maths, convergence means getting closer not becoming identical.  There's always a question of how close.  The binomial distribution is always made of discreet steps with values defined in a limited range but the normal distribution is a continuous curve with positive values defined for all real numbers.  Both these curve are theoretical mathematical functions not real world observations.  In practice, the differences won't matter past a certain point but this point depends on what you are doing.  If you print the curves on a piece of paper they will look about the same to the eye, but if you magnify down to the pixel level there will be clear differences.  If you increase the number of binomial points eventually you won't be able to see the differences because they are smaller than the printer resolution.  In the real world you are always working with samples and imperfect measurements so there is a level of accuracy which appropriate to the quality of your data.  If you have to offer betting odds on say getting 15+ heads on 20 coin tosses you can calculate the odd simply using a normal approximation and any small errors aren't going to matter.  However, if you were going to play this game a million times for real money you might want a more accurate number.
