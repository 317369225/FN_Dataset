X flips a fair coin n times, and so does Y. what is the probability that they get the same number of heads?
First recall two useful facts about the Binomial distribution: if X and Y are independent Bin(n,p) random variables, then n-X~Bin(n,1-p) and X+Y~Bin(2n,p). This follows from the story of the Binomial, i.e.,  that it counts the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success (so n-X is the number of failures in n trials, and X+Y is the number of successes in 2n trials). Now let X and Y be independent Bin(n,1/2) random variables. Then , which using the Binomial PMF is    Embed Quote
