★What are some good jokes?
This one is paraphrased from David Mamet-written film The Verdict and was told by Paul Newman's character Frank Galvin in a played up Irish brogue: "So Pat, he says to Mike, he says "there's this new bar... and you go inside and for half a buck you get a beer, a free lunch and they take you in the back room and they get you laid. Mike says, "Now wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Do you mean to say there's a new bar and you go inside and for a half a buck they give you a beer, a free lunch and they take you in the back room and they get you laid?" Pat says, "That's right." "Have you ever been in the bar?" And he says, "No, but me sister has."    Embed Quote
