If three coins are tossed simultaneously, what is the probability of getting at least two heads?
Before you begin, you need to assume some things about the coins for this problem to be solvable.  These assumptions are natural, but they are ESSENTIAL as well, so you shouldn't make them without realizing it. #1) You have to assume the outcomes on each coin flip are independent.  (Our understanding of the physics of coin flipping easily justifies this assumption.)  #2) You must assume something about the probability of heads on each of the three coins.  The usual assumption is that there is a 50% chance of heads on each toss of each coin. With those assumptions made, you can solve this problem by symmetry with no calculations.  Notice that when the coins are tossed, there are two possibilities: either at least two heads or at least two tails.  Since the probabilities of heads and tails are identical for a 50/50 coin, each of the two possibilities must have the same probability by symmetry.  Hence, each must have probability 1/2 (so that together they sum to one). Sure, this problem isn't hard to solve by direct calculation, but the symmetry argument is a useful one to keep in mind.  It can sometimes make a seemingly very tough problem much easier.  For an interesting problem that can be solved by symmetry, see: Michael Lamar's answer to What are the most interesting or popular probability puzzles in which the intuition is contrary to the solution?    Embed Quote
