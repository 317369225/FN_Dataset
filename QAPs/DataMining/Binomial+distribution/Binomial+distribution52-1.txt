If I flip a coin (heads or tails) 1,000,000 times, shouldn't the fraction of heads and tails approach 50% equally?
The probability of observing any particular number of heads (or tails) in any trial of this type is given by the binomial distribution (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin... especially the section titled "Probability Mass Function"). Exactly 500,000 heads is the highest probability outcome (though the exact probability is extremely small!), but there is a non-zero probability of observing anywhere between 0 and 1,000,000 heads on any particular trial. A different way of looking at this is to say you are repeating a trial of 10 flips 100,000 times.  Watching the process unfold this way can be illuminating and besides, the numbers are easier to calculate (binomial coefficients for n=1,000,000 require some numerical methods trickery).  When you are done, you would expect to have (all numbers rounded to whole integers) 98 trials with 0 heads, 977 trials with 1 head, 4395 trials with 2 heads, 11719 trials with 3 heads, 20508 trials with 4 heads, 24609 trials with 5 heads, then proceeding symmetrically back down for 6,7, etc.  The actual counts are very likely to be off to some degree, but if the coin is indeed fair, the numbers will be quite close.  The more trials you perform, the more your counts are likely to converge on the proportions given by the binomial distribution.  Visually, if you graph the counts in a histogram, as you go from 10 to 100 to 1000 trial repetitions the graph will come closer and closer to the exact shape given by the binomial.    Embed Quote
