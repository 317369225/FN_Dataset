How can we as a poor startup follow competitor's e-commerce prices with web scraping/data mining technology?
There are a bunch of price intelligence tools out there that can monitor competitors’ ecommerce prices. That being said, you’d have to do a cost/benefit analysis to determine whether the time and money you’d spend on developing and implementing your own technology is worth it, or if you can find an existing solution that’s within your budget. WisePricer is one such solution and we offer different product tiers to fit a variety of needs/budgets. You can check out the plans here (we also have a free trial so you can test it out before committing).    Embed Quote
