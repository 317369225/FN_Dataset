Which are some of the best web data scraping tools?
If you want to actually extract data from a website, you are going to need to do some custom programming for each site.  I have used a Python based library called Beautiful Soup (http://www.crummy.com/software/B... ). It is good for parsing HTML and XML. In particular it can parse HTML and XML that is not well formed.  Its main use case is when you have data locked up in site and you need to extract it.  If all you want is to extract HTML and text, I would recommend Apache Tika (http://tika.apache.org/).  This is useful for extracting data from PDF, MS Word, PowerPoint, images, and about any other type of data.  It is used in projects like Solr. It is Java- based, but it also has a command line tool as well.  Next, Universal Feed Parser is great for parsing RSS and Atom feeds (http://code.google.com/p/feedpar...).  Again, these are just tools and not full fledged solutions.    Embed Quote
