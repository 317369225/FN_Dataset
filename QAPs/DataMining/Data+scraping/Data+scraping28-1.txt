How can I data scrape every single data on Facebook by topic (i.e. all likes, interests, books, etc), organize the data visually, and add it to my personal site?
If you're just doing stuff with your own personal data, you can download a copy of your Facebook data (all of the activity you've ever done on Facebook). This can be done by clicking the gear in the top right -> Account Settings. At the bottom of the "General" section, there's a link to "Download a copy of your Facebook data.". Don't know about the rest of your question, but that's how you can get all of your Facebook data.    Embed Quote
