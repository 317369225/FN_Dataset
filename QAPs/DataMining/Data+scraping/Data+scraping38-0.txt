How can we as a poor startup follow competitor's e-commerce prices with web scraping/data mining technology?
Hi, we are startup based in Istanbul and working specifically on that subject. We are building a competitor tracking SaaS, which tracks the prices and stock availabilities of competitors and sends notifications when there is a change in the market. During Summer 2013, we will be in closed beta and starting from September 2013, we will be asking for a monthly subscription fee of 100-500 dollars depending on your need. However, for now, during the summer, it is free for our beta testers. If you wanna join the testers please send an email to info@prisync.com. Thanks.    Embed Quote
