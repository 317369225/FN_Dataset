How can I scrape data from an E-commerce store?
Many eCommerce websites embed structured data describing for instance products, people, organizations, places, events, resumes, and cooking recipes into their HTML pages using markup formats such as RDFa, Microdata and Microformats.  Search engines make use of this information to display price and other information in their search results. You have to extract these information from the corpus that you have crawled using any of the mentioned markup formats as metadata information.
