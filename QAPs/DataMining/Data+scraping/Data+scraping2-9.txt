Which are some of the best web data scraping tools?
I was surprised to find the .Net WebBrowser form control to be the best solution for my web scraping. I started out trying Scrapy, but overall the .Net web browser was more powerful (the web browser is like a full version of IE) and easier to use when combined with HtmlAgilityPack.    Embed Quote
