What are some good resources to learn data mining and data scraping from websites using Python?
Data mining is commonly learnt through R, as for beginners it's easy to pick up. However, R is slower compared to Python and other languages. Another good language besides Python, for machine learning would be Matlab/Octave. My suggestion is Go through the data specialisation course in Coursera. You can pick it up very easily. Also go through the other courses in Coursera (like Machine Learning etc) Data scraping for python can be done with the help of BeautifulSoup. It's a brilliant library made for Python for data scraping. Another advice would be to start going through websites such as HackerRank and Kaggle. In Kaggle, you have data mining projects available for every level- beginner, expert etc. I would suggest you to start playing about with them. (though they use R) Also, go through the libraries for python. It's brilliant for statistical data analysis. Some of them are scikit, NumPy/scipy, pandas, larry, statsmodels, PyMC, PyMix, python- statlib. Also, if speed matters, then you can use Theano However, for a beginner, I would advise you to start with R, as , R is absolutely brilliant in handling model building.Do check this link on whether to go for R or Python: What can be done in R that can't be done with Python/Numpy/SciPy Hope this helps :)    Embed Quote
