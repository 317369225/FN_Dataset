No. However, you can make it more difficult to scrape by: Have random-ness when generating HTML markup, especially for HTML tables Have ad-hoc, short periods of server downtime Implant fake data to assert data ownership Restrict what can be queried in the search box Rate limiting, banning IPs after a certain number of visits exceeds a limit Use of CAPTCHAs and images of data, to ensure that humans are accessing the Web database get Web monitoring or network security company or software to help A combination of the above counter-measures    Embed Quote
