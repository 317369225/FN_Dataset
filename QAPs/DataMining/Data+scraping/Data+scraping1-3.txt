What are some good resources to learn data mining and data scraping from websites using Python?
There is an inbuilt Library lxml which can be used in web crawling and scraping. However BeautifulSoup4. is pretty simple to understand and use. BeautifulSoup4 is built-on top of aforementioned library lxml so its little bit slower than lxml. besides these you'll have to use urllib/urllib2  and Requests module for HTTP requests like GET,POST,etc. There is an another third party library Robobrowser which includes features of BeautifulSoup, WebTest, Mechanize and requests.but this is new and many other features are yet to come. so I would recommend, start with beautifulsoup4. These are for small crawling system or scripts. If you want to design a big,modular and customizable architecture then Scrapy will be best. It is little bit complex to understand and use though.    Embed Quote
