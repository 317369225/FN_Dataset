What is the best way to scrape data from a website?
I actually work for Kimono Labs, so I figured I'd chime in here. Like you mentioned, Kimono provides a webscraping tool where you can select your data by pointing and clicking. This is great if you don't want to go through the trouble of building your own scraper because it doesn't require any programming. Kimono works by identifying the CSS selectors of the data you want on the page and then capturing that data for you as you crawl. The benefit here is that it works across tons and tons of different websites whereas your own webscraper might only work on a small set. While you do need a Kimono account to use the tool, you don't need to sign up for a subscription plan. Kimono is free, and unless you're planning to use it for larger-scale commercial purposes, it will continue to be free! That being said, I understand you also want to keep your data locally. Kimono does host your data for you, but you can still download your data as needed. Kimono is a great way to get your data quickly and easily, so I'd really recommend giving it a try! Also if you get stuck or need any help we have a great support team ready to answer your questions.    Embed Quote
