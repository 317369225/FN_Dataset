How can I data scrape every single data on Facebook by topic (i.e. all likes, interests, books, etc), organize the data visually, and add it to my personal site?
I have used several tools to scrape data from Facebook pages and gain insights on potential social media marketing techniques. In your case, I think these two - Social Media Crawling & Scraping services for Brand Monitoring and Export Data From Facebook To Excel List | MyHelpster  will help you get easy to use file format - xls and csv. Once you have the data in place, you can organize it in charts and diagrams. An easy way to visualize this is with the Google Charts - Google Charts — Google Developers Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
