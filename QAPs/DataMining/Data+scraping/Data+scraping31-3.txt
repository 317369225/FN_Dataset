Is there any way to scrape data from a LinkedIn public profile?
In January 2014, LinkedIn filed a lawsuit against unnamed parties after discovering that bots were used to scrape data from the profiles of hundreds of thousands of users. LinkedIn provided the following statement: “As a members-first organization, we provide our members with control over the information that they make available to others on LinkedIn.  When anyone tries to take away this control by scraping our members’ profiles without permission, we can and will take aggressive action to stop them and hold them accountable.” Be aware that scraping is prohibited by LinkedIn's user agreement, the company said, and claims that it breaks state and federal computer security laws, as well as federal copyright law.    Embed Quote
