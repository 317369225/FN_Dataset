Which are some of the best web data scraping tools?
You need a web scraping tool that is driven by a real browser. Headless browsers of any sort will not replace an actual browser, and unfortunately all of the solutions mentioned on this page employ this inefficient technology. This is why Kimono, Import and the other solutions on here fail because websites can only be accurately rendered and automated with a REAL browser. Namely, http://scrape.it/ uses a REAL web browser in the cloud that is capable of rendering anything you can view in your own browser as well as automating any type of complex actions such as typing list of keywords or clicking on AJAX forms. You can also see a real-time video feed of your jobs as they run to prove that this isn't just a marketing gimmick, it's an actual browser you can watch as it scrapes a website. You also need this to be distributed in order to scale up the data extraction speed. The problem with all the other web scraping tools to date is that they are still centralized in one instance when dealing with complex AJAX websites. Screen Scraping, Data Scraping, Data Extraction Software is able to completely distribute a task so throwing more workers at a task will automatically increase extraction speed. Lastly, what good is all of this if a tool itself is too complex or takes a long time to setup? What is the point of replacing programming with click and dragging logic into a long and set of rules? With http://Scrape.it, all you deal with is a wizard guide that tells you what to click from start to finish. You don't even need to read manuals, just follow the step by step wizard UI and you can automate even the most complicated website.
