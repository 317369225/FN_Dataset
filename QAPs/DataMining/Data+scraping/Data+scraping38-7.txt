How can we as a poor startup follow competitor's e-commerce prices with web scraping/data mining technology?
I would not recommend investing too much effort in it. You may be able to achieve initial success, but soon you'll encounter problems like scraping prices from sites which are not shown in HTML dealing with IP bans and similar ways of preventing scraping mechanisms Therefore, I'd suggest to leave this to professionals.
