Is it possible to scrape data from mobile apps?
Sure it can be done, but probably not a huge scale (thousands or millions of pages). What you need to start with is reverse engineering the mobile app traffic (not the app - just the traffic) - use a proxy on a computer and route the mobile phone traffic through the proxy and see whats going on. Here is a nice lightweight proxy https://mitmproxy.org/ Most likely you will see data requests and probably data in JSON format - that is much easier to grab. Again, it all depends on how each app is written, but this first step will give you a good start.    Embed Quote
