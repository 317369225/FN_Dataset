Has anybody been sued for scraping data?
Yodlee and CashEdge have sued each other over their respective scraping patents, a case that was settled in 2007.  I believe Yodlee has been fairly aggressive in going after scrapers. Facebook sued Power Ventures for copyright infringement and various other causes of action for scraping Facebook data.  http://www.scribd.com/doc/158278...  The original scraping case was eBay v. Bidders Edge, 100 F. Supp. 2d 1058 (N.D. Cal., 2000), which found that scraping was effectively a "trespass" onto eBay's servers in violation of the terms of service.  http://scholar.google.com/schola...    Embed Quote
