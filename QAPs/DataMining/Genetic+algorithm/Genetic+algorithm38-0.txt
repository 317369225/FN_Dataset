★Is there any genetic algorithm/library implemented in Map Reduce?
I guess you are looking for the Parallel implementation of Genetic Algorithm. Map Reduce, as Wikipedia describes is: A MapReduce program comprises a Map() procedure that performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name) and a Reduce()procedure that performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). As you see the main point here is processing the data in parallel using several computing nodes. However, the Genetic Algorithm doesn't tend to process data; the Genetic Algorithm is an optimization algorithm that uses to optimize an objective function which may need to compute data using Map Reduce technique. For instance, you may have a very large dataset that has to compute using MapReduce and then you may want to optimize a process based on the result of the MapReduce process. In this scenario, you need to: Process your very large dataset using MapReduce technique, as an output of objective function Use parallel implementation of Genetic Algorithm like (Matthew's Genetic Algorithms Library) to accelerate your optimization process in Parallel.    Embed Quote
