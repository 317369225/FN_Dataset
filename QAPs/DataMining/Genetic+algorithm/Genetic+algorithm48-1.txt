★What Java library do you use for genetic algorithms? Why?
In my experience, it is better if you write your own library for genetic algorithms. Then, you can tailor-make all the parameters and the mutation/crossover methods as per the problem you are trying to solve. I would recommend you to read the following threads to get an idea of how to go about writing your own library for GA: GA written in Java Genetic Algorithms Implementation An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms In Java Genetic Algorithm example with Java The above links will give you an example of an implementation of GA. I have put links which describe the implementation in Java itself. If you still want to use an already existing library for GA in Java you can look into Java API for Genetic Algorithms. I have got some good reviews about this API and it is well developed. But I would highly suggest you to take up your own implementation as it is quite easy to do and you would learn the fundamentals of GA along the way.    Embed Quote
