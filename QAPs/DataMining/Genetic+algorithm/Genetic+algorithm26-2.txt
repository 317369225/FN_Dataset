★What's the difference between Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming?
To me, the core difference is that Genetic Algorithms (GA) are trying to optimize a fixed number of variables. Genetic Programming (GP), on the other hand, is trying to optimize an entire structure with dynamic size, as well as any parameters of that structure. So for example you can use GA to find the best slope (a) and constant parameter (b) for a simple regression of the type y = a*x + b. With GP you could try different functions on x (a*x, x^a, a^x, sin(a*x), a*x^2 + b*x + c, etc.) that would better predict y. So GP can be seen as a more flexible version of GAs, or GAs as a special case of GP with a constant number of variables.    Embed Quote
