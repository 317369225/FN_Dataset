★Aren't genetic algorithms  elaborations of  pattern matching?
Anon is almost on the right track. But GA is not gradient descent/ascent + randomization. By your logic, you could say any optimization algorithm is a variation of gradient descent/ascent! The focus of memetic algorithms like GA is on exploration of solution space and to find several potential minima/maxima. The performance of GA depends more on how well the solution space is explored rather than how well the gradient descent/ascent is done. As far as pattern matching is concerned, I agree with Anon that it is no different than many other techniques.    Embed Quote
