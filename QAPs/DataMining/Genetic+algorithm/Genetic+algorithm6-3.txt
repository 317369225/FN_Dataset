★What should every programmer know about genetic algorithms?
Genetic algorithms are numerical algorithms inspired by evolution. They  do not have to mimick every issue of evolution in nature. If it were  advantageous to so mimick then the algorithm could easily be altered to  do so. Neural  Networks are numerical algorithms inspired by how the building blocks  of the brain might work. They do not have to mimick every  issue of how the brain might work. If it were advantageous to so mimick  then  the algorithm could easily be altered to do so. Aeroplanes are objects inspired by bird flight. They do not have to mimick every  issue of birds in nature. If it were advantageous to so mimick then  the aircraft could easily be altered to do so. Aeroplanes do not lay eggs.    Embed Quote
