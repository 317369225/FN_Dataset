★Does the success of genetic algorithms "prove" that natural selection and evolution occur?Can it be used as strong empirical evidence against opponents of evolution?
It proves that the principle works. But it's kind of obvious that it does. With any given space, we can traverse it looking for improvements.  The combination of random traversal, along with some rejection/selection criteria is obviously going to act as a brute force optimiser.   Sufficient mutations and generations is always going to lead to some improvement. But imagine trying to improve a screenplay, by introducing random variations to arbitrary ascii characters.   Most mutations would lead to sin It would take a lot of generations just to get rid of a single cliche'd use of "I was born ready!" The usefulness of this method is very sensitive to the language used to express the genes.  If random variations mostly result in nonsense or broken forms, than this stochastic search is not going to work well.  But if random variations mostly produce viable alternatives then the search will be more effective. The limited usefulness of genetic algorithms has more to do with the fact that we are mutating code, rather than an optimal "meta-code", which would permit the search to proceed at an algorithmic level, rather than at a opcode level. At the end of the day, genetic algorithms are interesting, but not a particularly fruitful way of making better code.  Why use random variation when a more purposeful search might be more efficient. It's clear that in biological evolution the trick has less to do with purposeless random mutation, and a lot more to do with how sexual reproduction results in optimisation without any need for mutation.    Embed Quote
