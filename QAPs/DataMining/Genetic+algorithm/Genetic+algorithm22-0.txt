★Can genetic algorithms evolve nano robots?
You mean like spontaneously? No, that's completely absurd. Genetic algorithms are for search and optimization. The only thing that is evolving is an array of bits, you know 1's and 0's. That array of bits is an encoding of a solution to a problem, which is repeatedly recombined, mutated, and tested against a fitness function until it approaches an efficient solution. The only way a genetic algorithm would end up evolving nano robots is if some nanotechnology researcher specifically set up a genetic algorithm for the purpose of designing nano robots with the array of bits encoding the representation of positions of atoms  in said nanobots. This would require a fitness function which would test said nanobots on their ability to perform a certain task. In theory if the fitness function is set up correctly after thousands of generations there might be a solution that produces a nanobots that does the job well. But the way this question is written sounds like silly Sci-fi. Which is an extremely common thing on the AI topic here on Quora.    Embed Quote
