★Which artificial algorithm is better? Genetic algorithm or Particle swarm optimization? and why?
I am using computational efficiency (i.e. which one comes up with a solution after doing less computation) as the metric for comparison. It is currently not known whether Genetic Algorithms is more computationally efficient than Particle Swarm Optimization (or otherwise) for most classes of problems. There are publications that compare the algorithms on particular problems; these have however shown mixed results (e.g. [1]) or results favoring one or the other of these algorithms (e.g. [2] and [3] favor PSO, [4] favors GA). There is no justification for generalizing from the results obtained so far. In future I suspect we will get to find which niche suits each approach best.  References: [1] Boeringer D., Particle swarm optimization versus genetic algorithms for phased array synthesis, IEEE Trans.
