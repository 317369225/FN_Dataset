★Are evolutionary algorithms a subset of genetic algorithms?
You have it reversed. Evolutionary algorithms are a superset of genetic algorithms. This is one instance in which Wikipedia does a great job of outlining things: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo... EAs generally refer to all algorithms that use the idea of simulated evolution. Genetic algorithms specifically extend that idea with the concept of sexual reproduction, where two candidate solutions (parents) are mated together to produce new candidate solutions (children). In other forms of EAs, like Evolutionary Programming, asexual reproduction is used and search is primarily driven by mutation.    Embed Quote
