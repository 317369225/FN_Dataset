â˜…What are the disadvantage of genetic algorithm?
The disadvantages of using GA in the way you mentioned: Over-fitting. Since you cannot generate all the possible permutations of holes and available blocks, you are bound to have over-fitting with your sample data using the simple weighted approach you mentioned On the contrary, if you do not train the algo long enough (generations) then the usability would be low. Optimization Time (which you already noticed) Results Over-fitting. Since you cannot generate all the possible permutations of holes and pros/cons also depend upon whether:available blocks, you are bound to have over-fitting with your sample data using the simple weighted approach you mentioned. On the contrary, if you do not train the algo long enough (generations) then the usability would be low. Optimization Time (which you already noticed) Results and pros/cons also depend upon whether: Do you adjust mutation rates with generations? Do you use elitism, if so what kind and how does it vary with generations? etc. Suggestion for better performance: Suggestion for better performance: Instead of a simple weighted approach, add an intermediary intelligent system and optimize that system. E.g. weights of a neural network or parameters of a fuzzy logic system.Instead of a simple weighted approach, add an intermediary intelligent system and optimize that system.
