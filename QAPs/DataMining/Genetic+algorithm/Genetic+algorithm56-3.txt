★How would you go about generating Jokes and Puns using Genetic Algorithms?As a final year project at the CS bachelor's degree level, if I decide to do something regarding Joke/Pun generation using GAs, what all do I need to know? Where do I start?
Yikes!  Philips George John has given a good answer from a technical perspective.  I'd just add that his question number (2) is far and away the hardest part of this problem.  Not only is there a fine line between the funny and the offensive, or between the funny and the merely nonsensical, those lines move around.  The fart joke that has you crying tears of mirth into your second pint on Saturday evening falls absolutely flat on Monday morning.  Everything else, representation, population, search operators, it's all secondary to the fact that having a computer evaluate how funny something is, is a very hard unsolved problem.    Embed Quote
