★How can i use genetic algorithms to create a better Neural Network?
Genetic algorithms (or another evolutionary strategy approach, like genetic programming) can be, in principle, combined with neural networks quite naturally since a neural network design requires hyperparameters tuning which is typically done manually these days. For example, one has to specify the number of neural network layers, the number of units in each layer, learning rate, momentum, etc. and then start training of the neural network parameters.   These configuration and learning hyperparameters represent the space in which an optimum is not easy to be found by hand. Training of the network is, in fact, two-level optimization problem -- on the first level the optimal configuration is found, which is then trained on the second level. If the hyperparameter vector is mapped to a suitable representation, some evolutionary algorithm can be used for optimizing it. However, such approach is very difficult in practice -- training and evaluating a single large neural network requires a lot of computational power, running a population of such networks (where each individual is configured by its own hyperparameter vector) multiplies these requirements by a substantial factor. Therefore some non-evolutionary alternatives exist (e.g. JasperSnoek/spearmint).    Embed Quote
