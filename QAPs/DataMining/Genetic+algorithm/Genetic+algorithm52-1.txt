★What is the main difference between artificial immune system and genetic algorithms?I'm reading about AIS and it looks like modification of genetic algorithms.
It's closer to a learning classifier system than to a vanilla GA. Stephanie Forrest has written about the similarities and differences between AIS and classifier systems: Page on unm.edu More generally, John Holland would say that learning and evolution are fundamentally the same process, on different time scales. Similarly you could argue that the immune system and genetic evolution use fundamentally the same processes on different time scales. The different time scales as well as the subtleties of implementation or representation could make a significant difference in practice, though.    Embed Quote
