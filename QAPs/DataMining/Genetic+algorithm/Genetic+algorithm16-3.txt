★Where can I find simple genetic algorithms sample code?I'm starting with all this Genetic Algorithms stuff, but I don't know where should I begin. I have been reading some literature but I would like to see some sample codes.
Pseudocode is a good way to begin understanding the basic concepts. Once you are familiar with the process and are ready to begin coding, I suggest using a Genetic Algorithm-based API for a programming language you are familiar with. Once you are familiar with coding through the API, you will be prepared to write your own Genetic Algorithm scripts from scratch. My Genetic Algorithm API of choice is Pyevolve for Python: http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/ You can read through sample codes through the documentation and also join our Google Group. Genetic Algorithm programming has allowed me to efficiently optimize my financial models. I hope it helps you in your work as well. Best of Luck, Rasikh    Embed Quote
