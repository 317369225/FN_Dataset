★What genetic algorithm applications are there in astronomy?
It's a bit too specific of a question, much like another question I just answered about the applications of neural networks in astronomy. I answered in general ML terms. Link: Hadayat Seddiqi's answer to What neural network applications are there in astronomy? Here's what I said: I'm not sure how much neural networks are used, but in general, classifiers and clustering algorithms are used extensively, and that will only increase in the future. Astronomers, astrophysicists, and cosmologists deal with incredible amounts of data, and there is nowhere near enough human eyes to look through everything. You could probably train a neural network to work as a classifier. Identifying sources is one big problem, and in stellar astrophysics, one can attempt to identify certain types of stars by their spectral properties. Most of these problems will be in the observational side, so I can't tell you much about it (I worked in theory/computation). Take a look at this page for some slides and papers: http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~calj/... And this book might be helpful: Advances in Machine Learning and Data Mining for Astronomy (Chapman & Hall/CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Series): Michael J. Way, Jeffrey D. Scargle, Kamal M. Ali, Ashok N. Srivastava: 9781439841730: Amazon.com: Books So from that, you can surmise that wherever there needs to be some optimization procedure in an ML technique, you can apply a genetic algorithm to it. You could even combine neural networks and genetic algorithms, though there are probably much faster ways to do what you're trying to do with more simple classifiers or clustering algorithms.    Embed Quote
