★What is the relationship between neural networks and genetic algorithms?
The relationship is simply that they are both inspired by biological systems/processes. Having said that, they are often used together in Artificial life. The title of my Master's thesis was "Evolution of developmental neural networks." I used genetic algorithms to evolve growth rules for creating a neural network to control a simulated hexapod for locomotion and food finding. Also, for my neural networks class in my undergraduate degree, I used GAs to directly evolve connections for a fixed structure NN to learn an approximation of ball bouncing physics. Despite it working well, I got a low mark because I didn't use what the professor considered "a valid NN learning technique." :(    Embed Quote
