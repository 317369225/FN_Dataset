★How do you use genetic algorithms?
First you need a translation from a "DNA" (e.g. an array of ids) to a real result of your problem. The best case is a one to one relation. So every random DNA is equal to a solution and vice versa. Now you randomly create some DNA and evaluate their solution. The better the solution, the higher is the probability that this solution survives. Start eliminating regarding these probabilities (by ensuring that some results are kept). Then start mutating the solution (e.g. by swaping ids in the array or setting values from true to false or the other way around depending on your problem). Start crossing solution (mix up some solutions) with a clever algorithm to create new solutions. Again you have a set of solutions where you can randomly calculate survival probabilities by their quality. continue until you cannot find a better solution than the best solution so far for several "generations" of solutions. This solution is your heuristical result    Embed Quote
