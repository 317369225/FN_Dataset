★Do some CS students refuse to learn genetic algorithms for religious reasons?Seeing genetic computation in action as part of a CS programming assignment may cause them to believe in evolution and question their religion.
And here it is where it pops again the conflict between religion and science, and since I think we have all agreed already that science should not be censured by religion and that science has to be learned in schools, the student would have a choice: either to give up the science coarse or the school, or to give up her religion. Since the two subjects (evolution and religion) are quite contradictory and opposite in spite of all efforts both sides have tried to re-conciliate them, I think it is not morally correct for the student to ignore or try to balance the two beliefs: she has to make a choice! Also, I don't think it is professionally correct for the teacher to ignore the issue and admit the student to pass without resolving his/her dilemma: this will either allow a future professional to make harmful mistakes, or a religious person with wrong and dangerous beliefs, which may fail on his/her psychological stability and profile!
