★Do some CS students refuse to learn genetic algorithms for religious reasons?Seeing genetic computation in action as part of a CS programming assignment may cause them to believe in evolution and question their religion.
I've never seen any litigation on it. The kind of people who refuse to learn some aspects of science often do not go on to degrees like Computer Science. They are  involved in direct preaching or in extremely fundamentalist seminaries. Never underestimate the power of cognitive dissonance, people have held far more obvious diametrically opposed views at the same time.    Embed Quote
