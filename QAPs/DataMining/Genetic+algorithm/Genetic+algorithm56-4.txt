★How would you go about generating Jokes and Puns using Genetic Algorithms?As a final year project at the CS bachelor's degree level, if I decide to do something regarding Joke/Pun generation using GAs, what all do I need to know? Where do I start?
Great question in that it made me think but when the objective function varies from person to person (as in humour), evaluation cannot happen on a computer (with no algorithm) and that makes selection impossible. Recombination and mutation will only produce the results you get by random chance. Humour is probably within the reach of expert systems and machine-learning directed at finding semantically similar forms that are considered humorous. But my simplest answer as of now to this question is simply "I don't know".    Embed Quote
