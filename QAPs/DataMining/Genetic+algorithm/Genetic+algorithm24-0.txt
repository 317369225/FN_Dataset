★What is the longest running genetic algorithm based simulation?
That's a really interesting question although I think your comparison between Computational Genetic Algorithm and Nature Genetic Algorithm way of working isn't accurate enough. Very important thing that I think you missed is that most Computational Genetic Algorithm use case tries to optimize a process or in general a cost function. They designed to find the best solution for very specific question and they will so called converge to the answer after some generation. The big difference between Nature Genetic Algorithm usage and the mentioned one is: Nature doesn't define the exact goal for a problem. In fact, the cost function will evolve during the optimization process. For instance, one creature will evolve many times to survive in the shortage of water in specific environment. During the evolution process the goal will change to solve other arising problems like size problem, biological problem, and ... In other words, many new decision parameters will consider to be optimized.  In my opinion, this is the secret of nature that we couldn't achieve yet.    Embed Quote
