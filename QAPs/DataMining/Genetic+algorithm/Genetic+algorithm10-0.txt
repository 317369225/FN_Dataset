★Are there any sites for benchmarking genetic algorithms?Is there a site with a common API for testing the fitness of the output of genetic algorithms to compare them and submit your own?
No. If there were, genetic algorithms would be much more of a science than they are currently. There are a variety of different kinds of problems for asking different kinds of questions, mostly the often difficult to generalize from "how does variety X of GA compare against some other version(s) of GA on problem Y?" Examples of more specific problems - both of which were proposed to explore how and why GAs work and to better identify what kinds of problems they do or don't solve compared to each other and to more local search algorithms (see No free lunch in search and optimization)  - are Royal Road functions (Mitchell, Forrest, and Holland 1991) and Hierarchical If-and-only-if (Watson, Hornby & Pollack 1998).    Embed Quote
