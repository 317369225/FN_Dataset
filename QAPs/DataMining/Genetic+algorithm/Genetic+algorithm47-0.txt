★Should I choose genetic algorithms or neural networks for an optimization problem?I have an output value which dependent from 2 input variables. I don't know what is the relation. My task is to minimize output value .
Neural networks are not an optimisation method, but a supervised/unsupervised learning method. When used as a supervised learning method, neural networks use in combination with the gradient descent method which IS an optimisation method. This works by moving in small steps in the direction of the gradient (which in neural networks is computed using the backpropagation algorithm), which is the direction of fastest change of the function. Maybe this method could be helpful to solve your problem. Edit: I understand you are talking about classical feedforward networks. Attractor networks such as the Hopfield model can be used for optimisation (a well known example is their use to "solve" the travelling salesman problem).    Embed Quote
