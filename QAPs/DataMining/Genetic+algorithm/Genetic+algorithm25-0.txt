★How is genetic algorithm implemented for optimal offspring?
You choose parents randomly from the population but in such a way that the stronger parents (with a higher score) have a greater chance of getting selected. Then you exchange genes between the parents to generate the offspring. In certain cases you may mutate a particular gene in order to increase the "chaos" in the system so that it does not get stuck in a "local maximum" (a good but not the best solution).  You may also choose practices such as killing the weakest offspring, safeguarding the strongest, etc. This is how GAs work in general. While practices such as preferably selecting the stronger parents to mate and killing the weaker offsprings introduce order into the system - stabilising it and ensuring good solutions, factors like the amount of randomness involved in parent selection and the mutation rate introduce chaos in the system - widening the search area and ensuring that the system does not get stuck at one good solution but is always looking for the best. Your job is to modify these algorithm parameters in order to balance the order and chaos in the system so as to reach the optimal offspring.    Embed Quote
