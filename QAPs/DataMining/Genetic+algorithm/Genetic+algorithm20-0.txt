★How can one use genetic algorithms without infringing on any genetic algorithm patents?Also, is it possible to use genetic programming at all without infringing on patents?
Which patents are these? Getting a software patent is very difficult. I would be very surprised if there are any out there that would restrict your own ORIGINAL work.    Embed Quote
