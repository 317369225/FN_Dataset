★What are some real-world applications of genetic algorithms?Answers should point to specific usages, not potential ones.
I worked at a company called Optimax (bought by i2 which was bought by JDA). We optimized manufacturing schedules - both job shop and assembly line schedules that had a variety of constraints.  We actually used a combination of a genetic algorithm optimization engine and a constraint net. In my mind the constraint net was far more useful in that you could frame up complex business problems.  While the GA was useful, it was always difficult to explain to end users .    Embed Quote
