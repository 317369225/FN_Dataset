★Do some CS students refuse to learn genetic algorithms for religious reasons?Seeing genetic computation in action as part of a CS programming assignment may cause them to believe in evolution and question their religion.
While I am sure that it is possible, merely because of the connotations associated with *evolution*ary algorithms, I don't think there is a strongly defensible objection to genetic algorithms on religious grounds. Fundamentally, exploring the universe as-is is a process of discovery.  There is a system that already exists, and scientists are determined to understand how it works.  A person who refutes evolution in this context is arguing that selection pressures inside a population do not influence a long term form of the population. On the other hand, genetic algorithms create a closed system with well-defined rules for how the population changes over time.  I don't believe there is a serious argument that the guiding strategy behind genetic algorithms does not work.  GAs may be slow, inefficient, or just plain incorrect in some contexts, but I believe the concept behind it is generally held to be correct[1].  (A similar situation can be seen with mathematical induction and a particular proof; a given proof can be wildly long or complex, but that has no bearing on the validity of mathematical induction.) Even if there were irrefutable proof right now that life on earth does not evolve, that would not have any impact on the correctness or efficacy of genetic algorithms, simply because the systems are being investigated in once case but created in the other. [1] Having never played around with GAs as a theoretical construct, this may or may not be actually accurate.  While I would not be surprised if there is some crazy proof that GA strategy is correct, I also wouldn't be surprised if there isn't a clear mathematical formulation of the strategy that does not presume the conclusion.    Embed Quote
