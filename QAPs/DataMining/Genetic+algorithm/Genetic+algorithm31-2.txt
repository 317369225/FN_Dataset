★How can i use genetic algorithms to create a better Neural Network?
I can tell you what I did in one of my neural networks. 1. Imagine the structure of a neural net. (i.e. layout of the input layer, connection strengths, etc. After all, they are only variables.) 2. Now codify that into the DNA of the GA. 3. The GA trains to improve the ultimate fitness function (whatever you have designed for that to be). In this approach, there is no "back-prop," and there is no transfer function. All adjustments to the connections are made after the entire pass is complete. BTW, the GA must not be a "classifier" GA but rather must be what I call, "King-of-the-hill," where each element of the GA is an entire string. Goldberg (1989) referred to this as the "LS-1" approach. (Poker-playing GA)    Embed Quote
