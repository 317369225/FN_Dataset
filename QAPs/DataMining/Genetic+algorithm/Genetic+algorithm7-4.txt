★What are some real-world applications of genetic algorithms?Answers should point to specific usages, not potential ones.
I work with a company called Affinnova that uses GA to optimize marketing and product design.  more on www.affinnova.com, but essentially we help marketers determine the absolute best combination of attributes such as name, color, copy, size, etc.  Often marketers will have a number of options for each attribute, implying millions of potential combinations, and we use GA to determine the best.  In real-world usage, this dramatically improves the reception and/or sales of their products.    Embed Quote
