★What are some real-world applications of genetic algorithms?Answers should point to specific usages, not potential ones.
I have used genetic algorithms (GA) on an aircraft wing design problem to improve the ratio of lift to drag for a complex wing. In cases like this, where the problem is multidisciplinary, the fitness functions for the GA can be customized depending on the specific requirements of the design at hand. This is often required in competitive product development scenarios. GAs are being increasingly used in financial time series analysis as well. Similar methods like Particle Swarm Optimization are also gaining ground.    Embed Quote
