★What are the differences between Genetic Algorithm and other heuristic algorithms?
Heuristics are methods to find approximate solutions to problems where other "classic" algorithms fail (to find an exact solution). They include some intuitive or intelligent guesswork to move towards our solution. Genetic Algorithms are a search heuristic. It is based on darwin's natural selection theory. Consider a problem and all possible candidates for solution, called chromosomes (these possible solutions make up the population). Now as in real world, the fittest organisms have a better chance to reproduce and generate offsprings, probability of the selection of chromosomes for overlapping (reproduction) is proportional to their "fitness", ie some measure of closeness to final solution. Again as in real world, the offspring tend to mutate also. In this way, we gradually move towards the real solution(s) as the "fitness" of chromosomes increase!    Embed Quote
