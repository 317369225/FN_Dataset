★How can I optimize Apache Solr boost factors using genetic algorithms?
I haven't done that personally but your question reminded me of this blog post: Using genetic algorithms to optimize Apache Solr boost factors. There is another series of blog posts that are relevant here: Evolving Search Relevancy Part 1 - An Optimization Problem Evolving Search Relevancy Part 2 - Genetic Algorithm Overview Evolving Search Relevancy Part 3 - Creating a Genetic Representation of Search Parameters Evolving Search Relevancy Part 4 - Calculating Relevancy and Deriving a Fitness Function JiM Strassburg, the author of the 4 part series above is speaking on the same topic at Lucene/Solr Revolution Conference 2014 at Washington D.C. His session is titled "Evolving Search Relevancy" I think this is an interesting area which hasn't seen many efforts. Please do keep us posted on your experiments.    Embed Quote
