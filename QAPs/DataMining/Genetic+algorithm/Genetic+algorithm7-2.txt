★What are some real-world applications of genetic algorithms?Answers should point to specific usages, not potential ones.
I did some doctoral research on optimizing container terminal operations using GAs. Specifically, for imports containers need to be taken of the ship by wharf-side cranes, moved to a holding area by different equipment, than later retrieved for dispatch onto a train/truck. Stacking them inefficiently leads to lots of unnecessary double handling, and the large number of containers/slots involved means algorithms that guarantee optimal solutions would be challenged by the high dimensionality of the problem. The chap who sat next to me in the PhD room was using GAs to solve single-line train scheduling problems, which are known to be NP-Hard.    Embed Quote
