★Does the success of genetic algorithms "prove" that natural selection and evolution occur?Can it be used as strong empirical evidence against opponents of evolution?
Short answer, no. Long answer, they support it. Genetic algorithms are inspired in evolution, and their success shows that a mechanism that introduces variability and one that exert selective pressure are enough to develop something. This supports the idea of evolution in the sense that it shows that evolution is possible. However, it says nothing about what happens in biology. In short, it says evolution "can" happen, but it doesn't mean it "did" happen.    Embed Quote
