★What are some practical applications of genetic algorithms?
This is copied from my answer to What are some real-world applications of genetic algorithms? I use genetic algorithms for dynamic animation of 3D characters (sorry, our work is not public yet), but this is not a new idea. More specifically, I use them to "teach" creatures and humanoids how to walk and react to obstacles (but really, they are "learning" on their own). By having them run through obstacle courses, the best algorithms/parameter sets can be easily benchmarked. Did I mention that the learning process is hilarious?    Embed Quote
