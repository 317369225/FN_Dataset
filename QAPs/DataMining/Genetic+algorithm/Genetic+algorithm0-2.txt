★What is a genetic algorithm?
A genetic algorithm is an evolutionary, iterative algorithm in which you have an initial state and a target state. The initial state can be called as Parents. Now, we apply different techniques (like cross-over, mutation and more) on the initial state, to generate child states which are better than the parents in terms of what is your target. Now after the child state is generated we replace the parents with their children, repeat the same process. There may be a chance you're algorithm might not reach the target, so you would like to add a iteration limit.  P.S. This is pretty much a gist, I would recommend you to read more, for I am not at all an expert on this.    Embed Quote
