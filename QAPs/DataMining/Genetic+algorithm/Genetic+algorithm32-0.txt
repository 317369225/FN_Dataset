★Does the success of genetic algorithms "prove" that natural selection and evolution occur?Can it be used as strong empirical evidence against opponents of evolution?
Showing that a process works in principle, does strengthen the case, but does not prove that it occurs in nature. For that matter, genetic algorithms are somewhat lacking in the sense that they are not really good at creating efficient complex entities, as opposed to what evolution creates.  More generally, there is nothing that 'proves' evolution, but it is by far the best qualitative description one can use to describe the process that drove life as we know today.    Embed Quote
