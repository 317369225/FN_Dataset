★What's the convergence criteria of genetic algorithm?
A genetic algorithm is usually said to converge when there is no significant improvement in the values of fitness of the population from one generation to the next. Examples of stopping criteria are generally, time limits placed on the GA run, generation limits, or if the algorithms finds a suitably low fitness individual, lower than a specified fitness threshold ( in case we are minimizing fitness ). I think, there is no defined difference between stopping criteria and convergence criteria, the terms can be used interchangeably. Verifying that a GA has converged at a global optima for a NP hard problem is impossible, unless you have a test data set for which the best solution is already known. The best you can do, is try out multiple runs of the GA, with different values of Mutation, Crossover probabilities, try out different fitness functions, crossover operators, and many many variants of simple GA such as Elitism, Multi-Objective GA's etc.    Embed Quote
