★What are some examples of commercially successful genetic algorithms?
There are LOTS. I'll focus on Evolutionary Algorithms in general, since the difference between Genetic Algorithms and other forms of EAs is not important. I worked for David Fogel, co-founder of Natural Selection Inc. [1]. At NSI, they use EAs for a variety of commercial applications, including: Drug creation. I'm not a Bioinformatics expert, but I believe the general idea is that designing a drug to bind to a specific protein is a complicated 3D folding process that can be treated as a multi-dimensional search problem. Industrial optimization. Imagine you have a big piece of material and you need to create shirts out of it. There are a large number of ways to cut the material, each producing a certain amount of wasted material. Minimizing the wasted material can be treated as a fitness function in an EA. Stock trading. I personally worked with David at Lincoln Vale [2] as part of the Adaptive Strategies fund, and later at Natural Selection Financial [3]. We used EA-based algorithms that were able to constantly evolve their parameters in order to quickly adapt to changing market conditions. Games. The Blondie24 game [4] was a great example of using EAs to learn Checkers (board game) strategies, though I'm not totally sure if I'd consider it commercially successful. A more recent example is Galactic Arms Race [5], which is publicly available on Steam and has won indie game awards. GAR uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve weapons. The list goes on and on, but those are the applications that I'm familiar with.
