★Do some CS students refuse to learn genetic algorithms for religious reasons?Seeing genetic computation in action as part of a CS programming assignment may cause them to believe in evolution and question their religion.
Although I suppose there are some fundamentalists Christians among the CS students (or hackers, because I don't assume that only students do study...), coding well and learning in that field needs a lot of curiosity, chich fundamentalists Christians wouldn't have much in reserve, or else they would be average people, so the issue would not matter that high.    Embed Quote
