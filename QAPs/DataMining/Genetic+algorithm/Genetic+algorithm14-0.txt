★Can a genetic algorithm evolve a neural net algorithm?
Neuroevolution, or neuro-evolution, is a form of machine learning that uses evolutionary algorithms to train artificial neural networks. You can check out the Wikipedia entry for further details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neu... Open source implementations I'm aware of: HyperNEAT JavaSANE NEAT (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) Sferes 2 To my knowledge, HyperNEAT and NEAT are the most used. I used Sferes 2 for the report The medial Reticular Formation (mRF): a neural substrate for action selection? An evaluation via evolutionary computation. [ENG/FR].  The Chapter 2 - Theoretical material explains how to evolve a neural net.    Embed Quote
