★Do some CS students refuse to learn genetic algorithms for religious reasons?Seeing genetic computation in action as part of a CS programming assignment may cause them to believe in evolution and question their religion.
Do religious folks actually dispute microevolution?  Supposing that evolution on a small scale exists is not controversial.  Natural selection exists and causes progeny to adapt to selective pressures.  We see it synthetically with dog breeders every day.  One does not have to dispense with the theory that a higher power could have directed macroevolution or that the teleological argument is a reasonable explanation for how life itself came to be.  Genetic algorithms operate on much simpler systems than complex biological life.  Genetic algorithms are therefore not controversial even to a Biblical literalist who can reason about things.  I hope so anyway.    Embed Quote
