★How can I train moving agents through genetic algorithms?
"But how can you use parameters to describe motion?" One thing that is very important to understand, is that you don't describe motion. The physics engine takes care of that. All you need to describe is a motor controller. It can be closed-loop, that is, taking information from the environment through sensors, or open loop, with no sensor feedback. How about this: define your body normally, with rigid bodies, connected with hinge and ball joints, and whatever spring muscle configuration you want. Then control all your muscles with sine waves of the same frequency, but each one can have variable phase and amplitude. So your genome is a simple array of N*2 floats (in the range o to 1), where N is the number of muscles. So the extension of spring (i) at time t is: ei(t) = sin( t * frequency + phase ) * amplitude. Where: frequency = fixed value phase = genome[i*2+0] * 2 * pi amplitude = genome[i*2+1] * maximum_spring_extension Does that make sense? Anyway, something like that. You will soon be able to evolve simple locomotion. Then expand your project with a more sophisticated muscle encoding, and perhaps some touch sensors in the feet and a tilt/altitude sensor in the head that can somehow influence the various muscle parameters.    Embed Quote
