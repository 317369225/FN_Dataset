★Does the success of genetic algorithms "prove" that natural selection and evolution occur?Can it be used as strong empirical evidence against opponents of evolution?
Genetic algorithms are not particularly successful -- in most applications, there are much more effective specialized algorithms. They optimize configurations for survival with respect to crossovers and mutations, and this overlooks rare/brittle configurations. You can replicate this effect with a fairly simple program for an appropriately chosen optimization function (and especially constraints). So, if you believe in survival of the fittest, genetic algorithms should not be selected -- they are not the fittest :) The idea to do something similar to the natural evolution is very appealing, but genetic algorithms do not model many observable phenomena in natural evolution - the connection is very superficial. Even if genetic algorithms were successful and if they represented natural evolution well, that alone would not be a very strong argument that natural evolution actually happened -- only that it could happen. On the other hand, if you ask which model has a greater predictive power, I am not aware of any competition to natural evolution in this category.    Embed Quote
