★Where can I find simple genetic algorithms sample code?I'm starting with all this Genetic Algorithms stuff, but I don't know where should I begin. I have been reading some literature but I would like to see some sample codes.
The code won't be the problem in GA. The SGA (simple genetic algorithm) is as simple as follows: generate initial population while (termination criterion)  do     evaluate population     select parents     reproduce using genetic operators     replace population with offspring end The difficult part will be the representation and your fitness function. Also, some decisions about the reproduction of the population will affect your algorithm. A good book would be http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-...    Embed Quote
