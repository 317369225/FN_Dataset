What are the critical programming skills to have before beginning to learn machine learning & data mining?
Python is a perfectly fine language for data mining. I'd say don't bother with sed and awk unless all you're going to be doing is parsing log files. If you're going to be dealing with large quantities of data I'd suggest learning some fundamentals of Computer Science, such as complexity of algorithms. You don't want to write a naive program that takes hours to do what should take seconds. Also, you may want to become familiar with tools such the Map/Reduce framework, and visualization utilities/libraries.    Embed Quote
