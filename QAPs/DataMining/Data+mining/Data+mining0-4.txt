★What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?
A list of algorithms Mahout developers discuss the most based on Apache Mahout mailing lists. http://bickson.blogspot.com/2011... Note: Some of these may appear more frequently because of the specifics of Mahout project or implementation constraints and may not be generally applicable (thanks to Fred Benenson for correction) For an academic review see Wu et al., Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining, 2008: www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/algorithms/10Algorithms-08.pdf KDnuggets poll "Which methods/algorithms did you use for data analysis in 2011?"
