How do I learn data mining?
Let me first appreciate your question. There were plenty of ways to learn data mining. i will post them in a order according to  my knowledge. 1) Primary thing is to select and learn most suitable language for data mining. ex: python, R. I prefer python. 2)Learning some packages like numpy,pandas,matplotlib,scikit-learn. 3) Just follow any reference book for data mining. I prefer Data mining concepts and techniques by Jiawei han and micheline kamber This is very good book and , at the end of reading this book you will get some basic idea about the top most algorithms used in data mining and you will be in position to decide an algorithm just on seeing the problem. 4) Just learning the algorithm will never make you perfect person in data mining field you have to apply them for some data sets. you can get data sets from internet itself. 5) If you face any problem while applying your algorithm to data sets. Just go to A Programmer's Guide to Data Mining  here you can find some very good example of how to apply data mining algorithms to data sets and with some real world  applications. I promise you if your an  really  datamining aspirant you will enjoy A Programmer's Guide to Data Mining . 6) Once you completed this now you can search for data sets and you can apply your algorithms. 7) You can spent some time on  coursera.org. where you will find some coursers belongs to data mining. (you will get videos and problem to practice)    8) On a final note i can say that quora + google will give you lots of stuff related to data mining. 9) All the best ,have a blast and have fun play with data mining.
