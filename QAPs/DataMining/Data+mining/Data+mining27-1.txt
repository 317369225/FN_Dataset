Which statistical tool is best for data mining?
R and Python have both been mentioned as really powerful tools for data analysis, but in terms of just retrieving large sets of data, Kimono Labs (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds) can prove really useful. With Kimono you can scrape almost any website and get the data in JSON or CSV. You can even set your crawl on a schedule so that you’re getting the data up to date, and Kimono will host your data for you. It’s incredibly easy to use and doesn’t require any coding, so it takes out the hardest part of data collection. Then you can bring in R or Python to do advanced analysis on your Kimono data. Take a look at how this user got beer review data with Kimono and then analyzed the data to find top descriptors: Beer Analytics: Review of Heady Topper Descriptors | Scott Janish and how this user charted NBA three-point leaders: Check out the performance of NBA 3 point leaders... I have to admit that I work for Kimono, but I’m consistently impressed with how a free product can be so powerful and easy to use.    Embed Quote
