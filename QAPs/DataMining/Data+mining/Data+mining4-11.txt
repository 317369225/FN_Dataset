★What is the future of data analysis?
I believe more tools like Numenta , BigML , Quid , recordedfuture will come to the marketplace and the key skill , for people working in the business domain, will be applying judgement on top of the models/visualizations created by the tools. Additionally , at the scientific research end, I do believe that the next frontiers in Data Analysis will be via cognitive science and understanding the workings of the Brain. Things like what  Ray Kurzweil , Numenta , Vicarious systems are working on  are probably the future of data analysis    Embed Quote
