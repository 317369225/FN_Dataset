★What is the future of data analysis?
This is an older question but I figured i'd throw in my two cents. In short, I'd argue that the future of data analysis is democratization. What I mean by that is that analysis tools have generally become more democratized as the complexities of query construction are more frequently obscured away from users in favor of easy-to-use UI's (think Palantir, Statwing, Fivetran). I believe that this trend will continue to empower individuals to spend more time distilling insights as opposed to aggregating, cleansing and generally preparing the data they need.    Embed Quote
