What techniques are useful for data mining financial time series?
This was a topic I was interested in some time ago, while doing ML research in academia (I dropped out of a CS PhD program earlier this year). After speaking with folks in the finance research industry, I learned that the majority of techniques actually are just variants of linear regression. Though a number of novel approaches have been attempted they, frustratingly enough, don't do much better than normal linear regression. This led me to believe that, instead of trying more methods to analyze the time-series data, it might be more effective to try and combine the other sources of data that we may have access to. For instance, there has been separate research on utilizing NLP methods to mine financial data from text such as breaking-news feeds, with a view to predicting the effect on price movements. A prime example of this is AzFinText (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZF...). You might be better served by trying to find a method that effectively combines such multiple, heterogeneous sources of data rather than going after a perfect method for any one data source. I had a paper on such an attempt, though applied to gene data, at NIPS last year: http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/d...    Embed Quote
