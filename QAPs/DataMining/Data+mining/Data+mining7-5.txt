What are the best Python 2.7 modules for data mining?
I would definitely +1 many of the items suggested here -- especially pandas, NLTK, and IPython and foundational tools. However, more specifically, I'd recommend IPython Notebook because it's so useful for intermingling your notes/thoughts with code in a really friendly format. To a seasoned programmer, it may seem like a superficial difference, but for data scientists who aren't seasoned programmers, the IPython Notebook UX makes a big difference since it allows you to work in the browser without dropping into a terminal. One of the pain points with some of these tools (mainly the ones that require compilation of low level C code) is that it can be a hassle for someone without some experience working with compilers, packages, etc. To that end, I'd also highly encourage people to think more about packaging tools like these in a portable development environment. Vagrant is great for this, because you can use different VM providers (Virtualbox, EC2, Docker, etc.) To that end, I've put together a fairly comprehensive collection of IPython Notebooks that may be useful for anyone interested in mining popular social websites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, and even GitHub (because it can rightfully be interpreted as an interest graph.) All of the notebooks are packaged in a friendly Vagrant-powered virtual machine (which makes it easy to get up and running), and the feedback so far has been pretty terrific. (It takes almost all of the pain away in setting up that dev environment with all of these tools.) I'd invite you to check them out, adapt the Vagrant-based environment to your own needs, contribute in any way you'd like, and I especially welcome comments/suggestions/support requests. You can view "read-only" versions of the notebooks from the main GitHub repo page at Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition    Embed Quote
