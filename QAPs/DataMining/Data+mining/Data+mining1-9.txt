★How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people?
Data mining and machine learning are vast and complex topics that are better explained through examples and concrete applications. Of which one of the most famous is the discovered association between diapers and beers in retail. This was done via what is called association mining and consists in counting how often certain products are purchased together (the support) and how likely (the confidence) a product will be purchased given that one or more products associated with this one were purchased. This helps retail stores optimize the placement of their products. Using this technique it was discovered that people who buy diapers are very likely to buy beer :).    Embed Quote
