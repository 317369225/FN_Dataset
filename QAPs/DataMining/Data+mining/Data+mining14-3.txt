How do I learn data mining in one month?
Assuming you have a pretty good math/stat background, a great place to learn about data mining and machine learning is www.videolectures.net.  A quick search will give you both intro lectures as well as more advanced discussions on current research.  A good first pass would be to look at Iain Murray's intro to machine learning http://videolectures.net/bootcam... .  Super accessible and covers key insights. If you are struggling with this lecture you might want to revisit linear algebra first. Another good source is Andy Ng's machine learning course that you can view at http://videolectures.net/andrew_ng/    Embed Quote
