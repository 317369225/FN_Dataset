★How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people?
You could start with one of the simplest examples of machine learning - the "line of best fit". http://commons.wikimedia.org/wik... Many other machine learning algorithms are more advanced versions of this. For example they can work with millions of variables instead of two, they may create multi-dimensional "hyperplanes" instead of simple lines, they may use all kinds of clever transformations to make the data more suitable for processing, etc..    Embed Quote Updated 29 Dec, 2012. 727 views.
