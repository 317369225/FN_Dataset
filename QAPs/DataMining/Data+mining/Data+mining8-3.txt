What is a good book on machine learning / data mining to give to a layman?
Machine Learning, An Algorithmic Perspective - Stephen Marsland The book is short and sweet. It doesn't go into depth about anything but gives a beginner a perfect feel of what the subject is about. The book contains code examples (in Python - an a short appendix dedicated to python), examples based on real datasets and really intuitive illustrations. The authors' webpage contains working code too. http://www-ist.massey.ac.nz/smar...    Embed Quote
