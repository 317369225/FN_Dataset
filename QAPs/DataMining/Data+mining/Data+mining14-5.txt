How do I learn data mining in one month?
I would have to question why you're asking this question. If you're looking to add a bullet to your resume there are some excellent answers here. If you have a specific problem to address, such as you're trying to program a function to answer a specific question, I think you can approach this from a much more specific direction. The question you're asking is very important, you need to know exactly what it is. "I need to know how many sales are predicted for the next 6 months?", or "What product is the customer likely to purchase next?" If you have a well-defined use case like this you can maximize your directed learning time and avoid learning a whole bunch of stuff that isn't necessarily relevant to the problem at hand. Once you know the question you should find out which data mining algorithms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dat...) are applicable to that question and then study those specifically (Google is your friend here, otherwise you could ask on Quora or something). You can get into the statistical background on them if you need to know, but at the very least you can find out what types of inputs and outputs you need to answer your question. This will give you enough direction to implement the data mining algorithm in your application provided you're using a library like Mahout (http://mahout.apache.org/) or something and not trying to code it yourself.    Embed Quote
