How do I learn data mining in one month?
As others have already mentioned, R is a great tool for working on datasets and learning data mining methods. One really great resource for getting data from the web is Kimono (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds). You can make APIs out of most websites incredibly easily, so this is perfect for data analysis in R, especially if you’re just getting started and need an easy way to get large sets of data. You can even set your APIs to crawl on a schedule, so that you are getting the most up-to-date data from the sites you are scraping. People use Kimono to perform data analysis on all kinds of different topics. It’s pretty powerful tool.

Good luck in your data mining studies!    Embed Quote
