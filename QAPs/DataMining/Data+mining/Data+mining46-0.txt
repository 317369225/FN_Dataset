Does data mining job require intensive programming skills?
Trouble is, this can vary widely from job to job. Ask 10 people what a "data scientist" does, and you will get 11 different answers. There's a general consensus that it's a mix of statistics, programming, and even design (for visualization). But the proportion of those elements, or which aspects of them are important, can be completely different from job to job. Personally, I do a pretty significant amount of software engineering these days, in order to develop my company's data infrastructure, which has been lacking. Many other data scientists actually don't work with "Big Data" (whatever that means) at all, and do a lot of exploratory data analysis with a small stack of libraries, just working with raw csv or json data. In python for example, the pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib/bokeh libraries encompass pretty much everything a data scientist needs, as long as the data isn't too big. Others may do a lot of work on well-developed in-house frameworks, or have lots of developer support, and do very little actual programming at all. This may be the case for larger, data-heavy Silicon Valley companies. For someone still on their educational path, I'd say you don't need really "expert" programming skills, but the better you are, the larger your job market will be.    Embed Quote
