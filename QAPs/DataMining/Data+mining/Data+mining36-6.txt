What is the best software to implement machine learning/large scale data mining algorithms?
As Muchenxuan Tong mentioned , Weka,Matlab and R are surely great tools , but recently shifting to Python for my projects and some know-how of ML and Big Data I personally feel , the Python community for AI based algorithm development is emerging at a rapid rate . I suppose using Python invoking its various packages can solve quite a lot of work and you can surely contribute , and make it a better ML developer ecosystem. You can also easily tweak into algorithms ( which is possible with extended libraries by Weka(Java) ).    Embed Quote
