Which statistical tool is best for data mining?
So I am really biased, because I work on this project, but I think there is evidence to support my claim, and I am also intimately familiar with the drawbacks ... so, I say SAS Enterprise Miner. --- In support of my argument I present the following summaries from recent independent industry analyst reports. 2013 Forrester Wave: 2014 Gartner Magic Quadrant: Also, the traditional difference between SAS and the other software you mention - which I think generally continues to be true - is that SAS holds data on disk until it is needed in-memory, so it tends to scale better for the larger data sets common in the data mining field. --- The drawbacks are : - You basically have to access this software through a school or company. I don't think many - if any - private individuals license this software. (It is expensive.) - It is very powerful, but very complex. The learning curve is quite steep. --- There is a free version of SAS that comes with a lot of free educational materials, but it does not contain all of the data mining and machine learning functionality that is available in the Enterprise Miner package: Free Statistical Software, SAS University Edition (This free software does contain procedures for logistic regression, PCA, clustering, and other data mining staples.) --- I think RapidMiner is another option you should check out if you need free software.    Embed Quote
