How do I learn data mining?
Learn data mining for free with Harvard's Data Science Course, CS109. This course was developed by Joe Blitzstein and Hanspeter Pfister in Fall of 2013 and will continue in Fall of 2014. While this is a "data science" course, I still consider this "data mining" because of the valuable practice in extracting and manipulating data, in addition to creating some common data mining algorithms like recommendation engines or sentiment analysis. Python intro, Numpy intro, Matplotlib intro (Homework 0) (solutions) Web scraping, data aggregation, plotting, forecasting, model evaluation (Homework 1) (solutions) Data manipulation, predictions, evaluations (Homework 2) (solutions) Sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, model calibration (Homework 3) (solutions) Recommendation engine, mapreduce (Homework 4) (solutions) Network analysis and visualization (Homework 5) (solutions) If you want even more - check out the labs! Lab 2: Web Scraping Lab 3: EDA, Pandas, Matplotlib Lab 4: Scikit-Learn, Regression, PCA Lab 5: Bias, Variance, Cross-Validation Lab 6: Bayes, Linear Regression, and Metropolis Sampling Lab 7: Gibbs Sampling Lab 8: MapReduce Lab 9: Networks Lab 10: Support Vector Machines Source - cs109/content And finally - check out the recorded lectures: Page on harvard.edu and slides: https://drive.google.com/folderv...    Embed Quote Updated 1 Apr. 33,797 views.
