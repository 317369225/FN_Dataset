★What are examples of data mining and analysis of succesful Kickstarter projects?
Not sure if these will answer all of your questions, but there is quite a bit of analysis out there. We share a lot of data, and many project creators have done great jobs analyzing their own experiences in a data-driven way. Some highlights: We just announced that one million people have backed a Kickstarter project, and that collectively they have pledged over $100 million. Includes info on pledge distribution and much more http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/... The Happy Birthday Kickstarter post features a ton of data from Kickstarter's first two years, including pledges by category and month, and a deep look into the all or nothing funding model (it works!) http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/... Our post on why we shortened the max project length from 90 days to 60 days also includes a fair amount of analysis: http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/... Our post on Trends in Pricing and Duration has a ton of info. http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/... In terms of analysis done by others, some standouts include: Craig Mod's Art Space Tokyo post-mortem is a must-read. http://craigmod.com/journal/kick... This analysis from comics project reMIND has a lot of data. http://www.remindblog.com/2010/1... The Glif guys did a thorough recap of how their project's enormous success came to be. http://www.therussiansusedapenci... And finally it's incredibly long, but Purple Pawn's survey of how game projects (successful and not) structured their project is as good as it gets. I learned *a ton* from reading this recap. http://www.purplepawn.com/2011/0... I'm forgetting just as many as I'm remembering, so hopefully this list will grow. But we believe very strongly in learning from the experiences of others. Anyone considering launching a project on Kickstarter would be wise to read through these pieces.    Embed Quote Updated 18 Jul, 2012. 8,698 views.
