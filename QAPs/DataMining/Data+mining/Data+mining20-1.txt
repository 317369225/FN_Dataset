What are the best online masters programs in data mining?
What are your opinions on the Data Analytics program online at Home | Statistics.com. I see that its one of the many programs you mentioned, it seems to be the cheapest option for a full certification program that requires 14 courses which seems like a full masters courseload to me. Any opinions?    Embed Quote
