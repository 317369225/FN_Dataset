★How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people?
Let's say the Machine is a ten month old baby and you are trying hard to teach him what is an apple and what is an pear. Whenever you find an apple you show it to him and say "apple" (he says "blah"); whenever you find a pear you hold it in front of him and say "pear" (he says "blah"). To develop the cognitive ability of our genius baby, we diligent parent continue to show him hundreds and thousands of apples and pears over time, and one day magic happen, our Machine baby says "apple" when he sees an apple. He will continue to make mistakes once in a while -- when a new apple does not look like traditional ones he has seen before -- but less and less he will go wrong. After some time, the Machine baby will know enough characters of apple to even recognize aged apples or apple slices. We say that he has been trained, or learned, now he can do stuff! Data Mining is like real mining but with data -- you know you are looking for something, like gemstone with gold, or some customer characteristics (e.g., attractive woman) that is particular valuable to you, but you don't exactly know what they are or where they are located. So with a goal in mind, you comb through mountains of data equipped with tools like statistical models or other advanced algorithms, in the hope of finding the great value.    Embed Quote
