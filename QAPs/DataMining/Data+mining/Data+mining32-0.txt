How to fit a model in Data Mining?
Time series techniques are probably your best bet here.  As Rich Weisberger said, you'll want to transform the data to make it stationary (if necessary), and your best best is taking first differences.  To say that data is "strictly" stationary means that it should have a constant mean and a constant variance, however evaluating whether the variance of an entire series remains constant over time can be difficult in practice.  It is often easier to check for what is called "weak stationary" data by evaluating autocorrelation.  Most time-series methods will still work fine if the data can be shown to be weakly stationary, and demonstrating weak stationarity is easier than demonstrating strict. The distinctions here are not necessarily trivial/semantic - Autocorrelation and Stationarity (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sta...)  are extremely important concepts to understand when working with time-series data.  If you're looking to expand your knowledge of time-series techniques, these two subject are the best place to start, as they represent the underpinning of most of what you'll read in the subject. If your time-series can be shown to be weakly stationary, you can apply ARMA, ARIMA, ARCH, and other time-series techniques to it without too much hassle - most software (SAS, SPSS, R) has procedures and/or packages that can help you fit these types of models to your data.  And while this autocorrelation concept is less transparent than the idea of a constant variance, both indicate stationary data in most cases, and knowing something about how to evaluate the autocorrelation of a series can be instrumental in selecting an appropriate model for your data.    Embed Quote
