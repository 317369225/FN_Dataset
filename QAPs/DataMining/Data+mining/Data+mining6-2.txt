★What are examples of data mining and analysis of succesful Kickstarter projects?
Actually, I am doing this as we speak (contacted over 100 successful projects on Kickstarter). Also, I wrote already a long article (10 pages) which is a film specific project and which may be published on a known movie related website. When it's published I will let you know here. After gathering answers from those contacted I will write another article about what makes a project successful on Kickstarter (with examples). UPDATE I wrote a 10 pages article about running a sucessful Kickstarter campaign, but it's for filmmaking. Some tips applies to other kind of projects to. See there the article (download the PDF too): http://www.mirceagoia.com/2012/0...    Embed Quote Updated 8 Sep, 2012. 1,058 views.
