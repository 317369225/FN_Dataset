How ethical are Rapleaf's data mining techniques?
Many, many people in the adtech industry feel that Rapleaf stepped over the line by making the data they collect so easily personally identifiable.  While your typical behavioural/social/re targeting can be described in a way that the layperson feels reasonably comfortable that their privacy is not being violated, the same can not be said for Rapleaf.  Even though their data is laughably general unless the targeted user plays games on FB, the idea that it can be linked to your offline life is alarming to many.  Saying that it's okay to violate someone's privacy because they didn't proactively prevent you is a losing argument (in an analogous offline situation you will quickly be likened to a peeping-tom.) I'm in the industry (that's why this is anonymous), so I'm not going to pretend I have the moral standing to judge them, but I worry that if anything is going to bring the wrath of the FTC down upon the industry, it's going to be Rapleaf.    Embed Quote
