What are the most useful data mining / analysis / science tools?
I use Apache Mahout (http://mahout.apache.org) and Myrrix (http://myrrix.com), but then I would because I'm involved with these. Whether it is useful depends on what you're doing. Many things you've listed are languages or environments (R, Matlab, Octave). Those are more for prototyping ML algorithms on your "workbench" and not any part of a production system's operation. I suppose I put NumPy in the same bucket; it's more of a library, sure, but for speed I'm not sure I'd base a production ML system on something in Python. For prototyping, for non-critical stuff -- sure, if you're a Python person. Mongo has nothing to do with ML per se, nor does Redis, HDFS, NoSQL DBs. Hadoop doesn't either but if you're trying to do ML on Hadoop (or, Java in general) I think Mahout is kind of the main starting point for any such adventures right now. If that's you -- yes, recommend Mahout, and by extension Myrrix. Otherwise, I don't think they'd be useful.    Embed Quote
