What are the best graduate schools/programs for those who are interested in data mining/data science?
At Columbia, "data sciences" is an agglomeration including but not limited to stats and cs.  Lee Bollinger announced this week funding for a "Columbia University Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering" . This is in direct response to mayor Bloomberg's request for a larger engineering academic infrastructure in New York and the subsequent proposals by Stamford and Cornell to build satellite campuses on Randall's Island of all places. That being what it is, it's worth noting that the Machine Learning group at CU though under the radar  is and has been extremely successful in gathering funding for startups in this area (esp for geospatial algorithms) . If your going for stats, that dept has courses in data mining , one of which I am taking this semester. Our professor was on the team that won the Netflix prize for improving their reccomender system a couple of years back.    Embed Quote
