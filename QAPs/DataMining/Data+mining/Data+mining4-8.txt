★What is the future of data analysis?
Litigation.  For instance, I can see the (potential) rational actions taken by an insurance company, medical organization, corporation or the government based on valid data sets/patterns simultaneously violating discrimination and civil rights laws.  I believe that risk analysis is a pillar of statistics and as the field becomes increasingly cross-disciplinary there will be a "lawless" decade before certain issues are sorted out.    Embed Quote
