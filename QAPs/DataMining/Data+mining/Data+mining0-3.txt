★What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?
PCA/matrix factorization/SVD/single-layer sparse autoencoders definitely belong in the top 10 (as one item).  These are all closely related and are useful for representing pairs of items, like user/product (reviews or recommendations), lawmaker/bill (votes), word/document (topic models), pixel/filter (image filters), documents/documents (PageRank), and many other things.  PCA and SVD are also built into any standard statistical computing software, so they're easy to apply. As Jeff and Marianna suggest, regression (linear, ridge, lasso, and logistic) belongs in the top ten.  Regression can be applied in many settings and often serves as an excellent baseline algorithm, especially with well-engineered features. If I were to organize a book or teach a class, I'd collapse many of the classification algorithms (AdaBoost, SVMs, C4.5, Naive Bayes) together since they're different ways of solving similar problems.  This contrasts with things like PCA and K-means, which accomplish orthogonal goals and deserve their own bullets.  (N.B. AdaBoost, SVMs, and decision trees still have lots of pedagogical value in the theory behind them, and each is still worth knowing).    Embed Quote Updated 30 Dec, 2012. 8,493 views.
