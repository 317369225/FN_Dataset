How ethical are Rapleaf's data mining techniques?
Rapleaf appears to take a strong stance on Privacy https://www.rapleaf.com/privacy and their technology is compliant with the NIA and the IAB. They have the easiest opt-out process of any data company I have experienced and they seem to convey a strong mission of wanting to make a personalized, better world for every person, not infringe on your rights as an individual. While the business does walk a fine line of privacy, choice, and "opt-in"--Adam speaks to a good point regarding lack of awareness and the wide array of information accessible from the internet.    Embed Quote
