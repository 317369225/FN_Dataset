Which statistical tool is best for data mining?
First off, I work for IBM - so I primarily work with SPSS these days.  Your question raises a couple points.  SPSS Statistics comes with a neural net module, which gives you access to all the algorithms which are in SPSS Modeler.  It doesn't have Modeler's UI/UX, but SPSS Stats can do everything that Modeler and SAS can. If you are already used to SPSS Stats, using the neural networking module would likely be the easiest route for you. The other point is that datamining a distributed file system (Hadoop) is different that mining a relational or columnar database.  You really have to understand your 'big data' before you start to mine it.  Big data in quite often sparse, you need to focus on what not to analyze.  If you don't you will choke the processing.  SAS and SPSS modeler both have a secondary server which is only used in Hadoop environments. Last point - don't be a hero.  If you are dealing with big data pick a tool like IBM BigInsights or Pivotal HD.    Embed Quote
