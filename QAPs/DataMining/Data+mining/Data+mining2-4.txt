How do I learn data mining?
It's a little surprising to see how few people have commented or answered on this question. I accidentally stumbled across it when getting ready to post a similar one. I put together a short list of some of my favorite books on data science (I know, not exactly the same as data mining, but still relevant) at http://amzn.to/goijMw that includes many of the titles on my shelf that I think are particularly useful or helpful. The disclaimer I'd make is that I'm a computer scientist and it's a little hard for me to think about data science though any other lens than "algorithms and programming", and the list reflects this bias with the exception of some titles like Outliers, The Long Tail, etc. toward the end. I also just finished writing a book called Mining the Social Web that's on the list, which is oriented towards social networking data, so as of late, I've been a little lost in thinking about graph mining and such things as opposed to more traditional techniques like record matching, a staple in just about any kind of data analysis you might run across. You can grab all of the source code and preview a good bit of the content from the links off of the GitHub repository at http://github.com/ptwobrussell/M... - Not trying to make a sales pitch here, but I wrote the book to be a useful resource, and the initial feedback I've received is that it has been pretty helpful. It would be great to hear more about books that are a little less programming oriented that people consider essential data mining/science resources and/or other types of resources such as online videos, podcasts, OSS projects, etc.    Embed Quote
