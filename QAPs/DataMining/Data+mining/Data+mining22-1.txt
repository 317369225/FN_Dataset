What are some programming languages commonly used in data mining, and why?
Python would be the first choice in most of Data Mining applications. Being a simple language and "can-do-it-all" power, it won't take much time to import a few mathematical and statistical libraries and do your task. There are better alternatives like R too. Here's how I order them : Python : Easy to learn (you probably know it), quick, and provide a plethora of libraries to handle things R : It is the most widely used among professional statisticians. Run it over a hadoop cluster, and you become a data mining god. SQL : Commercial SQL server editions provide facilities for classification trees and clustering algorithms. JAVA : The Java Data Mining package provides statistical classification, association, regression analysis and clustering. Plus, most programmers have a good hand over Java; so you can do your own stuff up too. SAS : It stands for Statistical Analysis System. Do I need to say anything else?
