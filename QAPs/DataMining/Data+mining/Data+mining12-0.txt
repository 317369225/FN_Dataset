What is data mining?
Data mining is the process of analyzing large amounts of data in an effort to find correlations, patterns, and insights. A lot of data mining is about experimentation: compute all sorts of correlation coefficients and summary statistics (mean/mode/std. deviation); look at outliers and try to find what makes them different; test different hypothesis to see if the data supports them; etc. The mining analogy is quite apt, actually. You have a mountain of data (rocks) and your goal is to mine it to find the nuggets of insight (gold). The principal goals of data mining are usually to explain and understand past behavior or to predict future behavior.    Embed Quote
