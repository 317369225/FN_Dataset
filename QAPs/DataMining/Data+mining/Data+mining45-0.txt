What are some of the most useful applications for data mining?
"Programming Collective Intelligence", which is written by Toby Seagaran on O'Reilly identifies these 7 options (although its not exclusive or ranked per se--its just a useful list): 1) Biotechnology 2) FInance fraud detection 3) Machine vision (?) 4) Product marketing (I guess user data before & after sale--as well as psychographics....and now sentiment data in the social space) 5) Supply chain optimization 6) Stock market analysis 7) National security Of course this can happen both at the micro & system level. Combining, filtering, and analyzing data (and patterns of data) for theoretically better decision making. Health care data is probably the largest omission from Toby's list.  Here are some other ideas: 1) data transparency & data as a means for accountability 2) data as game mechanic (or game dynamic).  Also, visual representations of data are increasingly being used to make sense of the data (think Gapminder).  3) data can obviously also be used for industry, organizational, or business benchmarking. (organizational effectiveness/success/sales) 4) Online group behaviour (reading, buying, sharing, etc....) & influence (tracking and analying how influence works).  5) Another application might be wisdom of the crowd & crowd sourcing--I know this is used for prediction markets. I guess anything you can put on an excel spread sheet with relevance for life, or business. BTW, the book is grounded in Python, but has a wider application based on the methodology & the general theory on mining.  I was consistently skipping over the Python part.
