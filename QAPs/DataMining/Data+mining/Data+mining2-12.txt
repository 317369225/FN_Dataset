How do I learn data mining?
A lot of courses (MOOC or traditional) are available around the world, but many forget that a Data Scientist must be good at CS/IT and hard science but also at business applications and ethics & law. The latter is too often forgotten in the curricula, but it's a massive challenge. Check us out at Data ScienceTech Institute, with our most intensive 1,600hrs MSc programmes , in partnership with the likes of SAS France and KDnuggets (Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro) And because we care for CSR, we also provide a range of scholarships, covering from 50 to 100% of the tuitions fees. ;)    Embed Quote
