★What is the future of data analysis?
The future of data analysis, hopefully, is the incorporation of statistical knowledge in the everyday knowledge of the common person.  This must happen.  Otherwise, the future of data analysis will be hijacked by the media, and an ever attempt of providing facts and figures will be trumped by the beautification and exploitation of "eye candy" for the masses. Statistics is the language of truth.  Most people that go through school are not educated, not required, to understand it.  It is the most responsible instrument for the manipulation of the masses, and visualizations just expand on its ability to herd the masses.  Visualizations are great, don't get me wrong, but data analysis must become a universally understood  language, known by the masses, just as math (barely) is. This said, private industry can benefit hugely for data analysis and is.  The greatest benefit however, is to use the Information to shape the world and optimize our existence, information is the key    Embed Quote
