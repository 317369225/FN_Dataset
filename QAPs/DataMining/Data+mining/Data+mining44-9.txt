What are some good project ideas related to data mining?
As google is a world wide using search engine website, You can use Google API's in android app development to link your gmail account with the app. that keep tracks of record about what the person usually do on internet? Which websites he visits? Which task he generally do? Linking other websites database like FACEBOOK , QUORA (yes) or others through their paid APIs, fetching and tracking about their activity from the databases, We can device a server side algortim that would derive about the person's character. His taste, interest, hobby, social interactivity and can link these results 9after a specified period) with matrimonial websites like The No.1 Site for Matrimony, Matrimonial, Shadi and Marriage etc. and sure, it will provide the best matches. Note- for it, you would have to spend a lot of money while using others databases through their restricting APIs and all work is possible on the sever. Thanks.    Embed Quote
