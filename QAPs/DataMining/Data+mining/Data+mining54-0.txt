What are the critical programming skills to have before beginning to learn machine learning & data mining?
Late answer, but since this answer comes as a near-top result in Google, I feel it needs more: Become reasonably proficient in Python. Learn some statistics and probability quite well (e.g. the equivalent of one university course on probability, and as much stats as you feel like taking). Learn the equivalent of one second-year university linear algebra course. At this point, learn to do some routine matrix-based computations in Matlab (and/or Octave) and also how those skills transfer to Numpy, and how to do I/O with both of these. As stated by the previous answer, take some fundamental CS courses in algorithms, such as the online algorithms course that was just offered at Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/course/...). If you feel like you want to prepare even more, an optimization course is *very* useful. (Perhaps even http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/elect... although it does look like overkill.) That's probably all you'd need, and keep in mind I kept them in order of importance. In summary: some linear algebra and proficiency in probability is necessary, and the rest I listed above is more or less optional.    Embed Quote
