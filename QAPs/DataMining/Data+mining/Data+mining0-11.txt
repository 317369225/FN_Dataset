★What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?
The answer depends on whether the data mining task is supervised or unsupervised (classification or clustering). For supervised machine learning, the top algorithms would be SVM, kNN, naive bayes, regression, HMM, Decision trees. For clustering the algorithms would be k-means, heirarchical, MCFS, etc. The algorithms like adaboost are a combination of multiple weak classifiers to improve performance. Page-ranking, mRmR ranks the feature space or the search space. Essentially the algorithms are good if they fit the task at hand. There are no absolute top 10 algorithms.    Embed Quote Updated 20 Nov, 2013. 3,113 views.
