What are some good research topics in data mining?
here is what I am working on Machine Learning CalculatedContent/tsvm What we are doing trying to do is set up a set of open source, collaborative, data science / machine learning research projects that correspond to the work described on my blog these projects are designed bona-fide scientific research projects that require collecting our own data and designing experiments that systematically test specific theoretical ideas.  Unlike kaggle which is isolated, competitive, and predefined, these projects are meant to be shared, collaborative, and requiring framing Each project involves 1.  mathematical understanding and advancement 2.  data science experiments 3.  developing some code I am very open to having collaborators interested in doing novel data science research    Embed Quote
