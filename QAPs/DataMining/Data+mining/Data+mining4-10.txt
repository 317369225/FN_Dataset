★What is the future of data analysis?
Non-cutting-edge business will become more aware and interested in data mining methods, which will lead to the growing demand of data scientists. New products will be emerging, making the process easier, lots of Data-Mining-As-A-Service startups (pretty sure that there are already some) will appear. The hype will go down and it will be not so hot anymore (with decent payment and a high entering entry barrier though).    Embed Quote
