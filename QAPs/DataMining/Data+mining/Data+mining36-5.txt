What is the best software to implement machine learning/large scale data mining algorithms?
I personally use Weka and Rapid Miner. Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. (Extracted from official site). Rapid Miner has the same functionality, more or less. I find Weka GUI better than others. If you want to use Supervised Learning Algorithms, then LibSVM is also a good choice. But you need to develop a wrapper class yourself. R is used more for statistical purposes than for Machine Learning. I will suggest to use Weka since the GUI is better and easy to understand if you are a newbie. Else, you wont find much difference with any of them.    Embed Quote
