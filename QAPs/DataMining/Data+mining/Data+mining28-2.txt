What are the best graduate schools/programs for those who are interested in data mining/data science?
Zack Black makes a good suggestion. Although Data Science/Data Mining is a good term to use for the field, you need to be more specific. What in particular is of interest to you? Information retrieval, web search, natural language processing, social network analysis, machine learning? I have my biases (towards more CS type applications), but these are some schools that grant an M.S. in Statistics that seem to do a pretty good job based on ubiquity in the literature that I have read: Stanford Carnegie Mellon University of Southern California "USC" (but this would need to be in CS AFAIK) UC Irvine (Statistics and CS are in the same small school) UC San Diego Berkeley makes it onto this list for Michael Jordan alone, but never choose a program due to one faculty member. I would strongly suggest that you look into an M.S. in Computer Science as well/instead. Your math background and an interest in topics covered in CS can be enough for many CS M.S. programs.    Embed Quote
