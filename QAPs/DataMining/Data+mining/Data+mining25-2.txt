Which are the most promising startups at the genomics/data mining interface?
The space is very interesting and has a fair amount of players in addition to Halcyon. Knome - Founded by a Harvard scientist, they have dropped their price for a full genome sequence from an original $320k to $20-30k, and they are looking to bring price down to under $1k. ionTorrent - Started by folks with excellent reputation in the genomics space, they are using an innovative chip that should also allow ultra-low-cost sequencing. Counsyl - They are doing pre-conception genetic testing for common conditions (also very talented team). All in all, the space is (finally) getting its deserved share of attention. Importantly, the new players are actually focused on building sustainable products with medical applications. I think it's highly likely that we will have low-cost, accurate (99.9%+), full genome sequencing in the next few years. The question then becomes who will be best placed to figure out the right analytics to match genetic data to clinical outcomes, social / medical history, and make the right inferences.    Embed Quote Updated 19 May, 2010. 483 views.
