What are the hottest data mining companies?
Kimono Labs (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds) can be a really useful resource in data mining. It’s a free webscraping product that allows you to extract data through a user interface rather than using code. This is great for people who don’t have a lot of experience programming but still want to get large sets of data in formats that they can easily use. Because you get your data in a structured format, it’s incredibly easy to pair Kimono with other tools for data analysis. We’ve visualized citi bike data (http://blog.kimonolabs.com/2015/...) and performed sentiment analysis on hotel reviews (Guest blog: Sentiment analysis on web scraped data with kimono and MonkeyLearn). You can set your data to crawl on a schedule, and Kimono will even host your data for you. It’s really pretty magical. Admittedly, I work for Kimono, but I love seeing the awesome stuff people do with their data.    Embed Quote
