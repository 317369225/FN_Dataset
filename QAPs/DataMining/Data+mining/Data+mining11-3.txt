What are some Indian startups working with Machine Learning or Data Mining?
We do some interesting stuff with DM/ML:  [24]7 Our objective is drive higher conversions across different channels like web, voice etc. Adding some more details as requested by Quora User in a comment: It is a little difficult to precisely pinpoint the problems we solve, because we try to solve any problem (well the constraint is it must be solvable with predictive analytics :)) that can help our clients (we're B2B) target their customers better. An example is if a client offers chats to customers visiting their website, we suggest who to offer chats to so that conversions are likely ([1]). Another example would be if a client uses a IVR system, we provide solutions to make speech-related workflows simpler ([2]). Our solutions are often a mix of good engineering and models that anticipate customer needs. Most of our models are proprietary, but if you want something of a '101' + 'teaser' rolled into one, check out this article: Page on scribd.com [1] http://www.247-inc.com/customers...
