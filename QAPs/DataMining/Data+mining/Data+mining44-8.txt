What are some good project ideas related to data mining?
Thanks for A2A One of my favourite will be web log file analyzing. A server log is a log file (or several files) automatically created and maintained by a server consisting of a list of activities it performed. It is huge depend upon website load it can be range of 200Mb File to 1.2 TB per month. By extracting it you can gather knowledge about site activity what is responsive what all robot enter you site where all user are mainly are visiting. It's a huge project depend upon your potential you can explore and if it is college project you can get log file very easily for this process. Hope my answer is satisfactory!.    Embed Quote
