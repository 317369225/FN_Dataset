What are some programming languages commonly used in data mining, and why?
Bash. A lot of practical data mining has a flow of importing some data sources to flat files (which may involve cleaning the data with Unix tools), running different programs (C, R, Java, Scala, Python, ...) on those files which write their results to more flat files, doing some basic data munging on those files (using Unix tools, see Rohit's answer), maybe importing some more data sources, and running more programs, etc, until all your artifacts are generated and organized in some dir structure. Shell scripts can automate and document your end-to-end process. Building on Bash and flat files translates well to Hadoop. I've been able to work on a single node with Bash driving the analysis for data sets up to 100GB. Beyond that I recommend using Hadoop and orchestration like Cascading.    Embed Quote Updated 16 Jul, 2011. 1,610 views.
