Which are the most promising startups at the genomics/data mining interface?
It's been a few years since this question was asked/answered. Looking back now, I think it's clear that the clear winner thus far has been Counsyl. DNAnexus continues to be very interesting, and Natera (formerly GSN), will be one to watch provided they survive the litigation wars with Verinata and Sequenom.    Embed Quote
