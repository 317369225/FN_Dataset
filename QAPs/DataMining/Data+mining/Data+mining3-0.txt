What are the most useful data mining / analysis / science tools?
Still waiting on the "big data stack" to really flesh out - at Recorded Future we have a pretty mixed bag of tools. For data collection (a big part of our business) our pipeline is written primarily in Java/Scala/Python and data is stored with a number of backends (MongoDB and MySQL - and more recently Dynamo), with RabbitMQ controlling messaging. We index with Sphinx and are getting going with ElasticSearch/Lucene. For analysis, we're mostly an R shop, and use Hadoop (with java/python/R) as necessary to do large scale data filtering, aggregation and clustering. Day to day, I make heavy use of Python, R, and good old UNIX to get my data into shape and do  modeling and exploratory data analysis. Spotfire is also a popular tool here for data visualization and analysis - though we've also baked interactive D3 visualizations into our product. I rarely go a day without producing a ggplot2 plot. Once we put our models into production, those generally run in Java or Python on realtime data. To Sean's point - I don't think that "data science" == "machine learning" - while ML techniques should be in a data scientist's toolbox, I think there are a lot of basic descriptive statistics, traditional statistical modeling, data manipulation, and data visualization techniques that should be in there, too.    Embed Quote
