What are some good project ideas related to data mining?
One of the first projects that I worked on was the beginning of a High Frequency Trading application. This application wasn't really going to trade, but the idea was that I would give it starting capital and it would decide when to buy or sell. The algorithm was reliant on the data that I was able to gather, which was done in an interesting way. The main thing I needed was the price of the stock. I was able to use the Yahoo Finance API to pull down the latest stock price. I decided that I would make the API call ever minute and log that data. Since the stock market is open for around 400 minutes, I would have around 400 data points every day. I decided on Hadoop/Hive. Although I wasn't going to be dealing with massive amounts of data, I figured it'd be advantageous to learn a new framework in the process! Hive also has a built-in MapReduce, which would be good for finding price distributions. Over the course of a few months, I gathered thousands of data points. Having this amount of data allowed me to make decisions about when to buy or when to sell.   This is just a quick example. Hope this helped!    Embed Quote
