What is the best software to implement machine learning/large scale data mining algorithms?
If you want to do something large-scale, you may run into trouble with Matlab in Windows. Far as I know, it is still struggling with the problem of contiguous memory chunks, which shows up as unpredictable out-of-memory errors when working with large matrices. An option not mentioned here is Vowpal Wabbit. Bit higher learning curve I think, but could be fast for large data sets. It might be that if you start out defining the machine learning/data mining task first, including data set and preferred types of algorithms, the choice of software will be easier.    Embed Quote
