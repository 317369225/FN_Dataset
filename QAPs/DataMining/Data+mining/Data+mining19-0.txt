What approaches exist for data-mining time series?
Time series data mining is a very big field. There are many things you can do with time series data sets.. classification, characterization, prediction change detection clustering anomaly detection Indexing The above things may include steps like segmentation feature extraction and compression Representation (symbolic/real) smoothing and other pre-processing Some popular ways for time series segmentation are SWAB ( Sliding Window and Bottom-up) , Piece-wise Linear regression methods, Constant regression ( both may be adaptive or not). There are plenty of methods for time series representation like Fourier transform, Wavelet (Haar or others), Piecewise Aggregate Approximation , Piecewise Linear Approximation,  CB polynomials. Some more advanced methods are APCA, SAX, aSAX, IPLA,iSAX etc. The above mentioned methods are used as a step in time series data mining because often the real time series data is too big to be handled in raw form. This is often referred to as 'curse of dimensionality'. I suggest you read the work of Prof. Eamonn Keogh to get to know different methods of classification and feature extraction. His method of symbolic representation of time series SAX is very popular. For Indexing also, you can read the work of prof. Eamonn Keogh and Dr. Rakesh Agarwal (In fact you can refer to his work for almost all types of data mining). some well known methods of Time series indexing are IPLA,iSAX 2.0, and many others depending on what you what to do with the data after it is indexed. There are a lot of papers for time series modelling and prediction. some of arithmetic modelling techniques are ARIMA modelling, using Fourier or wavelet coefficients, Yearly Delta techniques etc. As an example of applied time series data mining, you can see the work of Dr. Vipin Kumar in the field of land cover change detection using time series data. I hope it helps... :)    Embed Quote
