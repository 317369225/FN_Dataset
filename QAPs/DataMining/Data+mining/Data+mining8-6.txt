What is a good book on machine learning / data mining to give to a layman?
I found 'Discovering Knowledge in Data: An introduction to Data Mining' by Daniel Larose to be a really good resource that does not assume any previous programming knowledge.  The introduction is clear on the uses and importance of data mining and later on it goes into more depth on the most commonly used algorithms.  It also uses plenty of examples from economics, business and engineering so is not purely theoretical.  The problems at the  end of the chapter are great for if you do want to go deeper, but they also serve to give you a feel for the kind of questions you have to ask.    Embed Quote
