What are the most useful data mining / analysis / science tools?
In terms of analysis, R and Python have already been mentioned as well as SAS and other statistical software. When it comes to data collection, though, Kimono (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds) can be an extremely useful tool. With Kimono, you can scrape almost any website and get your data in a structured format, ready for analysis. This makes it incredibly easy to pair with Python or R for further processing, and you can even do some simple but powerful analyzing with the new modify results feature (Write JavaScript functions to transform your API results) What makes Kimono awesome is how easy it is to use. You just grab data you want from almost any site by clicking, and soon you’ve got your API. People use Kimono for all kinds of data analysis, from sentiment analysis (Guest blog: Sentiment analysis on web scraped data with kimono and MonkeyLearn) to graphing beer descriptors: (Beer Analytics: Review of Heady Topper Descriptors | Scott Janish). Full disclosure, I do work for Kimono, but I have to say it’s an amazing tool.    Embed Quote
