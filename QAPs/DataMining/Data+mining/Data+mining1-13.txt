★How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people?
Data mining is a broad world in itself. Some basic steps of data mining are 1. Collecting data 2. Cleaning Data 3. Data Analysis 4. Statistical Inferences 5. Regression Model In data mining, a useful information is extracted from a set of data. This information can be further used for policy making, in investment and in various other field. Now I give some example to show how data mining affects us. 1. Now assume a atmospheric research body doing a research on relation between pollution and asthma. In their finding they found that carbon pigments are major cause in asthma. So a government can use this research for a policy making to control air pollution especially carbon pigments which causes asthma. 2. Now see the firms like S&P they mine the data of stock market and do statistical analysis by keeping other market forces like demand, economy and others and invest accordingly. Now a days data mining is used every where in websites for giving you relevant choices to buy products or an offer by tracking you with the help of cookies, in search engines and everywhere you can imagine to make your life easier. A little overview of Text mining. In text mining, you can do information retrieval, lexical analysis and many other thing Example to understand Text Mining 1. By doing text mining we can retrieve an information like assume a text "John is a software engineer, who lives in Milky Way. He Worked for Stark Industries" So now let us assume we had a system who do text mining (i.e data mining) and we ask a question Q: Where John live System gives the answer Ans: Milky Way Q: Where John works Ans: Stark Industries All personal assistant like Siri, google Now, IBM Watson and others use data mining (text mining) to give you answers. 2. By text mining (lexical analysis) you can also find frequency of a word, pattern recognition and many other things.    Embed Quote
