Which are the most promising startups at the genomics/data mining interface?
23andMe will transition from genotyping to whole genome sequencing when the time is right.  Companies that can leverage the data being produced via the 'next-next' generation sequencing platforms will be the ones to watch.  Sequencing, in and of itself, will become a commodity. Agree that DNAnexus is one to follow.    Embed Quote
