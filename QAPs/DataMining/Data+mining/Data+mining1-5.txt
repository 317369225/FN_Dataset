★How do you explain Machine Learning and Data Mining to non Computer Science people?
Machine Learning is designed to optimize problems which are not obvious or not solvable by human deduction alone (or we can't do it fast enough to make it worth the effort). Introduce Zid, a happy-go-luck-does-only-what-you-allow-it-to-do robot chicken. You are Zid's master, and it worships your very existence. As Zid's master you have the ability to allow Zid to experience extreme existential satisfaction to exist along side you.  You also have the ability to have Zid experience great remorse. Human Happiness is a problem that is not solved and not obvious. Zid will try a slew of things to make you happy. Some will fail... most will fail miserably....  but once it begins to learn (i.e. receives score points), it can begin to maintain a long-term sustained optimized score. The difference to highlight here is that Machine Learning can be used to evaluate problems with a changing data-set or changing target goals. Maybe last year you loved getting a beer at 5pm everyday, but this year you prefer it to be at 6pm. Zid should be programmed with a set of algorithms that will look for optimal, and then begin to perform boundary tests to try and achieve higher and higher scores. One day Zid will bring you a Poo. You need to make sure you subtract points for this... and make sure you don't laugh or smile... Replace Zid with Website Replace Beer with Notification Replace You with Users Replace Points with User Engagements "Website gives you a notification at 5pm, but people don't prefer it at this hour."    Embed Quote
