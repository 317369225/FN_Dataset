What are the best startups in the field of analytics / data mining / databases?
For collecting large amounts of data from the web for analysis, Kimono can prove indispensable (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds). Kimono is a webscraping startup that allows you to select data from almost any web page and get your results in JSON, CSV, or RSS formats. You can even write javascript functions to modify the output and prepare it for further processing. What makes Kimono so cool is the ease with which you can select the data you want and the scale at which it works. You can establish the data you want from a page simply by clicking on the properties you want, and you can crawl thousands of URLs in a single crawl. Kimono can help you get incredible amounts of data, and it’s easy to pair Kimono with data analytics tools such as visualization (Visualize a year of bike rides with Kimono and CartoDB) or text mining (Guest blog: Sentiment analysis on web scraped data with kimono and MonkeyLearn). The possibilities are endless! While I’m biased because I work for Kimono, I truly think the product is great, and people do some unbelievable stuff with the data they scrape.    Embed Quote
