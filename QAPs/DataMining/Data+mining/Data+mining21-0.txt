What does data mining involve?
Data mining involves extracting data from a source, organizing it into an easy-to-analyze form, and then figuring out the important features/trends of the data. A super powerful tool for data mining on the web is Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds. It let's you scrape data from any site and then gives you the tools to modify it into the form you need. From there you can easily embed the organized data onto your own site or application or download it for statistical analysis. For example, if you wanted to get up to date stock market trends, you could use data mining with Kimono to get all that data as a time series. Someone's even done this before with the Taiwanese stock market: Taiwan Stock Express - Up to date financial data... - #builtwithkimono It's also totally free, which is pretty rad. P.S. I work there, but it's actually a super sweet and user friendly setup! Not just saying that :)    Embed Quote
