What books do you recommend to get introduced in the data mining "world"?
A lot of good books have been mentioned here but I think if you want to get started you should consider "Data Mining" by Witten and Frank. This book is easy to digest (some have called it Data Mining for managers) and the book introduces you to Weka the open source data mining project.  With Weka it's easy to play around with different data mining techniques.  The downside is that people quickly outgrow Weka and move on to implementing data mining techniques in other languages.  The biggest selling point of this book is that it answers the "why are we doing this" question with many well explained examples.  I would also recommend  Introduction to Data Mining by Pan, Kumar, and Steinbach.  This book covers more topics than Witten and Frank with a little more math.  I also like Pattern Recognition by Theodoridis and Koutroumbas, this one is long but it has code examples in Matlab (in a separate book). Good books that I think are a step up in the math from the previously mentioned books are: "The elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (This book is free in pdf format.) and Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop.    Embed Quote
