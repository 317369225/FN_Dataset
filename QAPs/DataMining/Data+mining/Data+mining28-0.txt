What are the best graduate schools/programs for those who are interested in data mining/data science?
If you're still looking for an answer, perhaps this will help: "Data scientists" now sit in multiple departments. Each department has a slightly different culture which drives what they focus on and places they publish at but you can find a mix anywhere. ========== For example, at Stanford alone, here are the places you could go: Statistics: Look at Brad Efron, Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman for example. I'd say they focus primarily on basic theory. Usually publish at stats journals e.g., Annals of Applied Stats. Optimization: Stephen Boyd, Ben Van Roy and several other people within management science and engineering, also CS theory - say, Serge Plotkin. Data-mining: Algorithms that scale to large scale web-data. Look at the InfoLab (Hector Molina, Jure Leskovec who recently joined.) ICDM, KDD, WWW are probably the biggest conferences. Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence): The field is now quite diverse with many people developing core models and others focusing on models for specific applications. Its a mix of stats, optimization, algorithms and data modeling. Look at Daphne Koller, Andrew Ng in CS. NIPS, ICML are the two biggest conferences. Within applications, Robotics: e.g., Sebastian Thrun, Andrew Ng Computer Vision: Fei-fei Li in CS (just joined), Daphne Koller, lots of people in other departments that I don't know. CVPR, ICCV are the two biggest conferences. Natural Language processing: e.g., Dan Jurafsky, Chris Manning. ACL and EMNLP I think are the two biggest conferences. Computational biology: Daphne Koller, Serafim Batzaglou, lots and lots of other people who focus entirely on this application. Most of the best work usually goes to Science, Nature, JAMA etc depending on your sub-focus. ============ This structure pretty much exists at many other schools, though their sizes and the amount of interaction between disciplines vary.  I moved to Johns Hopkins recently and they have a rich data intensive science and engineering program that extends between multiple schools (e.g., school of engineering, school of public health and school of medicine) with projects than span multiple disciplines outside of CS which is quite unique. Here are a few examples of some of the largest big data projects in academia (e.g.,  mapping petabyes of data from stars -- http://www.sdss.jhu.edu/ or ecological monitoring -- http://idies.jhu.edu/research.aspx ). Also,  http://ml.jhu.edu/courses/ gives you a pretty comprehensive list of courses on data science and the diversity of departments they come from. In terms of other schools, CMU is one of the larger CS schools and has whole sub-departments dedicated to each ML application area but primarily focusing within Computer Science (e.g., NLP, robotics). Berkeley has rich tie-ins between Stats & CS and recently got funded for an interdisciplinary initiative around big data. Toronto also has a fantastic ML program. (Of course, I name mostly the people whose work I've read and places that I am familiar with. There are several other people who might be more well-known that I missed.) I'd say, like Zach suggested, reading papers in the area is helpful to both get a flavor of the work and see the people whose names frequently appear.    Embed Quote Updated 17 May, 2012. 10,669 views.
