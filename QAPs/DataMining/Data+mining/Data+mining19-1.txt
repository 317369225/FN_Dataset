What approaches exist for data-mining time series?
It all depends on the data and what you are looking for. If you are trying to find patterns of correlations between different time series, e.g., to see if there are some series that move together or not, then some standard multivariate time series tests are the way to go. If you want to see if two time series "move together" (or evolve together) then do cointegration tests. If you want to see if one time series "causes" the other (in the Granger causality sense) then do Granger causality tests. There would be other approaches too, but it is not clear from the question what the objective of the modeling would be.    Embed Quote
