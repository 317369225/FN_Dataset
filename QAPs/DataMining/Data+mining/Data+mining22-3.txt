What are some programming languages commonly used in data mining, and why?
Java for both performance and wide range of libraries. Clojure for as more modern Lisp and Java interop. C++ for more performance (I guess not widely used). Python/Scipy/Scikits.learn for quick prototype and moderate performance. In addition for text and web mining. R for cutting edge methods and its huge community. SQL with  procedural languages (PL/SQL,T-SQL) SAS Gregory Piatetsky:I think you are confusing language used for writing data mining software and the language used for actual analysis.  I don't think Java or C++ are used for data mining directly.  R, SAS, Python/Scipy/NumPy,  MATLAB are used for data analysis/mining .  Perl is also great for quick analysis - I use it a lot. Edit: Gregory you are right SAS is specially used for data-mining. I am adding SAS to list (an expensive solution) In case of Java, Java is good for big data: such as  hadoop (map-reduce), mahout and also jdmp. There is a trend for big data and real-time analysis and these performant general languages more suitable for production think of Facebook and Twitter which one is more viable. But for moderate size projects you are right Java and its ecosystem is an overkill. I also added SQL and   procedural languages extension to the list. Anyway I might be biased becase I coming from CS background.    Embed Quote Updated 27 Jun, 2011. 2,475 views.
