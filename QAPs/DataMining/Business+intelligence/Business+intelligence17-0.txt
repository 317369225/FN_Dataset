How has social media redefined business intelligence?
Social media data is like an ocean and just as you can't use sea water without proper desalination, you can't consume raw social media data. One needs to filter, process, categorize, look at relevance and sentiments in the data. This can be done manually in theory but in practical terms if you have to analyze over a million conversations in a month, you have to rely on appropriate technology. Longer term the future of traditional surveys and focus groups is threatened. Moreover in the world of everything real time, one wants to know what is happening now and what is changing. The current technology and the way it is presented just doesn't allow much of real time analysis. In order to solve this problem, we took the approach of picking certain vertical markets and using experts in that segment, created our own taxonomy and did proactive data collection so that data is available for anyone in that industry. Our site www.socialnuggets.net is one such example and we would welcome your comments.    Embed Quote
