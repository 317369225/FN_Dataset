Make or buy BI (Business Intelligence)?
My own personal opinion is you are rarely better off building your own BI stuff.  The reason is that you need to hire people to develop the software and then people to use the software.  The exception to this is if you are an Analytics company and business R&D overlaps with business need, if you are a web 2.0 company and Cloudera, Greenplum or one of those ilk fail to meet your needs, or if you are in some bizarre niche business where spending money on an entire analytics platform would be a waste because you need very few, not super complicated results.  What you need to realize is that money is going to be spent on the software and money ought to be spent on middleware in order to integrate things.  When doing analytics the bain of my existence was  exporting data from one system, doing translations so it could be read, imputing that file into another system, running models, exporting transforming ad nauseam.  All of these translations, exports and imports make processes difficult to repeat and prone to error.    Embed Quote
