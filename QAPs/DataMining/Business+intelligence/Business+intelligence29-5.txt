Are there any desktop business intelligence tools for data analytics?
The issue is not whether it's Desktop or Web, the problem is cost. In fact Pentaho is a great BI tool and it's open source! There are many tools out there (jasper report). What I see as a problem (15 years in the field) is that Data Warehouse companies are looking for a home run on the first project. That's a mistake. Whomever you use, ask them to develop in stages. Within the next 90 days- what can be delivered in terms of Business Intelligence and expand from there. Take the project in phases and pay as you go. The tool is never the problem (they copy each other), it's scope creep and going for the big bang.   If you have any comments/thoughts- feel free to send to me.
