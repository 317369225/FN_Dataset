What is the future of business intelligence?
There will be a mass extinction event in the Business Intelligence space in the coming decade.  Established vendors are attempting to cope with demands for bigger scale (tera- & petabyte sized data sets, a la Google), faster speed (near- & real-time query responses),  and deeper smarts (shifting from classical statistics to modern machine-learning, a la NetFlix). Business Intelligence vendors have kept the 'business' part of their promise, but they have failed on the 'intelligence' half.  This has left them vulnerable to disruption by self-described analytics players -- ranging from SAP, SAS, to open-source frameworks like R -- who are pushing firms beyond reporting to leverage the massive, yet largely untapped potential of their data assets.    Embed Quote Updated 14 May, 2012. 2,127 views.
