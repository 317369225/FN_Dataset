What is the future of business intelligence?
I think the future of business intelligence comes out to two things: 1) Prescriptive, instead of just descriptive or predictive analytics. This means that the data provided by business intelligence should tell you WHAT TO DO, not just what is going to happen or what is happening. You want to get actionable insights from your data. 2) Democractized analytics. This means that the analytics or business intelligence is available to everyone, including all members of your organization. Not just an IT expert or the CEO or Sales VP, but all the sales reps and everybody else. This means that the BI platform must be easy to use without training and quickly implemented. I actually just wrote a blog post about this very topic. Read on to learn more about The Future of Business Intelligence - http://www.insightsquared.com/20...    Embed Quote
