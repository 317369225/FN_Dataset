Business Intelligence: Who actually uses BI tools?
Yes, if implemented correctly, they can have an impact on different people. A board member may want real time dashboards based on data being modeled by the business users. How do they get their data into the system? Using ETLs that could fall onto the the IT department. However, the majority of the BI products are targeted and are most beneficial to the business users. The people that report, plan and budget. The spreadsheet warriors, as I like to call them. Making their life easy is usually the goal of most BI products out there.    Embed Quote
