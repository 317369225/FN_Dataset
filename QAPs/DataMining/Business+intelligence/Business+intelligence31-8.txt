Business Intelligence: What are some good BI tools for MySQL?
Like others have said, Pentaho and Jaspersoft are the most established, but there are others out there. Check out Looker if you have a moment, we customize a model for you and offer a completely free trial. Our platform operates 100% in-database, never storing or cubing any data, and has a browser-based UI. People seem to enjoy our modern, web app approach. Cheers!    Embed Quote
