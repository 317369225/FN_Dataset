What's the scope of business intelligence in the future?
As a Data Warehouse & BI engineer with 4 years of work experience I can easily say that Business Intelligence & Data warehousing is a very good & demanding field in Information Technology industry . It's present as well as future is very bright. But the key should be is the field attracting you.If you are in BI you: 1) will be working on historical(10 + years of data) data of client , to help them making informed business decisions. 2) should be flexible enough to work on any data sources viz. Flat files , Oracle < Netezza, Sql server data bases or SAP . 3) get a chance to work on large number of things,one day you may be writing shell scripts, other day designing ETL jobs or some other day creating dazzling dashboards. 4) will be working in a domain where learning never ends.  But I have a few suggestions to make: 1) Learn the other tool also: When you enter the BI firm, mostly you are made to work in either ETL tools(Informatica,Datastage,Oracle Data Integrator,SSIS etc ) or OLAP tools(Cognos, Business Objects, OBIEE etc) . Please make yourself comfortable to learn both the ETL & OLAP tools. 2) Don't hassle on versions: People who are new to industry , always complain about the version of the tool they are working on. Believe me the basic functionalities remain the same in latest versions also. 3) Focus on data & business problems:  As a BI engineer you are expected to solved the problems of client  & understand their data , not to gain certifications & become a master of tools. Though that is also good & I am not denying they are valuable , but our main focus should be to serve the clients well & solve their problems.    Embed Quote
