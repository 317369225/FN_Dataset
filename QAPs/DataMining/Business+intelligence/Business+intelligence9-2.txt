What is the best business intelligence software?
As others have said already there is not a perfect software that can be applied to all businesses as every business has different requirements & needs. A good unified business intelligence and corporate performance management software that I have used in the past is Adaptive Insights' Adaptive Suite package  (http://www.adaptiveinsights.co.uk/) which is built from the cloud up so you can access the software on the web and on your mobile.  They also allow you to trial the software for 30 days so it is well worth testing it to see if it meets your requirements.    Embed Quote
