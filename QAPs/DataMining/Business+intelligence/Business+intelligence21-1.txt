Who are the big players in business intelligence?
The same as in any consolidated IT market: Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and SAP. You may want to check Teradata, SAS, Microstrategy, Informatica as well. New relevant players would be Tableau, Qlikview, Tibco. Open source would include Birst and Jaspersoft. Some might say that the second list is more relevant. You should take a look at big data players as well. Besides some of the above, those would include most Hadoop stack offerings (Cloudera , Hortonworks and a couple of others), but this area is still dominated by coding and open source.    Embed Quote
