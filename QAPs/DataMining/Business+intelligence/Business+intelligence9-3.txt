What is the best business intelligence software?
It depends on what you're really looking for, on BI, there is no "one size fits all" solution, as some look something that can be used by a multinational company across the globe while some others just want something to be able to make nice reports. I recommend you to try several and see if they fit your needs and pick the one that is closer to them; as you seem to be looking for something easy to use, i recommend you to start by trying DBxtra - Reporting Software, as it lets you create reports by pure drag and drop, with minimal to zero knowledge of SQL or programming.    Embed Quote
