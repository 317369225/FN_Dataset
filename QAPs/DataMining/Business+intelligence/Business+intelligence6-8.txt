What are the most cost effective Business Intelligence tools?
I might be biased but the company I work for - InsightSquared - is designed specifically for Small- and Medium- Sized Businesses (SMBs), and affordably priced with those companies in mind. Most legacy BI platforms are designed for enterprises and prohibitively priced for SMBs. I agree with Everett MacKinnon that a big cost with BI is data integration, referring specifically to time and effort. That's where our product really stands out - we can be fully implemented and up-and-running in just a day or two. Truly out-of-the-box. In fact, our team is curretnly at Dreamforce running a promotion to produce "Sales Reports in 60 Minutes or Less!"
