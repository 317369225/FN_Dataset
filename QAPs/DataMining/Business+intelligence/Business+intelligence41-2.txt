What are the best use cases for Mobile Business Intelligence ?
The advantage of mobile BI over desktop BI is that you bring your mobile device everywhere every time but you only use your desktop basically during office hours. With mobile BI you can also make use of push notification alerts. On mobile BI you have a smaller screen and the interaction with the device is trickier, which means you need to simplify your dashboards and reports for mobile use which often times means removing metrics and interactions that don't add value, which is also a good opportunity to rethink what business metrics are really important and which can be left out. Mobile BI is further divided into tablet or smartphone (the boundary becoming increasingly unclear with big Samsung screens and iPhones plans for bigger screen devices). As of today it's hard to deploy one-size-fits-all graphic apps, and BI is not an exception. Mobile and Desktop BI will coexist and until high performance, cache-enabled browsing standards develop, companies will need to adapt their reports and dashboards to different screen sizes and devices, which is costly. From my experience as a mobile BI consultant, a good rule of thumb for Mobile BI deployment is to make information available on a triangular shape: all information and use cases should be available on desktop, a little less so on tablets, and a little less so on  smartphones, but never the inverted way.    Embed Quote
