What is the best business intelligence tool for a ecommerce store running on Magento?
Make sure you have your list of must-have features before you go through the hassle of evaluating a new tool. This will help keep you grounded. There are a number of tools that can help you tie all of this data together. That is step one. You'll also want to be able to use the tool and have business users, ideally, be  able to slice and dice the data any way they please. I work at Windward - you may want to check us out at: Reporting Software, Document Generation, and Ad Hoc Business Intelligence. Good luck!    Embed Quote
