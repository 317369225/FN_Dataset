Are small businesses interested in Business Intelligence (BI) software?
In my opinion they are BUT even the name of Business Intelligence seems to require advanced knowledge. Furthermore, the existing software most of the times are so difficult to use that even the BI gurus may face some difficulties! My first contact with BI was through Comidor ( https://www.comidor.com/en/featu... ) which I must admit that it was a bit disappointing. But as I was using it  and getting used to it, I ended up thrilled with the BI the things you can do with it and how easily you can have an overview of what is really going on. I think that if every CEO of any business (from 1-1000+ employees) knew the power of BI tools, BI would have been one of the biggest trends nowadays.    Embed Quote
