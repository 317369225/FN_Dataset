Business Intelligence: What's the BI software/application landscape going to look like in the next 5 years?
Acquisitions: The market is extremely fragmented right now, and you can expect a lot more consolidation.  We saw a couple of large acquisitions of legacy BI companies in the last year. Tough competition from integrated vendors: Microsoft has come out swinging this year, and they have Tableau in their sights. Startups: At the same time, we're seeing the emergence of a new wave of newer BI and analytics tools every year. BI becomes a business function: The emergence of easy -to-use tools, such as Chartio, means that increasingly business users will become the primary buyers and specifiers of BI software. Disruption: All this adds up to a market in which smaller players with simpler value chains, lower sunk costs, and modern interfaces are going to gain strength among smaller businesses and put pressure on the legacy players as they compete more effectively in the middle of the market.    Embed Quote
