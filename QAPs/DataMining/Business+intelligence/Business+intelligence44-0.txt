What are key factors that drive success in deploying Business Intelligence?
Companies are still looking for their keys under the lamppost because that's where the light is. What that means in practice is that they dwell on  transactional data and don't associate that data with other less structured data sources, including social media data and other external sources. Or if they do, they use the same process for less structured data that they do with their transactional data. Using standard ETL for everything bogs down the process. Not all data should be structured up front. As a result, they're still in the dark about most of the data they need to process to make better decisions. Data politics is an issue that has to be addressed by leadership aggressively. Inside the corporation, data is siloed and owned by cartels. Access to the data, the means to transform it  as needed rather than up front, and capture and share the resulting  semantic metadata so that others can benefit are all central issues.  Setting up a data lake to aggregate the data from internal and external is important, and once it is aggregated, a process of discovery and tracking semantic metadata lineage that results from the discovery becomes necessary to start making sense of what's in the lake. See  Data lakes and the promise of unsiloed data for an assessment of the challenge companies face and some of the emerging tools.    Embed Quote
