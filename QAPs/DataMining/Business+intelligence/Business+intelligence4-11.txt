What is the difference between "business intelligence" and "business analytics"?
Disclaimer: I am tool agnostic. My viewpoint is more of a corporate one rather than an academic one. As some of the other answers have shown, there are a plethora of definitions out there. The issue is: - they are not in agreement - different people use the same terms to refer to different things, or different terms to refer to the same thing - the names of a given 'concept' change over time (as an example, data science was called business statistical intelligence in some circles  before the new name stuck) - many viewpoints are not independent, as many stakeholders (such as vendors and consultants) are pushing their own agendas That said, I would class Business Intelligence is a subset of Business Analytics. This is because: 1) Some aspects of 'Business Analytics' is future facing. Business intelligence uses existing data, but actually extrapolate a lot less. 2) Advanced analytical techniques tend to fall beyond the scope of Business Intelligence. Operations research is one example - and now the many applications of data science is another. 3) A lot of business analytics is exploratory. This may be the most important one in practice. So far every business intelligence project I have encountered requires definition of what is to be monitored or measured before the business intelligence capability is set up. This is in contrast to many analytics projects where we sit down in rooms for weeks searching for actionable insights. Some visualisation: ​ I think you asked a good question, because the sooner we settle on semantics, the sooner we can move to tackling the problems at hand and improve our work. Hopefully we can all reach that place soon!    Embed Quote
