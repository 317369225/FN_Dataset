Which business intelligence tools have the best user interface?
The best BI Tool in my opinion is Oracle's OBIEE tool. It has a huge customer base, growing in popularity and is backed by Oracle that is investing heavily in the product.                 Why I like the product is that it is:                         Extremely Flexible                         Has a tool for report writing  and Dashboards                         Has a much better "bug reporting" system than other BI tools. You can set Log Levels and it will show you exactly where the problem is in the code. Adding complex formulas can be done at the RPD layer and you don't have to be a coder for that. There are bug fixes and updates every month or so..so the tool is getting better and better Costs the same or maybe even a drop less then Cognos/BO We are Data Warehousing development company and work with all the major BI tools in the market and therefore not biased (we don't make a dime on any BI tool)..  If you'd speak..please contact me at maurice.berdugo@bpanalytics.com.
