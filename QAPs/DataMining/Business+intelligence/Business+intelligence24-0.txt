What is the difference between a data scientist and a business intelligence analyst?
I think the question Will 'data scientists' live up to the expectations or will 'big data' be a disappointment? has some answers that are relevant to this question. While there's a lot of people who argue both ways, I generally find that the following differences are generally accepted: Data scientists work with a mix of Big Data tools such as Hadoop/Map-Reduce/Hive, NoSQL, MPPs, traditional databases, and basically anything that stores/has data.  They also tend to have a stronger technology skill set in that they also programmers, and also have very strong math skills particularly in thing like statistics.  I've also seen that a data scientist would generally need to know how to do data visualization.  The data scientist also needs to have a strong understanding of the business as they typically would work directly with the business.  I believe this is a role in which realistically very few people could fill, even with extensive training. A BI Analyst would be a person who works with BI tools to perform analysis. Generally speaking they would be a person who is somewhat educated on data warhousing and understands how a star schema is modeled.  This allows them to do things such as perform ad-hoc analysis either through a reporting tool or using SQL to create the charts, graphs, excel sheets, etc that the business users require.  They can also serve as the middleman between business and IT when creating new BI functionality.  Basically will work more with the technology and business users as opposed to trying to play that single role.    Embed Quote
