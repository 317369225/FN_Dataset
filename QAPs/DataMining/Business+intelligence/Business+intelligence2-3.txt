Which business intelligence tools have the best user interface?
We are working on Comidor which has business intelligence features and I believe it's easy to use, as it was designed based on the fact that every employee should be able to use it, regardless of his/her experience in business software. Take a look at is features https://www.comidor.com/en/featu... or try its demo to check it by yourself!    Embed Quote
