Business Intelligence: What are some good BI tools for MySQL?
It all depends on your requirements but any of the BI tools mentioned here are worth considering for converting raw data in MySQL into interactive reports and visualizations. I'll toss our software, Yurbi (http://www.yurbi.com) into the mix.   The strength of Yurbi is other than the initial meta-data layer mapping of the MySQL database it requires no coding or querying expertise to build dynamic reports.   Plus we offer a lot of data security and a fully HTML5 interface optimized for mobile and tablets.   And a really big positive is unlike many of the large, publicly traded, or VC-backed companies listed so far,  we are a scrappy, successful bootstrapped company that provides a competitive solution at a fraction of the cost of others mentioned here. The only potential negative for a MySQL user is our Application Server requires a Windows Server,  so if you are running 100% on Linux/Unix then Yurbi probably won't be a good fit unless you don't mind a Windows Server in your environment.    Embed Quote
