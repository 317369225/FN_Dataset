What is the future of business intelligence?
I agree with Elad in that in general I think BI will become more widespread as there is a general move away from traditional BI towards lighter more scalable SaaS BI solutions such as Bime - http://bimeanalytics.com This includes a move towards: - Self service BI - Increasingly no longer requires IT professionals and can be operated effectively on the business side rather than the IT side. It will be business managers responsible for dashboarding and publishing reports rather than delegating to IT, thus the whole process becomes more efficient. - Cloud - Less infrastructure, meaning less CapEx, making solutions available to the mainstream market and making BI a strong economic investment for SMBs where in the past it would not have been. There is a lot of hype surrounding cloud at the moment but it seems as though it is set to play a big role in BI and generally over the next 5-10 years. - Visualizations - BI will allow us to process more data and there will be a continued shift towards data visualizaitions and dashboarding rather than long and detailed reporting.    Embed Quote
