Business Intelligence: What are some good BI tools for MySQL?
At BigObject we have found the limit to BI tools is the ability to receive data quickly from the data store.  In order to do some real-time BI it is imperative that queries return results in real-time to be analyzed by the BI tool. Here at BigObject we have been working on speeding up MySQL by a factor of 1,000x with in-memory computing.  It might be something to consider since it does not matter how optimized your DB is to realize an exceptional performance boost.  You can use your BI tools to instantly analyze data instead of batching it and we have some powerful built-in BI tools like search, statistics, probability and association. www.bigobject.io    Embed Quote
