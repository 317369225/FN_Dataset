Business Intelligence: How is Domo priced and how does it compare with Tableau and QlikView?
Domo makes you sign an NDA to even talk to them, so I need to write this anonymously. From what I understand, for our company (100 people), we would pay between $150K - 250K per year. Also, I was at a trade show last week where Domo had a booth. They actually employ full time "booth babes" to travel around the country and look hot in front of their booth. Maybe if they cut back on the booth babes they could lower their prices. Edit: We ended up going with Looker as our data analysts are SQL-savvy enough to not need to rely on Domo's services to do everything for them.    Embed Quote Updated 22 Aug, 2014. 13,300 views.
