How has social media redefined business intelligence?
You can have all the data in the world but if you can't transform it into meaningful action or reaction (as necessary) and in a time appropriate context then it's a waste. You need to ensure that your internal processes are fed by the results and structured/empowered to execute appropriately. Just a small example: Our Municipality woke up to Surveymonkey and put out a useful first survey to gather input on values and priorities The results were published, without any commentary or analysis, 69 days after close. Yet the results were available immediately and could have been reported for community discussion at least 2 months earlier. So a two month delay within a 36 month Council term could conceivably result in them running out of time to act before the next election. Incidentally ~70% of respondents indicated social media was their least preferred route for communicating with the Muni!    Embed Quote
