What is the difference between "business intelligence" and "business analytics"?
Broadly and simply speaking I define the difference as being: Business analytics: identifying causation Business intelligence: showing effect A BI professional is tasked with building reports or dashboards that can show business users what happened (ie the effect). An Analyst then has the role of digging in further and working out why it happened (identifying causation). So in effect BI is looking at the past to explain a situation although the past can not be changed, an analyst is looking at what can be changed to positively impact the future. While both of these disciplines are equally important it is an important distinction as they both require a slightly different skill set and mind set. Although there definitely is some large cross over.    Embed Quote
