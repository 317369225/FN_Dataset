Business Intelligence: How is Domo priced and how does it compare with Tableau and QlikView?
I think the other answers pretty fairly present the same message that many of our potential customers tell us when they are looking for alternatives to Domo. We recently wrote up the pros and cons of Domo as part of our Straight Talk Review series,  you can check it out here - https://www.yurbi.com/blog/strai... And we also discuss Qlikview and Tableau on the site - https://www.yurbi.com/blog/categ... Comparing Domo to Qlikview and Tableau is a little like Apples to Oranges.   Domo is a Cloud BI solution that provides a lot of out of the box dashboard widgets but not a lot of in depth data discovery/analytic capability.  It's a really nice picture for executives (and a expensive one).   Qlikview is more of a development platform that allows you to do some really nice associative dashboards but requires some developer expertise.  Tableau is the easier to drag and drop and create some amazing interactive visualizations but you have to have your dataset already prepared or that will require some SQL expertise.  Cost is going to depend on your requirements and configuration but as a rough estimate I would say Tableau < Qlikview < Domo when it comes to most configurations.    Embed Quote
