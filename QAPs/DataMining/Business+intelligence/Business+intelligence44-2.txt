What are key factors that drive success in deploying Business Intelligence?
I have done a few dashboard projects, several data integration projects and a couple of data warehouse projects.  So, you need to consider the entire data flow from the operational systems you pull data from, to the ETL jobs, to the data warehouse schemas, to the business intelligence data marts and finally the executive dashboards.  Considering the outcomes first, you need good KPIs and good visual representations of those that present the data in a meaningful way to the executives.  As for schemas, if you have fact-based data a star-schema is typical.  For ETL, you should also buy the data quality component of the ETL tool and insure you have quality data.  Remember, garbage-in, garbage-out.  Additionally, you need to get buy in from the business units that own/control the operational data or don't bother starting the project.  Finally, you need an executive champion of the system to both guide its development and sell the final product!  Best wishes!    Embed Quote
