What is the best business intelligence tool for a ecommerce store running on Magento?
Hello Rud, this isn't written from a customer perspective, I work for the company (so apologies if i come across too 'markety') but if you are looking for a SaaS solution you might want to look take a look at BIME - http://www.bimeanalytics.com. In BIME you can bring together disparate data sources using our QueryBlender tool and query them side by side. We already work with lots of e-commerce companies and just last week we won the E-Commerce startup competition at LeWeb. Truthfully, I don't know if BIME is perfect for your use case but it sounds like it might be a good fit, there is a 14 day free trial to try out the solution. Good luck!    Embed Quote
