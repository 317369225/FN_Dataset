What is the best RAPID business intelligence suite?
Well, you can look for a simple and cheap solution for your current issue - and there were some good suggestions above (Business Objects, Clickview etc.) But a company having milions of transactions per day looks like a serious business, so if you do your job well you will get soon new requirements for BI reporting: maybe finance, controlling... that come from SAP. Also, at that data volume, you need a data warehouse system instead of running reports on the current OLTP database. So my suggestion is to look at SAP BW solution. Start small, with a small hardware solution that can be upsized, but think big.    Embed Quote
