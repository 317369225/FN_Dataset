Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
If you have constraints in coding then may be it is not an option. But honestly after seeing/training many people, its not a skill difficult to acquire. Anyone can do great. Basic Requirement: R Programming (easy to learn) SQL Logical thinking Lots of perseverance (especially when you work on large data) All the best!    Embed Quote
