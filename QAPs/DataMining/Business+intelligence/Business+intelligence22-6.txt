Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
Extracting meaningful things from data involves a fair bit of programming and stats/math. If analytics/business intelligence interests you, I think you should try more to "like" programming. As for math/stats, I totally understand what you mean and I guess the best thing would be to persevere more at understanding it because it is a VERY important part of analytics. If you think something is out of reach, it will be forever. So I would persuade you to change the way you look at things if you really like analytics. Saying you like analytics but dislike the tools you need to get there is like saying you like cake but don't like baking. Perseverance trumps everything :) Best of luck.    Embed Quote
