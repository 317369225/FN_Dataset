Business Intelligence: How is Domo priced and how does it compare with Tableau and QlikView?
Domo is a SaaS solution and has an annual subscription fee.  The cost is dependent on the number of users that have username and password access to the solution as well as the number of datasources that Domo is plugged into.  They don't charge for data etc.  To add users and to scale Domo across a larger organization is made easier as their cost is tiered- as the number of users increases, the price per user decreases.  I think they're pretty comparable in cost to Tableau and QlikView.  As far as how their solution compares- they are 100% cloud based, they are not analyst focused but are focused on enabling business users to get at their data and collaborate around it without their or IT intervention.    Embed Quote
