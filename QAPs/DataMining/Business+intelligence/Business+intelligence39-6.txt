What is the best business intelligence tool for a ecommerce store running on Magento?
Here is an example of an entire industry pissing me off! As former CTO it was utterly frustrating to be talking to all of these top-notch BI companies, to only find out that they have no domain expertise and they just give you a tool. Then you are left with dedicating an expensive developer or two for the next 6 to 12 months to re-invent the wheel, add to it some professional service from the supplier, and you find yourself with a very expensive to implement solution that you can only start using 6 to 12 months after the purchase. Bonkers! Some times I ask, are they stupid or do they do it on purpose so that they can make money out of professional service? Anyway, the good news is that there are new products coming out, vertical and with domain expertise. For instance, I'd recommend online retailers to look at http://www.ometria.com, which resolves the problem above I was bitching about. Honestly, within a vertical, chances are that most of the companies are after the same informations. So why re-inventing the wheel? Smart people can productise that knowledge and keep improving it.    Embed Quote
