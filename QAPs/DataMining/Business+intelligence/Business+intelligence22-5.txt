Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
No. Honestly, don't waste your time. Problem is that you have highlighted most of what you don't like about a data analyst's core focus areas, and you have not mentioned anything about what you like doing. While I do not belong to "only passion" school of excellence, your question answers the question by itself. You do not have the skills, and you do not have the inclination. Then why would you want to do it? If its about everyone telling you how its the next hot thing, then so is mobile tech, google driverless car, apple pay, and a bunch of other things. Pick something else that you like a few things about.    Embed Quote
