What are the most interesting cloud business intelligence companies?
I would recommend taking a look at BIME Analytics. It has always been a Cloud Business Intelligence company. It is focused on presenting data in the most visually appealing way, and making data analysis available for the business users (generally not technical people) in a very user friendly UI. Mobility is also important, because Business Intelligence should be able to be done from any device, not just behind a computer. Literally everything can be done from a tablet for example, not just visualizing but actual creating of dashboards. I would say that it's definitely one of the most interesting ones on the market, and I would keep it on your radar.    Embed Quote
