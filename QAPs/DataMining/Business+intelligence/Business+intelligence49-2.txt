Business Intelligence: What's the BI software/application landscape going to look like in the next 5 years?
I would agree with Eric to a certain extent but not all There will be a move towards more "application driven" where departments will have complex applications and reports built for them vs buying these super expensive BI tools that cost a fortune and more or less provide the same functionality of Excel. The secret sauce behind any BI implementation is how well has the Data Warehouse been constructed? Relational models are here to stay and that won't change..what is changing is that Desk Top Apps like Excel can more or less do handle everyone's day to day request. So in 3-5 years I see: 1) A need for a lot of smart people whom can interconnect data from "Everywhere" both Internally and Externally into data models that service the company's needs 2) A big push to integrate and combine data that is found on the internet (the worlds largest database!) and combine with internal data. 3) A move towards more complex reporting but applications that are focused on the specific business needs vs building a Data Warehouse that is bent on Size and volume of data vs targeted reporting.
