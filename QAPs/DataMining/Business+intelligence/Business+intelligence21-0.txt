Who are the big players in business intelligence?
If you mean the behemoths that have been around for decades now, that would be MicroStrategy, Cognos, SAP, Informatica, Oracle, etc. If you mean the new players, I would suggest those also mentioned in Gartner's Who's Who report, including BIME Analytics, the company I work for.    Embed Quote
