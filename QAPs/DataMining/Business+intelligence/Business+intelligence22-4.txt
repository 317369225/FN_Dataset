Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
Let me be frank here; with your present state of skill-set, I'm afraid a career as a data analyst  is just not for you. But, myself being in your situation a couple of years ago, I would like to say that losing hope is what weak people do.  Take the help of online courses and learn math in a data point of view, i.e. learn what i a Gaussian distribution from the shape of the data (by actually doing it); and I bet you, you'd start acquiring the skill-set in no time. For SQL, refer to the datamonkey.pro website. For acquiring programming skills, there's always codecademy and datacamp. And for the math and ML, use coursera and other MOOCs Just for your motivation:  I've been slapped with 2 straight "F"s in math in my first year, and was quite miserable in the second year too.  Then, I did what I suggested above, and believe me, it worked wonders. So, good luck!    Embed Quote
