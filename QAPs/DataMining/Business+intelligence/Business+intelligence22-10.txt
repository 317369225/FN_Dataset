Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
It is possible for you to be a good analyst, but it will take a lot of time and looking at the description you've give, you wouldn't enjoy it either. Tools/technologies will include softwares like SAS, R, excel, Tableau, Clickview, Python etc. It seems you don't want to work in any of them, nor do you like maths.. I wouldn't be too optimistic on a long term career in analytics    Embed Quote
