What is the difference between business intelligence and business analytics?
(Business) analytics is a science (a substitute phrase for business analytics is data science). It takes data (mostly unstructured) as input, processes the data using computer science, statistics, and artificial intelligence, and outputs business knowledge/intelligence. Data mining is one of the tasks under data analytics. Interestingly, neither data mining nor data/business analytics lies in the sphere of statistics (contrary to what may have naturally happened). While data mining is in the purview of computer science, analytics is in the purview of business schools, and this should tell you why we use "business analytics" and not "data analytics." Basically, what you analyze/mine are data, but you apply the intelligence to make more effective business decisions. Note that analytics can be deployed to organizations, and not all organizations exist to make profit (definition of business).    Embed Quote
