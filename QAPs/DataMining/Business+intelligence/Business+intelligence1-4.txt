What is the difference between business intelligence and business analytics?
There is no difference between Business Intelligence and Data Mining. The are mutually inclusive. How can someone say they are using "Business Intelligence" data and content and not "data mining". Do people Data Mine data but not use it for their Business to make smarter decsions?  I think many times the billions of dollars pointed in Marketing is meant to "Confuse" the average user and create a seperation between their BI tool/product and others. In my opinion they are the same. Don't be fooled. My favorite BI/DW book- The Walmart DataWarehouse. Fantastic Book.
