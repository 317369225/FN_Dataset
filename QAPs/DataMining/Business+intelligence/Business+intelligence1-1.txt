What is the difference between business intelligence and business analytics?
I consider Business Intelligence to be the broad umbrella group under which everything related to data storage, manipulation, analysis, and reporting belongs. I sub-divide BI into: - Data Engineering, which is responsible for building the systems which collect data (CRM libraries, etc.) and architecting the storage of that data. - Data (Business) Analysis, which is responsible for defining KPIs and building the reporting platforms that deliver them. Data Analysts might also perform ad hoc analyses on specific scenarios for product or functional groups. Some companies have a dedicated group for this (usually called something like Consumer Insights), some have data analysts sitting in product groups, and some have generic business analysts who sit between the product and management layers in the company hierarchy. - Data Science, which involves engaging in data mining and algorithmic prediction to optimize user engagement / monetization.
