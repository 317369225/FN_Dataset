What is the best Business Intelligence software in the marketplace?
What's best depends on your needs, but Chartio, where I work, offers some distinct advantages. It's easy to connect your data and we have the fastest time to value in BI. It's designed for business users, and not for analysts. Our charts look great. You don't need to use SQL to perform complex analyses. Because we're in the cloud, we don't require expensive maintenance and consulting. Our support is great and we don't treat it as a profit center. Because we're a new product, our user experience and design are very friendly.    Embed Quote
