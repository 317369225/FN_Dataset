Business intelligence vs business Analytics vs big data?
Before the digitization of data, people used to analyze samples and extrapolate the result to population. Infact, even after data had started being digitized, people carefully chose good random samples which could represent the population and extrapolated and generalized their findings, insights and results to the entire population - and It was just fair to do so, since collecting all the population data was an impossible feat. Now, with the advent of powerful data storage devices and processors which help churning and manipulating so much data into valuable insights and suggestions, we are capable of using ALL the data available out there. Using ALL the data to generate insights is nothing but "Big Data"! Analytics on the other hand is applying your statistical know-how coupled with the business knowledge to validate your hypothesis around problems. Analytics can be applied on Big or small data, irrespective of data size. BI is representing the insights/findings you have churned from your analysis in format which is readily consumable by business stake-holders. After all, whatever you are doing is to help run businesses/companies/domains/processes better and your message needs to be put across clearly for them to take clear actions on your recommendations. This is atleast how I segregate the three in my head - but yes, you do see an overlap amongst all three.    Embed Quote
