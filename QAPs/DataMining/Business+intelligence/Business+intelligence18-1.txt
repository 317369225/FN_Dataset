What is the best Business Intelligence software in the marketplace?
Hey Jessica, I would recommend SiSense- Business Intelligence Software - SiSense Prism). As a non-technical business user myself, I always love with software that lets me see a complete view of all my marketing data, which is why I joined the SiSense team. SiSense software lets me actually get my hands on my data, build beautiful interactive dashboards with instantaneous data manipulation, get real-time data analysis, and share everything with my team.    Embed Quote
