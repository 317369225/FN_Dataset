Business Intelligence: What is the best database system for BI?
There is no direct correlation between the database system and the BI platform. Despite what some companies are doing, packaging a BI system with an RDBMS is mostly a marketing choice and not a technical need. If you look outside of the Oracle or Microsoft stacks you will find quite some free and commercial BI systems that are DB agnostic and will work as well on a PostgreSQL, a MSSQL or an Oracle platform. This brings a great benefit: you are not locking yourself heart and soul with the DB vendor but go for an open architecture.    Embed Quote
