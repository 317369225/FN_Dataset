What is the future of business intelligence?
BI is going where the vendors want it to go, self service, big data, mdm, to the degree that these buzzwords resonate with the technology trends. Big multi-nationals are always in an appetite to spend big $$ on all things new, its a standalone business cycle that sustains this industry. How well a new BI feature deliver its promised benefits still remains a mystery. For the rest of businesses that can't afford expensive solutions, BI is going where there's strong business process and a need to supplement direct experience with data, which more often than not, does not require anything but spreadsheets. The need for data must be driven by the businesses, not technology or vendors.    Embed Quote
