Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
Its okay if you have a little problem with programming,that can be manageable in this domain,but if you aren't willing to love Statistics,I's suggest you to go ahead and think of considering career options other than this domain. You should be looking at tools like 'R' and Tableau to start with,if you change your mind about Statistics.    Embed Quote
