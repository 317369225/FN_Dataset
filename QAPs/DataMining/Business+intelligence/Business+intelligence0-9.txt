What is the future of business intelligence?
I agree with some of the suggestions before me so I will not go through and repeat them, however I'm surprised that no one has yet mentioned mobile.  Tablet sales, and mobile internet usage is skyrocketing.  With data being available now where you need it decisions can be made more effectively and efficiently.  There is a huge opportunity in mobile, as was highlighted briefly in Boris Evalson - VP at Forrester Research in his recent predictions for Business Intelligence for 2012.  I believe mobile usage is really a large part of the future.  Aside from mobile, i'll add two points: Business Intelligence will become more proactive rather than reactive.  When we use the new "notifications" within iOS5 as an example, if setup you will get a notification each time someone mentions you on Twitter. I could see this applying in much the same way to Business intelligence applications whether mobile or not to say "Yesterday's conversion rate was 42% higher than average." or  "You just received 15 comments on your blog post "Mobile Business Intelligence". Cloud based Business Intelligence solutions will continue to chip away at the on-premisis version of Business Intelligence.
