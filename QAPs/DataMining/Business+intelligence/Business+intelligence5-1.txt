Make or buy BI (Business Intelligence)?
Several customers of Tableau Software had previously attempted to build their own visualization and reporting tools before scrapping the effort, which has sometimes meant abandoning a multi-year project. Of course there is selection bias in this observation, because those who are successful do not need to become Tableau customers. But I am still impressed by the number of times this scenario has played out, even amongst technology companies. A focus on "core competencies" often motivates the choice to buy instead of build, since companies remain efficient by focusing on areas they know they can manage, measure and deliver. However, many BI tools such as Tableau are built for broad use and may lack the depth necessary for a very specialized domain. For example, 3d volume rendering is ineffective for traditional data analysis due to occlusion, but it can be essential for visualizing inherently 3d data such as artery structure in the heart[1] or oil fields. If your data requires highly specialized analysis routines and visualization techniques, you may need to build your own. Consider bootstrapping your effort with open-source packages such as Protovis[2] or d3.js[3] [1] - Of course, even traditional visualization techniques can convey actionable information better than the seemingly natural 3d rendering.
