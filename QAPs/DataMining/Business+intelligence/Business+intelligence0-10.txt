What is the future of business intelligence?
I believe that BI will develop as many other product categories in general: A. General BI will become more of a commodity with prices going down, functionality going up and ease of use going up and B. Targeted BI Solutions that will focus on the needs of a particlar niche by providing a comprehensive solution consisting of  relevant data, industry specific analytical concepts and customized tools for optimal results. These BI solutions will be provided by domain experts and command a premium price for the higher value they deliver. These BI solution will not be called BI anymore but more likely Supply-Chain Intelligence, Market Forcast Intelligence etc. So the big one will slug it out in the field of General BI whereas the Specialist will offer Targeted Intelligence Solutions. My company is practicing this philosophy quite successfully for the automotive industry all over the world.    Embed Quote
