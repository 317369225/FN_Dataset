What is a good primer (book) on business intelligence?
I agree that "Competing on Analytics" by Tom Davenport and Jeanne Harris (http://amzn.to/niiaOZ) is a great book about fact-driven decision-making in business. The authors provide a number of business examples of how analytics are successfully used to improve performance and gain competitive advantage. Many books on the topic of "BI" focus on technical features and capability. While these books will be helpful to your friend's decision, I would recommend a review of business-facing benefits to get the full perspective of BI.    Embed Quote
