What is the future of business intelligence?
Business intelligence hasn't even hit 10% of it's potential market yet.  Even Qlik, which are tremendous success, has less than 3% market share. The future of business intelligence will be shaped by start-ups that can make BI approachable and easily deliverable to the huge potential in the mid-market.  They would do this by introducing new pricing models, new service models and technology that changes the game in setting up BI. SaaS is one example of attempting to do that (although not remarkably successful yet).  Open Source is another.  New paradigms for BI development will also be necessary.
