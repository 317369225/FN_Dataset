What are the most cost effective Business Intelligence tools?
remiCrystal. Not as well known, but a highly effective business intelligence tool. It allows the users to automate reports, with the output options you would need. Like most products, there's a free download period, but what I liked best is that there's no monthly subscription fee. You pay for the product and you own it. Case closed. There are two product offerings, a Standard and an Advanced, both of which are fairly affordable considering that it's a one time cost to own.
