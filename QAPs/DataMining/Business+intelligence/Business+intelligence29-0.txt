Are there any desktop business intelligence tools for data analytics?
I hear your pain. It's like Jeff Vance once said (and I will paraphrase): Many business intelligence analytics solutions are like battleships: they’re expensive, complicated to operate, and are actually overkill for most businesses, which just don’t need that much processing. - Big Data Startup SiSense Lands $30M to Fuel Continued Growth - Startup 50 I think Russel gives a pretty good breakdown of the best options for what you're looking for. That being said, as someone who works for SiSense I know one of the biggest differentiation's is that SiSense is built to offer data analytics technology to businesses of all sizes. With no coding or scripting required, business analysts can analyze data themselves, without having to draw IT or data scientists into the process. So, besides for the very easy setup, good price compared to other solutions, lower implementation cost than the competition, no requirement for outside consulting (that Russel and Bruno mentioned below), SiSense also provides powerful technology that makes it easy for business users to go through every step of BI: from scattered data to dashboards without relying on IT. Meaning, a non-technical user can access data by joining multiple data sources into a single repository, then build a dashboard with and array of data visualizations, and share the dashboard with the team--all without coding, programming, or complete dependency on IT. A lot of the other companies Russel listed lack the ability to make joining the data easy, and often needs IT to help regular business users do that. Hope that helped!    Embed Quote
