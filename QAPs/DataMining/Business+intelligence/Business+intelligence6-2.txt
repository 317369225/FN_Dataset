What are the most cost effective Business Intelligence tools?
The biggest cost we found with BI is the data integration piece.  It is less about the license cost and much more about the time and effort required to try to get the tools to do what you want.  One of the biggest issues is typically the need to coordinate mulpile tools to solve your problem (ETL, DW, DM, Cubes, OLAP tools, etc.). Because there is not shared metadata model across these tools it is all on the customer to figure out how to use them together.   The other issue is with the amount of coding required even in the new tools that have become more popular.  QlikView, which we experimented with was able to create very dynamic dashboards.  The problem was though that you had to develop in 3-4 different development languages/syntaxes to do anything beyond a simple prototype where all the data starts out perfectly named and structured.   I have been involved with using Altosoft which did allow for the development of very advanced BI solutions with no coding.  Frankly it was the fastest implementation environment we saw.  The only limitation was that it didn't have deep statisitical functions and the dahboard was well designed but lacked some of the bells and whistles of some of the newer products.  I have heard that they are  about to introduce a new version which is supposed to be a complete rewrite of the dashboard to address this limitation.  I think it is available for free download on their site.    I am not a big fan of most of the SAAS BI solutions mentioned because they seem to greatly underestimate the data loading and transformation issues associated with real-world data sources where nothing is ever conveniently named and data is spread across multiple systems of record.  If all you need is Excel in the cloud they are fine.  In my experience though getting the data is the hardest part and they completely underestimate this.    Embed Quote
