I have an MBA, but I firmly believe that Business knowledge and skills can be adequately gained from the workplace, especially if you are a consultant with enough drive, open-mindedness, and suave to learn from your numerous client companies. I don't recommend getting a technical Master's degree since there is none that will be specialized and practical enough to support your BI aspirations.

Specific BI Software (Hyperion, Cognos, etc.) Design, Implementation and Support 5. Dashboard and Key Performance Indicator metrics 6. Enterprise Architecture Functional 1. Requirement gathering 2. Project Management 3. Consensus Building 4. Negotiation 5. Financial and Accounting know-how ... (list is not exhaustive)    Embed Quote
