What are the most interesting cloud business intelligence companies?
I would take a look at Birst, Gooddata and Altosoft.  The first two are newer entrants and SAAS-BI only but they are getting alot of attention - particularly Birst.  They are built around the idea that you simply load your data into the their cloud and they will manage the data warehouse and other infrastructure from there.   Altosoft is different in that they use the same code base for both on-premise and the cloud which is interesting for larger companies that may need to start one place and migrate later or manage a hybrid cloud/on-premise approach.  If you look at Altosoft make sure you ask them about their newest release which includes a complete rewrite of their dashboard server.  I would wait until this is available on the cloud version.   Another name that has been out there for a while is OCO.  My understnading is that they are really a collection of BI solutions for specific business areas (like manufacturing and supply chain management).  They don't seem to be a general purpose BI product liek the other three.  I think they actually use Business Object SAAS Bi offering in their product somehow (and unfrotunately the BO product is not real impressive).    Embed Quote
