Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
You not knowing stuff is perfectly fine. You can always learn them. But you are not interested in math, stats and programming, I would say there are many other career options out there you should be pursuing. I would not say that to be a good data analyst, you need to be a good programmer. But math and stats are MUST have for any data analyst. What you would need is a brain seasoned to think analytically and crunch numbers well.    Embed Quote
