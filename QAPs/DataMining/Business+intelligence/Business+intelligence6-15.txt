What are the most cost effective Business Intelligence tools?
I can appreciate the people below trying to help sell their products (BIME etc), but the fundamental question is if BI is the right tool for the job, and if so will a VW do or do you really need a Rolls Royce? Just pitching a one-size-fits-all scenario shies away from the question the OP asked.   I have to agree with Elana Roth Katzor below in that many of these tools that call themselves BI Tools are really just Reporting/Analysis Tools - front ends. That is fine, if that is what you are after; and many SMEs will be as they have data in Access and Excel or other similar product that can easily dump out CSVs and are happy to drag and drop them into some webpage uploader for basic analysis.   Owners of Big Data (Enterprise especially) are not going to have much use for these as their data set is too large and too valuable to send across the net. Businesses with their own OLTP or even DWs are almost always going to go with the SAP, Microstrategy, BO, Cognos tools - and either hire their own staff or pay for consultants. There is a gap between enterprise level business and SMEs though, and this is poorly catered for - the big guys are too expensive and ROI is not there, SAAS implementations  just do not take into account the complexities of ETL (especially with respect to OLTP systems where aggregation is non existent and data at atomic levels and often not directly relatable), the size of data sets and the depth of analysis/mining required.   The big guys offer scaled down (even free) versions in an attempt to bridge the gap, but these are often just too staff/hardware intensive and more enticements to scale up than real long term solutions IMO.    Embed Quote
