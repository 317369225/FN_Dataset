What is a good primer (book) on business intelligence?
Ah, very tough to say. As Henry points out, Business Intelligence is quite ambiguous. If you're speaking about the more traditional business intelligence stack, then it breaks down into a number of topics, each of which has its own literature, from Data Warehousing to ETL to reporting and ad hoc querying. I wouldn't recommend books in this space per se. Instead, I'd try just checking out videos on google, as strange as that sounds. Start by googling OLAP (a super vague phrase that means 10 different things) and just surf the videos as you discover about DW, ETL, ERP, KPIs, etc. My company is planning on releasing a brief overview of the more common BI terms and removing the typical BS that surrounds them soon. Check out http://chart.io in about a few weeks. Hopefully, it'll be up.    Embed Quote
