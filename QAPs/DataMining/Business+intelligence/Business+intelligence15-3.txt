Can Business Intelligence (BI) meet business expectations?
BI is not a static deliverable,  it evolves and changes as the business needs change (which is quite often).   So in my opinion,  most companies adopt legacy bi products and deployment with a set of requirements (report of x,y,z,  chart of a,b,c) without any realization that the most important part of the project is NOT day 1,  but day 365. To keep users satisfied they must have a solution that is easy for the USER to create new ad-hoc queries on-demand and to quickly extend the reporting and dashboard capabilities to support new datasources or modified datasources with none to limited involvement by IT.   If the business user has to go to a centralized report writing department or IT to get the new information they need: #BI #FAIL.    Check out this inforgraphic I just posted on my blog yesterday,  it describes some of the roadblocks/failure,  this one is specific to the Public Sector but it applies to all industries http://www.yurbi.com/blog/bi-tho...    Embed Quote
