Business Intelligence: Who actually uses BI tools?
BI tools are not universal.  Far from it. In fact, research shows that less than 24% of employees use BI tools...(reference is @ What’s up Big Data?). There are lots of theory for why - but mostly: BI tools are too expensive, too complicated and still require specialized skillset to operate. The industry is evolving but slowly - happy to chat more about what else we see in the space.    Embed Quote
