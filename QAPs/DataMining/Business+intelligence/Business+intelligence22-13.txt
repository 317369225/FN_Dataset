Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
Hey . I am not a Data scientist to answer this. But, I can assure you one thing that, if you learn data analysis through various courseea,edx courses you can be very successful. Only thing is that you change your perspective. Its hard to learn initially. Read even you dont understand, slowly you will start to learn. I am doing it right now. So interesting. learn R and Python as main programming languages.    Embed Quote
