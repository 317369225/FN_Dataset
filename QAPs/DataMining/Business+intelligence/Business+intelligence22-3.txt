Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
Since a lot of the skills that would help you out like programming, math, stats aren't up your alley,  if you still want to pursue a career in Analytics/BI, I suggest you look at the applicability/use-cases/functional aspect to begin with.  If you are good at logically thinking through real-world applications for Analytics/BI, you'll have a significant contribution to a team. Honestly, that just requires a keen understanding of how businesses work and where you can identify an opportunity to do things smarter leveraging the data that's being generated.  Programming/Math/Stats are like the hammer but knowing where to hit the nail on the wall is as important.  All the best!    Embed Quote
