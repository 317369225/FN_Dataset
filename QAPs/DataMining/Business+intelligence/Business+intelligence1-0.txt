What is the difference between business intelligence and business analytics?
This is a question that will probably yield a difference responses depending on who you ask.  I'll see if I can do my best to define what these mean to me with a little more clarity and explanation than simply googling them will do. Business Intelligence Very broad term that to me means using the data available to your organization to make factually based business decisions.  This can take on a number of forms and methods but generally includes doing things such as developing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Trending Analysis, Predictive Modeling, dashboards, etc.  There are also a few variations of the Business Intelligence Maturity Model (http://bi-insider.com/portfolio/...) which basically categorizes the extent to which an organization leverages BI to make key decisions. Business Analytics To me is about the same thing as BI.  If I had to differentiate, I would say Business Analytics is the heart of BI that doesn't include the actual business decision making, but the steps that lead up to the decision. Data Mining Somewhat more defined, is the process of looking for trends, patterns, or other useful information within sets of data.  This is typically done as part of "exploratory analytics".  This is becoming a much bigger part of the BI process with the rapid adoption of big data solutions like Hadoop and NoSQL and the new concept of a Data Scientist within an organization.    Embed Quote
