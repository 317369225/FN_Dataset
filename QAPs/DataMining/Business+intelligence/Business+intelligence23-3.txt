What are the best business intelligence solutions?
I don't know your requirements, but Chartio ("A powerful business intelligence tool that anyone can use.") is an excellent BI tool for business users. In addition to all the functionality you'd expect, we have some unique advantages: Chartio doesn't require SQL or a proprietary language, making it an excellent choice for business users. Because of our drag-and-drop chart creation tool, Chartio gets much wider adoption in organizations than legacy BI tools. SQL is still available to those users who prefer it. We have the fastest set-up in BI. It's possible to add new data sources to Chartio in minutes. This makes it easier, less expensive, and more predictable to set up Chartio. Chartio links to your live data, so you always have current information. Our charts look great – simple & beautiful, with no chart junk.    Embed Quote
