How do Jasper and Pentaho compare as business intelligence solutions?
Has anyone here seen Yellowfin? Yellowfin beat Pentaho and Jaspersoft in the BARC survey, and came number one in the Dresner Survey which is actually voted for by the customers and their experience of the product. for Mobile Business Intelligence One of the most impressive features is the scalability - one customer is running 180,000 users of just a handful of servers, so it's great for large community deployments. It also contains features like a Facebook-like interface for sharing information found on reports and dashboards with others, and a PowerPoint-like presentation feature so you can have your monthly board-meeting presentations dynamically updated. Yellowfin also deploys across all mobile devices with the developer needing to do a thing. Finally, it actually comes in cheaper than the support on the 'Open Source' alternatives.    Embed Quote Updated 8 May, 2014. 1,085 views.
