Business Intelligence: How is Domo priced and how does it compare with Tableau and QlikView?
We are very small company and were told it would be $50-$60k paid upfront for a year.  I don't know if subsequent years were lump sum payments or spread out.  It is a little bizarre to me how 1) secretive they are and 2) how aggressive they are with marketing dollars and sales.  Personally, I feel that I am being stalked.  By very very friendly people.  But still.  it creeps me out.    Embed Quote
