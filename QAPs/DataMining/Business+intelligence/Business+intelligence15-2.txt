Can Business Intelligence (BI) meet business expectations?
There are a few reasons for this. 1) BI initiatives must be owned by the Business, but delivered by IT. Typically IT owns and delivers BI, which is prone to failure. 2) BI depends heavily on the quality of data. Its an ongoing process to keep the quality of data good so that the BI can be good. More often than not, this does not happen and eventually the BI initiative is termed as a failure. 3) Business needs are dynamic and hence new requirements need to be accommodated with quick turnaround. Agile methodologies must be used but more often than not, waterfall methodologies are used for BI initiatives, which eventually becomes "too little, too late".
