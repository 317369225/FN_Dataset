Business Intelligence: Who actually uses BI tools?
I work for a Business Intelligence company, BIME Analytics. I do online marketing, so I guess you are speaking about my kind of statements. But these statements are truly correct, these days everyone needs business intelligence. Most people think of legacy BI behemoths that cost a fortune and are highly complicated, but it doesn't have to be that way. Everyone and these days, everything (IoT) generates data. Tons of it. If you could turn that data into information, and use that information to your advantage, you can see that BI has a huge potential for everyone. BI needs to be accessible to everyone, simple, affordable, but also powerful and secure. But it's still a nebulous sector, and many companies have yet to discover the potential. But those who have discovered it, truly do come from everywhere. SMBs, Fortune 500 companies, and from all different kinds of departments (sales, marketing, management, etc). See our list of clients here. I'd love to see what people could produce when BI catches on fully. But BI is definitely universal.    Embed Quote
