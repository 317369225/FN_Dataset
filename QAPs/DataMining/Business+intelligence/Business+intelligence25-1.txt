Which Business Intelligence tool is best in current market?
I would say BIME Analytics. The current market needs Business Intelligence that is accessible for all, not just budget wise, but also ease of use, whilst being powerful and can scale.

Accessible for all also means BI experts and analysts  as well as non tech savvy business users. Yi Ting Wang summed up pretty well the features you should be looking for, and BIME has it all.
