What is the best business intelligence software?
Your question implies that you believe usability is a key element of the best business intelligence software. We agree. Business users can get full value out of Chartio without needing to use SQL or a proprietary language.  Not only can you query your data, but you can transform the data within our drag-and-drop interface. Our vision is to make business intelligence as easy to use as the common spreadsheet. Many of our customers are already seeing that level of usage among their users.    Embed Quote
