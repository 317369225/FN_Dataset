Business Intelligence: Who actually uses BI tools?
The main consumer for BI tools are the  internal company Analysts- marketing, finance, operations etc... basically all the number crunchers.  In order for Analysts to get their data, they need the technical backend folks to make it happen which includes the ETL folks. Don't be fooled BI tools is not the golden solution to all problems.  BI tools helps sifts through gigabytes of data and surface "problems". Example- identify out of millions of transactions all Purchase Orders above Material cost. In addition, BI tools allows you illustrate data that an Excel sheet can not do. Keep in mind- BI Tools are worth "Nothing" with out a relational database on the backend.  In other words, the data must be modeled on the backend first! BI is the icing on the cake- You need the Cake- and that's the Database!  Any questions, please contact me directly at maurice.berdugo@bpanalytics.com.Home - BP Analytics    Embed Quote
