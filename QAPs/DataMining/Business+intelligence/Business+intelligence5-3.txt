Make or buy BI (Business Intelligence)?
(I'm going to assume "tech firm" implies startup.) Build vs. buy? Based on my experience, the best solution for an end-to-end BI solution will always include some amount of "build" and (likely) some (hopefully significant) chunks of "buy". When  it comes to source data, every company is unique and it's highly unlikely there's a third-party solution that can simply integrate with all your sources out of the box. You're going to need dev work done to pull data from and build ETL on top of all desired sources. Once you've got your source data into a "BI-ready" schema, however, there are likely third-party (hopefully relatively cheap SaaS/PaaS) solutions which will help you put the data in front of your users in a way that enables non-SQL-literate users at all levels to build and share their own reports and dashboards. (I'm a big fan of GoodData for this last piece though there seem to be others catching on to the size of the opportunity in this space such as Domo and Birst.)    Embed Quote
