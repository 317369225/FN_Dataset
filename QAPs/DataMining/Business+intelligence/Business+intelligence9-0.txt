What is the best business intelligence software?
When you look at the products produced by the major "traditional" BI players (IBM Cognos, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle and Microstrategy) there is no way to say that any is objectively better or more practical than the others. In fact, in terms of features and functionality there is very little daylight between these products. What differences there are arise primarily from the requirements of individuals and the organizations within them. One company will say that they used Cognos for years but then switched to Oracle's OBIEE because it is far superior for one reason or another, while another company will switch from OBIEE to Cognos. It all comes down to requirements and preferences. You also mentioned Tableau in your question, but Tableau, Spotfire, Qlikview are considered data visualization tools. People do use them for analysis, as they do BI tools, but there is a difference -  each has its strengths and weaknesses.    Embed Quote
