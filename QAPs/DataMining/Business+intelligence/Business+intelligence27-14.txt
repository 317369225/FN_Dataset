What is the best, reasonably priced business intelligence application?
Late here but do checkout InfoCaptor. I am the founder so certainly biased but do check out the pricing page and see how it compares with others in the industry. It gives you end to end analytics and dashboard experience. And you can use the cloud service or host it within your own network.    Embed Quote
