What is the difference between "business intelligence" and "business analytics"?

Big Data is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications. Due to its technical nature, the same challenges arise in Analytics at much lower volumes than what is traditionally considered Big Data.
