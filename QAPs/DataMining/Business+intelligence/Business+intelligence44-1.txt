What are key factors that drive success in deploying Business Intelligence?
I'll only write on one emerging area related to your question. Combining advanced analytics with traditional BI reporting.  By advanced I referring to the type of analysis that results from neural networks, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.   One of the most common uses of BI is to report data with multiple segmentations.  We you apply clustering algorithms to the dataset you will see a completely different segmentation of the data.  Cluster algorithms can either be supervised (were you set the inputs to a selected output (f:X->Y) ) or unsuprevised where the algorithm determines the relationship between all variables.  This can be very useful in looking at customer data.  It gives you insight into the behaviors of your customers and that may change the way you group them. You can also get great value by using advanced predictive analyses, and then showing the predictions along side with the operational data that is related to.  A good example is to show historic sales, with projected sales.  Most BI tools provide a simple what-if capability, which pales in comparison to a well consider predictive analysis.  IBM calls this Forward Looking Business Intelligence.  It really can makes your BI platform much more strategic.    Embed Quote
