Which business intelligence tools have the best user interface?
I recommend that you try BIME, we launched our latest version a few months ago and it is fully web-based and you can view your dashboards on tablet and mobile. It has every options that you'd expect from a modern Business Intelligence tool and some of our clients say that "the interface is attractive and user friendly". There is no setup required, you juste have to create an account on our website and you're good to go (you have a 14 days trial to test it).    Embed Quote
