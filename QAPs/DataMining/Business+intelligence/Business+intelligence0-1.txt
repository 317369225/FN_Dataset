What is the future of business intelligence?
I agree with a lot of what Jason Kolb said. I work for Semantria, a text and sentiment analysis API provider, and we've noticed that a lot of our new clients are BI companies, or BI centric. The main use case we run into with BI companies is that they tend to turn yammer, chatter, and other corporate messaging feeds into structured information. It gives corporate users a dashboard which tells them what's going on in their organization. The second most common one we have revolves around collecting internal and external unstructured data such as tweets, facebook posts, blogs, and PR stuff. They then correlate it to their other business performance indicators and kpis, for predictive analytics and other use cases. Bottom line, all BI companies are looking to turn an unstructured data mess into pretty pie charts, and gauges, that the CEO can keep looking at all day long. Semantria is the basic foundation for all of our clients BI needs, but there are plenty of other text and sentiment analysis providers out there. If you don't have text analytics tech under your belt as a BI company, you're going to fall behind fast. P.S. You can check us out at http://www.semantria.com    Embed Quote
