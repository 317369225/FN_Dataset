What is the best, reasonably priced business intelligence application?
Hey, I would recommend SiSense- Business Intelligence Software - SiSense Prism). Their prices are most definitely lower than most BI tools, partly because they have a unique technology that requires only standard hardware and no "consulting hours" from super technical people so the total cost of ownership is lower. As a non-technical business user myself, I always love with software that lets me see a complete view of all my marketing data, which is why I joined the SiSense team. SiSense software lets me actually get my hands on my data, build beautiful interactive dashboards with instantaneous data manipulation, get real-time data analysis, and share everything with my team.
