Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
Thanks for A2A. Well, to be honest here, Data Analytics/Business Intelligence is a mixture of a lot of stuffs. You will need some good number crunching skills, great analytical abilities and a good domain knowledge of the particular problem which you are analyzing as an analyst. The prerequisites can be said to be: Good math/stat skills. Understanding of quantitative stuff and a bit advanced knowledge idea and familiarity with statistical concepts related to analytics. Good Coding skills Not just the basic programming languages like C, Java, Python etc, but also R and tools like SAS, SPSS etc. And, data analytics would also include Big-data analytics and as such a working knowledge of big-data technologies like Hadoop and stuff would be needed. ( I am not saying that you need to know all that before you take admission in a course for DA/BI,  but those are what you will encounter during the course, and based on your description of yourself, I don't think you will like it, and neither will you be able to survive it.) Domain knowledge As a business intelligence analyst, you will have the responsibility of analyzing a certain problem of a certain domain and you will need to apply your analytics techniques to that very domain. For that you will need a working domain knowledge of the industry and stuff. I hope that won't be a problem for you. Well, what most MS in Business Analytics courses mention is that they "prefer candidates from a highly quantitative background". That is a prerequisite. If you now develop your coding skills and starting loving everything that you mentioned you don't like, then you have a chance. I suggest you consider another field that is less quantitative. There are plenty :) All the best.    Embed Quote
