What are the most cost effective Business Intelligence tools?
This really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. MicroStrategy, for instance, released a free BI tool (MicroStrategy Analytics Desktop) awhile back. It's great for self-service visual analysis. However, this was not built to be an enterprise BI solution. So, some important questions to ask are: - How many users does your BI tool need to support? - How big is your data warehouse or will you strictly be uploading spreadsheets? - What is the average profile of users who will be using the BI tool? How tech savvy are they? - Are you looking for something that can be deployed across different departments and need a data agnostic platform? - Will you need offline access and write back capabilities? If so, a Mobile solution is something to consider. If you plan on starting small and scaling up, I especially encourage you to explore the enterprise software standards out there. A lot of the standalone BI tools create data silos, which can eventually spiral out of control. I am biased towards MicroStrategy as a one tool fits all solution. It has been around for 20+ years and has natively built their entire platform, which means that it integrates seamlessly across different product offerings and consumption methods. In the past few years, it has invested heavily in creating a suite of product offerings that are both IT and business user friendly.    Embed Quote
