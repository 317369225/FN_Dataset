How do Jasper and Pentaho compare as business intelligence solutions?
At TrustRadius we just released our Buyer's Guide to Business Intelligence Software that covers both of these products in the Top Rated Open Source Based Full-stack BI Software section.  You can get your free copy here: https://www.trustradius.com/guid....  Based upon the in-depth user reviews, both are highly rated with Pentaho having the edge.  Pentaho reviewers note very strong ETL and data integration capabilities, but say support can be haphazard and there are inconsistencies in the look and feel across different modules.  Also mentioned is the difficulty to find developer resources with Pentaho expertise. Jaspersoft reviewers are highly satisfied with the ad-hoc reporting capabilities and the ease of creating pixel-perfect reports. The ETL capabilities are also cited for working well. Like Pentaho, complaints are focused on the quality of support but also include the difficulty of installing and managing the software.    Embed Quote
