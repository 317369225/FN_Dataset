Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
The point is what you like not what you know, everything can be learnt, however to enjoy the learning, you must like/love it. Data analytics is not sql, it is converting data to useful information like 80% website visitors are wrong targets - now that is useful for a shopping cart website. So it includes capturing right data and then analyzing it. Tools only help you achieve it, which can always be learnt. However, analysis always includes measurement like 'a lot of website visitors are wrong targets' does not help....you should be able to measure. So yes, stats if not core maths will take a liking. In the era of being able to do anything, don't live a safe life, look what you like doing,do it and do it well......you will be a winner in life and soul. It doesnot take a genius to be genius but the thought 'why not me?'    Embed Quote
