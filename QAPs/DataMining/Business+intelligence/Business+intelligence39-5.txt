What is the best business intelligence tool for a ecommerce store running on Magento?
Hi Rud, There are a lot of good choices, and you list many of them. I'm proud to work at RJMetrics, and I'm happy we made your list. Here's my thought for you, as unbiased as humanly possible. There is a difference (currently) between ecommerce analytics and BI. Ecommerce analytics covers stuff like average order value, repeat purchase rate, margin analysis, merchandise analysis...and much more. These are all things that will help you "go deep" on your core ecommerce business and make better tactical decisions. Traditional BI is better for connecting 12 different data sources and showing you high-level dashboards. It's mostly for monitoring KPIs, not for conducting deep analyses and making decisions to change aspects of your marketing and merchandizing functions. Both are really valuable. And at some point in the not-too-distant future, they may very well not be two different tool categories. But currently ecommerce companies are better served by looking at a tool that is focused on their specific needs. I'd suggest killing the items on your list that aren't specifically focused on ecommerce and maybe adding another 1-2 that are focused on ecommerce. Based on our experience working with hundreds of ecommerce customers, there's a huge difference in terms of the value you can derive from the tool. It's a wide open space...we're probably the farthest along on the premium side of things, but there are several new competitors that are providing super-simple tools for very little $$. Based on how mature you are as a company, either could be the right decision. Have a good one and good luck! Tristan    Embed Quote
