What are the best use cases for Mobile Business Intelligence ?
I would argue that the use cases for mobile bi are universally the same as, err, non-mobile bi.  What changes are the the requirements for accessibility and presentation; not the underlying data driving the analytics, report or dashboard in question. Ex. iPad/Android BI app with real/near-time access to data versus laptop access requiring VPN connection to a corporate network so one can download a PDF of a report generated yesterday.  Given this, I would say the increasing appetite for easily accessible real and near real-time data presented in a visually appealing way on a broad array of mobile devices better characterizes the requirement and driving force behind  mobile BI.  More so, I would suggest, than any particular functional use case.    Embed Quote
