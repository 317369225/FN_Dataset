Business Intelligence: What's the BI software/application landscape going to look like in the next 5 years?
Looker's CEO, Frank Bien, wrote a great piece about trends we envision for 2014. Here's a slideshare - The Top 5 BI Shifts for 2014 Quickly, they are: 1. This year, size won't matter. It's about getting value out of data, not how much you can store. 2. Companies will put data in the hands of their employees. 3. Data collaboration will become even more paramount and ubiquitous. 4. Data analysts will get modern tools, similar to web developers in years past. 5. Traditional data warehousing paradigms will continue to die. So, pretty similar to what others have said. If you're interested in how Looker capitalizes on our trends, feel free to give me a shout!    Embed Quote
