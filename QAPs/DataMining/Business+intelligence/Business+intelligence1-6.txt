What is the difference between business intelligence and business analytics?
I agree with Christ Schrader, particularly in saying that the definitions very by individual. BI and BA are typically used interchangeably by most people within the industry. Data Mining is the only one of those terms that has a somewhat definite definition (personally I prefer the term Data Discovery instead of Data Mining because it better conveys what you are aiming for) Data Discovery/Data Mining it is analysing data from multiple perspectives using varied methods in order to find useful information that can be used to find key performance indicators, increase revenues, cut costs, or all three. It is the act of finding correlations or patterns within your data, figuring out what they mean, and taking advantage of that pattern or corelation.    Embed Quote
