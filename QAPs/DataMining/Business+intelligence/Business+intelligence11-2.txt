Business Intelligence: Who actually uses BI tools?
The real users are the business users (marketers, sales management, ...) - the ETL and IT guy is needed to bring the data into the system. Most business users do some form of BI - even if it's a bunch of excel sheets. The reason for this is that as soon as you run a topic that is not trivial (like understanding the flow of visitors to your website and how they convert into $ over time) the amount of data you handle is not something you can hold in your brain or on a piece of paper so you start relying on some form of storage, calculation, aggregation and segmentation to make sense out of the data.    Embed Quote
