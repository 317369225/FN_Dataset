What are the best use cases for Mobile Business Intelligence ?
Mobile BI is great for people who need information but can't be connected to a desktop or laptop all day.  For example: Executives - They want to see high level dashboards on sales, operations, marketing, and finance, to know at a glance how their business is doing.  And they want it on their iPhone, Droid, or Pre, which is on them all the time. Sales Teams - They can see how their pipe is doing, which deals are at risk, and which deals they can possibly pull forward into this quarter in order to make their number. And they can do that while driving between sales calls, on the plane, or prepping before a meeting. Field Service - They can check information on part inventory availability, production times, etc. all from a cell phone, tablet computer, or ruggedized device. Due to smaller screen sizes, mobile BI is mostly used for data consumption and exploration - that is, reviewing and exploring dashboards and reports - rather than doing complex calculations or ad hoc reporting.  However, there are a *lot* of situations where this can come into play.
