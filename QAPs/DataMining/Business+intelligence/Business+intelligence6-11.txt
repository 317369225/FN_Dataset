What are the most cost effective Business Intelligence tools?
As other people have pointed out, "cost effective" is a relative term- it also depends on what you're trying to accomplish and what the implications of the problem are (in terms of dollar value, speed, competitiveness, etc.) A lot of people try to solve BI problems with a spreadsheet tool like Excel - it's extremely cost effective since most people already have it, but it's also extremely limited in terms of what it can do. It's not really BI. There are also very cheap tools out there that call themselves BI, but don't really handle much data, join tables, pull information from a variety of sources, etc. If you want a real BI solution, there are now modern alternatives to the big, complex, expensive software packages like OBIEE, Microstrategy, Cognos, and Business Objects. If you want to build yourself, check out an open source solution like Pentaho.  The software cost is very low, but you have to pay for support and do most of the work yourself, so your internal resource costs can be high. Or, you can check out the new SaaS BI solutions. They're low cost, subscription based, and don't require lots of IT resources to implement and maintain. You should check out the latest Gartner BI Magic Quadrant report, which covers SaaS BI providers for the first time.  Vendors that made the cut included Birst (www.birst.com), PivotLink (www.pivotlink.com), and Oco (www.oco-inc.com). Satisfaction rankings for all three were fairly high.  For Birst, for example, all customers interviewed saw themselves with the company for the next 5 years.
