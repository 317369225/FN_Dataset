What is a good primer (book) on business intelligence?
Great question. I have looked and looked, and the gulf between the deep algorithmic plumbing (10 flavors of OLAP) and the managerial success stories (Ayers, Davenport) feels pretty wide. Both perspectives are necessary, but the overlap is what matters: if you want to use data to retain customers better in a hospitality scenario, what data do you need, how clean must it be, and will regression analysis be useful? Or if you have a quality issue in a complex manufacturing process, should a genetic algorithm ever be deployed?  Forecasting is its own domain entirely, with more questions about processes, data quality, and the relevant toolset. In short, and we're struggling to figure out how best to teach this, how you you combine process knowledge and business awareness with database-fu and statistical mechanics?    Embed Quote
