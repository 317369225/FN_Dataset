How should one begin career in data mining/business intelligence?
My personal experience is as follows. I completed the Master's of Science in Analytics degree from NCSU (http://analytics.ncsu.edu/, recently referenced in a Harvard Businees Review article http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scie...). There is a similar program at Northwestern (http://scs.northwestern.edu/info...). This is a very applied program that gave me broad exposure to the generally accepted practices and technologies in data science, facilitated an 8-month internship with a very analytically driven consumer credit risk department at one of the countries largest financial institutions, and conducted on-campus recruiting sessions with over 50 companies. This program excels at placing students into blue chip data mining/big data/predictive analytics positions (think: IBM, SAS, B of A, Chase, Deloitte Consulting ...). They have also placed students at Ebay and I had interviews with companies like Linkedin, Google and Cloudera following this program, but they did not seem to have same comfort level with my degree as the previously mentioned firms. They often asked me to consider interning, which I simply could not as I had full-time offers from leading data mining/big data/predictive analytics groups. Previous to participating in the MSA program, I had programming experience from two start-ups and graduate education in science. Both of these were extremely helpful during the program and my job hunt, and are still relevant at my data science job today. If heading back to school isn't what you had in mind, perhaps a certification could be helpful. SAS certifications are widely respected in the commercial data mining realm (http://support.sas.com/certify/). A google search turned up Hadoop certifications from Cloudera (http://university.cloudera.com/c...). However, I have no personal experience with them.  (This is more information than I like to share about myself on the web - hence the anon post. Obviously, some of you could figure out who I am... If you would like more information, please post your email and I will get in touch. Also, I am in the beginning stages of my data science career so take this advice with a grain of salt.)    Embed Quote
