Is data analytics/business intelligence a good career option for me?
As I always answer "Is X a good career option for me?": Yes. If you're thinking or it, you're curious. If you're curious, give it a try. It's only you who can decide. It's no shame if you call it not your field after a year, a month or a week. But, by all means: if it feels like something that might excite you a a career, give it a shot. One can be a good analyst in Excel. Get a few practical tasks, ideally, an internship. Don't over-invest into technologies; instead, be agile and try to formulate precise questions and answer those with data. Answers are secondary to questions and tools are secondary to answers. All the best! Dima (Wow, I've answered an anonymous A2A. Wow!)    Embed Quote
