What are the best business intelligence solutions?
There are 100+ reviews of BI and data visualization tools from real users and other experts. I did a bit of research on our site, IT Central Station, and found some reviews which may be helpful in your research process. Our reviews are verified and crowdsourced - here are a couple useful excerpts: QlikView - "For the user QlikView is a wonderful tool of data discovery, providing powerful tools to navigate easily between a sea of data in an intuitive, easy, and clear way, allowing them to go from facts to KPI and vice versa. Qlikview can be used both as an advanced reporting tool as well as an BI KPI tool, becoming the base for continuous process improvements. In general the benefits of the tool become clear at the early development stage when the user is challenged to input clearly his ideas, problems and needs and that will affect the process in which he participates."

Doesn't require me to think about the level of aggregation that I'm going to need as it deals with large data sets. Blends disparate datasets together which is awesome for plan vs actual reports where the data is a two different levels of granularity."
