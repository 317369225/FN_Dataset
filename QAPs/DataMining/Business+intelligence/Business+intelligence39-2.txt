What is the best business intelligence tool for a ecommerce store running on Magento?
Unfortunately, there is no one tool that will solve your need. The first thing that needs to happen is build an integrated data warehouse that brings data from all disparate sources, merges them and puts into one place. No tool can do this. If anyone claims that their tool can do this, they are not telling the full story. What you first need is an ETL resource that can do this. Once this is in place, you can put all sort of tools on top of it to do build reports and analysis. From the above list, it looks like rjmetrics is the closest to what you need and will provide you with full service. I would start with them.    Embed Quote
