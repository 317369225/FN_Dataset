What are the best business intelligence solutions?
We have done a large amount of research and identified 46 different BI products. And while it is difficult to say which is the "Best", our site does allow you to define specific criteria and narrow down your search based on your specific needs. For example, if you need a cloud-based tool to monitor social media for a restaurant, and you need real-time analysis and 24/7 support, it would recommend MetaMarkets. Try it out here: Business Intelligence Software Comparison - 2014's Best Tools Or if you prefer a more direct route, you can always call our product advisor for Business Intelligence: Noel Heath (615-610-1770). Her job is to answer any questions you might have about BI and direct you towards a product that fits your needs perfectly. Let me know if you have any questions! Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
