Are there any desktop business intelligence tools for data analytics?
The trouble with data analysis is that you first need to know what question it is you want to answer. Preparing the questions you need to ask and having a thorough understanding of the data you're modelling will make it quicker to get to the answer you're looking for. As for software, Pentaho is an excellent package that gives you the business intelligence tools you need - data analysis, modelling, reporting, ETL and big data integration into Hadoop and NoSQL datasources.  The Community Edition (Pentaho CE) is free to use and, although the software does have server elements, I've run the suite from my desktop in the past. For truly lightweight data analysis though, I think it's hard to beat querying the data directly using SQL (or whatever is appropriate for your datasource).  This has the advantage of making sure you really know your data inside out.    Embed Quote
