What is the best Business Intelligence software in the marketplace?
I would recommend Phocas Business Intelligence Software (Phocas Software - There’s nothing complicated about business intelligence software. Not if you do it right.). Phocas ranks in the top quadrant of the 2012 Gartner BI survey for 'Ease of Use', 'Overall Customer Experience' and 'Overall BI Success' as surveyed by customers.    Embed Quote
