Which Business Intelligence tool is best in current market?
I agree with Yi-Ting Wang in that it really depends on the individual business's needs. But with that being said Capsidea is an option not listed here by any comments. I work for capsidea, but its a great option for small business BI. Its free for a ton of its features making it pain free to try and there are no trial limits on these features. Theyre just free in general. Its a cloud-based service so the initial costs are very low. The capsidea development team are constantly working on making the interface as intuitive as possible which is just another way of lowering the 'cost' of using the solution. Check it out!
