What is the future of business intelligence?
There are two main concepts which will rule business intelligence in the future from data user/consumer perspective: Replacement of traditional reports/dashboards with live "data feeds" Empowering all users to become data analysts Replacement of traditional reports/dashboards with live "data feeds" I have been playing for a long time with the idea of analytics tools more resembling Twitter, Facebook or other popular social networking services because the biggest issues with current reports are: there is too many of them they don't change in time which results into fact that users are: overloaded with the content they consume (imagine Facebook showing you all activities from all friends) bored with the content they consume (imagine staring at the profile every day which has low or no activity at all) Therefore, business intelligence ultimately needs to result into more "feed-like" applications/interfaces which: filters only the content (understand reports/charts) user is interested in (based on his/her position, previous interactions, recommendations) changes in time and keeps the newest (most recent) facts in highlights while burying what has been seen and understood. Empowering all users to become data analysts For company to be successful in the future, everyone has to be and think like a data analyst. Unfortunately, current BI tools were built around “league of extraordinary heroes” from BI department who precisely guard gates to all company data and provide access only through reports and dashboards. This worked well in the past but times are changing, data are growing, requests are cumulating and the narrow bridge between business and data is not sufficient any more. Once your “heroes” are overloaded with requests, reports delivered too late and users craving for more power, its time to look for solution which enables everyone to instantly become data analyst and start developing his/her own reports while not having data wizard or coding hero skills. And benefits can be seen immediately: faster data discovery, delivery and decisions unbounded specialists for more strategic tasks increased employees skills and responsibilities lower operations and maintenance costs I think BellaDati Agile BI is especially strong in empowering end users to become data analysts through great UX and human-centric approach to analytics.    Embed Quote
