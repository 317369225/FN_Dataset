What are the best use cases for Mobile Business Intelligence ?
I think Barbara Lewis said it well, but I will add two user-types: Digital Marketer: Having close friends that are in internet marketing I'm told that if they are walking in between campus buildings, or to their next meeting it's handy to be able to check on all of their web analytics information and more. Product Manager: Product Managers always want a sense of how their product is performing and love the high level graphs and trends that are available, but always want the option to dive into more detail if they would like to. Full disclosure: I am involved with a startup, Trendslide, helping to make Business Intelligence mobile. http://www.trendslide.com    Embed Quote
