Make or buy BI (Business Intelligence)?
With today's modern business intelligence tools, the economics of writing your own BI interface don't make a lot of sense. Development resources are scarce. Why use them to build tools that are already available to purchase for less than the cost of on full time engineer. Maintenance costs are going to be much higher for DIY systems, as your systems change over time. Time to value is much better with cloud software. Chartio (http://chartio.com), we can have you up and running in less time than it would take you to create a project plan for writing your own BI system. Support costs are going to be higher for your own system. Support is included with our service. There's no additional cost.There may have been a time when there was a serious build/buy question when considering legacy BI systems, particularly when you considered that many of them included their own software development costs. But those days are over for most businesses.    Embed Quote
