What is the difference between "business intelligence" and "business analytics"?
BI is commonly regarded as the superset, Analytics the subset, I agree with Augusto and Seth here. Analytics tends to refer to analysis that requires more complex or statistical calculation (e.g. predictive) although Increasingly I hear more precise and/ or alternative definitions. Confusingly, some vendors such as IBM and SAS refer to the superset as Analytics. I suspect this is because the term BI is beginning to show it's age and they want to draw attention to the more recent innovations and acquisitions they have made here. Hey, it's their market and, of course, the field is continually evolving so our definitions will too.    Embed Quote
