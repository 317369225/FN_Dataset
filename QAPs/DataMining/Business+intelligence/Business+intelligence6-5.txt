What are the most cost effective Business Intelligence tools?
I must confess I am biased as I work for the company but Bime http://bimeanalytics.com sounds perfect for what you are looking for. Bime is a SaaS BI solution that let's the small guys unlock the big data. The solution is highly scalable so you can tailor it to your business needs and the solution involves minimal CapEx (Capital Expenditure), requires little infrastructure and thus is extremely competitively priced. Bime was built with userbility in mind so the simple drag and drop interface is easy to utilise and thus can be used on the business side and requires little specialist IT knowledge. I hope that helps.    Embed Quote
