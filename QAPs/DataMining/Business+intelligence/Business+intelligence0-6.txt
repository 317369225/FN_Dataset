What is the future of business intelligence?
Hi, I've been working on business intelligence for the insurance industry for the last 8 years, and I believe the following must happen with BI over the following years: Simpler tools - most of today's BI tools are enterprise type software solutions, which come nowhere as close to being intuitive as other software categories do. I believe this must evolve so more users can actively use their BI software. Niche markets - as data is getting more and more complex, many niches will open of business intelligence solutions for specific verticals (for example, InsFocus and iPartners are insurance-specific BI tools). Self-service - this has been called in many names, such as ad-hoc or self-service, but still hasn't come off. BI tools are already changing to be more self-service, so users can finally stop relying on IT for every reporting need they have.    Embed Quote
