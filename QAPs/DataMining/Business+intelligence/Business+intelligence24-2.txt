What is the difference between a data scientist and a business intelligence analyst?
A data scientist is a person who has more knowledge of programming than a Statistician or Business Intelligence person but lesser than a Software developer while on the other side he has more Data knowledge like algorithms, stats, mathematics, etc than a software developer but lesser than a Statistician. For a Data scientist there are quite a lot of domains in which he needs to have hands on. Some of them which are highly important are: Programming language: Java, C++, Ruby, Python, R, Scala, Octave Feature extraction: Convolution, wavelets, Time series analysis, fourier transforms, DSP knowledge Statistics: Chi-Squared test, p-values, F-test, Standard error, AROC, ROC curve, Hypothesis testing Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, Casandra, CouchDB, HDFS-Hadoop Technologies: Django, Ruby-on-Rails, Groovy, Lift, Thrift, Avro, Protobufs, Hadoop/Mahout API, Node Data mining packages: Weka, Statistica QC miner, SAS, SPSS, Rapidminer Useful algorithms: ANN, Bayesian network, SVM, Probabilistic Graphical Modeling, HMM, MCMC Visualization: D3.js Debugging: PDE, Numerical Analysis, Lagrange Multipliers, linear Algebra, Stochastic processes, Vector Calculus And of course knowledge of business is a mustWhile for a BI engineer, it drills down to understanding Business more and provide adhoc data analysis using BI tools like SAS, SPSS, MS Office tools, Tableau, Pentaho. Their main focus is providing management decision making analysis from databases using of the shelf tools.    Embed Quote Updated 20 Feb, 2014. 1,158 views.
