Are there any desktop business intelligence tools for data analytics?
esCalc and esProc should be on the list. esCalc: A more intelligent business spreadsheet software than Excel, especially for complex computing. Its multi-level structure is very impressive. When entering one formula in a cell, its homocell(cells with the same business position) will automatically copy this formula and calculate it. Detailed differences of these two can refer esCalc vs Traditional Spreadsheet.   esProc Desktop: It's a database script, enabling agile and easy-to-use statement for the interactive analysis of structured data, and is especially good at dealing with complex, flexible or occasional data. More information can refer desktop BI software-more powerful than SQL.    Embed Quote Updated 21 Jun, 2013. 163 views.
