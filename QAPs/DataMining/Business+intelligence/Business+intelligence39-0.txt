What is the best business intelligence tool for a ecommerce store running on Magento?
I can share with you some of the real user BI reviews written by users who work for retailers and e-commerce companies. One reviewer, who is an Architect at an online retailer writes that Microstrategy's "deployment and stability has been fairly good but scalability of the product is quite challenging." He also says that although it's a great product it does require attention to individual needs.

They now use BIME to "provide us with management dashboards."He says that BIME provides them with a significant time saving and data quality matching.
