Which Business Intelligence tool is best in current market?
As market analyst in Flexmonster (ideal pivot table component for BI and Enterprise solutions, http://www.flexmonster.com/) ,  I read a lot about BI market and customer experience, both from devs and from end-users.  And I really wish to contribute to the discussion.  My personal "WOW" is  Necto14 Demo from Panorama Software on Vimeo. It is very intuitive and social BI. Panorama can make a trend, as was witth OLAP for example. Just a note: "Founded in 1993, Panorama Software is the original developer of the OLAP technology that was acquired by Microsoft in 1996, which was rebranded as SQL Server Analysis Services and integrated into the SQL Server platform." Even Gartner says they are cool.    Embed Quote
