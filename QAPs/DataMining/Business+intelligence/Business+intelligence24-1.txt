What is the difference between a data scientist and a business intelligence analyst?
The answers posted so far are all great. To them, I would add that "under the hood" there is a significant difference, but you'll have to look closely to see. Data scientists are scientists. BI analysts are analysts. And no, that doesn't mean one wears a white lab coat and the other wears a suit.  :)  It's a mindset issue. Scientists want to understand why. Analysts want to get the "right answer". Scientists are inherently curious. BI analysts are focused on getting actionable info in the hands of the client ASAP and could care less about the nuances of the underlying methods, unless they are going to screw up the answer. Both need to be focused on the business problem at hand. A data scientist who gets so caught up in the mathematical and computer science details that they lose track of the application is of little use. Put more simply: BI analysts see data cleaning/wrangling/munging as a necessary evil before getting to the problem. Data scientists realize that data munging IS the problem. Make sense?    Embed Quote
