What are the most cost effective Business Intelligence tools?
I agree with Russel's research that SiSense is one of the most cost effective BI tools that give you big bang for your buck. I have worked for SiSense for a while now and see that the BI industry has a lot of tools that are just front-end tools - requiring companies to invest a team of IT/ dedicated data scientists/ hardware resources to take care of the back-end data management aspect. This can bring up costs tremendous on both hardware and manpower.  On the flip side, getting just a just a back-end tool will leave you with cumbersome Excel graphs or you will need to invest in a front-end tool for the data viz part. SiSense is an end-to-end solution and provides both a powerful back-end (actually, it's won a bunch of award for it's unique In-Chip technology), as well as an easy to use, business-friendly front-end. Good luck! Here is another great research site: 2014's Best BI Software    Embed Quote
