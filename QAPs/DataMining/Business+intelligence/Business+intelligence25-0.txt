Which Business Intelligence tool is best in current market?
I would recommend SiSense. As a non-technical business user myself, SiSense software lets me actually get my hands on data, build beautiful interactive dashboards with easy drag-and drop data manipulation, and share everything with my team--all without bothering IT or any programming/coding know-how. Here is a breakdown of the 2: SiSense: Very easy setup Good price compared to other solutions Lower implementation cost than the competition No requirement for outside consulting While I work at SiSense, here are some 3rd party reviews from IT Central: SiSense Reviews 2014 QlikView: Flexible licensing system Ability to provide Business Intelligence Off-The-ShelfSome 3rd-party reviews: QlikView | IT Central Station One of the biggest differentiation's is that SiSense is built to offer BI to business users--with no coding or scripting required. So, non-techies can analyze data themselves, without having to draw IT or data scientists into the process. This is due to SiSense's award-winning and powerful technology that makes it easy to access data by joining multiple data sources into a single repository, then build a dashboard with and array of data visualization.  Qlikview lacks the ability to make joining the data easy, and often needs IT to help regular business users do that. Hope that helped!    Embed Quote
