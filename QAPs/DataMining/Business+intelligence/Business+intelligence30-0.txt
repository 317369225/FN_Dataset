What do business intelligence consultants do?
The role is usually to examine a specific business or organization within a business and make recommendations on how they could improve the processes, products, or personnel. Typically, they spend some amount of time onsite with the client, meeting with the relevant people.  Longer term engagements may include market studies, feasibility studies, and the like.  The final recommendations usually follow a template and you work in a team, so you have significant help coming up with the deliverables. As with all consulting, it's important to identify the decision makers and support their goals, which may means you are just a "yes man".    Embed Quote
