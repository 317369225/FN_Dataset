Are small businesses interested in Business Intelligence (BI) software?
I think this is an interesting question right now. Small businesses typically don't have the resources and technical skills to accommodate the use of business intelligence reporting or software. What I find interesting is that the newest movement towards content marketing has created a plethora of new content and data points that make it difficult for any size business to sort through and make sense of. I believe Forrester Research (source not difinitive) recently produced a report that calculated the creation of content on the web had grown by 2X in the last 24 months. And this report projects the creation of new content on the internet in 5 years to grow by 16X the current content. EMC sponsored a study that also reported huge numbers. In this study the researchers found that internet content doubled every 18 months. You read and hear about the new trend in capturing and managing 'Big Data' as the next step in remaining competitive. Big business is just now starting to spend small fortunes to harness and manage this big data. So where does that leave small business? I think if a company can deliver an innovative BI system that is offered on an affordable SaaS type basis then small business could very well be inclined to consider the use of this information to help them remain relevant and competitive.    Embed Quote
