What is the best business intelligence tool for a ecommerce store running on Magento?
Hello Rud - Firstly a quick disclaimer! I work for Causata, so this isn't coming from a customer's perspective but I wanted to share a couple of thoughts on your post. As Miguel rightly points out, the main challenge you'll face is connecting these data sources into a single view. Causata's Identity Graph enables you to easily pull together disparate streams into a single view of a customer, so you can see the whole customer timeline in one place. Data integration is made very easy by our use of a very light schema for data import, and then a flexible variable layer that allows you to transform that data in whatever way you like for reporting and analysis. We have our own data exploration and analytical interface, and you can also put other visualization tools (such as Tableau and QlikView) on top of Causata for reporting that fits your needs. I'd be delighted to discuss your requirements in more detail - you can PM on Quora or on Twitter at @MattJReading to get in touch. Thanks    Embed Quote
