What is the future of business intelligence?
In the spirit of full disclosure, I am an employee at Looker, a data discovery platform based in CA. Late last year, our CEO wrote a piece exploring recent and future BI trends and examining how the landscape is changing. You can find the full article here, but I'll outline the key points below: 1. The size of the data you collect is meaningless if you can't derive any value out of it. The industry focus will shift from "Big Data" and instead focus on how to marry collected data with business-changing insights. 2. Self-service BI / analytics solutions will become more prevalent and more complex, allowing both technical and non-technical users access to the data they need. 3. Data analysis will be collaborative across departments, and will happen in real-time. Decisions will not be based on "gut" or on anecdotal evidence, but rather, will be routed in hard facts and supported by real-time data. 4. There will be a BI 2.0, just as there was a Web 2.0. BI developers will have agile, code-based architectures to model their data, and web-based UIs to access it. 5. Traditional data warehousing paradigms will continue to die, and will be replaced by in-memory, scalable databases that allow for both analytical and transactional workloads. If you'd like to learn more about how Looker is positioned to capitalize on these trends, feel free to check out our site at looker.com. Cheers, Kyle    Embed Quote
