Business Intelligence: What's the BI software/application landscape going to look like in the next 5 years?
I see two things happening that I think will persist into the near-term future: 1) Shift away from relational data toward "big data" systems on the back-end, which allow for much more powerful predictive capabilities but are harder to "mine" non-programmatically. Thus much of the analysis is being pushed to the back-end, where it is automated. 2) The move away from 3rd-party desktop "business analysis" software (Tableau / QlikView / Microstrategy) to in-house, hosted dashboarding. Because the analysis is handled on the back-end, the front-end can simply be a "dumb terminal" that merely interprets parameter inputs (date / dimensions / etc.) and queries directly from some middle layer that holds the output from the back-end. So the BI personnel stack is moving away from something like this: DBA -> Business Analyst -> Management toward something like this: Data Scientist -> Management because the traditional business analyst role is being replaced by a smarter back-end (designed and deployed by the data scientist) and a dumber front-end (much lower learning curve on the visualization / analysis tools).    Embed Quote
