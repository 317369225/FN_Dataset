Which business intelligence tools have the best user interface?
SiSense is a business intelligence tool with a great interface that makes it easy to manipulate/tweak data by adding different graphs, charts, etc.  for non-technical users--which is why their drag & drop functionality is really advanced on 2 fronts: 1) You can create a single repository of data by joining multiple data sources using a simple drag & drop feature (see photo). This is pretty advanced for BI tools since data sources these days can be pretty big (GB-TB). SiSense is robust enough to handle big data though, so drag and drop is really that simple. There are also built-in connectors to make combining data sources even faster. While other BI tools require an IT department to prepare data by programming sources to speak the same language, SiSense is the only on the market that lets business users drag-and-drop data to combine large data sets. 2) On the second front, data visualization via dashboards and reports, SiSense also has a great drag and drop capabilities. You can follow your train of thought by adjusting charts, graphs, reports in one click. For each visual you build, you can drill down to its underlying report to see the smallest detail or combine multiple views to illuminate the bigger picture. Just for your information I work at SiSense, but you can feel free to check out our customers page on our website to get a third-party perspective-- I'm sure they will say the same ;) And on a side note, there are a lot of  BI tools that provide the second front-- drag and drop when building dashboards and reports--such as Tableau Desktop, though they don't provide the first part that makes it easy for joining data. Good luck!    Embed Quote
