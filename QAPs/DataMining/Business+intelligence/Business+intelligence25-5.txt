Which Business Intelligence tool is best in current market?
The best definitely depends on your requirements.   This includes the expertise of the users using the software,  the number of users,  the types of reports, dashboards, and analytic capabilities needed.   And it also includes factors such as what and where your data is stored,  your budget,  the timeframe of when a solution is needed,  your infrastructure, and more. I just wrote a few articles on what I think are the best options for Small and Medium Sized business,  but this list would change if we were focused solely at the Enterprise level or if we were talking about Solopreneurs.   It would even change if I wrote specifically for eCommerce companies or companies looking for Service Desk integrations.  The best is in the eye of the beholder (the beholder of the requirements that is).
