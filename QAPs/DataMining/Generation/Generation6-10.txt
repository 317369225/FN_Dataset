★How did our generation become the helicopter generation?My friends and I think about this, and we have some theories.
People have smaller families now. That is the main reason why. There are a range of reasons why people have smaller families now and they are mainly correlated to advances in technology. Communities with smaller families are correlated with a higher probability of helicopter-like personality. You can have whatever cultural theories you want but as far as I am concerned the big factor is that advances in technology have led to smaller families. There has been a massive reduction in the size of families across the world in the last 50 years and this reduction in the size of families has had led to a massive shift in cultural values.    Embed Quote
