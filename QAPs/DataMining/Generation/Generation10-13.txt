★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
This may be more specific than you're looking for but writing letters and writing in cursive.  I learned cursive in school growing up but I usually favored print. I hadn't written anything in cursive in years other than my signature when I read an article about it being a dying art. I picked up a pen to write in cursive and I was shocked at how bad at it I was. It's crazy that something that used to be second nature to you can become almost foreign.    Embed Quote
