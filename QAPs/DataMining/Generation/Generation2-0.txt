★What will our generation be called?
The Excess-of-everything-we-don't-really-need-and-shortage-of-stuff-that-we-do-need generation. The I'm-too-sexy-to-wear-bell-bottoms-or-wear-flower-garlands generation. The I'm-not-sure generation. The Ed-Hardy-shirts-are-obsolete generation. The mixing-is-fun generation. The chivalry-and-Victorian-erotica-are-dead generation. Thanks for the A2A. Will add more once it hits me :)    Embed Quote
