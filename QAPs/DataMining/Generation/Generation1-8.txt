★How can I generate website traffic with $0 marketing budget?My Startup is out of cash and we are 2 days before launch. I don't think we will see any investment coming in next 3 months not even from a family members so we need to start selling quickly.
Use social network platforms like Facebook to tell people about your website.  You can't advertise or promote your business on Facebook, but you can create a business page and start reaching out to people.  Best of all, Facebook is free! With Facebook, you will also have access to a large number of apps that could help you with your marketing efforts.  Wishpond.com is a company that creates Facebook apps that ultimately helps create traffic to a business's website.  We offer a suite of promotional apps that allow our clients to create photo contests, social sweepstakes, and social offers.  Every time someone participates in a promotion, news of that event will automatically be posted onto the participant's FB news feed with a link referring others to your promotion, which will ultimately lead people to your website. Best thing is: We're free for the first month!  So if you have absolutely no marketing budget at the moment, that's where Wishpond comes in!
