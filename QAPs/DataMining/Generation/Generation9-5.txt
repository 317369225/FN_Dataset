★Did the Baby Boomer generation commit generational theft?
It happened to me on a personal level.  My family ran 3 quarters of a million dollars through a custodial account with my SSN, didn't pay a dime in taxes thus ruining my credit, and illegally neglected to tell me it even existed until years later hiding behind some pseudo fatherly explanation about how I should handle things on my own and anything I ever got would have been icing on the cake.  Only when I moved out at 18 and started paying my way through community college, the tax authorities started garnishing my bank accounts. I realize that the question probably meant in general, but I think there are a lot of commonalities between my father's behavior and other baby boomers that I have seen.  Some of them are as follows: Bullshitting.  The baby boomers I have come into contact with are some of the most blatant parasites I have met, and they hide their selfish behavior by bullshitting.  Every conversation is an ego contest, and someone or something from their generation taught them to never let anyone point out anything you have done wrong.  Never admit you are wrong, and use any subversion technique you can to prevent people from pointing out when you are wrong.  They don't listen when people explain things to them.    Embed Quote
