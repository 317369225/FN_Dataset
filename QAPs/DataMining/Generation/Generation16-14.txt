★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
For me personally it is Esponce (Esponce - Turning things into hyperlinks). I like the simplicity, tracking reports that I get and a lot of different types of codes that I can create. Geo QR Code is interesting because it is "Geo smart" and it serves automatically USA, UK or Germany website depending where it is scanned. This is cool.    Embed Quote
