★Will Facebook ever generate more revenue than Google?If so how will Facebook do this and when will it happen?
It's highly impossible for Facebook to generate higher revenue than Google. Facebook is just a social network, even though they are making acquisitions like Instagram, WhatsApp, oculus.. But that doesn't add much of the revenue. Google has lots of products its hard for me to explain each. They have more than $25b cash pile. Search, Android, Gmail&apps are the core products of Google which generates literally 70% of revenue. Google 'X' labs is an innovation centre for google where the "Self Driving Car" , Google glasses, Robots were developed. Can you imagine how much they are gonna earn from these? It would be beyond your thoughts.    Embed Quote
