★Who is the finest Bollywood actor and actress of our generation and why?The 70s / 80s saw the emergence of Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Kamal Haasan. In terms of popular actors, it would be probably one of the Khans but I am looking for great actors. Please post one answer so that people can upvote / downvote an individual rather than a bunch of actors.
I'd say: Irrfan Khan - He has his own way of acting. Also, he has to be one of the best narrators. Manoj Bajpai - See him in shool. What a performance. Boman Irani - probably the most versatile actor in Bollywood. It astounds me how easily he fits in the most diverse characters. Amongst the Khans - I'd say Shahrukh and Aamir are the only good actors. Abhey Deol - Did anyone see his expression in ZNMD. If you haven't noticed them, go watch the movie again. Ajay Devgn - This was before he plunged himself into Rohit Shitty films. Watch him in Deewangee and Zakhm. Arshad Warsi - Another one of those lesser known but brilliant actors. His role as 'Circuit' will give you a very clear picture of how good he is as an actor. Vidya Balan - seems to be making quite a name for herself lately. Paresh Rawal - He is almost at par with Boman Irani when it comes to versatility. Remember him in Hera Pheri, Andaaz Apna Apna or Judaai? I can't think of anyone else as of now but will edit it when I can come up with more.    Embed Quote
