★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
There are endless QR Code generators on the web. Some are free and others have a price tag that is usually paying for advanced analytics or graphic design. I am working with a company called a company called Visualead. They are a new player in the QR Code space and have been making some waves and updates when it comes to QR Codes Visualead has developed a technology that allows anyone (without graphic design experience or knowledge) to turn any logo, design or image into a scannable QR Code. It's a bit difficult to explain since their solution is completely visual so have a look: Page on Viusalead    Embed Quote
