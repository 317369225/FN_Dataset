★Is the emerging generation of American adults a bunch of "spoiled, entitled, lazy, whiny, unappreciative brats"?Some context for those who don't know... The Baby Boomers are those born 1946-1964, Generation X were born 1964-1981, Generation Y/The Echoes/The Millennials were born 1981-2000's. Do you think what the media, and older generations are saying about The Echoes is true?
I think the real question is: "Has there ever been a generation of mature adults who believed that a generation of young adults truly measured up to their standards?" The "Greatest Generation" thought the Boomers were a bunch of useless pinko-commie hippie peaceniks. Boomers thought Generation X was a bunch of cynical latchkey layabouts. Boomers and GenX find Milennials to be a bunch of entitled, idealistic Occupiers who can't be torn for a second from their iPhones. I, for one, look forward to telling today's toddlers to get off my lawn once they start having to make adult decisions in the next 20 years.  I only hope I'll be able to afford a lawn for them to get off of by that time.    Embed Quote
