★Why is the younger generation so opposed to capitalism?
Because capitalism as it currently exists (I can only speak to the US specifically) is failing hard, and it is failing us millennials the hardest. We have crushing levels of student loan debt, substantial unemployment and underemployment, people who are employed are expected to work increasingly long hours and get increasingly less vacation time...and meanwhile inequality has skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. The top quintile, and especially the top 1% of earners have seen dramatic growth in incomes in the last decade while the median income has dropped almost 10% since the mid 90s. The Land of Opportunity mantra no longer holds true either. Social mobility has plummeted. It is easier to pull yourself up by your bootstraps in Denmark than America. And then there's the governance issue. The influence of money has corrupted our politics to the extent that I don't think that you can really call America a capitalist democracy anymore. We are a crony-capitalist hybrid of democracy and oligarchy. I'm not totally anti-capitalism, based on what we've seen so far it may be the least bad system, at least the least bad system anyone has tried so far (though we should keep our minds open to other possibilities). But if capitalism wants to survive the next century it has to do better. Germany and the Scandinavian countries appear to be doing it pretty well, with an efficient hybrid of socialism and capitalism. But, I'm not sure what the solution is. But something does need to change, or the pitchforks and torches will come.    Embed Quote
