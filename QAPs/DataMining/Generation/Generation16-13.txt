★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
If you go with a good provider, the codes don't expire.  Plus, they'll allow you to update them at any time.  Typically, paid providers not only offer analytics so you can better understand who are your customers, but they'll also have services to create mobile websites/landing pages and integration with social media. I'd recommend you check out sparqcode.com.  They offer free codes, free tracking and a free mobile website/landing page.    Embed Quote
