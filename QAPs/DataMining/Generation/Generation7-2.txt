★Who is the finest Bollywood actor and actress of our generation and why?The 70s / 80s saw the emergence of Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Kamal Haasan. In terms of popular actors, it would be probably one of the Khans but I am looking for great actors. Please post one answer so that people can upvote / downvote an individual rather than a bunch of actors.
Since people have already mentioned the lot I admire, I draw your attention towards one of my favourite actors: Sanjay Mishra. He is a show stealer. I don’t know if that is even a word or not, but the guy does steal the whole frame he is in. You faintly remember him as this guy, from one of the best sitcoms of Indian TV, Office Office, as Shukla Ji. ​ ​ You have loved him in All The Best. ​ ​ I could sit through the drag of a movie; One Two Three, just because of him. ​ ​ Then he had his small but powerful role in Phas ​ ​ But he turned me into a real admirer by his latest performance in Aankho . ​ ​ If you haven’t watched the movie, I urge you to it. If you have, then ‘Dhondhu Just Chill!’ UPDATE: Just watched Dum Laga Ke Haisha, as suggested by Shruti, Nishant and Srayanshu. It was an extremely sweet movie with Sanjay Mishra, once again doing justice to the role! ​ ​ And saw him in the Famous CWC Mauka Mauka ad today. ​    Embed Quote
