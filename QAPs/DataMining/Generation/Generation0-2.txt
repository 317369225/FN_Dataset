★What are the best things in the world that the coming generations will miss?Things are not done the same way anymore as they were done earlier. Lots of stuff is changing. Some, way too fast!
I think Sparrow. A complete pack of music. During my childhood, every fresh morning, I always used to hear very soft & soothing voices. These voices were of different birds. Sparrow was one of them. Nowadays I don't see more of them around me. Humans have always condemned afterwards for the mistakes he has already committed. We have become so busy in building big malls and high apartments that we almost forget to take care of our environment. Ironical part is that people are now listening to the videos and audios available in the internet. Humans must understand that he could not go much far without a proper connection with the nature. Meanwhile, When was the last time you noticed a sparrow in your window?    Embed Quote
