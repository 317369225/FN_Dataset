★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
As long as any type of business exist, lead generation will definitely do the same; it's a hand-in-hand situation. Lead generation is as important as sales leads in a business. Without the latter, you cannot expect his company to stay long in the business; it's lifeblood of the business and its absence means industry’s stagnation, that’s why it’s very important not to get these leads off the hook because they will eventually bring in that big dollar sign into your company, potential revenue as they say it.    Embed Quote
