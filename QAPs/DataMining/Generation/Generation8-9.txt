★What are the best lead generation tools?
The power of the internet and the growth of the use of social media for B2B sales/marketing is amazing and must be harnessed. It has been said time and time again that B2B buyers today do their research online and through social media by reaching out to their connections for advice. That being said, B2B companies must be active on these platforms (especially LinkedIn, Quora, Twitter, any platform uniquely relevant to your industry) so that they can engage with these buyers. B2B sales and marketing professionals need to make adding value and providing objective (as possible) advice when reaching out. To make it easier to find where/when these conversations are occurring, I recommend trying out Colabo. Colabo's lead generation tool discovers warm leads from sources such as LinkedIn groups, Quora questions, industry Meetups. Colabo brings these leads straight to their users by sending them real time alerts to their inbox. Signing up is as easy as visiting the site  Colabo™ - Connect the dots  and filling in a short questionnaire. If you want more info, please contact me at may@colabo.com    Embed Quote
