★What are the best lead generation tools?
We generate most of our leads through social media, wether on Quora answering questions, or publicising our blog or webinars on twitter/linkedin. Our main tool is Oktopost ;) Social Media Lead Capture | Oktopost. It allows us to manage all of our social media campaigns, on multiple social networks, easily and gives us the analytics we need to understand where our leads are coming from and how to imrpove our campaings.. Heres an example of how we use oktopost: We just put together an awesome webinar and want to make sure we get a lot of people to join...About a week before we'll build a SM campaign around the event in order to make sure people know about it...We use multiple social profiles on different social networks in order to post our event.. Oktopost then takes care of the rest...posts according to the schedule,  centralises the campaign chatter in the social inbox, using the great lead capture feature oktopost generates REAL leads from social media (not just numbers...), analyses the campaign according to clicks, converstions, leads etc. and syncs all of the lead info to our CRM! Thats our main tool and how we use it..    Embed Quote
