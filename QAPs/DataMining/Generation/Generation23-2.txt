★Why is the younger generation so opposed to capitalism?
At least in the USA, I think the generation of people now in their 20s is much less opposed to capitalism than the generation that was in their 20s a generation (or two) ago. However, any statements about huge groups will be true for some and false for others; and, for the ones it is true for, the reasons will vary.    Embed Quote
