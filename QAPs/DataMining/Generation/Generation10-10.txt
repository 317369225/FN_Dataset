★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
My vote goes towards manners. Knowing how to be polite (avoiding rudeness and profanity), knowing when to stop asking questions, when to change a topic, being careful with the emotions and being sensitive towards the feelings of the other person, and acting as an adult (and not a toddler) is what I treasure in people. Even basics such as eating with a knife and a fork, and chewing with one's mouth closed are now elevated to a superpower. Unfortunately, these can only be found mostly in older generations, and almost non-existent in younger ones.    Embed Quote
