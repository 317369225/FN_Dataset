★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
So we can ask if the random generator is "random enough" for a particular application. A very important application is Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, which is secure enough for typical cryptographic applications,  (it is allowed to use some randomness, e.g  a very short bit series, which is really random, e.g. come from termal noise or radioactive source hardware.) It is a theoretical question, if a Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator exist at all. Interestingly, existence such a generator  is equivalent with , which tought to be true by the most, but one of the most well known open question. See: Pseudorandom generator    Embed Quote
