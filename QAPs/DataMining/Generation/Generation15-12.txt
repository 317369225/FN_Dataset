★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
Many computers are equipped with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that provides certified true random number generators. It is like a smart card chip with a physical process for generating random noise.   Windows 7 is certified under Common Criteria, and the Security Target says:   “FCS_RBG_EXT.1.1   The TSF shall perform all random bit generation (RBG) services in accordance with [NIST Special Publication 800-90] implemented in a FIPS-validated cryptomodule operating in FIPS mode seeded by an entropy source that accumulates entropy from [a combination of hardware-based and software-based noise sources].   Application Note: When a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip is available in the underlying hardware, the TOE will utilize its hardware-based noise source features to improve random number generation.”    Embed Quote
