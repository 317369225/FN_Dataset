★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
Lead generation is not a dying business.  The way leads are generated have changed, but there are still great ways to do that.  I like Krista Bunskoek's infographic about using Social Media to generate leads.  Another great tool to use to generate leads is Live Web Chat.  Should Your Website Have Live Chat to Help Generate Leads?  Getting people to talk to you via your website is a fantastic idea!  Not equipped to man a web chat?  Contact Davinci Virtual, we can do it for you!  http://www.davincivirtual.com/receptionists/features/live-web-chat    Embed Quote
