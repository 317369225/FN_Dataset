★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
There is a great QR code generator provided by uQR.me, with +70,000 customers worldwide, big brands among them. The service is free and it allows you to fully customize the QR code, from its color to its background. QR codes don't expire, but they can only link to one destination. You can use dynamic QR codes to make this nuisance go away. uQR.me gives you this tool as well by registering for free. If by any chance you need to create several QR codes you can do so with uQR.me's campaign module. It allows you to create and manage unlimited dynamic QR codes, retrieve and export full statistics, remove the redirecting page, perform batch actions and create almost invisible QR codes. Hope you find this useful. Here's a pic:    Embed Quote
