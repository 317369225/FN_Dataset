★Who is the finest Bollywood actor and actress of our generation and why?The 70s / 80s saw the emergence of Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Kamal Haasan. In terms of popular actors, it would be probably one of the Khans but I am looking for great actors. Please post one answer so that people can upvote / downvote an individual rather than a bunch of actors.
Rajkummar Rao This guy is on the horizon to be one of the best actors that Indian cinema has seen. In his short career, he has shown how he can dive into the character and make it his own. Whether it be in Shahid, where he played the role of a real life lawyer Shahid Azmi; or Kai Po Che as Govind where he played the mastermind behind opening a sports shop and unknowingly falls in love with his best friend's sister. In Queen, he plays the role of Vijay, a guy who feels in love, and then says no to the marriage just a day before, and afterwards reconsiders the proposal. In the movie with total emphasis on Kangana, he leaves his mark with an impressive performance. And with City Lights, he shows his mettle by playing role of a guy who migrates from a small town to a big city. Although the movie was average, his role was appreciated by everyone.    Embed Quote
