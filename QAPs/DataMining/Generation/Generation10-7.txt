★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
We still remember the past, so we truly understand how easy it is to disconnect ourselves from the Internet and still survive. We understand what it is to be "lapped." What you guys think is new, we've seen it all before. We understand that back in the day when everyone was worshipping Gucci, Pucci, and Ferrucci, thinking that owning one of something with their name on it would make us happy, didn't work then and still doesn't work now. Sorry Prada. We know how to hold a door open for the next person and if someone happens to do it for me, I know how to say "thank you". We still remember how to use pronouns. It sounds like nails scratching on a blackboard when we hear, "Him and me went to the movies." In a pinch, we still remember how to roll down a window if a car doesn't have power windows. Of course it rarely happens because I don't think are many cars on the road without power windows. We know how to wash and dry dishes. No one had a dishwasher when I was growing up. We know how to hang clothes up to dry on an outdoor clothesline. We know that wars don't work. We've been through too many of them and we're still out there fighting, posturing and building up our military industrial complex.I know there are a lot more and that as soon as I hit done, I think of them, but this is a start.    Embed Quote
