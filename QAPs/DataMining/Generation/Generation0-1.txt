★What are the best things in the world that the coming generations will miss?Things are not done the same way anymore as they were done earlier. Lots of stuff is changing. Some, way too fast!
Birthday parties where Snacks were samosas,paneer pakode, spring rolls, gulab jamuns. Games played were musical chairs, hide and seek. Gifts were pens, a coloring book, comic, a chocolate. Venue was the house of the kid which was beautifully decorated with balloons and glitters by the parents. The innocence of a birthday party will be missed.    Embed Quote
