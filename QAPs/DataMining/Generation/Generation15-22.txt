★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
As mentioned by Thomas R. Stegelmann random.org uses atmospheric noise to generate numbers. Also if you read http://www.random.org/randomness/ further, they mention some other interesting methods which rely on radioactive decay. http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/ These type of methods which use physical phenomena are referred as True Random Number Generators. In real world applications, Pseudo-Random Number Generators are used due to efficiency advantage. Also, if you're doing simulations etc, you want to be able to generate the same pattern by giving the same seed, so you should  actually prefer a deterministic algorithm. The most simple one is probably linear congruential generator.    Embed Quote
