★Is Zynga our generation's Disney?Disney seems like a good target for Zynga to go after (from my limited standpoint)
Disney made things 75 years ago that I still love. Business models, process or criticism don't affect that love in anyway. I don't know anything about how Disney made their movies, I just remember the movies. In 75 years will people remember FarmVille? Or what other game designers thought about FarmVille? Or what stock price Zynga traded at? I'm not sure any of us know. But if anyone remembers Zynga in 75 years, it will have been for the games not the process or the shares. I do know that tens of millions of people play our games everyday. I also know that everywhere I go with a Zynga T-Shirt, people stop me and say something. Whether we are Disney or not, we are loved by our players.    Embed Quote
