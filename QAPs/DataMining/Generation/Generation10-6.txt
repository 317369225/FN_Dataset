★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
As part of "the older generation", I'll list a few skills I developed as a young wife and mother half a century ago.  .  I made some clothes from scratch.  A few from my own patterns.  Used to knit. .  "Put up" veggies and made my own jams and jellies, butter, ketchup, pickles. . Baked bread and all our desserts, like pies, cakes and cookies from scratch. . Knew how to change a tire and changed the oil and filter on my cars. We washed and waxed our own cars, too.  Never used a car wash, ever. . Always hand-wrote Thank You notes for gifts and my kids did, too.  Who does that anymore? . And this one was truly a skill:  I could pick up a dime with my toes while holding a baby on each hip.  :) (Hope this doesn't sound like I'm bragging, but most of these skills came from necessity. We were far from rich.)    Embed Quote
