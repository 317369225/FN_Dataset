★Is Zynga our generation's Disney?Disney seems like a good target for Zynga to go after (from my limited standpoint)
I would say more early Merry Melodies...because of the lack of the type of pathos for characters.  Games seem to be so focused on technical architecture and cute or slick design.  Gets early addiction but wide spread long tail addiction comes from pathos.  Zynga has not created enough story/emotion vestment in characters  for familial attachment that would be needed.  Social gaming (like most of web dev) has been predominantly managed by (as the Greeks discussed) ethos and logos...not pathos. (Expecting pathos like a sport...would come from the feeling toward other players). When it comes to long tail success of each venture...pathos has to be key to self perpetuation/pull. Otherwise you have a stronger /quicker passing"fads" structure ...imho    Embed Quote
