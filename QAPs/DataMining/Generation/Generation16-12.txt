★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
For free generators, I like this one: http://keremerkan.net/qr-code-an.... It allows you to save your QR code as various image types, eg JPG and PNG, which is useful for customizing. You also can create QR codes that link to URL, that send an SMS, etc. As for a QR Code expiring, you don't need to worry about that. Each generated QR code is unique and should maintain its functionality (dont want to say indefinitely in case it gets bent/smashed - but they are really resilient). For paid providers you hit the nail on the head. Basically a free QR code gets you access to create a code, whereas a paid provider can give you information about who is scanning the code, what they are doing after they scan, and what types of people are scanning your code. Ultimately, the best way to use QR codes is to integrate them into a mobile marketing CRM strategy, so that you can understand how your customers are interacting with your brand.
