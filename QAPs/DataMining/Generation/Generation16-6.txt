★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
I use a free QR code generator from the ZXing Project (http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/).  It is the only one I have found (that I can recall) that will let you specify the amount of error correcting. The higher the error correction is in a QR code, the more of it that can be covered up or destroyed and it still work.  I add custom graphics to QR codes and having the higher error correction is the way to go. If you decide to use Bitly or another URL shortening service, consider doing the same with your own domain.  Many people are leery of clicking on Bitly or other shortened URLs because they have no idea where they are going.  By using a 301 redirect and your own domain (either your normal domain or a dedicated shorter one) you can still take advantage of the tracking aspects via services like Google Analytics, keep your brand in the mind of your visitors (why promote Bitly if you don't have to), and have more control. If you decide to use 301 redirects (or a customized Bitly URL), you can create a QR code that can be reused.  To change where it is going, all you have to do is adjust the 301 redirect or the target link in Bitly.    Embed Quote
