★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
Do the codes expire or run out? QR Codes never expire but the destination cannot be changed after the QR Code is created. That's why it may be usefull to use URL shortener to be able to change the destination when you need. It also allows you to track the traffic coming from your QR Code. What's the benefit of using a paid provider? There are many QR generators you can use. Many of them are free and allows you to create your QR Codes in few clicks. The big differences between QR Code generators are about : The possibility to track and change QR Codes destination Quality and resolution of the QR Codes (for posters it may be better to use vector image) Customizations with colors, shapes and logo Some of these features are often paid. My favorite QR Code generator is Unitag which is one of the most complete tool for free : Custom QR Code Generator Here is an example of what kind of QR Code you can create :    Embed Quote
