★How did our generation become the helicopter generation?My friends and I think about this, and we have some theories.
In addition to Jeremy's and Anonymous' answers, which I agree with, I think we judge other parents much more today than we ever did before. We over-parent our children partially because we are immersed in fear media that capitalizes on every bad thing that ever happened around the world; but also because we, as parents, base our self esteem on how well we parent. Then we spent our free time bashing the other parents around us for doing it wrong so we can feel superior for how much better we did it and how great our kids will turn out. Parenting turned competitive somewhere along the line. We're afraid not only that our children will fall down and skin their knee, (which not only would hurt but might leave a scar or worse, get a MRSA infection) we're afraid that we'll be judged for not doing enough for our children and being bad parents. Why do we judge each other and why are we so afraid of being bad parents, when our grandparents were so confident? I don't know for sure, but my guess would be the social change that has comes with most families needing to have two income earners and both parents working. So parents who work feel guilty about being away from their kids, and parents who stay home feel guilty because they're outside the norm and not providing financial security. Everyone feels guilty. Everyone feels on some level like maybe they're doing it wrong. We make up for that feeling by over parenting in ways we can control, i.e. hovering.    Embed Quote
