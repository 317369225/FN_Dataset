★How did our generation become the helicopter generation?My friends and I think about this, and we have some theories.
I'd like to suggest  Child Welfare Legislation as another possible factor.Since the 1980s and 1990s, there have been a number of measures implemented to protect "child welfare". I put that in quotes, because sometimes I think it's more about ideology than actual welfare. For instance, current Child Welfare legislation in Ontario could be interpreted to say that it's illegal to leave  your child alone in public if they're under the age of 10. I'm perfectly comfortable letting my nine-year-old play at the park and go places, and apparently I'm doing something illegal! Child Protection agencies are known to be "trigger happy"-- they investigate no matter how innocuous the accusation, and their powers are somewhat tyrannical. They don't need a warrant to bust down your door. Sometimes they're known for shooting first and asking questions later. If you happen to be a fundamentalist Christian parent, or belong to some other "distinct" group, they will have their eye on you. I suspect that some of the fear of letting the children do what they did in ages past has to do with the implicit threat of some disgruntled neighbour calling Child Protection. Even if the complaint doesn't go anywhere, it's definitely unnerving.    Embed Quote
