★Did the Baby Boomer generation commit generational theft?
Yes, but they didn't do it on purpose. Medicare overwhelms any other sub-topic on generational theft, and they had no way of knowing that medical costs would grow so much faster than inflation. By the time that they bumped up payroll taxes, it was too late - the boomers didn't put enough away to pay for their medical costs, and it will crush the younger people under an unpayable burden.  Similarly, with social security people are living longer than expected, so the boomers didn't put enough away for that either. Well, maybe the prescription drug program was direct on-purpose intergenerational theft, come to think of it - it has a $19.3 Trillion npv shortfall. page 234 of the trustees report: http://downloads.cms.gov/files/T...    Embed Quote
