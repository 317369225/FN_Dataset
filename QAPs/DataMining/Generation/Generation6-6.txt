★How did our generation become the helicopter generation?My friends and I think about this, and we have some theories.
My 2 cents from a non-helicopter parent who feels trapped at times. The biggest issue is judgement from other parents, the schools, law enforcement,  and social welfare professionals: If there is a societal expectation that it is "inappropriate" to Leave a child under the age of 12 unsupervised Let elementary school children pay the consequences of their academic effort (instead of overseeing all homework and school projects) Allow children to be unscheduled in the summer and weekends.it makes it harder for me to allow my kids to do these things without putting my family at risk. The term "neglect" is used far too easily and without good universal definitions, so it is easy to feel like you are harming your kid. No one has been arrested for too much parenting involvement.    Embed Quote
