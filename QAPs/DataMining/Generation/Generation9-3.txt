★Did the Baby Boomer generation commit generational theft?
I know I'm over-simplifying a bit here and there are lots of positives to credit and access to capital but It seems to me that  selling credit products  to their kids is where that wealth transfer has happened at a massive scale. Let's look at Education & Housing 1) The infusion of credit via student loans seems like a good idea except what it also does is create a  huge amount of inflation in educational institutions with a wealth transfer from kids who did'nt know any better to banks and the education institutions who were able to consistently increase tuition with the influx of money. Net effect, rapid escalation of education costs, students stuck with debt etc.while administrators, bank  pay is bloated. 2) Housing-A few decades ago you bought a home in cash until you could put half down and then 0 down and then pay it back in 10 years and then 20 and then 30. The longer you took to pay it  the more house you could afford to buy and the more people that got access to these products the higher prices would go. Expanding credit is what helped the baby boomer buy it for 50k and  then sell it for $500,000 a couple of decades later to the next generation who loaded up on debt to buy it. The babyboomer makes a profit of $450,000 and the next gen had a 30 year loan of $450,000(assuming he put 50k  down).  These strategies were devised by some  baby boomers which have benefited most baby boomers by inflating their assets and then creating these debt  products that have transferred enormous amounts of wealth to them while loading the next generation up with a lifetime of debt and escalated costs and now their kids live with them because they can't afford to live on their own. How's that for karma?    Embed Quote
