★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
Lead Generation cannot die. Even if we tried :). As technology evolves, so do solutions that offer new, innovative options. People think QR codes are dead too. It's a misnomer. I recently came across a leadgen tool - mobile surveys that collect data via interactive surveys. Companies can utilize the surveys to ask their customers questions in real-time - say in the middle of a presentation, right after a webinar, or for products, for example, a recent campaign by a marshmallow company issued QR codes for an on pack promotion that linked to a mobile survey, customers input their data, took the survey and were rewarded with free marshmallows. And the data collected offered targeted insights for future lead generation and retention. The stats were pretty impressive actually- http://surveyanyplace.com/on-pac...    Embed Quote
