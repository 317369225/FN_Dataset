★Is the emerging generation of American adults a bunch of "spoiled, entitled, lazy, whiny, unappreciative brats"?Some context for those who don't know... The Baby Boomers are those born 1946-1964, Generation X were born 1964-1981, Generation Y/The Echoes/The Millennials were born 1981-2000's. Do you think what the media, and older generations are saying about The Echoes is true?
I am a gray haired Buster, but I interact with a lot of X, Y, Millenials and Mosaics because of games. So, this notion gives me a rash.   The truth is, these young people have been advertised to and lied to since day one. They have had to learn, out of self defense, that the goverment, the stuff in the media, big business, schools, chemical companies, pharma and all the rest is mostly a big smiling lie.   When they don't buy in to some con man's corporate plan, designed to rob and dehumanize you, they are labelled whiny brats. When they resist leaping in for endless unpaid overtime to "get ahead" when they saw that same lie used to manipulate their parents, they are called lazy.   If they see through the tired lie, maybe the lie is the problem.    Embed Quote
