★What are the differences between Generation X and Millennial Generation?
I realize that I'm late to this party, but isn't that what Gen X is really all about? In a word: yes.  Generation X is small small small. Barely worth marketing to, we were (and remain) on the margins.  We were told (and quickly learned) that we would never have the impact of our Boomer elders, nor would we match the achievements of our Gen Y (I prefer the term "Millennial") successors.  We were slackers, in part because of our sense of having been defeated before we were ever really out of the gate. Come of age at the tail end of the 20th century, we were always told that had missed the party.  Woodstock was over.  The 60s weren't even within living memory for most Xers.  America's optimism had turned, first to malaise, then to cynicism.  The Boomers were all about ending things (like the 20th century) when we were beginning. And when it was time for a New Century, we weren't at our cultural apex anymore - the Millennials were. So Xers were (and are) a little more cynical, and less engaged in the larger world than Millennials are.  There's a reason social entrepreneurship didn't catch on until the Millennials came to champion it. I have a slideshare deck all about the differences between Gens X and Y (with the Boomers thrown in for reference) here: Ignite DC Slide Deck And a 5-minute video here: Gadi Ben-Yehuda Presents at Ignite D.C. 8    Embed Quote
