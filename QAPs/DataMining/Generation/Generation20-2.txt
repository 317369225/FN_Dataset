★Is there a Motorola plan for a 3rd generation Moto G?
Moto G2 is a very successful device, so is Moto X2. With just five unique devices in the market as of now, and all five doing exceptionally well, Lenovo will be more than happy to give an update to the existing lineup. But, with that said, don't expect anything soon. If an update is scheduled, it is definitely going to be in the second half of the year. The specs won't be much different from the G2. An updated processor is in order, probably will keep the same screen size. Slight design changes. Most probably will continue to stick with 1GB RAM, but most likely will feature a slightly larger battery.    Embed Quote
