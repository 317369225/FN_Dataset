★Is the emerging generation of American adults a bunch of "spoiled, entitled, lazy, whiny, unappreciative brats"?Some context for those who don't know... The Baby Boomers are those born 1946-1964, Generation X were born 1964-1981, Generation Y/The Echoes/The Millennials were born 1981-2000's. Do you think what the media, and older generations are saying about The Echoes is true?
I am a Boomer and have worked with an awful lot of Millennials, both professionally and in volunteer settings. My experience generally, especially in volunteer settings, is that Millennials work very hard, are idealistic and creative, and generally prepared to bust their asses for what they believe in. Having said that, in professional settings I have encountered the occasional Millennial who had somewhat grandiose expectations about sliding into a position that required somewhat more experience and seasoning than the Millennial in question currently had. This is a known psychological difference between Boomers and Millennials: this talismanic belief in dues-paying as a path to greater success. Many Boomers have achieved great success but we are in our 50s and 60s, and most of us endured jobs with very sub-optimal attributes when we were young to get to where we are. So Boomers tend to believe in the importance of young people sucking it up for a few years and paying their dues before being able to advance into more interesting or remunerative work. Some Millennials think this idea is horseshit, and in their defense, I would say, if they can pull it off, good for them. But they shouldn't be shocked if they encounter resistance. Boomers had to pay their dues not because it is cosmically essential to do so, but because the generations before them enforced that requirement. If Millennials can achieve advancement based on pure merit and hard work, more power to them.    Embed Quote
