★Did the Baby Boomer generation commit generational theft?
No.  You've been conned by right-wing propaganda. The big shift since the 1970s in Britain, the USA and most of Europe has been a much larger slice of wealth going to the richest 1%.  And there has been no "trickle-down", no net improvement in growth in GNP.  But this has been successfully obscured by a mass of propaganda designed to set the majority against each other and ignoring what the rich are doing. The rise in house prices and private pensions means that older people look better off, on paper.  But if you need to live in a house, you need it and can not sell it. Also since the richest 1% are mostly past middle age, they inflate the average wealth of older people.  Which does not mean For other successful deceptions, see USA deceived.  9 Out Of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact Britons systematically misled, mostly by the tabloid press “British public wrong about nearly everything” or “Perceptions are not reality” Note also that the Baby Boomers established a lot of the freedoms that are now taken for granted.  Not just for gays: in the 1950s there was very strong prejudice about sex before marriage or outside of marriage.  It happened but people would suffer if found out.
