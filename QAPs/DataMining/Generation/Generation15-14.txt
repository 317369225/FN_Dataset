★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
A program can't really pick a number randomly. The Random class uses a pseudorandom number generator. A random number generator essentially picks a number at random out of a range of values. What a pseudorandom number generator does is do a series of complicated calculations, starting with an initial seed value to produce a number. Because they are calculated, you can't consider them as truly random.    Embed Quote
