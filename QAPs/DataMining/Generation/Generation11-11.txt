★How a lead generation company generates leads?
The questions I would ask in response are  .. What is a lead generation company (every business is in the lead generation business)? What do you mean by a “lead?”. List companies say they sell leads (but they are really selling prospect lists).  SEO companies say that someone clicking a link and coming to your website is a lead.  Inbound Marketing companies figure that when someone reads an article or a white paper on a particular subject then that is a lead.  Marketing Automation companies score a users activity on a website and determine that a certain score makes that suspect/prospect a "lead".  (See some of the earlier responses for more examples.) Ultimately the purpose of providing sales leads to salespeople is to help your business sell more products  and or services - more often.   A salesperson is an expensive asset.  Probably your most expensive. If you position him/her in front of a prospect that has the wherewithal to make a purchase in the short to medium term - and that prospect is willing to effect change within their organization (assuming the application is B2B) - then you will have helped the salesperson enhance his or her productivity by supplying a “qualified” lead.  And when you increase productivity you increase sales.  And when you sell more in less time you reduce your cost per sale significantly. Conversely if you provide a salesperson with an unqualified lead you actually decrease productivity as salespeople are now not focused on the correct prospects.  And are therefore looking for a needle in the haystack.  The lost opportunity factor is huge! Obtaining unqualified leads is, for the most part, easy and cheap.  Generating high quality, fully qualified leads that will have an impact on maximizing sales productivity is harder and more costly.    Embed Quote
