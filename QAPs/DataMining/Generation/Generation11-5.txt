★How a lead generation company generates leads?
I think that most lead gen companies like http://inspirebeats.com (that does it well) use a mix of human researchers with scraping tools like import.io, email verification like http://kickbox.io, http://fullcontact.com and other tools to scour dozens of public and private data sources. By combining human intelligence, custom data, and machine learning they can provide high quality leads.    Embed Quote
