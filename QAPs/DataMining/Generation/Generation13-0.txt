★Is Zynga our generation's Disney?Disney seems like a good target for Zynga to go after (from my limited standpoint)
In "Farm Villains", the SF Weekly reported that Zynga's CEO told employees "I don't fucking want innovation!"  Whereas "Innovation" is the first corporate cultural value mentioned on Disney's careers page: http://corporate.disney.go.com/c... So culturally, I can't imagine two companies much more different. That said, both are certainly in the hit-making business - and perhaps more importantly - the franchise-making business (a game or movie with lots of sequels).  And as computer games now bring in more annual revenue than movies, Zynga is certainly well-positioned to benefit from what seems to be continuing growth in that business. I think people still tend to get more passionate about the more richly-developed narratives behind characters in movies/books/comics (you'd hope - since there's no other draw like there is with games), but maybe someday we'll see Link (from Zelda) or Mario Bros or Lara Croft, etc develop as passionate a fan base in the general public as Harry Potter.  But at the moment, I can't think of anything close since most of the best developed game characters are only known to hard-core gamers, who are a very large but still not quite mainstream audience.    Embed Quote
