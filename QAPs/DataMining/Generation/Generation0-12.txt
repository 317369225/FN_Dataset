★What are the best things in the world that the coming generations will miss?Things are not done the same way anymore as they were done earlier. Lots of stuff is changing. Some, way too fast!
​ The beauty of millions of stars on a clear night sky. Well I'm not saying that they are constantly being devoured into a black hole. But the increasing pollution leading to smog is obscuring the visibility of the grand cosmic ocean we live in. When I was a kid, when A/Cs were not common in an average household, we used to sleep on the terrace during summers. Looking at the sky, we were always amazed to see how far it reaches into the emptiness and how beautiful the stars made it look. Weather balloons were our flying saucers and glimmering light from stars was a signal from aliens. But now, owing to pollution, all we see is a brownish fog. And if this continues, our only way to enjoy star gazing would be from a dense forest far from human settlements.    Embed Quote
