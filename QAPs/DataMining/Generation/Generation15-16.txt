The "National Security Agency" article on Wikipedia contains an interesting passage relating to this point (below).  There has also been speculation that private-sector encryption systems such as Pretty Good Privacy may have been compromised by the use of predictable pseudo-random number generators. Dual EC DRBG random number generator Main article: Dual EC DRBG   NSA promoted the inclusion of a random number generator called Dual EC DRBG in the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology's 2007 guidelines. This led to speculation of a backdoor which would allow NSA access to data encrypted by systems using that random number generator.[15]    Embed Quote
