★What singer (any genre or generation) has the most distinctive, instantly recognizable voice?
My first choice would have been Bob Dylan, but he's already taken, so let me toss Michael Stipe of R.E.M. into the mix. Proof: even when he's a guest vocalist on someone else's track (10,000 Maniacs, Indigo Girls leap to mind) you immediately know it's him.    Embed Quote
