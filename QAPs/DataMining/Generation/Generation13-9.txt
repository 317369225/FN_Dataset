★Is Zynga our generation's Disney?Disney seems like a good target for Zynga to go after (from my limited standpoint)
No - Simply put, Disney (with some travel) allows a more immersive experience.  By going to their parks, you are surrounded by the Disney experience.  Zynga games aren't so.    Embed Quote
