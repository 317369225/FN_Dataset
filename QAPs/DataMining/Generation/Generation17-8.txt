★Are we a philosophically enlightened generation?
The answer is YES. The upcoming generation is smarter than us. Thanks to the Internet, because of which people are more accessible to information. Also I can actually witness the higher maturity level of the people who are younger to me. What I am doing now, learning now, are done by the people, who are 2 or 3 years younger to me. What I did when I was 5 years old, is done by a 3 year old kid.  Not only they have more knowledge, but also have higher levels of frustration. Rising demand for smarter people make them very competitive and selfish. They run for perfection and want to be smarter and smarter than others, which is the reason for their depression, frustration and anger. Soon they go in search of a way to attain inner peace. They constantly chase for happiness and peace of mind. This is where the second phase of mindset starts. They start reading more self-help books and look for inspiration. Twenty year old men and women start learning philosophical concepts. This makes them philosophically and spiritually enlightened.    Embed Quote
