★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
Let me try to define what a random number generator(RNG) means:  A number generator is random if for any k , when asked to generate a k tuple the generator generates all possible tuples with equal probability.  Say k=2, then a RNG over the natural numbers(this means the RNG outputs natural numbers) is equally likely to output (7,2), (500,500).(1, 1million) etc. Since there are infinite such tuples, and a computer has only finite memory, it cannot possibly recognize all possible tuples and hence will output among a finite number of tuples. Okay what about RNG over finite sets. Say a RNG only outputs only 0/1. There are 2 possible 1-tuples , 4 possible 2-tuples {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)},   8 possible 3-tuples... 2^k possible k-tuples. There will thus exist a k such that 2^k will exceed the computer's total memory space, and the problem form the above paragraph resurfaces. So apart from the trivial case when the generator generates out of a set of size 1, RNG'S cannot exist.    Embed Quote
