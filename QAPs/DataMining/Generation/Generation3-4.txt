★Is the emerging generation of American adults a bunch of "spoiled, entitled, lazy, whiny, unappreciative brats"?Some context for those who don't know... The Baby Boomers are those born 1946-1964, Generation X were born 1964-1981, Generation Y/The Echoes/The Millennials were born 1981-2000's. Do you think what the media, and older generations are saying about The Echoes is true?
If anyone was spoiled, it was the Baby Boomers. When they grew up... - You could pay your way through university with a summer job. - A university degree actually meant something, and got you a job. - You could get a public/union job with only a high school degree and make enough money to buy a house, and have a decent life. - Popular music was not as controlled by corporations, i.e. Real musicians, bands, and artists were the ones in the spotlight, and culture was not something created for the sole purpose of selling you something. - Everything, from gas to houses to living expenses, was cheaper! (Yes, I know what inflation is, and this statement takes that into account) - You didn't have to toil through years and years of highly competitive academia just to cling to your spot in the Middle Class The list goes on and on... I worked my ass off to get to where I am. Our generation has earned double the education to earn half the salary of the Boomers. There's nothing I hate more than Boomers saying we're spoiled and entitled. We only expect what we were taught to expect, to have the same opportunities as our parents. (Side note - I love my parents, and I'm grateful for everything they've sacrificed for me. Luckily, they don't hold the negative views of my generation that many their age do.)    Embed Quote
