★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
Have you tried http://www.freeqrcodetracker.com yet? Its completely free to use and you can generate and track qr codes, and it does free tracking built in. Really easy to use. Clearest reports around by far. (Yes my agency TMB built this free solution, but you really can use it with no strings attached, if you have any worries about signing up, we are 100% anti-spam and your email is safe - we have been in this industry for 17 years and are the good guys. Give it a try and see for yourself, you will love it, we promise.)    Embed Quote
