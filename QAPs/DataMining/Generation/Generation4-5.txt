★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
It's not dead. Now they call it "customer acquisition" or CPA. If you ask me, same thing. But what I would say is that doing SEO for lead generation is dead.. or at least an uphill battle. Search engines are getting smart about where the ppc bids are going, which means for high commercial intent keywords, the SERP real estate is getting more ads. http://www.solaronemedia.com/top...    Embed Quote
