★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
I love using www.unitaglive.com/qrcode, it's totally free and they have just released a new version with more templates! They also offer a comprehensive guide that helps to create great QR Codes : http://docs.unitag.fr/white_book.... What's very useful for me is the possibility to create a free landing page for my QR Code and to track the number of scans and visits with their statistic tool! I hope it will help!    Embed Quote
