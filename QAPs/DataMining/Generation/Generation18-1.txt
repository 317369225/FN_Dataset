★Why is the generation following the Millennial Generation being called the Homeland Generation?Source: Census Bureau
What a first-rate question, since it isn't - exactly - yet - by everybody - so named! The (A?) source of the graphic can be found on page five of this PDF:  {Page on whitehouse.gov}.  A brief, interesting blog about its meaning can be found here:  {The White House is making up entire generations now}.  The salient points are: the info is from the Census Bureau but the labels are not the delineation between "Gen X" and "Millennial" is not (yet) firm "Homeland Generation" is an emerging term, but not a final one(Information on names, dates, and the significance of generations preceding this one can be found here:  {Generation}  Also included is how they were named.) Defining a phenomenon as nebulous as a "generation" into one or two words is difficult (but intriguing to me); the generation following the Millennials is too young - it's still being born - to know how its members will define themselves and what it will be called.    Embed Quote
