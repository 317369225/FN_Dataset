★What are the best things in the world that the coming generations will miss?Things are not done the same way anymore as they were done earlier. Lots of stuff is changing. Some, way too fast!
I believe of all the things I would miss Getting lost and being ignorant I don't mean getting lost in a city, alone even though that is included, but getting totally lost in something. In the present world, the moment we get lost, there happens to be something that always pulls you back to reality. It may be your phone beeping, or a Facebook notification. People no longer get lost in a puzzle, they look it up in the internet. People no longer discuss the complex ending of a mystery movie/novel they look it up in the internet. People no longer argue about pointless stuff, they look it up in Wikipedia. Being constantly informed, takes out the fun in being wrong.    Embed Quote
