★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
My Dad was a master carpenter.  When he was interviewing guys for a job on his crew, he'd first have them make a saw horse using only a hand saw and a hammer for tools-  proper angles, too, not one of those butt-jointed things.  If the guy could make a saw horse, the next task was to build a thresh hold.  If he could do that, and he'd managed to not piss my Dad off too much in the interview, he had a job. Chances are good even guys in construction right now may not be able to do those two tasks with nothing but a hand saw and hammer.    Embed Quote
