★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
I  highly recommend http://qrlot.com/generate. They claim they don't track the code. It is a good thing if you're worried about privacy    Embed Quote
