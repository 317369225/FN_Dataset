★Is there a Motorola plan for a 3rd generation Moto G?
motorola has been maintaining a seven months gap..between release of phones...so a surprise release could take place in july...and also regarding specs and price...they have been very unpredictable....whether it be the screen size or camera specs or processor size...to be called a upgrade moto g3 would make a foray into 2gb arena and a processor chip upgradation in order to look exclusive when compared with moto e2 and g2...and camera and screen size will also be upgraded particularly front cam...and price as usual will be less than expected shaking the market at that time    Embed Quote
