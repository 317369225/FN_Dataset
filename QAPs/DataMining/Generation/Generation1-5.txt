★How can I generate website traffic with $0 marketing budget?My Startup is out of cash and we are 2 days before launch. I don't think we will see any investment coming in next 3 months not even from a family members so we need to start selling quickly.
I will assume you have at least $100. That's not a lot and you can find that much money I hope. If you don't have other options, borrow them. 1. Make the foundation for a good SEO. Google traffic may not be a lot at first, but it's free and usually converts very well. More keyword rich text content and good Titles is a simple and working thing. 2. Buy a few old domains in your niche, that have expired and have good (natural, relevant, authority) backlinks, and redirect them with 301 redirect to your website - good for both SEO and traffic. However it's a good idea to have somehow who knows what he's doing to take a look at them, because if they have bad backlinks you may shoot yourself in the foot with this one. 3. Buy/get somehow vouchers for Adwords, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn ads. Use them wisely. 4. Make a very good affiliate program and spread the word for it. 5. Divide the remaining time between social media activity and outreaching to relevant people (online and offline). Connecting to experts, not selling. They will give you ideas how to sell.    Embed Quote
