★Why is the younger generation so opposed to capitalism?
I don't think young people are "opposed to capitalism"  I think they are responding in opposition to governmental/political and corporate cronyism.  Which has a tendency to manifest whenever you have a concentration of captial or legal power in either private corporations or government entities, operating in weak systems of individual agency like human rights, civil rights, private property, and education. 2011 Pew Research study: Little Change in Public’s Response to ’Capitalism,’ ’Socialism’ Notably, liberal Democrats and supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement are not overtly critical of capitalism. In fact, as many offer positive as negative reactions in each of these groups.... ...People under age 30 are divided in their views of both capitalism and socialism. But to Americans age 65 and older, socialism is clearly a negative (72%), not a positive (13%), term. I would say my personal views are primarily influenced by the first two-thirds of Freidrick Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, and my personal recent experience being a young person. I would like to note as well that Russia in it's most recent state was a "Capitalistic Democracy." Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Putin and his political allies, to-an-extent made their fortunes by pandering to Western capital investment interests in the new "Democracy" of Russia.  Think about where they are today and what the Russian leaders are doing.    Embed Quote
