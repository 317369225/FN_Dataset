★Who is the finest Bollywood actor and actress of our generation and why?The 70s / 80s saw the emergence of Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Kamal Haasan. In terms of popular actors, it would be probably one of the Khans but I am looking for great actors. Please post one answer so that people can upvote / downvote an individual rather than a bunch of actors.
