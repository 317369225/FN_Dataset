★Who is the finest Bollywood actor and actress of our generation and why?The 70s / 80s saw the emergence of Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Kamal Haasan. In terms of popular actors, it would be probably one of the Khans but I am looking for great actors. Please post one answer so that people can upvote / downvote an individual rather than a bunch of actors.
Rajkumar Rao 1. Watch Shahid(the movie) 2. Watch Gangs of Wasseypur 2(yes he has a role in it) 3. Watch Kai Po Che 4. Watch CityLights and even then if you are not convinced then keep on watching Tushaar Kapoor's film...    Embed Quote
