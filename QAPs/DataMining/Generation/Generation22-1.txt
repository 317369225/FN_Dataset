★What singer (any genre or generation) has the most distinctive, instantly recognizable voice?
The great Tom Waits.  His distinctive voice, was described by critic Daniel Durchholz as sounding "like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon,  left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car.   I love his work.       Embed Quote
