★What will our generation be called?
Thanks for the A2A, but judging by the examples given, I'm guessing you (the asker) are a post-1980's baby.  As a pre-1980's baby, I consider myself a dyed-in-wool Gen Xer.  Since the question is about "our" generation, I'm not sure I'm fit to answer. Having managed a few of your ilk, I'm fine with the moniker "Echo Boomers" or "Millennials."  If the question demands a unique answer, may I suggest the "Hairy Plotters?" P.S.
