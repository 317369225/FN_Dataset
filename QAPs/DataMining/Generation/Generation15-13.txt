★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
Software alone can never generate random numbers.  John von Neumann once quipped, "Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin."  Thus we call of them Pseudo Random Number Generators.   Now the reference paper is Park and Miller (1988) http://www.firstpr.com.au/dsp/ra... where they talk about how bad many of the generators are. Since then most have been improved, but only within a limited scope.  The question is really are they random enough for your application.    Embed Quote
