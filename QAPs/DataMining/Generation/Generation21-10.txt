★What's the best marketing automation tool for B2B lead generation?"B2B Marketing" lists the following available tools: Pardot, Eloqua, Silverpop B2B Engage, Marketo, Aprimo, Neolane, Manticore, HubSpot, Swift Pages and Vertical Response.
I would argue that it's more about "fit" than finding a "best solution." We use Marketo with many of our B2B clients of varying sizes, and overall, we're very pleased by how quickly users can adapt to the systems and create value. If there's any weakness with all of these solutions, it's that they bring many more features that users are even ready for. One Marketo feature that sales teams always enjoy (you need "Marketo Insight" for this) is the automation of a top list of prospects that exhibit sales-ready behaviors following a campaign.    Embed Quote
