★Is there a Motorola plan for a 3rd generation Moto G?
Motorola started the Low price branded mobile in India last year(2014). Very good configuration for reasonable rate was their stratergy.For the same configuration when samsung and Sony priced it for 20k. Motorola priced for 14K. Online only sale. Lot of demand and All motorola phones(Moto g, moto E, Moto G2) are huge Success. But this year motorola wont be a hot cake considering there very own company Lenovo has started the same stratergy and flash sales with very low price. They are becoming the first choices now. Xiaomi is another chinese vendor who is taking on smart phones. Yes motorola will defnitely come with new model like moto G3 or anything but the demand will not be as huge as they did in 2014.That was the time when moto G 1st Gen was released motorola was in Google hand but now lenovo acquired motorola and their stratergy is changing !!    Embed Quote
