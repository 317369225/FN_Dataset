★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
If you are using a free QR Code generator, you are probably using static QR Codes. While these work alright, they have very limited capabilities. I am listing the advantages of using trackable QR Codes (also called dynamic QR Codes) and additional features provided by paid generators: Edit content without changing the design of the code Track number of scans by time, geography, and device Activate/De-activate codes as per campaign needs Use advanced design effects to create designer QR Codes Download and export vector images Customize short URL of trackable QR Codes Multi-user access to manage QR Code campaigns Scanova (the generator I am associated with) has all of these features.    Embed Quote
