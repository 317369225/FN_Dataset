★What are the best things in the world that the coming generations will miss?Things are not done the same way anymore as they were done earlier. Lots of stuff is changing. Some, way too fast!
Life Without Google:- Year:1999 Grade:2 Place:-Classroom My science teacher was teaching blood groups. After 10 mins of initial classification into A,A+,B,B+. Suddenly someone asked a question "Ma'am!! Which is the rarest blood group?"  The teacher didnt know, the boy from the last bench said " It must be AB negative, my father went through quite a lot of trouble while finding a donor for my grandma's operation"After a few more random guesses which included absurd ones like ABA blood group, someone said "It is BOMBAY blood group. yeah I read it in the last weeks TOI(the times of india)"The teacher didn't trust him and neither did the class, I laughed at him and thought he's making stuff up.The class was dispersed on a final note that everyone will go home and try to find the answer. I remember going home asking my mom ,dad, calling my uncles and aunts for the right answer, and most of them weren't even aware of BOMBAY blood group. After some days, when everyone had forgotten about it, the same boy came with a yellow piece of paper (his lunch had leaked pickle oil) which was a news clipping testifying his claim.  Google has made life easier, but I sometimes miss those years when I sifted through piles of newspaper to find that clipping or a particular pic for Holiday Homework ,or visiting my uncles place so that I could just read that one volume of Britannica Encyclopaedia he had just purchased.    Embed Quote
