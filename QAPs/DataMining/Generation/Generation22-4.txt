★What singer (any genre or generation) has the most distinctive, instantly recognizable voice?
What? No love for Sacthmo? None of those other cats would exist without Loius Armstrong! He had one of the most distinctive voices ever recorded - and combined with his sublime phrasing and note choices - and with the sheer force of how he basically built the foundations of modern music... this guy should be top of the list (followed by Billie, Ella, Nat and Frank to make a top 5!)    Embed Quote
