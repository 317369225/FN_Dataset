★Why is the younger generation so opposed to capitalism?
Because capitalism is, at the moment, failing the great majority of young people. Some few have earned billions, but are relatively so few that they only go to emphasise the difference between the have and have nots. Non-jobs, "internships" (an excuse for paying below the minimum wage), zero hours contracts and part time jobs with no prospects and tuition fees which are effectively a life long tax on anyone with the outlandish temerity to think they should have education beyond school all go to breed a reasonable dissatisfaction. When I left university I could afford a rented house, I could afford to get married if I worked only a little overtime and I could afford the transportation costs from home to work. So in my early 20s I settled down to make a life with no debts from my education and a bank in whom I had trust. At the same time as my wife and I were young enough to enjoy a family on one adult salary which meant she and I were not eternally exhausted and we didn't have to pay baby minder's costs. All that has been swept away. Young people can't afford to even contemplate marriage or a family until their biological clocks are winding down, they are burdened by taxes masquerading as student loans, transportation costs for the ordinary soul are irrational and your chances of being able to support a family and a "normal" life on one adult salary are a very sick joke. Who trusts a bank? So I say the younger generation are not opposed to capitalism as such, they are opposed to bad and corrupt management of capitalism by a ruling class that deserves to be swept away. And much more of this level of corruption and they will be.    Embed Quote
