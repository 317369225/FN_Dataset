★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
How to entertain ourselves. How to not have a phone available all the time.  (And enjoy the fact.) How to sew, mend, darn, crochet, knit, tat, make quilts, or embroidery. How to make meals and desserts without a mix.  How to make bread, whipping cream or meringue -- without an electric appliance! How to grow your own fruits and vegetables and freeze or can them. How to do basic home maintenance/plumbing, paint or hang wallpaper. How to do basic maintenance or repairs on your own car (granted, that's a lot tougher to do these days). How to drive a vehicle with a manual transmission. How to use a typewriter, whether manual, electric or computerized. How to have discipline, work and responsibility without thinking of it as abuse or that our parents should pay us for it. How to survive a full day comfortably with a power outage. How to write thank-you notes for gifts and thoughtful acts. How to spell and use proper grammar. How to sleep on a porch during a summer thunderstorm -- and really enjoy it. Granted, these are only some of the things, and they don't apply to everyone, but as a farm kid, I learned all these things and am really glad I did.  I miss the life.    Embed Quote
