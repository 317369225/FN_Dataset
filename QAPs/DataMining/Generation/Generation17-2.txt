★Are we a philosophically enlightened generation?
Due to the internet, computers, and general technology, we certainly have more information, and less prejudice because we are realizing we are all on this planet together. But this has a negative effect as well. We talk less with each other, texting is everywhere. If we accept the definition of philosophical as relating or devoted to the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, then no. We are not even close to attempting this in the current generation. Most people do not seem to care why we exist, only where to find the cheapest X-box.    Embed Quote
