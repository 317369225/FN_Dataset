★How can I generate website traffic with $0 marketing budget?My Startup is out of cash and we are 2 days before launch. I don't think we will see any investment coming in next 3 months not even from a family members so we need to start selling quickly.
As with most things, generating traffic for your website costs either time or money. Building traffic without spending any money takes time, patience and some work. I have found the following things have helped send traffic to my site: Plan - Create a plan for traffic growth. Detail how and where you will promote your content. Track your traffic - After you have some momentum from different traffic sources work out your most successful activities to refine which traffic strategies are working for you. Social Media - Find a platform that is suitable for your target audience. You are better to do well at 1 or 2 platforms rather than be average at 10. Reach out - Contact people in similar niches to cross promote websites, product or services. Niche Research - Find out what is working for other people in your niche. There may be a directory etc that is really popular. Share everything you put online - I have found sites like this reddit, stumbleupon, digg and medium can help in building an audience.  I have published my 2015 traffic strategy - it may have some useful tips.
