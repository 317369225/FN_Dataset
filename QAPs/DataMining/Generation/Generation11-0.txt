★How a lead generation company generates leads?
Depends on how you define "lead generation company".  Here are a few basic categories: 1) Content sites / farms.  These are companies that publish a lot of content.  Milk SEO for all it's worth.  Traffic going to these pages sign up to receive more information about X.  These leads are then sold to 1 or more companies that provide X.  The key tactic here is the use of SEO. 2) Ad networks / adtech.  Most people wouldn't label ad networks/adtech companies as lead generation companies, but they are effectively the biggest lead generation companies around.  But, a lot of the best marketers utilize ad networks / adtech to generate leads. With search ads such as Google or Bing, you can often just effectively drive free trials directly.  For low intent networks -- where people are not actively seeking your solution -- such as display, Facebook, Twitter (and even my company LaunchBit), marketers drive signups for their ebooks, white papers, and other pieces of content instead of their product.  Then, they'll cultivate those leads into sales over time. 3) Lead generation tools.  Lastly, there are a number of companies that help you generate leads on your own site/properties.  Marketing automation tools such as Hubspot, Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot et al, All of these tools have forms and lead qualifying tools to help with lead generation on your site.  Other standalone tools include Unbounce and Kickoff Labs and a whole variety of other creative lead generation tools I've written about and refrered to here: 3 unusual ways to generate more leads    Embed Quote
