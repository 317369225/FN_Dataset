★What singer (any genre or generation) has the most distinctive, instantly recognizable voice?
I submit three singers, one for each group: Male Vocal: I feel Michael Jackson has a distinctly recognizable style. His is a breathy, soulful, and filled with trademark sounds and nuances. Female Vocal: Elsiane singer Elsieanne Caplette. I have touted her so many times in various places I feel her PR rep should be writing me a check. If you haven't heard her voice, go find her now, we'll wait. Other Vocal: Hard to miss this guy's distinctive pipes. I almost always know it's him.    Embed Quote
