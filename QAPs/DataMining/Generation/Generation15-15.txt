★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
As other said the short answer being no ( but only at present practically)! Theoretically You can generate perfect random number  if you have  quantum computers . The classical world is deterministic .So given enough computational resources one can predict the random number generated by classical computers.But Quantum mechanics by itself is probabilistic. A simple demonstration of above idea is, Lets have a simple state   a single qubit as input      : Output : Return the measured value on observation. This acts as pure random number generator source for 0,1.    Embed Quote
