★How did our generation become the helicopter generation?My friends and I think about this, and we have some theories.
I grew up in the Sixties, when it was the norm for kids to be "free range" and saw the transition to helicopter parenting. I think it all boils down to the invention of the communication satellite. From the 1970s on, TV news gained the ability to show video coverage of any scary news story that happened to any kid anywhere. The media got ratings drunk on this type of story, so that it became common to see stories about, say, a kidnapped white girl in Los Angeles even though you might be watching the local news in Des Moines.    Embed Quote
