★How did our generation become the helicopter generation?My friends and I think about this, and we have some theories.
In addition to the other excellent answers, I might add that technology has enabled helicopter parenting, especially in cases of parents with older children and teens . I came of age in the 1980s, when it was easy to call your parents from a pay phone, claiming you were someplace innocent. If you were at a raging party and the phone rang, the place would fall silent and remain that way while the host was talking to his parents or whoever might be on the line. We didn't have phones or even caller ID. GPS tracking was the provenance of NASA and the KGB. Helicopter parenting was only possible for those parents who actually owned helicopters, figuratively speaking. However, if these technologies were available back in the day, you'd bet a ton of parents would be using them. With it, there's also been a societal shift in the amount of supervision parents are expected to do. I was part of the generation of children that did get to roam the neighborhoods and parks without adult supervision. I'm sure there were anxious parents who didn't like their 10-year-olds out of sight, but let their kids out anyway because it was seen as the normal thing to do. In this day and age, it's easy to communicate with whomever you want, whenever you want. In my day, overprotective parents either had to keep their teens at home (which many did) or suck it up and trust them.    Embed Quote
