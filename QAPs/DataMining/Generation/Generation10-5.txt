★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
Remembering phone numbers. My niece had misplaced her phone and she needed to call someone and I told her to use my land line but she did not remember the phone number of the person she needed to call. She called herself and waited for her phone to ring in order to find it so she could call her friend.    Embed Quote
