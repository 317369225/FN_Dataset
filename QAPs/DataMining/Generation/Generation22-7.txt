★What singer (any genre or generation) has the most distinctive, instantly recognizable voice?
I am surprised to see no one mentioned Willie Nelson. The thick yet soft camber of his voice. The very character and wording of his songs. Willie is not just an amazing singer but he writes his own songs. He is an extraordinarily talented musician, singer and songwriter. He wears many hats and wears them well. Country is not normally my favorite style of music but you can always recognize Willie. I am also surprised that Evis Presley is not on the list. Elvis may be a few generations back but everyone knows an Elvis song when they hear it.    Embed Quote
