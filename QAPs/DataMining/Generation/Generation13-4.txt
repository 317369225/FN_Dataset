★Is Zynga our generation's Disney?Disney seems like a good target for Zynga to go after (from my limited standpoint)
I think the next Disney is a very bad analogy for Zynga. Disney are a content company who sell characters and stories, and their gaming activity is a support to that. Zynga, like any games company, are a game company that may try to sell characters and stories as a support to that. The business models and markets are so thoroughly different. You might as well be asking are Zynga the new General Motors.    Embed Quote
