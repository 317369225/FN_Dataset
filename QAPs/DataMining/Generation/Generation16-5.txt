★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
I would suggest you to try TAGO, which is a comprehansive tool for Creating and Managing "trackable" (dynamic) and "non-trackable" (generic) QR Codes. Do the codes expire or run out? QR Codes do no expire. When creating a generic code the content is embedded in the code itself and it can not be modified once it has been created. However, when using certian QR Code platforms that typically offer additional features, they often embed thier own shortlink into the code you generate. Those links can be deactivated or have a limited life span. Therefore, it is not that the code expires, it's the shortlink or the content that the shortlink points to can change or no longer be available. Another benefit of using dynamic codes other then the size and legebility, is that they are "trackable" and you can redirect the code to a new function or URL at any time. So the same code can be used for various purposes, without having to reprint new materials. What's the benefit of using a paid provider? There are number of free and paid online services where you can create generic QR Codes. For example, TAGO offers Free and Premium plans with advanced features. All codes are none-proprietary so they can be scanned with any application available on the market. More information can be found here tagomobile.com/pricing    Embed Quote
