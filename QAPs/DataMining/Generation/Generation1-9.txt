★How can I generate website traffic with $0 marketing budget?My Startup is out of cash and we are 2 days before launch. I don't think we will see any investment coming in next 3 months not even from a family members so we need to start selling quickly.
It's simple and easy. Start a blog. I've started three separate blogs. All got traffic within a week by just writing decent content and using proper meta titles and descriptions. One of the most important factor for Google in consideration for SEO is content (and frequency and quality of content). If you're the writer, that content is free. You don't even need inbound links to drive traffic. Do the basics of optimizing your site and blog for SEO (meta title, description, etc.). Blog around relevant topics to your business and area. Use the Google keyword tool to find keyword with decent search volume and medium to low competition and you'll have traffic quickly. Blog regularly and write good content. There's a lot of crappy content out there. Think of original ideas and write and traffic will come. Start from there and then layer in social channels. The other suggestions here are good. There's definitely a lot of them. But blogging and writing content is one of the core aspects of SEO. SEO rank can take some time to build but once it's there, it sticks. You can see my business' blog below. We blog on trends in the influencer marketing space and without significant in bound links, rank highly for relevant search terms and drive significant daily traffic from Google.
