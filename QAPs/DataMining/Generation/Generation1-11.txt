★How can I generate website traffic with $0 marketing budget?My Startup is out of cash and we are 2 days before launch. I don't think we will see any investment coming in next 3 months not even from a family members so we need to start selling quickly.
For the sake of this answer (and because you are asking on Quora,) I'll presume you understand the concept of social platforms, I don't need to tell you about them. In any case, Ron and Christine have listed excellent choices and I hope you'll consider them. What I want to say is this - it's not about you, your business or your product. It's about your audience, and your market. First FIND your audience. They may be on some of the platforms Ron and Christie mentioned...they may be on a forum somewhere in a corner of the Internet - they may not be online at all. Find the people who care about what you have to say and talk with them. Don't pitch to them or advertise...just talk. Let them know that you are one of them and you have a body of knowledge that you can share. Then ENGAGE them. Recruit folks to be part of your team, enjoy the discussions you have with them, really get into the conversation for conversation's sake. Don't just be the company front blah blah blahing the company line. Lastly, REWARD those people who convert from audience to market, who actually buy your stuff. Give them incentive to talk you up, treat them like heroes, like team members. Let the folks that are your advocates know you appreciate them. It doesn't have to be something big...it's better if it's small, honestly. All of this will take time of course, but you can't get a ROI unless there's an I. If you're not investing money, be lavish with your Time.    Embed Quote
