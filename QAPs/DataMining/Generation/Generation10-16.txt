★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
Being able to fix a leaky faucet. Not terribly complicated, but it involves taking apart the faucet and replacing the worn out washer. Being able to build simple utility furniture from plywood -- bookshelves, coat rack, wardrobe. And having the satisfaction of knowing that it's not a piece of crap from Ikea made from composition board.    Embed Quote
