★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
One of the properties of random numbers is that should be such that no person can predict the number, with the condition that that person has access to all the data existing in the universe and unlimited computing power. But all the algorithms that we use are deterministic and based on existing data or the current time. So, we cannot actually get a random number. So, until we can exploit the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle or Schrodingers Cat Exp. I suppose you might as well use the following function. :-P    Embed Quote
