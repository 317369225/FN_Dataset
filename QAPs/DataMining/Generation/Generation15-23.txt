★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
True random numbers can only be generated from a natural source. Any program which uses only an 'algorithm'(math) is not truly random. But it is random enough for any purpose you may require it for! I once wrote a program, which generates true random numbers from laptop's microphone noise. But then, why go through such complexities when pseudo is good enough.    Embed Quote
