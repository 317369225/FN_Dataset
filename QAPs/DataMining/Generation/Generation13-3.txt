★Is Zynga our generation's Disney?Disney seems like a good target for Zynga to go after (from my limited standpoint)
"Our generation's Disney" is tie between Google and Apple.  Zynga is no where in the running. What made the Disney brand so unique to the generation that grew up immersed in Disney culture was not merely that it was a successful and popular film studio, but also that it expanded out beyond the confines of the silver screen in a quest to become more real -- Disneyland and then Disney World.  Walt offered our parents' generation an opportunity to experience a magical place where their two dimensional fantasies would come to life. Walt told Americans that needn't just watch movies and TV, but they could experience those imaginary worlds in real life.  Disney found it's place in our consciousness during the space age, an era when Americans were dreaming about fantastical scenarios becoming materially accessible -- some day putting a man on the moon. These days, Americans once again have that same lust for science fiction and fantasy coming to life, but now it is out desire to fuse ourselves with our technology.  We don't want to be space men these days, we want to be androids, integrated seamlessly with the electronic devices that connect us to the world around us.  Apple and Google are the companies whose iconic executives and seemingly impossible mission statements epitomize the fantasies of contemporary America. Zynga, on the other hand, is cleverly engineered for commercial success, and people sure do spend a lot of time consuming their products. But they are not leaving the same indelible impression on American culture that Disney, Apple, or Google have.    Embed Quote
