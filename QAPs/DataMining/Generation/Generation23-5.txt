★Why is the younger generation so opposed to capitalism?
Hell's no. I love making moneys! What's really the opposite of Capitalism these days? Communism? That didn't work out so hot. Even the communists are capitalists these days. What the younger generation is against is the crazy and unrealistic Ayn Randian philosophy that I should be some egotistical Ebenezer Scrooge who hordes gold and build my industrial empire on top of the bones of the poor and weak. My generation is now rich enough to live super comfortably, get a nice paycheck, AND be nice to my neighbor. As the world become more integrated its important to recognize that companies can't simply wage total war upon it's enemies since everything is so interdependent. It's not as if we're all struggling to get food on the table and attempting to overcome natural selection. What's your definition of capitalism?    Embed Quote
