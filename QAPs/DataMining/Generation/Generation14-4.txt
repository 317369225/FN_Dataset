★Will Facebook ever generate more revenue than Google?If so how will Facebook do this and when will it happen?
Certainly not !  Facebook is more of an entertainment. Google is a mixed bag with entertainment and productivity. With the services that Google offers, , people can do some really productive collaboration tasks such as document editing etc.. And also, Google is not just google.com, it has docs, maps, android, youtube and a big product base and the nicest thing about it is it provides seamless integration of all the services... On the other hand, FB just has a social networking and games platform. No body would get their paychecks just to be online and chatting with somebody or playing games. Certainly, the time spent by people on FB would be less than what they spend on other sites to do some productive work to earn their paychecks. Definitely there is lot of dependency on lot of the services outside the realm of FB. Also FB doesn't have any definitive monetizing ideas yet.. How can it assure its investors that the money they spend does not go in vain - certainly in doubt !    Embed Quote
