★Which is the best QR code generator?We are considering using QR codes on some posters and exhibition stands.  We are using a free provider.  Do the codes expire or run out?What's the benefit of using a paid provider?  Presumably this is to do with tracking?
Best code  or best service? There are some cool websites out there that let you choose colors or embed text. If you need an easy solution that creates the code and a mobile web page at the same time, I recommend LikeScan.com. You can up update the content at any time.  It is easy to include links to social media (e.g. "like" and "tweet") or embed a YouTube video, or include a subscription form. You can take any URL and make it into a QR code.  You can make it fancy with some online QR code generators, or have a graphic designer do that for you. (Disclosure: I developed the LikeScan website.)    Embed Quote
