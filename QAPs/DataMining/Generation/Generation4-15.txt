★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
I agree: lead generation is a waste of time. When you look at the end of this year who paid most of your salary, it's not leads but your present customers. And the same goes for next year. That is where the gold is, motivate your customer to buy more from you by delivering excellent service. And when you do, they will generate your 'leads'.    Embed Quote
