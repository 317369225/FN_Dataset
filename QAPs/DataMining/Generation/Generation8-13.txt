★What are the best lead generation tools?
I agree with Jordan Witkov, that it is important what your business is and who your potential client is. Otherwise, it's hard to find the perfect set of tools. But since you are asking only about lead generation tools I would like to recommend: Jigsaw Business Contact Directory of Business Contacts and Company Information - is a business directory where you can find contact and company information. I know it's old fashioned, but sometimes it might be useful. LiveChat - real-time chat alternative to phone and e-mail. Colibri IO - Growth Hacking Tool - Growth Hacking Tool that tells how to generate leads by injecting discussion on social networks.    Embed Quote
