★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
Absolutely not...lead generation can never die. Any business thrives on leads and the lead generation comes to a halt, the market will become stagnant, well its a viscous circle. On the contrary, I believe that lead generation is only set to grow further. With the internet spreading its wings with each passing day, a good salesperson will first have to qualify who is a good lead, which sources are most productive and all this alongside the lead generation process. Then they will have to mark them as prospects. Lead generation is a business far away from dying.    Embed Quote
