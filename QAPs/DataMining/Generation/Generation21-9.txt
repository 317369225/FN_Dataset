â˜…What's the best marketing automation tool for B2B lead generation?"B2B Marketing" lists the following available tools: Pardot, Eloqua, Silverpop B2B Engage, Marketo, Aprimo, Neolane, Manticore, HubSpot, Swift Pages and Vertical Response.
I agree with Carlos and Howard. While there are great products on the market - Eloqua Eloqua, Silverpop, and Marketo are terrific and Aprimo is ideal for large and complex companies (Aprimo is a client), the simple fact is how you use it is far more important than which tool you select. You can choose from lots of guitars, but the guitar does not make you Eric Clapton or Carlos Santana.
