★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
In general, software creates random numbers with a PRNG. PRNG stands for Pseudo-Random Number Generator, which gives away the secret: no, the numbers are not truly random. In some cases the random number generators are seeded with values that might be considered random, such as the low order bits of a system clock, or time between mouse movements. In practice these have been shown to be not-too-random. More importantly, even if one starts with a random seed, the random number generator then creates a sequence of numbers that are well-defined. As long as you know the algorithm to generate subsequent numbers, you can predict exactly which number will be next in the sequence. So no, they are not random. To get real random numbers you need to use some sort of physical process, as described here: http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele... For good thoughts about randomness, RFC 1750 is not a bad place to start. http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1750.txt    Embed Quote
