★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
I disagree. I think even using advertising platforms, you are generating leads. I am a strong believer of " Money is in your list". To build a successful business online, you would need to generate and build list. This is my 2 cents :-)    Embed Quote
