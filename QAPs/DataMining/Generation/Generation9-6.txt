★Did the Baby Boomer generation commit generational theft?
How else were they going to pay for their cocaine? I watched as they began to pursue a path of enlightenment and fight against the paranoid silent generation. Then, as soon as a few of them were shot down (Kent State), they did the quickest about face I've ever seen and dove into the corruption like fish into water. Their mantra changed form "tune in, turn on, and drop out", to "everything that isn't green is grey." Their physical creativity spent on music and tie dye, and their idealism lost for want of courage and conviction, they convinced themselves that if they couldn't realize their vision, no one could, so they settled into a new idealism, a bourgeoisie sensibility well suited to their already over intellectualized world view. They decided that the best product to sell, as it involved no actual work, was their imagination, so they refined the concept of making money the product, and/or made their livings as clowns, entertaining themselves and the world (or facilitating that entertainment), and used the wealth and security built by the earlier generations to convince everyone else to buy into their ponzi scheme society. Now, even more terrified of death as it will now be an ignominious one, they cling to whatever real and imaginary wealth remains to keep it at bay, and expect those who followed to sacrifice their integrity with equal enthusiasm, and admire them for their pragmatism and the limited social progress we have made that's more fairly attributed to their neglected children. And the world burns.    Embed Quote
