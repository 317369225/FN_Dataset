★Is there a Motorola plan for a 3rd generation Moto G?
Ofcourse... Its their best selling smartphone ever... They will ( I suppose) add more features to it and slightly bump the price tag to 14k and have features like SD 615 64bit processor 1.5 gb ram they will keep the camera same though they might add some moto x features like active display and moto voice If they switch to amoled: It would be the best day of my life    Embed Quote
