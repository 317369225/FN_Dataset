★Why is the younger generation so opposed to capitalism?
Personally I think the idea of Capitalism is fabulous. I want to support free markets and I want people to regulate themselves. I want less government and I want more growth of the community through networking. Making our own schools, transit systems, credit and labor unions, enriching the lives of our people.   The main problems with Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism is not in the ideologies as each of them carry benefits and the best system is going to borrow principles from each. It's with the political connotations of the words, and the histories surrounding each of the movements.   Here in the US we don't practice capitalism as much as some form of Corporate oligarchy. It isn't Capitalism that most young people oppose. It's broader ideas like the wrongful accumulation of wealth and the privatization of power. It's just easier to blame Capitalism when you're younger because you haven't had the time to figure out what the problems really are.    Embed Quote
