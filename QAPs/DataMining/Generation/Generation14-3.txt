★Will Facebook ever generate more revenue than Google?If so how will Facebook do this and when will it happen?
No time soon, but if Facebook is patient enough it could grow very fast in revenues after 4 till 5 years from now. But due to the greedy IPO, Facebook feels the need to grow fast and is showing a lack of patience with new commercial formats. Facebook should take time to completely turnaround its commercial model. (Of course in the way I described in my book, but that sounds rather arrogant ;-)    Embed Quote
