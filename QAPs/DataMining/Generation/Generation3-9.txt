★Is the emerging generation of American adults a bunch of "spoiled, entitled, lazy, whiny, unappreciative brats"?Some context for those who don't know... The Baby Boomers are those born 1946-1964, Generation X were born 1964-1981, Generation Y/The Echoes/The Millennials were born 1981-2000's. Do you think what the media, and older generations are saying about The Echoes is true?
I'd say those who got pensions, cheap degrees, cheap land, high real wages and experienced very low costs of living were the "spoiled, entitled, lazy, whiny, unappreciateve brats" - aka the boomers. The current generation of adults is graduating into a tough market, without the job security or benefits, increased competition, much higher costs of living, and lower real wages than the previous generation of so called "hard workers". The current generation is getting, what's that word again, oh yeah, "fucked". How about we defund social security and medicare, and stop honouring unsustainable pensions just to prove my point. You've had a good run boomers. Don't poke the hornets nest from your lawn. We can vote now.    Embed Quote
