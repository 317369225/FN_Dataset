★What are the best lead generation tools?
I've recently read a book called Predictable Revenue by Aaron Ross, and it's reshaped the way that we grow and manage our sales team as well as how we've implemented tools that are reflective of delivering a sustainable and predictable revenue. We've recently introduced four new sales reps in the team and provide them with a very simple yet powerful solution in terms of SaaS products to work with: 1. found.ly - each sales rep has their own account to find and build their on targeted list of leads. The tool also searches for the email addresses and social records so that our team can prospect out. 2. Streak CRM. each sales rep has their own professional gmail account with Streak CRM built in (it's really smart as the CRM is built into your inbox). 3. Rapportive. another incredible tool that provides insights into the prospect to improve engagement rates. We've trialled various combinations of tools and this is delivering significant and predictable growth for our outbound activity.    Embed Quote
