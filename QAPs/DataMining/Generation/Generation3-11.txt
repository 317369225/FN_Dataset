★Is the emerging generation of American adults a bunch of "spoiled, entitled, lazy, whiny, unappreciative brats"?Some context for those who don't know... The Baby Boomers are those born 1946-1964, Generation X were born 1964-1981, Generation Y/The Echoes/The Millennials were born 1981-2000's. Do you think what the media, and older generations are saying about The Echoes is true?
The Boomers cannot be equaled in their desire to have it all, and their indifference to the fact that they're leaving crumbs behind for their children and grandchildren.  They're the first to fight to protect their own benefits while simultaneously trying to cut and abolish them for all who follow.    Embed Quote
