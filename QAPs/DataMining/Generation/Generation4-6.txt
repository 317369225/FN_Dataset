★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
I agree with Dan - as long as one person sells to another, we are likely to experience some form of lead generation. Some people are looking for what we do (inbound marketing), others will need to be contacted (direct marketing). To neglect either of these is to cut one's potential revenue dramatically.    Embed Quote
