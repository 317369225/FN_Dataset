★What's the best marketing automation tool for B2B lead generation?"B2B Marketing" lists the following available tools: Pardot, Eloqua, Silverpop B2B Engage, Marketo, Aprimo, Neolane, Manticore, HubSpot, Swift Pages and Vertical Response.
The right vendor really depends on your budget and breadth of features required.  Like with any software purchase, I'd recommend charting out your specific requirements in advance to help narrow your search.  Tight integration with your CRM system should be one of the first things to look for. Eloqua and Marketo are high end and feature-rich, but may provide more functionality than needed unless you require highly complex triggered drip marketing and advanced lead scoring methodologies.  Other vendors worth researching in this category are Manticore and Genius. There is an emerging cluster of fairly powerful B2B Marketing Automation vendors whose price points are more amenable to the SMB market.  Pardot, Act-On Software, Loopfuse and SalesFusion are a few examples worth checking out. I'm also noticing that traditional email service providers have migrated into the space.  If your primary goal is to use marketing automation as a vehicle for email marketing, Silverpop may be worth considering.  Very robust email platform with comparable automation features at a slightly lower cost than an Eloqua. I can't speak to HubSpot, but I know they package their offering a bit differently than other vendors in the space.    Embed Quote
