★Why is the younger generation so opposed to capitalism?
If familiarity breeds contempt, and I have no evidence to convince me that it doesn't, our younger generation only knows capitalism. I leaned that way through much of the 60's until I had a chance to visit Prague during 1971. This was three years after the Prague Spring had been squelched by Soviet tanks and my hosts were the family of a friend who had fled to West Germany during that brief moment when you could flee. Capitalism sometimes sucks, but good old-fashioned state socialism sucked really big time. The first thing you noticed were the police. As a foreigner, I had to report every day to the local station. The second thing you noticed were stores with empty shelves and no choice. The next thing you noticed were no tourists -- one of the most beautiful cities I had ever seen and it was empty. There were virtually no hotels and few restaurants. I went to a graveyard outside the city and saw the grave of a young man, Jan Palach, who had burned himself in protest against the Soviet incursion. It was a grave marked only by flowers that were piled there every day. Life inside a totalitarian regime was not exactly hell, but it was close to it and most of the students I met knew that they had to hide their opposition if they wanted to work.    Embed Quote
