★What are the differences between Generation X and Millennial Generation?
In my personal opinion as someone born in 1975. Generation Y likes texting a lot more than Generation X. A millenial friend of mine doesn't even have a voicemail and won't pick up the phone if you call him.  Generation Y is also more likely to get tattoos and body piercings.  Generation Y enjoys multitasking more, they can watch TV and text on the phone at the same time. Gen X on the other hand could play Dungeons and Dragons or a video game and forget about the rest of the world.    Embed Quote
