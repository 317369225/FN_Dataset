★How did our generation become the helicopter generation?My friends and I think about this, and we have some theories.
I think about this a lot too. My oldest child will be 10 soon, and I keep thinking of how different my life was at that age. At 10, I was babysitting, cooking simple meals, biking across town to meet my friends at the community pool, hanging out at the park on nice days and the library on rainy ones, or migrating from one friend's house or yard to the next. Sometimes I went home for lunch, sometimes I bought one with my allowance or ate with a friend. My kids spend far too much time indoors. If they go outside they have to stay in our small yard. Time with friends is nearly always scheduled. In all honesty, it drives me a little nuts. They are underfoot all day long. The older two pick at each other & argue a lot when they are home from school. They don't know how to swim, or fish, or climb trees. I don't have a lot of confidence in their ability to take care of themselves if not supervised. I am making a big effort to get them to where they can have more independence. It does them no favors to be lacking in these areas. It is hard though! Hard to let go, sure, but also because things are different now...it is not just my kids. They can't just go out and find someone to play with because the other kids aren't out either!! There is a certain "village" component missing, too. If I got up to shenanigans, it was a safe bet that someone would see it & my parents would hear of it. I don't have that kind of social network here.    Embed Quote
