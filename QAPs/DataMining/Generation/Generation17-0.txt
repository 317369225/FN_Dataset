★Are we a philosophically enlightened generation?
I don't think so. In my opinion, philosophy in general is such a subject which we feel comfortable discussing with others who respect our opinion. Most of the times, people from our previous generations don't value our points because they think us to be immature due to lack of experience. Plus there is the thing called generation gap. All the generations have some viewpoints of their own and so those are easy to be discussed with like-minded people. I have seen my mother and aunts discussing about life- how it is in real and how it is portrayed in daily soaps. My grandmother tells us stories from her younger life and suggests what we should or shouldn't do. I think it's all about whom we feel secured to open up with. Age, generation doesn't matter. See here in Quora, you'll find people from all over the world- a community for people to bond via their thoughts, where age or location doesn't matter. So I can't say ours is a more philosophically enlightened generation than the previous ones. Thanks for asking :)    Embed Quote
