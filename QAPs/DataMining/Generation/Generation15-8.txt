★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
"Truly random" needs better defining.  Good random number generators are sufficiently statistically random, but yes they are still generated by an algorithm, just not an easily predictable one. These algorithms generally start with a "seed" number.  Given the same seed they will produce the same sequence.  Seeds themselves are randomized in cases where you don't want this repeatability by a number that is as random as possible. Most commonly this seed is based on the number of milliseconds the computer has been running for.  This is very hard to repeat exactly.  Even two identical startups of a machine are likely to vary from physical factors some number of  milliseconds.  (One example of such a physical factor would be the exact position of the harddrive heads at start up.)    Embed Quote
