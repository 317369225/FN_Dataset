★What's the best marketing automation tool for B2B lead generation?"B2B Marketing" lists the following available tools: Pardot, Eloqua, Silverpop B2B Engage, Marketo, Aprimo, Neolane, Manticore, HubSpot, Swift Pages and Vertical Response.
I am biased, as I worked there in the past, but my vote is for Marketo.  I purchased it once before working there, and once since, and find that it is a must-have for marketing automation.    Embed Quote
