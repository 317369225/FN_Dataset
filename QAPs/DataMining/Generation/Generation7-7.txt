★Who is the finest Bollywood actor and actress of our generation and why?The 70s / 80s saw the emergence of Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Kamal Haasan. In terms of popular actors, it would be probably one of the Khans but I am looking for great actors. Please post one answer so that people can upvote / downvote an individual rather than a bunch of actors.
I wonder why Farhan akhtar is not in the list .he has a great passion and dedication in Indian cinema.  Apart from his direction , vocalist , dialogue writer he has a immense talents in acting. , such a work being done in bhaag milkha bhaag. Truly this guy has a place in Indian cinema    Embed Quote
