★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
When you ask about in programming, then I'd like to quote the early computer scientist John von Neumann: Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin. If you have a deterministic computer, running a deterministic program (not that it can run any other) then of course any number the program serves up can never be random. But in practice, our computers aren't entirely deterministic batch-processing beasts. It's possible to have specialized hardware, or (ab)use various sensors in them (including mice and keyboards!) in order to get more or less real random numbers. It's a really good idea to run whatever you get from these through a complex algorithm, though.    Embed Quote
