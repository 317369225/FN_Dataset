★How can I generate website traffic with $0 marketing budget?My Startup is out of cash and we are 2 days before launch. I don't think we will see any investment coming in next 3 months not even from a family members so we need to start selling quickly.
Strategic partnerships are usually free and powerful enough to launch companies into stardom. Who already has your customers? How can you add value for them making it a win for them to promote your company? Maybe you start an affiliate program or maybe you just negotiate deals one by one. My buddy Chris Brisson showed me that just by making his product something that enhances (integrations) another product that other company will tell all their customers to go buy your product. If there is someone out there who already has your markets attention then there is a deal that can be made.    Embed Quote
