I agree with Clare. You are really need to figure out what is the best fit for your organization. Smaller businesses might not be able to afford the top tier MA providers but dont discount them just because you are small. Many of them price based on database size so they might be more affordable than you think. There are really two components to consider...CRM and Marketing Automation. How well does your MA integrate with your CRM (it does integrate, right?)  I have only used Salesforce.com as my CRM so I cannot comment on other CRM systems. I  would recommend you go with a CRM system that is a SaaS model so your team can access it from anywhere using any device. As for Marketing Automation, I have used Marketo and Eloqua. My first experience with MA was with Marketo. It worked well enough and the UI is  nice, but after using it for a year, I started to note the limitations. For example, off the shelf WYSIWYG editors for emails and landing pages, no ability to turn off tracking for landing pages without a decent understanding of Java, no ability to write to the account level, and too easy to screw up data in your CRM via auto-syncs. When I moved to my current company and was presenting MA solutions to the Exec team, I suggested we go with Eloqua. We've been on Eloqua for over a year now and it has been an excellent experience. If you are in the UK, make sure you ask your sales rep about tracking and privacy laws and how they deal with it. Eloqua is a leader in keeping up with the changing laws around this topic. Not sure what/if Marketo is doing around this key topic for the UK and Europe.    Embed Quote
