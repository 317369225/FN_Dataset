★Who is the finest Bollywood actor and actress of our generation and why?The 70s / 80s saw the emergence of Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Kamal Haasan. In terms of popular actors, it would be probably one of the Khans but I am looking for great actors.

I choose Amrish Puri without an iota of doubt. We all know him as the greatest villain of bollywood. The kind of roles that he played is a testimony to his versatility. Following are some of the roles : As Mogambo in Mr India: As a lachaar baap in Ghatak: As an orthodox and stubborn father in D.D.L.J.: In his trademark  Thakur roles(in Ram Lakhan): As an aggressive and dominating boss in Aitraaz: As Commissioner of Police in Garv: In indiana jones : As a patriarch in Virasat: As angarchand in Hulchul: As Chief Minister Balraj Chauhan in Nayak: Edit1: Updated to incorporate Nishant's,Nikhil's and Sunil's inputs.    Embed Quote
