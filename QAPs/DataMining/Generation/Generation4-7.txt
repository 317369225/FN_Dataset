★Is lead generation a dying business?There have been a number of articles published stating that because of more efficient internet advertising platforms, and for other, similar reasons, online lead generation is "dead."  Agree or disagree?
I agree with Krista - Lead Generation is far from deade. With the new technologies constantly entering our markets we are finding new and better ways to reach our prospects. I work with business to help increase their lead generation through live chat technology, and it has shown that in 6 months it now accounts for 15% of all quotes and their live chat to quote rate is at 35%. This is far from a dying industry.    Embed Quote
