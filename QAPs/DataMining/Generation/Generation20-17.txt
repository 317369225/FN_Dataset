★Is there a Motorola plan for a 3rd generation Moto G?
I haven't head about it. But, there will be a 3rd generation Moto G as the successors didn't stop. We have never heard about iPhone 8 but one day it will also arrive. So, it's just like the case of iPhone as everyone knows a successor is cooking in future.    Embed Quote
