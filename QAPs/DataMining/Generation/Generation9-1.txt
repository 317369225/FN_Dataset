★Did the Baby Boomer generation commit generational theft?
Yes, and they continue to do so.    The "theft" is not paying the full cost of government programs as we all consume those services.   This effectively uses up the debt capacity of the nation in addition to, of course, leaving an horrendous debt service burden for future generations.   Our debt is nearing 100% of GDP, many economists think that 125% is the upper limit without substantially negative impacts to the economy.      The net effect is that when the millenials come into power, most of our borrowing capacity as a nation will be already be committed to past consumption, and just the debt service will consume a huge amount (as a percentage) of the total government revenue.  You can see this writ small in places like Detroit where a huge part of current revenue goes to pay for debt service and pension obligations - all well and fine of you are on the receiving end of payments, but for residents that need service, the cupboard is bare - courtesy mismanagement of prior generations of leaders. A couple of points:   why should the boomers get the blame?   Fair point, boomers aren't in charge of everything, but they are disproportionately in positions of power both in government and out.   And, of course the boomers should be setting an adult example of how to manage the country just as a matter of principle.  Second, is government debt all bad?  Of course not, but debt should be used to purchase/generate public assets (think building a bridge) as opposed to paying for routine consumption (think of buying food on a credit card - without the ability to pay it off that month).    Embed Quote
