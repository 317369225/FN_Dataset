★What are the differences between Generation X and Millennial Generation?
Our data science team just happened to finish an analysis on your question :) Generation X Gen X-ers tend to be keen to be the top boss and will work hard to achieve a position of influence. They become highly competitive and ambitious, eager to lead the field. However, they do realize the importance of team and community spirit – what affects one, affects all and they prefer collaboration. With time, they become adept at adapting and develop the gift of getting along with anybody. Millennials / Generation Y Millennials believe in living life in the fast lane – risk becomes their middle name. Why plan anything when you can get results through determination and energy? Characterized by a high amount of intellectual curiosity, they love to learn and like to explore any topics of interest. But that doesn’t mean they are all hyper-emotional – in fact, they develop a cool and collected demeanor which may sometimes come across as emotionally cold. What's interesting both now and moving forward is the compatibility of these generations in the workplace (Gen Z is quickly catching up).  We used a neat mechanism (and a ton of psychometrics) that we call FitScore to reveal which generations work best together and which clash.  For example, Gen Z get along better with Gen X with a FitScore of 64.75% (higher is better) compared to Gen Z & Gen Y (49.24%).
