★Are we a philosophically enlightened generation?
In many respects, no.  During the age of enlightenment  much close study was done of the philosophers,  particular the classic Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.   Study the history of the Jesuits.  Whether you agree with them or not, you must admire the intellectual discipline imposed on members of their order.  These people were Mind Warriors for the Church. Now we are into sound bytes and computer generated images  (which have their uses).  They are no substitute for following abstract ideas down to bed rock.  A good indication of this is the average length of paragraphs that people use these days in their writing.  They keep the paragraphs short because they do not have the stamina to plumb the depths of ideas. I am no exception.  My paragraphs run 2 to 5 sentences.  By enlightenment standards that is kindergarten performance.    Embed Quote
