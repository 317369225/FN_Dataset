★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
As explained, there's no true randomness in pure software because our computers act in a well defined manner and we would not want them any other way. But this can be changed by using sources of randomness. These can be times between the user pressing two keys, mouse input, CPU consumption, a sum of all the bytes received through the wire, or even input from specialized chips.    Embed Quote
