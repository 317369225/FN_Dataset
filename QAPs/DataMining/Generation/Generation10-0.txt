★What are skills the older generation has these days that younger generations lack?
Understanding the joy of real correspondence, especially the love letter. I have stacks of wonderful letters I have saved over my life time.  But the ones which always give me a special lift are the love letters from young men with whom I was in a relationship. I often wonder what the biographers of tomorrow are going to use for research materials.  Everything is so transient today when it comes to communication. Emails and texts are deleted.  Social media exchanges happens in the blink of an eye and then are scrolled past. I hear it said that nothing put on the Internet ever really disappears, but does that mean that in the future researchers will need court orders to unlock the email caches of those who have died?  Do the young today think about the difficulty those who come after them may have in understanding their love affairs, their family dynamics, their hopes and passions when the written record they are leaving is all electronic? I feel badly for someone who does not know the joy of receiving a love letter in the mail -- the stationery carefully chosen, the ink scrawled across the page, the handwriting bold or cramped, but personal to the sender.  What a secret thrill to read and re-read a real love letter, sent by post, long-awaited and carefully answered. And what sweet nostalgia to open such a letter decades later and remember what it was like to be so young and so in love.  To savor that long-ago time and then tuck it carefully away again. Emails and texts just aren't the same.    Embed Quote
