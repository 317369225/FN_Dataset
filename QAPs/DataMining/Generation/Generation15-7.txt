★In programming, is a random number generator truly random?Or are the random numbers generated by a hidden algorithm?
Without having any knowledge in the art of creating random numbers, I remember an article pointing to http://www.random.org/. They offer further information on randomness. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs    Embed Quote
