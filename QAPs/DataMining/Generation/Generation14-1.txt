★Will Facebook ever generate more revenue than Google?If so how will Facebook do this and when will it happen?
Google offers something that Facebook cannot currently offer. When someone searches on Google, ads that show are directly related to that search. As a result, people are likely to click on the ad. Facebook is more like television. Marketers are guessing that their products are likely to sell to a specific demographic, and hope that the demographic will actually pay attention to the ad and click on it. When I run ads on Facebook I get clicks and I get conversions, but nothing like I do on Google. Google costs more, but it is substantially more effective, and if I have the budget for one or the other, I spend the money on Google. I never spend the kind of money on Facebook that I am willing to spend on Google. If Facebook ever develops social search for its site and is able to implement keyword marketing similar to Google (leaving aside any patent issues) then Facebook will be in a better position to increase its revenue. I agree with Mark's excellent analysis. While anything can happen, I don't see Facebook ever catching up with Google, unless it adds something new and unique that generates income. Perhaps we will see Minority Report like ads come from one or the other. That will definitely generate substantial revenue. And fear. If I had to pick which one would manage that sort of ad first, I would bet on Google based on the depth of talent and access to technology. Facebook has very talented people. Google has more.    Embed Quote
