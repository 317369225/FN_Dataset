★Who is the finest Bollywood actor and actress of our generation and why?The 70s / 80s saw the emergence of Naseerudin Shah, Om Puri and Kamal Haasan. In terms of popular actors, it would be probably one of the Khans but I am looking for great actors. Please post one answer so that people can upvote / downvote an individual rather than a bunch of actors.
Manoj Bajpai .......his versatility is outstanding and the naturalness of his acting is quite evident in his performances. from being a politician to a professor to a gangster he's done it all. also a point to be notified is that he has done lead roles,side roles,villainous roles,jocular roles,fanatic roles,patriotic roles ......u name the role and its there. He deserves so much more than he has recieved and national award will embrace him someday although he already had one for supporting actor !!!!    Embed Quote
