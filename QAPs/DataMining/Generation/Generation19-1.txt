★Who are the visionaries of our generation?I want to know who living amongst us would be the next Richard Feynman, Richard Dawkins, Viktor Frankl etc and would carry the scientific/philosophical movement forward? I believe that it is better to get to know, support and get behind them sooner if possible.
Michio Kaku - a theoretical physicist specializing in string field theory, and a futurist. Aubrey de Grey - an English author and theoretician in the field of gerontology, and the Chief Science Officer of the SENS Foundation. Muhammad Yunus - a Bangladeshi banker and economist, he developed and popularized the concept of microcredit. Richard Branson - a millionaire and the man behind Virgin Galactic. James Randi - a scientific skeptic and the man behind the one million dollar paranormal challenge (http://tinyurl.com/2jlyl3). The guys on this list are the living visionaries that I admire today, but the subtext of the question kind of asked about something else, and none of these guys are of my generation, now that I think about it. I hope that this answer might help someone to think of some related but obscure visionary, that we might support and get behind them as soon as possible. PS: Digging through the TED talks will help us find some visionary nuggets (www.ted.com).    Embed Quote
