★What will our generation be called?
Let me dig both the sides, please christen as how you think  - deem to be fit :) A2A. Here you go, Mr/Ms Anon :P The pride moments: The Positive names Adapters : We cling on to anything that is radical, swift.  The multi-pin laptop adapters are our inspiration ! Rationals: We fight for homosexuals, women equality and online rights! With logics and anecdotes. Embracers: We love to hug. New trends, brands and yeah, people too! Innovators: Jugaad to Mars mission, This generation has lifted the human aspirations to a different planet altogether, no pun intended. Okay, brace yourself. The not-so-cozy aspects of our lives Apathists: God forbid what happens to our neighbour, wait, what is his name ? Kill the nature, so what, You can own three Porsche cars :) Critical gauges: We can criticize (and presume as objectively dissect) anything. From Gandhi to Godse. Modi to Aam admi. Rahul to Empowerment, C'mon. Sachin to Sharapova. Often un/misinformed. Savvy Robots: Addicted, sorry, official slaves to smart phones. Stalkers: The very theme of Facebook or for that matter, any SNS. Intrusion into privacy, often uninvited.  Article 19- Right to freedom as our shield. We cloud it under socialization. Debates are anticipated. These are seen in a narrow perspective. If you encompass all our features, alas, a name has to be invented !! No existing one will serve the purpose ! However, we shall update the list ! P.S I donno if  I can have more than one name :) The name I have for myself, and the one the rest of the world calls me as !    Embed Quote
