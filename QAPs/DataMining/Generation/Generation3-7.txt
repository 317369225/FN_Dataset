★Is the emerging generation of American adults a bunch of "spoiled, entitled, lazy, whiny, unappreciative brats"?Some context for those who don't know... The Baby Boomers are those born 1946-1964, Generation X were born 1964-1981, Generation Y/The Echoes/The Millennials were born 1981-2000's. Do you think what the media, and older generations are saying about The Echoes is true?
This happens every generation. This is nothing new at all. There is a prevalence of over-romanticism of "the good old days" going back to the middle ages. (ie - the attitude of "The last group was great, our group is good, but this next group sucks," etc.)  History shows the opposite is true; Basically, as you'd expect with human progression, every generation is better than the last, I think one reason older generations think less of younger generations is because younger generations don't care about ineffective/outdated class, structure or legacy systems. The frustration stems from the fact that they want so badly to tear these legacy institutions down, but at this point in their lives are simply powerless to do so. Like Sanjay Sabnani stated, why slave away for someone else if it doesn't make you happy? Why have any loyalty to corporations when the feeling isn't the least bit reciprocal? As Matt Damon would put it, why drop $100k "on a fahkin education you coulda got for a dollah fifty in late chahges at the public library." (Or online) Younger generational attitudes come across as "dangerous thinking", when really it's just the way of the future, 30 years too early.    Embed Quote
