★What are the best lead generation tools?
There are practically two types of lead generation tools - outbound and inbound. We usually mean inbound, but I'll get back to that. Outbound 1. We were super happy to find BuiltWith (http://BuiltWith.com) to figure out what companies (sites) were potential customers. 2. We then used ProspectAce (http://www.autopilothq.com/prosp...), Ebsta (http://www.ebsta.com/) or Ecquire (http://ecquire.com/) to get the leads from Linkedin to Salesforce. 3a. We inMailed them on LinkedIn, or 3b. Try to find their email address, either manually by paying a company like LeadGenius (http://LeadGenius.com) or by guessing their email address and use Rapportive (Rapportive) to verify it, or 3c. Seeing if we have mutual contacts on Conspire (Conspire) to get an introduction. Inbound With inbound lead generation there are a couple of sources - your blog, your own landing pages, and social media. Marketo (http://www.marketo.com/) and Hubspot (http://www.hubspot.com/) both do all the work from landing pages, lead scoring, conversion tracking, and drip marketing. An alternative for lead scoring is Infer (http://infer.com). An alternative to drip marketing is to use Customer.io (http://Customer.io) or if you already use another tool to track your data (Mixpanel, Keen.io) you can use Segment.io (http://Segment.io)  to push your data into multiple different systems. For social media management I can recommend HootSuite (http://www.hootsuite.com) and Buffer (http://www.bufferapp.com), but maybe this was not the focus of your question. Ending words :) Tools come and go especially in this space on a weekly base. Use sites like Producthunt or Betalist to find new tools. Try them out and dismiss them if they don't help you. Personally I find content marketing (like a blog or Quora) the most sympathetic as you try to add value to the reader independently if they are your customer. We just found Colibri.io ( https://colibri.io), and maybe that is a good tool to find more places to blog on.    Embed Quote
