★What is an intuitive explanation of gradient descent?
Adding to Eren Golge and Params Raman  Which explains well what gradient decent is. I would add a bit on model selection or choice of irritation function and steepest decent. CHOICE OF IRRITATION FUNCTION: You have a goal(expressed in english). Now the goal in english needs to be converted to a mathematical irritation function over the space(like latitude and longitute is space and height above sea level being you irritation function, the chosen mountain range being the model choice). Every irritation function is matched to a mountain range in this universe. Now assume there would be an ideal irritation function which matched with a mountain range in this universe. But say we live on earth and dont have the resource to travel through space and time.  The behaviour of this function is kind of like what space irritated you in english might also irritate you mathematically. So if you are in a space where irritation function has high values then you should also feel emotionally irritated in those locations. But since we are on earth we have very few choices of which mountain range to choose(Like how steep or curvy we would like our mountains to be or different stuffs like that). So even before doing gradient decent we make a choice of which mountain range to decent on.   STEEPEST DECENT: Also I would like to give an intuitive explaination of steepest decent. Its is in the eyes of the mountaineer that what he thinks steepest means(he may exclude the unsafe ways or he may choose to walk in a direction alligned to the sun). Its like how he choses his distance(will it be geodesic or height above sea level or some other fancy ways to choose it). So based on you choice of measure you will choose a path which takes you down fastest. P.S. You need to be immortal too.    Embed Quote
