★How can gradient descent algorithm be implemented with logic gates?
There are so many ways to solve this problem. Without further constraint to your problem, the simplest most generic solution that comes to mind is to instantiate a simple micro controller in the FPGA and implement the search algorithm on this controller using C/C++.    Embed Quote
