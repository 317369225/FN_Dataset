★In what online classification scenarios is stochastic gradient descent a better choice than Naive Bayesian?Both are methods for online learning. In what scenarios would you use stochastic gradient descent (with logistic regression) and vice versa? Please explain why.
SGD is just a method of learning a logistic model's coefficients. It should get you the same results as any other method; if you're impatient and cut it off early that won't be quite true but it won't be wildly different either. So the question is really logistic regression vs. naive Bayes Both can perform well in different situations, but the basic difference is this: Naive bayes is very simple. It's not bad, but it's not very strongly founded either. Logistic regression has a lot more theory behind it, won't give you crazy, hard-to-interpret results, and is probably in general a little more robust; it can also be regularized. It is absolutely no trouble to implement both and compare their cross-validation scores.    Embed Quote
