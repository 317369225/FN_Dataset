★What is an intuitive explanation of gradient descent?
assume you are at the top of a mountain. And you are blind. Your aim is to arrive the piedmont to below as quickly as possible. You also do not know the structure of the mountain side as well thus most reasonable choice is to choose steepest descent to go down but as I said you are blind so no structural information in advance. You need a some kind of heuristic to find the correct way. One of the best choice and the simplest one is to check the decline rate by single step for each possible direction and choose the most steepest one. Gradient of a function also gives the this heuristic information to algorithm when we think the function as a mountain landscape that we try to find the lowest part as the minimum of the function.    Embed Quote
