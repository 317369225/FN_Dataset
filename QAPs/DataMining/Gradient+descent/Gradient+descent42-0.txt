★What is the best convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent methods?If you know any good paper, please suggest me. Thank you so much in advance.
These no single universal value, but it depends on your problem, please refer to these papers, these give good insight about this: 1. Back-propagation tricks (Page on bottou.org) 2. Stochastic Approximations (Page on bottou.org) 3. Stochastic Learning in NN(Page on bottou.org)    Embed Quote
