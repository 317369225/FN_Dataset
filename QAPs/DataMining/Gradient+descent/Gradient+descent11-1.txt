★Convex Optimization: Why use gradient descent when the normal equation exists?
Other reasons besides computational complexity of matrix calculations: data streams: when data comes in as a continuous stream of items, without possibility to buffer all the samples, the closed form solution is not applicable; Data stream mining concept drift: when statistical properties of the data evolve over time, iterative training allows for smooth adaptation to new characteristics without completely forgetting the old ones; Concept drift generalization: iterative method gives approximate solution and this is a feature, not a bug, because this makes the algorithm more robust against outliers and improves accuracy on new unseen examples    Embed Quote
