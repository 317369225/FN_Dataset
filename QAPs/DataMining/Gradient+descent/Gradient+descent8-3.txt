★Mathematical Optimization: Why would someone use gradient descent for a convex function?Why wouldn't they just find the derivative of this function, and look for the minimum in the traditional way?
Gradient descent can be pretty easily modified to deal with constraints, whereas finding an analytic solution to constrained optimization problems is generally a fool's errand.    Embed Quote
