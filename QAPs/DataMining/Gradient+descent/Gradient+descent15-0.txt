★How does stochastic gradient descent work?Please assume a familiarity with ordinary gradient descent in your answers.
Basically, instead of summing over all the training examples and then computing the gradient like in ordinary gradient descent, in stochastic gradient descent, the gradient is computed and the weights are updated for each training example. You can think of this as taking small steps down the slope, at each training example, which is far more efficient than ordinary gradient descent (which is not practical for large datasets). Here is pseudo-code to illustrate this: while (iter < maxIter) {    for i = 1... # of training examples    {         compute gradient         update weights    }    iter++ } Note that stochastic gradient descent, as the name suggests, is stochastic. That means that the minima where it ends up is completely random and depends on the weight initialization. Usually it takes a lot longer for stochastic gradient descent to converge to a global minimum than gradient descent, but gives a good solution much faster, for obvious reasons.    Embed Quote
