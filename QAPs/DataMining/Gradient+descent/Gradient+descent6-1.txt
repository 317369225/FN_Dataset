★What is an implementation of gradient descent in Matlab?For a logistic regression, the gradient descent is: / =
Though it is very simple to program gradient descent in MATLAB. Still if you need a code for gradient descent (which is basically the steepest descent with L2 Norm)  - download it from http://www.searching-eye.com/san... (See under section-2 of this page) You can also download coordinate descent (steepest descent with L1 Norm) and modified gradient descent (changing the coordinate system, with quadratic norm). Also available is the Newton method. Each code has an inherent example and a corresponding video lecture.    Embed Quote
