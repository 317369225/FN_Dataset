★Does gradient descent only work under unconstrained conditions?
You can adapt gradient descent to work on constrained problems.  One popular approach is the barrier method.  This is explained in chapter 11 of Boyd and Vandenberghe for Newton's method; the approach for gradient descent is largely the same. (There are other approaches as well, which will be discussed in any text on nonlinear optimization.)    Embed Quote
