★What is an intuitive explanation of gradient descent?
The gradient is a vector which points in the direction in the domain that the function decreases/increases most. Another way of saying this is that it points in the direction that is perpendicular to not changing at all, since if it were to have some component in the direction of "not changing at all" we can subtract off the projection of the vector onto this direction to get a vector that points in a direction of greater increase/decrease. Why is this true? Let f(t) be a level surface of the function F that is parametrized by t. Since it's constant, dF/dt = 0 but by the chain rule dF/dt = grad F(x)*f'(t) = 0. Therefore, the gradient is orthogonal to the direction of the function that doesn't change. Computationally, this suggests that if we take steps in the direction of the gradient of a function we will either climb/go down it as steeply as possible.    Embed Quote
