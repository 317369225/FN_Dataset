★What are some fast gradient descent algorithms?Follow-up on: http://hunch.net/?p=119
The fastest gradient decent algorithm, trivially parallel, and with zero overhead, is 1+1 CMA-ES. A more elaborate description of CMA-ES can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES . Even though this wiki entry looks very mathematical, the algorithm is actually easy to implement. It can be used for any numerical optimization task, including finding the weights of a neural network. Here is a demonstration of 50,25 CMA-ES in action: In response to some comments: @ Number of evaluations per step In 1+1 CMA-ES you have 1 function evaluation per step. @ Performance in Practice There are several studies where CMA-ES comes  out on top. For example: http://web.mysites.ntu.edu.sg/ep... @ Algorithm X is better than CMA-ES Sure, some algorithms will outperform CMA-ES on a specific benchmark. After all, we have a no free lunch theorem in search and optimization.    Embed Quote
