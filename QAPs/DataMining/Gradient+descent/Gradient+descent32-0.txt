★How do I prove the validity of the gradient descent algorithm?
The proof of gradient descent lies in the definition of the maxima and minima points (or maximum/minimum in the case of concave/convex functions). What gradient descent does is that it finds the slope of the tangent at every point and iteratively changes the parameters of the minimizing function to reach the maxima/minima. If you meant to ask how do you prove that it has reached the global/local extremum, it is simply done by checking the derivative of the function at that point and checking whether it is zero, or close to zero meaning checking whether the function has converged.    Embed Quote
