★Is there any other predictive machine learning algorithm to enhance the quality of a prediction based on linear regression?
The question is a bit obscure, but I'd presume that you mean meta-algorithm like boosting/bagging. I haven't seen any in popular frameworks, but you can implement something similar: Take a random sample of data from training set. Train a linear regression and compute the metric on training set. Repeat 1 & 2 N times. Compute the final prediction as a weighted average of basic predictions. But I doubt that this method will boost your model significantly. It will be more effective to train something slightly more sophisticated and not highly computationally intensive, like 2-layers ANN or SVM with RBF kernel, which converges really fast.    Embed Quote
