★Is a variable significant in a linear regression model?I've got a linear regression model with the sample and variable observations and I want to know: Whether a specific variable is significant enough to remain included in the model. Whether another variable (with observations) ought to be included in the model.Which statistics can help me out? How can get them most efficiently?
Significance should not be the test of whether a variable is in a model. There is no one statistic that will allow you to build sane models; it requires judgment. If you must use an automated method, LASSO is perhaps best. But consider: A nonsignificant variable might nonetheless be important if the sample size is small. A significant variable might be unimportant if the sample size is large. A variable that has a small effect size might be interesting if theory suggests the effect size should be large Independent variables also act as covariates - that is, they may affect the parameters for other variables (at least, unless there is perfect balance) There could be interactions that are signficant and large with a main effect that is nonsignifcant and/or small In short, building a good model requires thought and substantive expertise. You  should also apply the MAGIC criteria (Abelson): Magnitude - how big is it? Articulation - how specific is it? Generalization - how widely does it apply? Interestingness - self explanatory Credible - the less credible the claim, the more evidence it needs.    Embed Quote
