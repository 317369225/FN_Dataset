★How do I review linear regression in two weeks?
One of the best ways of learning is doing. If you're a bit geeky and like working with computers, you can try interactively exploring statistics/linear regression on a website such as DataCamp or Khan academy. Since you have two weeks, and assuming you have at least SOME knowledge about statistics I would recommend the following: 1. Go to Data Analysis and Statistical Inference - DataCamp You only need lab 0 & 1 as preparation, then you can skip straight to 6 & 7 for linear regression. This should get you familiar with how linear regression works. 2. Study the material in your textbook, since your professor will assume you have used it as preparation and the material might be presented in a slightly different way from the website.    Embed Quote
