★What are the best practices for coding a categorical variable for a linear regression?Say for example you want to code for eye color among other variables such as height and weight to predict longevity? Would something like color frequency/wavelength work better than a randomly assigned code, e.g. green=1, blue=2, brown=3
A randomly assigned code should not be a number; if you code it as a number you might treat it as a number. Oops. First, you have to decide if you want to treat something like eye color as a continuous variable or a categorical one. This is not a statistical decision - it must be based on the theory you are trying to test. I am not sure why you would include eye color to predict longeivity but if your theory has to do with the "lightness" of the eye, you would treat it as continuous. If you think (for some reason) that one or several particular eye color(s) will lead to longer life, treat it as categorical If you treat it as categorical, I find the most intuitive method to be dummy coding, but there are others In dummy coding, with p colors, you create (or let the program create) p - 1 dummy variables and one reference color. Each color is then compared to that one. But there are other methods, perhaps the most common are Helmert coding (each level is compared to the mean of all subsequent levels) and deviation coding (each level is compared with the overall mean) and orthogonal polynomial coding.    Embed Quote
