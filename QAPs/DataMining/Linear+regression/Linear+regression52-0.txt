★Is correlation a good indicator for choosing parameters in a linear regression?
No.  This is known as bivariate screening.  It is a very common method, but it is demonstrably wrong for many reasons. E.g. 1) Just because a variable is highly correlated with the dependent variable does not mean it needs to be included. It might be highly colinear with another variable. 2) Just because a variable is nearly uncorrelated with the dependent variable does not mean it should be excluded. It might alter other coeffiicents. Or it might be important to show that the relationship is weak. 3) Doing bivariate screeening means all the output from the final regression is wrong: The p values are too low, the standard errors are too low, the F value is too high and the parameters are biased away from 0.  See Harrell Regression Modeling Strategies    Embed Quote
