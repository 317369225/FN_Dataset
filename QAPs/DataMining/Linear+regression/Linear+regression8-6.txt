★What are some justifications for removing an outlier from linear regression analysis?
A sufficiently extreme outlier is more likely to be a mistake than a genuine extreme result (how extreme will depend in the details - people often just pick a fairly arbitrary number of standard deviations, but you should take into account how likely errors are with your methodology). Including mistakes when performing the regression will result in an incorrect trend line, so they get left out. You need to keep in mind when using the trend line to make predictions that your prediction could end up being completely wrong if your new result is an error.    Embed Quote
