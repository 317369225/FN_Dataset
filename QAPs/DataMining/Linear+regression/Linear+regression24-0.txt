★What is the difference between a multiple linear regression and a multivariate regression?I've found ambiguity around the use of the phrase "multivariate regression". Is there a difference between a multiple linear regression and a multivariate regression? Wikipedia seems to suggest that there is, but it is not clear. This is a follow up question to: What is an intuitive explanation of a multivariate regression?
Properly speaking, multivariate regression deals with the case where there are more than one dependent variables while multiple regression deals with the case where there is one DV but more than one IV. However, many authors get use "multivariate" where they should use "multiple" (this is mostly authors in fields other that statistics)    Embed Quote
