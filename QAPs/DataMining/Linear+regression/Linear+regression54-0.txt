★What is a good method to run linear regression with the constraint that all coefficients are non-negative?That is, such that for all .  Also, how does the method change if we need to enforce ?
Both versions of the problem give you a convex quadratic program with linear equality constraints.  There are specialized solution methods that have been known since the 1950s (see The Optimization of Quadratic Functions Subject to Linear Constraints), but nowadays general purpose quadratic program solvers are good enough to handle problems like this without any trouble.    Embed Quote
