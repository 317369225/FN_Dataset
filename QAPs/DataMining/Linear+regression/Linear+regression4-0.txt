★How would linear regression be described and explained in layman's terms?
Given a bunch of points, find a line that "fits" them the best. For any line you try, each point has a distance to that line. This is known as your "error", since the further the point is from the line, the less-good your line is at fitting that point. If you add up those errors, you have the total error. You are trying to find the line that makes that error as small as possible. It turns out that if instead of adding up the errors, you add up the "squared errors", the math becomes really nice, and given any set of points you can just figure out what that line should be. This is best described in two dimensions, but it should be easy to then extend to n-dimensions.    Embed Quote
