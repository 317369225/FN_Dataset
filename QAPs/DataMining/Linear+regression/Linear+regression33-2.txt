★What is the formula for finding the coefficient in linear regression with four independent variables?
You can estimate them using the normal OLS equation -> where x = your data matrix including a column for the intercept. y = your dependent variable in vector form (just have it in a column). so you will need to use the =transpose() function to get the transpose of the x data matrix and the =mmult() function to multiply the matrices and vector. You will also need to use the =minverse() function to invert the (x'x) matrix. Once you get all those, multiply them together ala the above formula and you will get a vector of coefficients. note: when working with vectors and matrices in excel you have treat them as arrays. That means knowing what size your results are going to be in columns and rows, and hitting CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER when calculating. All in all, it's a tedious calculation in excel, but if you don't have access to the data analysis toolkit you can do what i suggested. have fun!    Embed Quote
