★What are some justifications for removing an outlier from linear regression analysis?
In some applications involving product pricing, I have seen automatic discarding of the top and bottom 25% observations where analysts prefer to work with a trimmed mean.  Certain products such as insurance automobile policies have complex parameters such as policy limits and deductibles and the data can be trimmed in very specialized ways to aid in pricing. In most cases there is certainly enough data to yield valid regressions. In these cases it can be viewed as desirable and not in terms of "giving up information" as we usually tend to view discarding of outliers    Embed Quote
