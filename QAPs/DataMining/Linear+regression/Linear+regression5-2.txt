★What should I choose: simple linear regression or multiple linear regression?I'm working on predicting an amount that variates over time. I can use simple linear regression over the values amount/time or I could use multiple linear regression over the values amount(tomorrow)/amount(today). Which should I use and why? With the first, I could predict the amount if someone gives me the time. With the second I could predict the tomorrow's amount if someone gives me the today's amount.
This is a common type question I think anyone building models approaches. I don't think I have ever entered a project knowing which model is going to best address the goal. I know general approaches I want to apply but until I validate the models I don't pick one over the other. It takes a little playing, analysis, setup, and validating. I'd start with your last two sentences in your question. One of those should be your desired result because each provides a different answer based on the confidence in the model. Basically... which one is a better fit for achieving the goal?    Embed Quote
