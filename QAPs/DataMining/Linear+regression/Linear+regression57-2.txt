★Is there any other predictive machine learning algorithm to enhance the quality of a prediction based on linear regression?
Try the kernel trick. Essentially I am suggesting you use kernel ridge regression. You could also setup a kernel regression problem with L1 penalty or get more adventurous and set it up with L1 and L2 penalty. I am assuming that you want to stay within the realm of regression techniques. You could use all of these results in a boosting algorithm and see how it works out. I am assuming that your reason to do only linear regression is because of data size. If that is true then ANN is also good as it works very well because you can use stochastic gradient decent for training. As I am unaware of the problem specifics I cannot suggest a topology but what I can say is that you should use rectified linear input as activation function since they work well for deep nets. Theano is a very good package if you want to use greedy layer wise training for your deep net.    Embed Quote
