★I am creating a multi-linear regression to forecast electricity consumption in a multi-tenanted office building. The best R2 value is 61% (aiming for 75%), hence am considering non-linear regression. Any advice on the form of non-linear regression to try?
I sympathize with your desire for a better model.  If you can only predict 60% of the variations in your electric bills, some of them may come as a nasty (expensive) surprise. The term that's most likely to have a nonlinear effect on heating and cooling costs is deltaT(t) = OutsideTemperature(t) - ThermostatTemperature That is, heating and cooling could increase non-linearly as the difference between outside and inside temperatures increases.  This might give an equation fragment like Cost(t) ~ s2*deltaT(t)*deltaT(t) Depending on the heating and cooling systems in your office building, the slope of the linear term s1 in the equation fragment Cost(t) ~ s1*deltaT(t) could be different for positive deltaT (cooling the building) than for negative deltaT (heating the building).  If you have an automatic thermostat, ThermostatTemperature could also be a function of time (different when the building is empty at night).  If all you have are monthly electric bills, you probably won't have enough data to fit so many terms.  You may need to record your electric meter reading every day to enable development of a better model.  And you may need to record at least two temperature readings per day. Good luck!    Embed Quote
