★Is there any other predictive machine learning algorithm to enhance the quality of a prediction based on linear regression?
A2A. Many of the Machine Learning algorithms address the problem of Classification, where the dependent variable is discrete(ex: Logistic regression, SVM,Neural Networks, Random Forests etc). They can not be used as a substitute for linear regression. But, there are other methods which are not typically called Machine Learning algorithms which can be used to "enhance" (if possible) the prediction based on linear regression. They are called Generalized Linear models. They are based on Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian methods.  Some of the models are Weighted Least Square, Polynomial regression, Ridge Regression, Poisson Regression, Exponential Regression etc. For more information: Generalized linear model    Embed Quote
