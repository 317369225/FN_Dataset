★What are the standard texts on linear regression?
I've picked up three texts on linear models over the course of my PhD studies: Seber & Lee.  This is a nice reasonably mathematical treatment of linear regression with a good chapter on regression diagnostics. Ravishanker & Dey.  This is an introductory text on the theory of linear models, which includes linear regression as a special case.  It would be a good reference if the index weren't so sparse, but it's not a bad place to start reading. McCulloch, Searle & Neuhaus. This goes into depth regarding random and fixed effects models, and is a good place to start reading about what's not in Ravishanker & Dey.Unfortunately linear model theory doesn't have a single standard textbook like Casella & Berger or Durrett.  Maybe someday....    Embed Quote
