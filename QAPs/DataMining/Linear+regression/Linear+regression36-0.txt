★When is it appropriate to condition on a binary variable in a linear regression vs. including it as a feature in the linear regression?The former would produce two separately trained regression models. The latter would produce one.
Conditioning implies the models have all interactions between the binary variable and other variables and well as different error variances. That's a pretty big difference compared to just a variable. Is that what you want?    Embed Quote
