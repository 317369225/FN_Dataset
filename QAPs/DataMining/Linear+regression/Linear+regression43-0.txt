★What's the intuition behind the derivation of linear regression formulas?Simple/Linear Regression tutorial, definition, example, formula The above link lists the steps. But what's the explanation for each step?
The objective of the standard OLS (ordinary least squares) regression is to fit a line to data so that the sum of squared residuals (y-axis distance from the data point to the regression line) is minimized. So we need to minimize this function... ...in respect to the parameters a and b. After that, it's a simple (if a little messy) calculus problem. (Take partial derivates d/da and d/db, set to zero and solve the resulting equation pair)    Embed Quote
