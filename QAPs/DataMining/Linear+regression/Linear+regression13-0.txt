★How is linear regression connected to Kalman filters?And particle filters as well
First, notice how both Kalman filters and linear regression assume that your model is linear-Gaussian. Now the connection between KF and LR is that you can set up a Kalman filter so that it produces estimates of the coefficients of a linear regression. Using the notation from Kalman filter for convenience, you would achieve that by setting: set to a positive real value. If you choose an initial covariance matrix of the form , you will be doing online a linear regression. Particle filters are useful when a model does not have analytic forms for the conditional densities of one hidden state given the previous or of the hidden state given the observation. In the linear-Gaussian case, which is the setting of linear regression and of Kalman filters, you have closed forms for both densities, therefore particle filters introduce an unnecessary source of error and extra computational cost for no reason. If, for example, you were to decide that you would like to use a Student-T conditional density for the observations given the state, you would need a particle filter as you would not have a closed form for the hidden state densities.    Embed Quote
