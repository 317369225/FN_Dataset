★Is a variable significant in a linear regression model?I've got a linear regression model with the sample and variable observations and I want to know: Whether a specific variable is significant enough to remain included in the model. Whether another variable (with observations) ought to be included in the model.Which statistics can help me out? How can get them most efficiently?
It depends on the type of problem you are building the model for. If it's an explanatory model, you could either use: The AIC criterion, and keep the variables that give you the best value Assuming you have some insignificant variables, you could perform a forward variable elimination or a backward variable elimination of insignificant variables one at a time while comparing the adjusted R-squared.However, your absolute R-squared value(the accuracy of the model) would suffer, the elimination is a trade off between excluding insignificant variables and increasing R-squared values, as usually the goal is to find out the variables that significantly affect the outcome. If you're building a predictive model, you need not care about the significance of the variables as the end objective is accurate predictions. With each variable one eliminates, the predictive power of the model goes down, ergo, variable elimination is generally not advisable while building a predictive linear regression model.    Embed Quote
