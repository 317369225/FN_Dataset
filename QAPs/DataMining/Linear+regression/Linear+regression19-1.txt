★I am creating a multi-linear regression to forecast electricity consumption in a multi-tenanted office building. The best R2 value is 61% (aiming for 75%), hence am considering non-linear regression. Any advice on the form of non-linear regression to try?
You get and you are not happy with it? I have a feeling that any more than 60%-70% is a result of an overfitting model. One cannot (should not be able to) explain more than 60%-70% of variation in a variable by a simple linear regression because there are usually several determining factors of a variable and we researchers cannot observe/control for each one of them. Before trying to increase your to 75%, I suggest you to do some out-of-sample forecasting. Divide your sample into two parts, call train and test sets. Do your estimation with one part (train set). Then by using the estimates from train set, predict the dependent variable in the test set. Because you know what the 'true values' for the dependent variable in the test set are, you can check the performance of the prediction (you can use statistics for the prediction as well). If your out-of-sample value is significantly lower then in-sample value, it means that your model is overfitting. If your model is not overfitting then you can try other methods (adding cross terms, more nonlinear terms etc) to increase your  .    Embed Quote
