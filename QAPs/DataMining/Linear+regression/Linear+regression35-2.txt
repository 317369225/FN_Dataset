★What's the relationship between linear and logistic regression?What are the similarities and differences?
I will talk about some of the differences. The dependent variable. In linear regression, the dependent variable is numeric; in logistic regression, it is categorical. Coefficient interpretation. In linear regression, the coefficient interpretation of independent variables are quite straight forward (i.e. holding all other variables constant, with an unit increase in this variable, the dependent variable is expected to increase/decrease by xxx). However in logistic regression, depends on the family (binomial, poisson, etc.) and link (log, logit, inverse-log, etc.) you use, the interpretation is different. Wikipedia has a quite detailed explanation on different families and links (Logistic regression).    Embed Quote
