★Why do we need the bias term in ML algorithms such as linear regression and neural networks?
In linear regression, without the bias term your solution has to go through the origin. That is, when all of your features are zero, your predicted value would also have to be zero. However, that may not be the answer the training data suggests. Adding a bias weight that does not depend on any of the features allows the hyperplane desbribed by your learned weights to more easily fit data that doesn't pass through the origin. I imagine there is a similar explanation for neural networks, but it is harder to visualize due to the non-linearity of the solution.    Embed Quote
