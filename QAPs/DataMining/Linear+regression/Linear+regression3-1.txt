★What are the standard texts on linear regression?
Two books that Stanford uses to teach linear modeling: Weisberg: Applied Linear Regression. (http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Li...)  People love and hate this book. It's terse, isn't always well motivated, and the author should really make use of  linear algebra to explain concepts rather than relying on elementary calculus that does more to confuse than enlighten.  But it has plenty of examples and an R package! Chatterjee & Hadi: Regression Analysis by Example. (http://www.amazon.com/Regression...) I'm starting to use this book myself. It skips most derivations and gets straight to the things to look out for in a linear regression. Good applied book.    Embed Quote
