★Why do we need the bias term in ML algorithms such as linear regression and neural networks?
Let's say you have one input feature : , and you want to learn so that you can predict . Typically, it is of the format . and you have to learn just one value. I give you 2 data instances: 1. 2. If your function is , can you tell me what should be? What if I allow you a bias? Instead of , I give you , and ask you what shooul be? Now you can answer with (2,1). Without the bias, the line must necessarily pass through origin, and can not represent the full information. Remember high-school days - Equation of line is and not just ?    Embed Quote
