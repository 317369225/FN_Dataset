★How do I combine time series analysis and linear regression?I want to predict the processing time of US visa application, and I have a number of samples with several categorical features so that I can build a linear regression model. Now I want to integrate the general trend of the waiting time into the linear regression model to account for effects such as policy change, or processing efficiency improvement. How do I do this?
Have a look at ARX-models and Vector Auto regression models. Both might ne suitable for your question as they model a dependency if your waiting time over lags and allow for external predictors as well. However, you might want to model your dependent variable as a Poisdon distribution as this is normally used for waiting times.    Embed Quote
