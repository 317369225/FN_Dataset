★How are linear regression and gradient descent related?My understanding is that gradient descent is an optimization function used for linear regression. 1/ Does that mean that gradient descent is a type of linear regression? 2/ Is gradient descent similar to ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized least squares(GLS)?
linear regression is a model when you assume that the phenomenon being studied can be explained as a sum of some other variables. gradient descent is an optimization method, which can be used for, among other things, minimizing the model error of a linear regression model.    Embed Quote
