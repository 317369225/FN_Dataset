★When is it appropriate to condition on a binary variable in a linear regression vs. including it as a feature in the linear regression?The former would produce two separately trained regression models. The latter would produce one.
You might condition on a binary variable if you have reason to believe that the model (in the case of regression, the coefficients for the other independent variables) should be different in the cases where your binary variable is 0 vs 1. You could think of that as a predetermined regression tree model with independent regression models at the leaves (a legit and well studied type of regression tree model). Of course, you could simply fit that type of regression tree model, perhaps with a preset high penalty for tree depth if you're not interested in a large tree, and see if there are any splits on your binary variable high in the tree. If you think it implausible that the model is different dependent on your binary variable, aside from a difference in mean response, then you should simply include it as a covariate in a single regression on all your observations. The decision here on what to do and what sorts of analyses to explore depends on your goals and constraints. This is where the art of applied statistics and data analysis comes in. Are you interested in insights on your independent variables, purely prediction, both? Is computational cost a major consideration? What sorts of prior knowledge is available? What goal(s) are you employing your analysis to pursue?    Embed Quote
