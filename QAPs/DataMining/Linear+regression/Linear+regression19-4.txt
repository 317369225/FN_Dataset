is a poor metric, and you need to look at . Moreover, the jump from linear to non-linear is not a trivial task. For example, transformations, higher order variables, etc, are all still examples of linear regression model only. For the use of nonlinear model, you would require a strong understanding of the variables and their mathematical interrelationships. Further, look at whether the overall model is significant and not merely the    Embed Quote
