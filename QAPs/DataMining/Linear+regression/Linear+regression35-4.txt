★What's the relationship between linear and logistic regression?What are the similarities and differences?
Linear regression is usually solved by minimizing the least squares error of the model to the data, therefore large errors are penalized quadratically. Logistic regression is just the opposite. Using the logistic loss function causes large errors to be penalized to an asymptotically constant. Linear regression has a continuous output, wheras logistic has a categorical output.
