★What is a linear model in data mining? Is it a different term than linear regression?
Linear model basically indicates that the output quantity that we are trying to predict is a linear function of explanatory variables. Linear regression is a special case where we are interesting in predicting a real valued quantity. Contrast this with the case where we are trying to predict binary class outcomes. In this case, we use a function of outcome variable as a predicted quantity (e.g. probability of belonging to a class). Now this is still a linear model (output as a linear function of explanatory variables) but not a linear regression model. I think a better terminology to differentiate between the two is linear regression model and generalized linear models.    Embed Quote
