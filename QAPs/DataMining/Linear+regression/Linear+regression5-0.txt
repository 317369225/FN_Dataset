★What should I choose: simple linear regression or multiple linear regression?I'm working on predicting an amount that variates over time. I can use simple linear regression over the values amount/time or I could use multiple linear regression over the values amount(tomorrow)/amount(today). Which should I use and why? With the first, I could predict the amount if someone gives me the time. With the second I could predict the tomorrow's amount if someone gives me the today's amount.
Neither. If you have a long time series (dozens or hundreds of days) then you should follow Justin's advice and look into ARIMA type models, or, more likely, hire someone. Such models are tricky. If you have fewer time points, you may want to look into multilevel models or generalized estimating equations. Regression (either simple or multiple) assumes the data are independent. Longitudinal data are not independent and regression methods will give wrong results.    Embed Quote
