★What are the best practices for coding a categorical variable for a linear regression?Say for example you want to code for eye color among other variables such as height and weight to predict longevity? Would something like color frequency/wavelength work better than a randomly assigned code, e.g. green=1, blue=2, brown=3
There is one hot encoding or dummy encoding method, that will help you to use categorical input variables for linear regression. Check the One hot encoding technique. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One... Scikit learn also has a package for you to use to implement One hot encoding technique. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/m... Dummy encoding: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mul... If python is your programming language of choice then I found this blog from data robot very useful too.
