★What are some justifications for removing an outlier from linear regression analysis?
I'm very conservative about removing outliers, but the times I've done it, it's been either: A suspicious measurement that I didn't think was real data.  For example, a value of "99" for the age of a high school student.  That's more likely to be a code used by the DB admin to indicate a null value than real data.  Or maybe the kid didn't want to answer the question, so they just put in an easy-to-type ridiculous number. A case where it's a very extreme outlier (as measured by Cook's distance or something similar) AND I can make a qualitative argument that it belongs in a different class than the other data points.  A made-up-example:  regression of sales price of some products against their characteristics, where all of them are manufactured goods sold in stores, except one is a unique object whose price is meant to be so outrageously high that it's really not for sale, but rather a publicity stunt.    Embed Quote
