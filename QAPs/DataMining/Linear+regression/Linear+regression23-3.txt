★What are the best practices for coding a categorical variable for a linear regression?Say for example you want to code for eye color among other variables such as height and weight to predict longevity? Would something like color frequency/wavelength work better than a randomly assigned code, e.g. green=1, blue=2, brown=3
Oh, the classic divide between theory and practice. I don't understand why anyone would want to use a categorical variable in linear regression. This is what this question sounds to me like: What is the best way to hold a wrench to hit a nail into wood? In practice, a hammer is the right tool. But you don't have a hammer or don't know where to find it. You only have a wrench. It doesn't matter - hold it anyway you want to. If you want to force it, I won't stop you, because it's not impossible, it just doesn't make any sense when you have a hammer. You are forcing linear regression on a problem while there is the perfect tool in your kit. Why would you use it to find a relationsihp between eye colour and longevity in the first place? Again, if you want to force it, I won't stop you - it doesn't make any sense. The codes you thought about will serve that purpose. I don't know how you will interpret your results, though. If it turns out that with this coding, there is a 0.99 R-square value, that will be a fluke, because you won't be able to explain why brown should have a higher value than blue, and why blue should have a higher value than green. What if you had assigned 3 to green, 2 to brown and 1 to blue instead? The simplest method is to find the average longevity and standard deviation of people with different eye colours. You can do that by filtering each eye colour, and running a descriptive statistics on your data. Based on what you find at the aggregate level, you can go deeper into controlling for other variables (height and weight in your case).    Embed Quote
