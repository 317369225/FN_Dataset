★What is the intuitive meaning of the solution to the problem of finding least-squares linear-regression coefficients?
I don't know if this is a helpful way to look at it for you, but it certainly is different. In Y ~= X * B, we think of B as the operator, sending X to Y. But you could think of X as a transformation too, transforming B into Y. Viewed that way, solving this is like figuring out the (closest) pre-image of Y in the space transformed by X -- what B gets sent most nearly to the answer Y? Viewed that way, we just want to solve B ~= Z * Y, where Z sends Y back into the original space. Z must be a (pseudo-)inverse of X. Indeed the expression inv(X' * X) * X' is just that. Applied to the left of X it removes it. Applied to the original equation it gets one of the form we need. So... I suppose you could view the expression in terms of the matrix X and its inverse, in terms of a transformation and its inverse.    Embed Quote
