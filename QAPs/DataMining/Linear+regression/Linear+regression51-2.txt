★What are the most important questions to ask when examining the residual outputs of a standard linear regression model?Lets split the question in two: out of sample residuals and in sample residuals.  What insights can we glean?  What pitfalls can we avoid?  What should we always check for?
The following are some insights that may help to ensure smooth operation : 1. Make sure that the cost function is decreasing with every iteration. 2. Make sure the algorithm used for minimizing the cost function does not get stuck in a local optima. There are various techniques to ensure this. One may also use the help of certain advanced optimization algorithms that promise a global solution. 3. If  using the normal equation method to compute the optimal values of the parameters, it is generally a good practice to use pseudo inverse or the generalized inverse of a matrix instead of the simple inverse. This prevents the algorithm from crashing if the matrix is non-invertible. 4. Feature scaling should be done to ensure the gradient descent method converges faster.    Embed Quote
