★What are the standard texts on linear regression?
As others have noted, there is no standard text. Which one you want will depend on your mathematical background and whether you want a formal treatment (theorems and proofs) or one that concentrates on practical aspects. Here are some in the latter category: Chatterjee and Hadi Regression Analysis by Example (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics): Samprit Chatterjee, Ali S. Hadi: 9780470905845: Amazon.com: Books A good introduction, especially if you like to learn by example. Draper and Smith Applied Regression Analysis (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics): Norman R. Draper, Harry Smith: 9780471170822: Amazon.com: Books Somewhat more technical but clear. Gelman and Hill Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models: Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill: 9780521686891: Amazon.com: Books Harrell Regression Modeling Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis (Springer Series in Statistics): Frank E.
