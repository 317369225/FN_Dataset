★When do you use two-stage linear regression?
You use 2SLS mainly when you face the issue of simultaneity bias (when you have endogenous variables in your system of equations). In such a case, the error terms are correlated with the independent variables. The method is called “two-stage” because it conducts estimation in two steps. In the first stage, the endogenous variables are replaced with the substitute variables in the first stage of the analysis. Each endogenous  covariate in the equation of interest is regressed on all of the exogenous variables in the model. In the second stage, the endogenous covariate is replaced with the predicted values from the first stage. And now we carry on the regression of the main equation of interest.    Embed Quote
