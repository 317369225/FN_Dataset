★What's the relationship between linear and logistic regression?What are the similarities and differences?
Linear regression is used when the desired output is required to take a continuous value based on whatever input/dataset is given to the algorithm. Suppose you want to make a program which would predict the average temperature of say tomorrow, based on certain features, like average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, etc. of past week. Since this problem needs output as a value of continuous nature, it is classified as a linear regression problem. Now suppose your problem was to not output the temperature, but the type of weather that tomorrow might have (eg., sunny, cloudy, stormy, rainy etc). This problem will give an output belonging to a certain set of values predefined, hence it is basically classifying your output into categories. Classifying problems can be either binary (yes/no, o/1) or multiclass (like the problem described above). Logistic regression is used in classifying problems of machine learning.    Embed Quote
