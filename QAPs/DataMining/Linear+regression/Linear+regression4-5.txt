★How would linear regression be described and explained in layman's terms?
Visually, linear regression is a process of finding a flat shape that best fits in the cloud of observed data. The shape could be a point on the axis, a line in two dimensions, a plane in three dimensions, or a hyperplane in higher dimensions. Using linear regression to calculate a single point on an axis that is a best fit is the same as calculating the average. A line is linear regression with an intercept and one explanatory variable. A plane will have two explanatory variables. And once you get to three or more explanatory variables, the situation is analogous, but extremely hard or impossible to think of visually. The fit is done by making sure that the sum of all the distances between the shape and the actual observations at each point is as small as possible. The fit of the shape is "best" in the sense that no other position would produce less error given the choice of shape. The shape position is also considered "unbiased" in the sense that you could not anticipate the perfect position for this shape being any different than the position estimated by linear regression (assuming errors in the relationship have a normal bell shape or any kind of a symmetric shape and a lot of data is involved). In my opinion, this description should provide the layman with intuition and understanding as close to someone who could derive linear regression mathematically from first principles. And it should allow a layman to have a reasonably intuitive understanding of the limitations of linear regression. On the other hand, it is just off the top of my head since I didn't find any good references online.    Embed Quote
