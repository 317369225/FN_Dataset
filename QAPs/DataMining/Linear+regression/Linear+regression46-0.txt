★What are the advantages of support vector machines (SVM) compared with linear regression or logistic regression?
Kernel methods are NOT unique to SVM. This is a popular misconception. If you look at the objective function for logistic regression you will see that it is just as easy to use the kernel trick. See below for a reference. Page on cmu.edu SVM is basically logistic regression with L2 regularization and a slightly different loss function (SVM uses hinge loss while logistic uses log loss). I treat these methods as essentially equivalent (one could easily get probabilities from SVM through Platt scaling). I find logistic regression slightly more appealing theoretically, given the maximum-likelihood formulation (i.e. assume response variables are Bernoulli(p) where logit(p) is linear in the explanatory variables). But in practice I've found that SVM gives slightly better performance (but very slight).    Embed Quote
