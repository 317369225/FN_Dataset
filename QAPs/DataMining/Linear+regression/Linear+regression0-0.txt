★What is linear regression?
It's really simple, unless I've missed the point due to not being a mathematician! If you have a bunch of points on a chart in 2D (for example), often you want to fit a straight line through those points. You can draw it by hand, and that would be a form of linear regression. But if you want to do it mathematically, with some replicable rationale for the line you've drawn, you need to figure out how. One very popular technique is to find the line that minimises the sum of the square of the distances from the line to the points. This happens to work particularly well when the errors (distances of the points from the line) follow a normal distribution, which they often do. This gives you the line that best predicts where future points would lie, if more were added.    Embed Quote
