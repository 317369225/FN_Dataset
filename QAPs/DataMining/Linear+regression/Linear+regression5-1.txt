★What should I choose: simple linear regression or multiple linear regression?I'm working on predicting an amount that variates over time. I can use simple linear regression over the values amount/time or I could use multiple linear regression over the values amount(tomorrow)/amount(today). Which should I use and why? With the first, I could predict the amount if someone gives me the time. With the second I could predict the tomorrow's amount if someone gives me the today's amount.
You should look into time series models like ARMA or EWMA.    Embed Quote
