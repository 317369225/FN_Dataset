★What are the advantages of logit and conditional logit regressions over linear regression models?Specifically with regards to financial modeling
Logit models impose the condition that predicted values must be on the unit interval, and produce consistent covariance matrix estimates assuming the distributional assumptions are correct. Linear regression models when the dependent variable is binary go by the name "linear probability models."  This approach is commonly used over logit or other nonlinear models in the academic literature.  They have the disadvantages that predicted values may by less than zero or greater than one, and that the OLS covariance matrix estimate is inconsistent.  However, the estimated coefficients are usually very similar to marginal effects from logit or other nonlinear models, the problems with the covariance matrix estimate can be easily corrected using a robust estimator, and the linear model avoids a number of problems which arise with nonlinear models:  recovering correct marginal effects on interaction terms in nonlinear models is difficult (see Ai and Norton, Economics Letters, 2003), including fixed effects in nonlinear models is problematic, and sometimes the scale of the problem makes linear models desirable for computational reasons.  There is also no need to calculate marginal effects off linear models, as the estimated coefficients are the marginal effects. If the goal of the exercise is to predict probabilities, it will usually be preferable to use a model such as logit which ensures your predicted values make sense as probabilities.  If the goal is to estimate the coefficients on the independent variables, linear models are preferable in any context in which the problems listed in the preceding paragraph are severe.    Embed Quote
