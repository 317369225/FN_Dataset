★What will be the next big thing in artificial intelligence in the next 10 to 20 years?
Embedded AI and AI materials Neural nets and their likes are usually touted as being more "brain-like" due to their parallellization and resilience to noise. In some "evolved" electronic circuits you'll also find redundancy and resilience not found in ordinary computers. However, these properties also make AI-algorithms ideal for implementation in parallell and error-prone computing platforms.   Today, we've got "smart" materials and nano-thingamabobs which tailor material properties. We've got sensors made out of carbon nanotubes embedded in concrete and materials that respond to changes in the environment. This is really rudimentary data transfer and logical operations, on the form IF A, THEN B.   Gradually, we'll see more complex logical operations and controllability by signalling to the material. Say, tires that alter their surface properties based on whether the road is dry or wet or adjusting the room temperature by controlling the heat transfer through the wall.   Eventually, "computation" and signalling is advanced enough to implement petri-nets, neural nets with backpropagation etc inside the material. This will be a new branch of computer science, taxed with both AI-like and traditional application features on the same platform and with hardware redundancy and code-reusability taken to a new level. Being very much exposed to the real world, this computing platform will have to adopt coding paradigms that's the very anti-thesis of object oriented programming. The latter have variables safely hidden within "objects" and coding is made easy by several layers of abstraction. This is a paradigm that depends on the sanitizied and closely guarded world of traditional CPUs. For "computing materials" however, something vastly different is needed and AIs are going to be part of the re-invention of computing on this platform.    Embed Quote
