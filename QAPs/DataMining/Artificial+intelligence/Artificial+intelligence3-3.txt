★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
It would do whatever we program it to do. I'm sure if any money or effort has gone into it at all, people will want to protect their investments, and avoiding self-destruction will undoubtedly be an important design constraint. So yes, it will avoid "death" out of a built in drive for self-preservation.    Embed Quote
