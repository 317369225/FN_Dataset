★How is artificial intelligence programmed?Generally / high level -- what concepts are important and how does the code to "learn" something actually work? Bonus points for code snippet examples...
This is kinda a loaded question as there is no single high level concept to encapsulate artificial intelligence. However you mentioned learning so I'm going to take the approach of AI through the eyes of a neural network or perceptron. Essentially what happens in these systems, a program learns by firing true and false values by adjusting weights based on past epxeriences and compared against a threshhold to give the best possible outcome. This is often how we assume the synapses in our brain chain together to influence our decision making. A very simple example would be given a problem f(x) to determine a positive or negative response the value x is multiplied by the trained weight 'w' to form a dot product. That do product is then added to an influence (sometimes referred to as bias or threshhold) 'i' and if the outcome is greater than zero then the synapse fires. f(x) = (w*x) > |b| ? true : false; In all honesty though, this is not intelligence by any means and there are millions of other machine learning topics / strategies out there. If I could make a book recommendation... "Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective" Just look at the table of contents. Each chapter is basically a separate concept or concept building off the previous one such as: Evolutionary Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Tree Learning, Ensemble Learning, and the good 'ole' Perceptron.    Embed Quote
