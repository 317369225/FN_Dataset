★What will be the next big thing in artificial intelligence in the next 10 to 20 years?
All of the topics you have mentioned are very detailed and when you check each field you will see that a lot of researching is being done in that field. I am no expert in any of these fields but being a student of Mechatronics engineering, I am currently studying about Robotics, Machine learning and Pattern recognition (though introduction about other fields is also given but the core subjects are based on these fields). Though I can find a number of interesting answers on this topic but as I am interested in this field also and I am student of Mechatronics therefore I would like to share my thoughts. In order to make a complete system or a machine which is capable of learning itself by observing the environment, application of all fields is required. On theory there might not be a limit to what a person can achieve from a machine but when it comes to practical life there are some limitations. One of the most interesting fields, in which there is requirement of a lot of research work, is Bio-mechatronics (I am not saying this merely because I am student of Mechatronics). This field is related to application of artificial intelligence and biology. This field is mostly related to humans. A simplest application of this field is that one can get damaged or no functioning body part or organ replaced by a mechanical device which does the same function.  The main obstacle in this field is embedding the mechanical device and its synchronization with human body. This field requires knowledge of several sub-divisions of artificial intelligence field. If you are interested then I would suggest that you should pursue your PhD in the field related to Bio-mechatronics. In the end it does not matter which field you choose for PhD as any independent field is not capable of producing a complete system and you would need knowledge and help of other aspects also.    Embed Quote
