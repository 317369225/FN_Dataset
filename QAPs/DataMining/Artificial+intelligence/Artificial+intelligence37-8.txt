Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
To start, I hope the society of tomorrow will provide for basic needs for everyone. With work being automated, and with lots of jobs disappearing (think self driven cars, but also online universities), I like to think that in a few decades people will not need to work as much, and this calls for some sort of uniform resource allocation. There's always a chance we will just keep doing what we're doing - we might go back to a society ruled by dogma, and controlled by a few very rich people (think the 1% class)... but It's Friday, just ebfore 5 pm so I'll say that this is not very likely... A world free of work will likely liberate us to pursue our passions - and free lots of time. Entertainers will be in high demand - whether as stand up comedians,  singers, actors or athletes. I also agree that most of tomorrow's jobs are not yet invented - time will tell what we will do.    Embed Quote
