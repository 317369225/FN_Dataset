Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
We created artificial limbs allowing us to do things as advanced as hunting or making a soil more fertile for culture or build new tools (sorry I meant limb). We created artificial fur allowing us to endure cold weather or the harshness of the sun. We created artificial caves that allowed to be secure as a community no matter where we were We created artificial muscles that allowed us to go beyond any alive specie (including us) in term of speed or ability to move/manipulate large things. Some of them are the size of buildings and allow to mass produce all of the above. We created artificial wings that allow hundred of us to travel around hearth faster than it can turn. Why artificial intelligence should be different ? Not that I believe that we are close to anything you assume nor that most of the research in AI is specifically targeted to create such an ideal artificial intelligence as you suggest. For the most part people work on bit and pieces of what make an intelligent behavior and the main purpose is either creating new tools for our comfort or deepening our understanding on how we work. Whoever speaks about a AI that rule them all us living in science fiction : no approach presenter seriously with result is close to this sentient being and this is not an issue as no researcher can present this as his purpose without having to laugh immediately after. So keep calm, breathe, try to look at what people were concerned about at each big revolution of humanity and see on which side of the fence you relate to. Hint more often than not both the people looking at the utopia or pandemonium were not making the good bet.    Embed Quote
