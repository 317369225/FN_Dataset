Why would you prefer artificial intelligence?
Intelligence implies weighing before deciding which implies fallibility. Wether this intelligence is biological or artificial, won't really make a difference. So in my mind, quality of decision making won't be a reason to prefer artificial intelligence. Unless we're talking about constrained/specialised intelligence. Expert systems, so to say. They will allow us to drive a car more safely, they already fly most of our airplanes, they help physicians in their diagnosis etc..    Embed Quote
