★Why is artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence?To me the words "artificial intelligence" would indicate it is real intelligence, but is artificial in nature. Real AI would be better described as "faux intelligence", no?
When I look at symbolic AI, it does seem like "faux intelligence" to me. That's not to insult it, because I think it offers a valuable way to look at symbolic computing that's better than the conventional means many developers use for solving computational problems. However, it seems to me that neural nets have more promise in replicating human intelligence. Doug Lenat's Cyc is the most ambitious symbolic AI project I know of. The thing is, he's been working on it for 30 years, and he's said recently that he's gotten it to the common sense of a 4-year-old human. Compared to biology, that's terribly inefficient. I think he may be showing that symbolic AI is more than just "faux intelligence," but I don't see promise in producing a usable artificial intelligence using this approach.    Embed Quote
