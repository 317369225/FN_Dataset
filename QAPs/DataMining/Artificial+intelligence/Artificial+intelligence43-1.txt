Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
Its definitely possible. Intelligence exists, so intelligence is possible, and if intelligence s possible we should be able to replicate it. How is a good question, and we have been trying to figure that out for decades. Its hard. Why is also a good question. One basic reason is for the pure knowledge of it. Furthering our understanding of computer, of ourselves, etc. If we make one, we can study how it works and its capabilities, and that will further our knowledge. The things we learn along the way are practical too- there are many computing applications rooted in AI research. If we succeed and make an AI, its  effect on the world could be earth shattering. How depends on many specifics that are not clear yet, like how intelligent they are, what are their personalities like, how reliable are they, what types of problems are they good at, how subservient are they, etc.    Embed Quote
