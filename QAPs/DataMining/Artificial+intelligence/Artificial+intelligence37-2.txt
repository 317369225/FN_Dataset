Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
All of them. The mastery of a certain skill, whatever skill, will be vastly more valuable if teached to an "AI". All the skill sets will be code powered, and the ability to critically think within our own skill set, precious. The world-best and always striving-for-perfection bolter, can teach to a robot the secrets of perfect bolting, can find ways to use the peculiarity of robots toghether with humans to bolt better and faster...etc... The mediocre physician is already outdated by Watson, and (if market economy works) will be jobless when Watson will be on cloud and openly available. More than specific skills, mediocrity will be outdated.    Embed Quote
