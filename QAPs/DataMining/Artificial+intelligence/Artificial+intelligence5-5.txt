How can you regulate AI?  Only commercial, public AI maybe, but there's no way to regulate military AI nor private AI. Passing laws forbidding creating Ultrons is like passing regulatory laws defining pi equal to 3. You know, if you are hellbent on protecting society from bad software/hardware, pass a law forbidding kids from using cellphones at the dinner table. And if you REALLY want to protect humanity, mandate that all politicians must have implanted neurochips that keep them from lying. You want a Golden Age?  It's yours.    Embed Quote
