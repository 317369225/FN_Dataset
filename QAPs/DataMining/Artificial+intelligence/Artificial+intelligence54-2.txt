Is designing an ideal artificial intelligence an NP-hard problem?
It is NP-hard by reduction to SAT, but it is also PSPACE-hard because so is the game of chess (on an arbitrarily sized board). The logic here is that by designing an ideal AI you can also solve hard problems, so this must be at least as hard as solving those problems in the first place. It seems that a lot of answers neglect the word "ideal" in the question, which I interpret as being able to (optimally/exactly) solve any instance of a given problem, such as SAT, which leads to worst-case complexity.    Embed Quote Updated 2 May, 2014. 427 views.
