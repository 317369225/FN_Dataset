How is artificial intelligence the biggest threat to humanity?
Artificial intelligence can alternatively defined as providing intelligence to a machine which is close to or equal to human intelligence. You can't programme each and everything into the machine. So what do you do is programme it such a way that it learn from the surrounding. Basically it learns from human beings. The machine will be like a child curious to know and learn everything. The problem is that it cannot judge between right and wrong properly. It may learn good as well as very bad things. It becomes more intelligent day by day and also comes to know that it is nothing but a slave. It might do things to free itself from slavery. And it might be harmful for human beings. It's OK till the machine is controllable but if it goes out of control then things will change. Because the machine will not have  any imperfections like humans do. It will be very hard to control.    Embed Quote
