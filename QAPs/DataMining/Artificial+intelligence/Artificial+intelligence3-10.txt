★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
No, because it is not alive. To fear something is to expect something to happen that you do not desire. In order to have desire, one must have a will that is internally regulated, which is another way of saying free. But anyone who has ever done any programming, whether in Basic or assembly or Java, knows quite well that at any given microsecond, the next step the computer system will take can be seen by simply looking at the execution list. Thus a program is exactly the opposite of a free will. Some try to get around this by suggesting that the software can be given the power to modify itself, but guess what - that "modification ability" is just more linear code, so it is also externally determined (in this case external refers to the human programmers). The only reason we fall into the trap of calling any of these systems intelligent is because they contain intelligence that has been put there by truly intelligent beings (us). Containing intelligence and being intelligent are two vastly different things.    Embed Quote
