Would artificial intelligence machines be interested in religion?
We all try to understand how we got here. Using the word "creator" implies a god which is not necessary to explain our existence. I believe we should start with evidence and see where that leads, rather than assume we have a creator and follow some translation of a translation of a translation of ancient words based on faith. In the future case of an artificially intelligent machine, I would assume they would also perceive the superiority of evidence over faith and not make the same mistake.    Embed Quote
