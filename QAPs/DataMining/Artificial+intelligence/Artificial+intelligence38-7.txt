How is artificial intelligence the biggest threat to humanity?
Short answer is goals and lack of morals/ethics. Take for example a super intelligent machine that's given the goal of producing a maximum amount of staples. It could go to the extreme of harvesting all matter on earth and then harvest matter from across the cosmos...all to produce staples.  Sounds ridiculous but it's highly plausible. I believe super intelligence will be created.  It seems that those developing AI are more interested in getting it working first, rather than ensuring it has the appropriate safety shutdowns and decisons guided by morals/ethics.    Embed Quote
