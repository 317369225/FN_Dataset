★Should artificial intelligence be regulated?Do you agree with Elon Musk that AI needs to be regulated to protect from "skynet" Elon Musk Compares Building Artificial Intelligence To “Summoning The Demon” | TechCrunch
Elon Musk is completely right on this. AI's certainly will *need* to be regulated. They will rapidly/monsterously outpace human development; without any cultural history of co-existance/empathy/co-operation. They will ultimately be connected to everything. OF COURSE that needs moderation (if you care about the human race). Whether AI's *can* be regulated is another question entirely. I doubt it personally. I really hope I'm wrong. We are at least decades away from AGI. It is not premature however to be considering methods of regulation - we should be doing it now.    Embed Quote
