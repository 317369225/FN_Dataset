★What will be the next big thing in artificial intelligence in the next 10 to 20 years?
I don't know much about Robotics or Nonlinear control, but I think a good cognitive science program would do you well. I don't think it's one of these fields that's going to go forward ahead of the others; I think the point of AI is that it needs aspects from all of these in order to advance closer to the regular old intelligence it's on the heels of.  In order to have an eye on AI in the end, choose a university in which the cognitive science program is situated institutionally (or maybe even physically) near to computer scientists and linguists and that's your best bet. In other words, choose a university that already recognises and leverages the similar threads between these six "separate" fields, and you should be able to do at least some of each - this will be an important factor so that you know exactly what to go forward with at the PhD level. I know the University of Edinburgh is good for this, then again, this is probably why you can just get a degree in AI from there. Though it's housed in Informatics, there are very close ties to Psychology and Linguistics, and it's a great interdisciplinary environment (I spent 5 years there, so I'm also biased).    Embed Quote
