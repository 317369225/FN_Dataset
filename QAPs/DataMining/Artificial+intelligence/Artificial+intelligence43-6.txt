Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
Depends on how you define artificial. Basically parenting is all about building a new intelligence. If this is not artificial enough, throw in genetic modification. If you talk about non-biological systems, sure just copy what works in biological systems. It is just a matter of time. We have proof of concept (humans). The rest is engineering.    Embed Quote
