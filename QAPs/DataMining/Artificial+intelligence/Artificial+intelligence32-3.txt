Could non-sentient artificial intelligence destroy mankind?
Thanks for A2A. Artificial Intelligence, is basically a software. Sophisticated and sometimes peculiar, but nonetheless. Like any software, it's tested very carefully before deploying it into production. They test it to ensure that it performs the task and does it reasonably. The sci-fi scenario where mad AI destroys the mankind is only a sci-fi scenario. Nobody will trust the machine learning algorithm to decide whether to launch nuclear missiles or not. And as far as even the most intelligent algorithm in the world has no own willpower (IBM Watson is smart, but it only serves it's purpose), we are perfectly safe, because AI isn't trusted to make big decisions due to statistical errors.    Embed Quote
