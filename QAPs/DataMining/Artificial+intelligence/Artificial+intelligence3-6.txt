★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
Does the term fear bring with it consciousness? If we are thinking about a consciousness emerging in a computer or artificial brain, configuration etc., the consciousness in humans "normally" have a "drive". Built by evolution and indoctrination, human mind consciously or subconsciously define and set goals all the time. To protect itself, to reproduce, to make his environment less dangerous.... Fear of death is a concentrated idea serving many goals. What a consciousness does when there is no goal? Does it get creative? Does it just stay as it is? Can we view such a consciousness as the enlightened state? What a consciousness driven by artificial instincts designed by us does? You get the equivalent of pleasure performing tasks, your greatest fear is not being in an optimum state for performing your duties, you "feel" guilty when you abuse the pleasure you get from self checks on your status. ?    Embed Quote
