Is artificial intelligence headed in the right direction?
We don't yet have a good definition for intelligence, the artificial variety is even less clearly defined as it encompasses many different techniques that seem to shape facets of what we understand humans can do with their thinking. The idea of whether this is ultimately the right direction is a value judgement that will need to apply not only to the techniques we invent but to how they shape our future. We may someday, not too far from now, understand how to generate synthetic minds but we need to be ready to handle the many issues that rise up with this in parallel. We need to make sure new intelligences are not at the expense of other biological intelligences such as our own or that of other animals. It would be the wrong direction if our engineered super intelligence required so much energy to power it that we might have sacrifice our planet.    Embed Quote
