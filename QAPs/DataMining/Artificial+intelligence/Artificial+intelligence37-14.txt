Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
Which human skills will be more valuable? In other words, what skills AI CAN'T DO WELL? I guess everything that based on NEW IDEAS will be a nightmare for AI. Why new ideas? I believe new ideas' existence based on NO RULE. Because new ideas don't need to folllow the rule. such as, If I want to draw a picture about an animal I create in my mind. I can pretty much draw everything I want. I can make this animal looks like gas in the air and eat sun light for food. But AI can't draw a picture like this. AI Has to follow the rules, because all the thinking, reactions, emotions are all data/rules in their database. AI can never jump out the rules and create new rules. So AI may search google, find every picture of animal parts and mix them together to create a "new" animal, but won't be something like "gas" that I created, because theses no such animals look like gas in the world.    Embed Quote
