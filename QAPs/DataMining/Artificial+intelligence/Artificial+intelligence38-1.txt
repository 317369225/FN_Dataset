How is artificial intelligence the biggest threat to humanity?
People are built for challenges, and for a lot of failure. If we didn't fail so much, then we wouldn't appreciate our successes. When Artificial Intelligence take up all of our challenges, and complete them faster, and better than any human, humanity's self esteem will drop dramatically. A.I.s will produce better novels, better art, better music,...etc. People will search for meaning for their existence, and find very little comfort. We will stop having kids, and the rate of suicides will soar.    Embed Quote
