Will artificial intelligence ever have an idea?
All useful novelty in the universe comes about through processes of Variation and Selection. This includes ideas in your brain. Google for "Neural Darwinism". Variation and selection are both easy to implement in computers using Model Free Methods. As a matter of fact, Evolution itself is a Model Free Method. So if we just work on the *right* kind of AI, on Intuition based "Understanding Machines" then we should fully expect them to have new and useful ideas. Learning itself is a creative act. You are invinting ways in which new ideas find their space in a mesh of existing ideas. A fully general learning machine is therefore also a creative machine.    Embed Quote
