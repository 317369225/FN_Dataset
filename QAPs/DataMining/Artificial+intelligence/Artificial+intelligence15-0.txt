Will artificial intelligence make traders redundant?
I am certain the job of a trader will involved more and more technological systems to check the financials behind decisions, to include experts analisys, to draw in from sentiment analysis in social media, to bring in neuroeconomic idiosyncrasies.. but ultimately there be a human supervising this process for still some time. The reason I believe this is that the ultimate potential gain you might make by occasionally discovering the right "system" that will lead to great margins that you cannot explain will be counteracted with huge potential losses and instability that come from the "system" acting in error, either because it is wrong or because others are now including information about this own system in their decisions. At least it is my hope organisations reason in this manner... While trading is not a zero sum game, and an indefinite amount of wealth can be generated in a future, on a short timescale there are factors that are zero sum game like. The total cash in the world is finite, the total amount of natural resource in the world at one time is finite etc.. Because of this the trouble with any AI will be that it will need to be contending with other AIs and left unsupervised could run into very bizarre outcomes. As a global population that rely on trading to optimise resource allocation we would not gain from the strange side effects that would emerge from fully automating the sector. And the imperfect, corruptible, approximate human approach to this allows and even encourages us to constantly revise and rationalise the value proposition that is motivating our investments. Maybe the thing that works best in finance is the fact that it is broken, and if we could just acknowledge that, and the fact that we are regularly dealing with outlier effects that crash the system we would actually reach a much more stable overall system.
