★The Technological Singularity: Will self-aware, intelligent, sentient artificial intelligence be sociopathic?
When you say "sociopathic" I think you mean without empathy or emotion. I question strongly whether human-level self-aware AI is even possible without emotions. In any event it's certainly not a foregone conclusion that such AI would not have emotions. Empathy is a bit more difficult, but not impossible to do. And it too may be required for self-awareness and social awareness, since this is based on the (neurologically based) ability for us to put ourselves in someone else's situation. So, short answer: no, I don't believe they'll be sociopathic, without emotion, or without empathy at all. Any created that way probably won't be usefully self-aware or able to interact socially with humans, and so would be deemed a failure (I know in my research I'd call that a failure).    Embed Quote
