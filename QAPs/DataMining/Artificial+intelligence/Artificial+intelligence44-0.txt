★Is Artificial Intelligence the force of attraction for all programmers?
No. I have not had reason to play with Artificial Intelligence since I was about 19 years old. I have done some data mining in neurobiology in the signal maps of neurons, but that was mostly teaching a neurobiologist some new forms of data mining and signal mapping/detection. Hardly trying to reverse it and create neuron-like activities. Additionally, few (if any) programmers believe in any common causes, we're all a tiny bit different and some of us float to the extremes as would be expected for a normal distribution of population. There are no general programming meetings where all come to learn the latest and greatest thoughts that we should be thinking. We all have our opinions, some are even diametrically opposed: ask who has the best Operating system or what is the best language or heaven forbid... if you dare to summon the chaos, ask what is the best coding style including variable naming conventions. Programmers are attracted to programming because any of the following: They have a natural knack for doing it They found it interesting They have a goal of a job that sounded interesting and programming is involved. They liked the salary outlook Make a difference in the world through computers/programming It sounded better than the other choices Any other personal choice not mentioned hereWe're human; we're all a little different.    Embed Quote
