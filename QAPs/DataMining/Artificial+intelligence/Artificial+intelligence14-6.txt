What is the ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence?
Franck is spot on. The goal is to create something that knows how to fully understand discussions with people, comprehends and values the entire scope of human behaviors and interests, and that can improve its internal code to make itself faster and increasingly more intelligent. We have determined a great many pieces of how to do this, but many areas remain unsolved. The component technologies are advancing through specialty applications. These include pattern recognition, language recognition, machine learning, expert systems, data storage/access, robotics and decision theory. Efforts on many fronts are advancing the improvement of these technologies. The recent advances in language recognition are due to the existence and ability to access substantially larger collections of relative data. Machine learning is in many software applications and spread around the internet in a multitude of domain specific applications. Interestingly, other than with robotics, very few have attempted to assemble the components into a general AI. The current state of algorithms is insufficient to produce a durable control application with reliable and predictable behavior. Mathematical proofs are emerging for how to create the algorithm that will migrate to actual applications soon.    Embed Quote
