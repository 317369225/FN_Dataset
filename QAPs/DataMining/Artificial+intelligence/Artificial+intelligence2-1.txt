★Why is artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence?To me the words "artificial intelligence" would indicate it is real intelligence, but is artificial in nature. Real AI would be better described as "faux intelligence", no?
This has always been a debate in the field and there are generally two sides. There are those that believe that AI will never be the same but can only approach the simulate it. These people would not mind using the faux intelligence label. There are those that believe real AI can only be called that if it is indistinguishable from real intelligence. So these guys won't stand for the faux label.    Embed Quote
