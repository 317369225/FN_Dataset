★How is artificial intelligence programmed?Generally / high level -- what concepts are important and how does the code to "learn" something actually work? Bonus points for code snippet examples...
Prolog is a logical programming language. You can check out some examples here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog A simple low level AI code. Axioms - mother_child(trude, sally).Rules - father_child(tom, sally).father_child(tom, erica).father_child(mike, tom). sibling(X, Y) :- parent_child(Z, X), parent_child(Z, Y). parent_child(X, Y) :- father_child(X, Y).parent_child(X, Y) :- mother_child(X, Y). Query -?- sibling(sally, erica).Answer -Yes This is mostly used in planning. For learning from examples, you can check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sta..., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clu... and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg... they are some basic learning algorithms. In robotics, these are used extensively. Planning, Learning.    Embed Quote
