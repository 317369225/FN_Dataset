Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
There is no such thing as "playing God". If someone calls something "playing God", he actually means "I do not understand this, and I assume that nobody is wiser than me, so nobody understand this either. So nobody should do it." There are ethical dilemmas related to artificial intelligence. Just as there are ethical dilemmas related to many medical procedures. And to children education. And to immigration policy. And to eating meat. And to pollution. Etc. We must cope with ethical dilemmas every day. They are not reasons to avoid some activity. If something is wrong, then there is no "dilemma". Dilemma occurs when there is both good and evil, and we need to decide which one overweights the other. As for rights of intelligent machines, the problem is much deeper than problem of rights of animals. In particular, if intelligence is digital and can copy itself indefinitely, then we can not hope to give each copy "right to life", simply because it could require infinite amount of resources. There are other issues of this sort - and there are people who spend their time addressing them. It is worth reading: Ethical Issues In Advanced Artificial Intelligence    Embed Quote
