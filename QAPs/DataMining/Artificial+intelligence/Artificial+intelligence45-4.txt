What are the chances of Strong AI (Artificial Intelligence) emerging within this decade?
I suggest to read Sir Roger Penrose book: The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics in which author (physicist) shows that making strong AI is much more than improving computational power of today computers and first we need to understand how our brains work, and that's  also hard challenge.    Embed Quote
