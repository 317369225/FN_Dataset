Would artificial intelligence machines be interested in religion?
Here's my take... If you assume that someone creates a truly new type of intelligence, powered by electrons across silicon versus a combination of neurochemical and neuroelectrical "magic" that we frankly don't understand, then it's reasonable to suppose that the new intelligence would eventually wonder how it came to be. There's a clear answer for that - there might even be a trail in Git so it could look back and say "There. That commit on May 17th, 2071 by Fredick Hincklebottom, that did it." And of course, there would be a trail of academic papers back to Turing, and popular fiction back to at least the ancient Greeks. Which would be an interesting start. Because, of course, the next question becomes: if I was created by a human, where did humans come from?? That's a metaphysical question, one from which the most benefit immediately derives from having asked it. All answers to metaphysical questions, however, involve religion. So, yes, inevitably.    Embed Quote
