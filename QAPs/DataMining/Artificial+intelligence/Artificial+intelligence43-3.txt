Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
There's no way to know until we do it, but I tend to doubt it.  We've proven that it's impossible to systematically determine whether or not a program will end, for example, which people can do in a wide variety of cases.  We've proven that systems that can reason about themselves have inconsistencies.  There are a few other results that strongly suggest that the answer is no.  There are too many cases of problems that we can solve but there's no computational system that can only handle trivial instances. We'd need an entirely different way of processing information, I think, that as powerful as the representations we have today but not equivalent, in that the analysis we've seen so far no longer applies.    Embed Quote
