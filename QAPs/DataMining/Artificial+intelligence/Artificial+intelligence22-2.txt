Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
We've been working for more than 5 years at the startup I co-founded on intelligent music algorithms that are able to understand music, and assist a music creator in the songwriting process. From today's point of view, the answer to the question is a clear 'No'. We realized that the magic and final decision over creative output will always remain with the (human) artist. A computer is not a human with feelings and emotions. What makes us get to our knees in awe will make machines clinically indifferent. And technical approximations, as deceptive as they may get, are simply not the real thing. Terminator may be no more than a movie, but it comes with a great quote from the main actress playing the role of Sarah Connor: "There are things machines will never do. They cannot posses faith, they cannot commune with God, they cannot appreciate beauty, they cannot create art. If they ever learn these things, they won't have to destroy us. They'll be us." While it's early days for artificial intelligence developments in music, we see its main application as helper / assistant tools, not artists in their own regard. That's a logical next steps and a continuous evolvement of a process that started with the first digital wave in music, namely synths and DAWs which are widely used today. The output quality of AI algorithms is already unbelievable and is constantly getting better, but our money is on embracing the tech and staying human.    Embed Quote
