Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
Critical thinking and interpersonal skills. The real problem with talking about artificial intelligence is that people tend to regard AI computers with a degree of awe, like they have superhuman or supernatural powers of thought. And considering we've been spoon-fed this sort of AI from our science fiction for a century, that's understandable. This form of AI is entirely theoretically possible, but given the direction of our technological growth it is reasonably distant. Outside science fiction, AI is more a mechanical problem solving aid than anything else. More to the point, the difference is a matter of kind, not degree. This is the distinction most science fiction authors refuse to acknowledge: powerful supercomputers already exceed the raw computational power of the human brain, but they are still fundamentally problem solving aids. Our technology is growing in the wrong direction entirely to make a science fiction AI like HAL 9000. An entire branch of consciousness-emulating computing does not exist, and barring a quantum leap in the technology, isn't even on the horizon. What you will see is autonomous problem solving for mundane or dangerous tasks. A mechanical problem solving aid can automatically repair your car, cook your food, drive you to work, and pay your recurring bills faster and more efficiently than a human, freeing you up to do other things with your time. Things which involve conceptualization or communication, which computers can assist with, but haven't thusfar shown an ability to replace entirely. Again, I'm not saying it's theoretically impossible for a computer to write a best selling novel or the like, but that by and large our technology is evolving in the wrong direction for that to happen.    Embed Quote
