Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
I don't think so. This question seems to carry a silent assumption that the use of music makers (human or otherwise) is to produce noises that people recognize and enjoy as music, and as long as such noises come about, it is irrelevant how they were produced. That doesn't make any sense to me, because the context of how a piece of music was made changes how I perceive it. If I were being blind-tested for human/machine differences, that would alter the experience as well. Musicians and composers live in a time and context that influence what they think about, listen to, and are inspired by, and what they produce is an expression of what they made out of the whole human condition. Part of understanding that expression is to make a guess at what they wanted to convey, and even if it isn't accurate, I find that part of the listening experience is to imagine (and participate in) what they may have felt when they wrote or played. I wouldn't object to music composed by an artificial intelligence, but my own intelligence doesn't work the same way, so I can't relate to what went on in an artificial intelligence that made it create the music I am hearing. That doesn't invalidate either approach, I'm open to listening to computed music as an interesting complement to all the other ways that music is made, but I don't see how human- and machine-composed noises can be considered so similar that one might as well replace the other. That is, unless we produce an artificial intelligence which is in every way indistinguishable from human intelligence, so that it begins to matter where it grew up, how it feels about justice, love, death or politics, or if it maybe just played a ditty to amuse itself. If we should ever reach that point, I think it will be more pertinent to ask whether it has become a human music maker than whether or not it can obsolete any.    Embed Quote
