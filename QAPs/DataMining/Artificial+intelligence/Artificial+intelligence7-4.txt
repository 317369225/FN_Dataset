★How is artificial intelligence programmed?Generally / high level -- what concepts are important and how does the code to "learn" something actually work? Bonus points for code snippet examples...
The simplest way to do AI (very rudimentary AI) in my mind would be to have a network of terms with strengths of association between pairs of terms.  The strength increases the more times a pair of the terms is encountered.  If it were a search engine the most associated term could be added to a query for a narrower search.    Embed Quote
