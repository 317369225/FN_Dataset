What are the chances of Strong AI (Artificial Intelligence) emerging within this decade?
There are "pregnancy" stage (creation per se) and then development stage. You can create AI system in 10 years. And then it will be "develops" more 20 years to show level of intelligence that will satisfy you. If there will be "uploading" of this AI-child-adolescend-adult several times during this 20 years will you consider this as "recreation" or simply "stages of development"? Thus this question should be reformulated to have a proper answer to it.    Embed Quote
