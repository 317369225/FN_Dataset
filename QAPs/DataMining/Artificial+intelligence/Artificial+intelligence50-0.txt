Could we say that Cortana is an artificial intelligence?
There is Artificial intelligence, and there is Artificial general intelligence (AGI). The latter is a branch of the former. Microsoft Cortana is definitely an AI application, like all Natural language processing applications, but it's not an AGI application, nor it aspires to be. Neither it employs the fancy hyped "deep learning", nor it has to (though there are some machine learning elements in play). Intelligent assistant applications are perfectly fine with Gofai, from there it's just a matter of fine engineering and polishing within the given budget. And you know what, the actual economically viable applications where AGI is actually a must are very, very few - let alone the immense complexity of building an AGI, which compares to a purpose-built AI software like the fictional USS Enterprise to today's spacecrafts. Today's reaction to the likes of Siri and Cortana makes as much sense as the fright of the viewers of L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat or Musicians Wage War Against Evil Robots. Siri, Cortana, Watson are the real AI applications that we'll be living with for a while (in fact, they are still in their infancy). They will not rebel nor gain consciousness because they have no tools for that. They are basically smarter search engines.    Embed Quote
