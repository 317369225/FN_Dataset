What are the chances of Strong AI (Artificial Intelligence) emerging within this decade?
10 day weather forecasts are highly inaccurate. I think a 10 year forecast for AI would also be inaccurate. I'd say in 3 years the chances are close to 0, and then 3 years from now we could make a prediction for the next 3 years and so on.  If you're building a giant bridge, it will often take a decade but it's not really a random process. You know what you have, what you plan on building, and how to build it.  Building AI is much more random. You don't really know what we want or how to get there yet. So in that regard to answer your question would be the equivalent of making a 10 day weather forecast.    Embed Quote
