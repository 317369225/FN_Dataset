★Why is artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence?To me the words "artificial intelligence" would indicate it is real intelligence, but is artificial in nature. Real AI would be better described as "faux intelligence", no?
Are we talking about what AI is right now, or what it aims to be in the future? For the former, "faux" is appropriate, but not for the latter. "Artificial" works in both cases.    Embed Quote
