★Why is artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence?To me the words "artificial intelligence" would indicate it is real intelligence, but is artificial in nature. Real AI would be better described as "faux intelligence", no?
It is called artificial because of the definition of this word: made or produced by human beings rather than occurring naturally. Artificial intelligence therefore indicate a form of intelligence made by humans. Faux intelligence on the other hand do not convey the notion of human and is also conveying negative meaning : if it is faux - meaning fake in French - then it is just not a real intelligence. But even without this negative meaning artificial is a better word as no artificial intelligence can occur naturally while a faux intelligence could.    Embed Quote
