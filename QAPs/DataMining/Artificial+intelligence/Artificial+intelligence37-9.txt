Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
Insight, acceptance, diplomacy, the ability to remain calm in the face of intense change. Some degree of 'psychic' ability.  The ability to bring out the basic essence across many fields and combine them for the development of inventions.  Religious and cultural syncretism which is sensitive and not necessarily purely ego driven.  Maturity.  An appreciation for robots.  Empathic analysis of nonhuman creatures. Transmuting functions into code.  Turning everything into programs.  Architecture, dance choreography, even scripts.  This means either understanding both coding and a variety of fields well at once, or very strong communication between tech-savvy folks and people from disparate fields.  Autodidactism.  The ability to say a lot in few words.  Humility.... the disintegration of snobbery for the sake of learning from every level of life possible. Utopian ideals.    Embed Quote
