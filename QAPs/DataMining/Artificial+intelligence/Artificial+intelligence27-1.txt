Would artificial intelligence machines be interested in religion?
By definition, an AI would be capable of changing its mind in any capacity, and of synthesizing data about its environment to find optimally efficient models for predicting said environment.  This is the essence of Bayesian networks, learning algorithms, etc. Because of the first capability, AI would not be capable of committing to any human religion, because all of them require adhering to this or that tenet regardless of future learnings.  Even Buddhism, which has its own prescriptions that are not subject to revision based on future learnings.  That's why it's an ism.  Because of the second capability, AI would learn about our religions and seek out efficient models to explain them and help it predict future human religious behavior and beliefs.  Beyond that much is anyone's guess.  But based on the definition of AI, we can know this much.    Embed Quote
