★The Technological Singularity: Will self-aware, intelligent, sentient artificial intelligence be sociopathic?
I question the assumptions the question is based upon.  Mind you that an AI is by Definition Intelligent, and that if Sentient it is by definition self-aware. But someone with Anti-social personality disorder feels emotion just fine, he or she simply does not recognize the rights or validity of others emotions.  Nor can he or she typically form emotional relationships. For an artificial intelligence to be sociopathic it would not only require self awareness but the capacity to feel (not simulate) emotional response, and then lack the ability to respond to the emotional state of others we term empathy. I don't see us developing self aware AI any time soon, I don't see us integrating the ability to feel genuine emotion, without finding a way to include empathy.  So I don't see us creating sociopathic AI's.    Embed Quote
