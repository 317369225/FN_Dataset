What software uses artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence can be and to an extent is used in a wide range of fields including education, medical diagnosis, robot control, computer games, law, scientific discovery, stock trading etc. It is difficult to give a solid definition of AI as it cannot be characterized in general that what kind of computational procedures can be called intelligent. Some may give chess game program as an example of AI while some may refer artificial intelligence to a computer having full human level intelligence as shown in the "Her" movie. Virtual personal assistant market is at a booming stage. Siri, Google Now, Cortana etc. do use AI to an extent. Some AI start-ups seem very promising. For example, Braina - Artificial Intelligence Software for Windows is a project to make computer understand, think and even learn from experience like a human brain. Software with human level intelligence is still a distant dream but its not too far either.    Embed Quote
