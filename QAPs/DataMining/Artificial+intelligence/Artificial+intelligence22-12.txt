Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
I have no music qualification or IT expertise, but for what it's worth....  If Artificial intelligence continues to increase in 'Intelligence' then (one day - maybe not in my lifetime) it will be able to create every thought process I could ever have, simulate accurately the phenomena of emotions and understand all of the underlying patterns within successful music.  Much sooner than that computers will be able to have 'pop music' hits. Such music already uses 'pitch corrected' (Urghhh) voices and digitised backing tracks along with a pathetic selection of chord progressions and tricks. For all I know Computer Disco could be here tomorrow and I'm not sure anybody would notice. The music that I love - Will any computer be able to recreate the originality of a live Fred Frith guitar solo ? Would such a computer decide by itself to explore the first 100,000 rhythm patterns and anticipate new uses for them or would it stick to the ones already used?  would it start creating microtonal music even if nobody liked it? Our fantasy future computer could do all this surely. Eventually would it not also be able to create a live hologram of anyone playing anything so that as an audience member you would be unable to tell it from real? In my view this renders the computer as useless rather than the human. I feel emotion rather than understand it's parameters. I am not attracted by techno tricks and I have failings. Of my own recordings the one I love the most was made after I had lost 18 months of work, and in anger and despair I created something I could not have made from my 'normal' working practice. It may be a while before a computer masters that trick.    Embed Quote
