Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
[Speculation / Stream of consciousness / No scientific basis] 'Inductive intelligence' in contrast to deductive intelligence.. Inductive intelligence defined here as being good at inferring general rules from examples/special cases. Deductive being the other way around and also defined here as being good at step-by-step procedures, taking in scientific facts from media (books,internet ..), formal languages and applying them to a problem (Not much inducing own rules req.). To study a complex system, the environment or politics/economy etc. A good good inductive thinker would immerse them self in the complex system (ex environment) taking in knowledge from all 'abstraction levels' - books, blogs, other media, own senses  to high level environmental science down   to lower level physics,chemistry,biology, politcs/economy, social science etc. A very complex model would be induced from all this touching upon all fields of science and own data collected from senses. Would probably be very ugly to state. Now very insightful decisions could be made with this model. Or one could make an insightful (funny/cynical) comment linking two seemingly disconnected topics. Anyway computers are catching up quickly with machine learning and AI but probably a good while till human level and they are catching up quicker on the 'deductive intelligence' side of things I think.    Embed Quote
