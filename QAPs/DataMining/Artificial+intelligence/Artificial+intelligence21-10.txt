★How do I get started in Artificial Intelligence?
Everything. Find a book with a lot of references but is a general overview. For example, a second hand or international version of a univerity textbook from http://abebooks.com (an Amazon subsidiary). Then find what interests you and either asks this question again being more specific ("Hey, tell me where I can learn about neural networks") or do you own research. This is a very broad field. Unless you can be more specific on what you want to be a professional in, it is hard to be more exact than to turn the quest back around to you.    Embed Quote
