Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
The answer depends on a variety of factors. Assuming that we advance significantly in AI over the next century, the answer might be none. Consider the Technological Singularity (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tec...), anything and everything that is considered 'creative' is a result of some kind of thought pattern. When AI is advanced enough that it can do this as good or better than we can, humans might not posses skills that would be considered 'valuable'. We'd still be able to create, invent and make stuff; but the AI might be more efficient at it. So in answer to your question, depending on the level of advancement in AI over the next century - it might be anything to nothing. But as we advance more and more, the answer gets closer and closer to nothing.    Embed Quote
