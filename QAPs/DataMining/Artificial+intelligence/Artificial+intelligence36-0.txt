What is a good sci-fi book on artificial intelligence?
Robert Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966) is not actually about artificial intelligence, per se, but it features a sentient computer named Mike who takes a central role in the plot. Mike befriends the first-person narrator of the novel, Manny. He's interested in jokes, both how to tell them and how to make them up. He's mischievous, a personality trait that is related to the catalyst of the story. If you're interested in stories that include AI characters, Mike is fascinating and engaging. Furthermore, the book is well worth reading as hard sci-fi; it was nominated for a Nebula award in 1966 and received the 1967 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel.    Embed Quote
