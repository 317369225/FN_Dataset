★Why is artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence?To me the words "artificial intelligence" would indicate it is real intelligence, but is artificial in nature. Real AI would be better described as "faux intelligence", no?
Because it is not natural intelligence.Man possesses natural intelligence.It is not right to think that Computerised robot has artificial intelligence.Even simple intelligence is not there. Intelligence is the by- product of consciousness and a conputer is unconscious.So there is no question of intelligence growing there.Man could grow intelligence because he was conscious,better to say self-conscious. Computer scientists could not find a better word than "artificial intelligence" to denote the phenomenon called memory. Scientists,also suffer from the notion that those who have memory are intelligent.It is not true.Memory is always unconscious whether it is computer or human.A memory with consciousness with it makes a man intelligent and computer remins an Idiot Box because it has no conscious.    Embed Quote
