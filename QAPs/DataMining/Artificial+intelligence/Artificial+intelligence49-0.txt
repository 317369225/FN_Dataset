What is the primary programming language used in artificial intelligence research?
As always, the answer depends on the research group and subfield. C++, Java, MATLAB, and Python are all used extensively. A large portion of machine learning and modeling seems to be done in Matlab (for research and proof of concept) and C++ (for speed, if the Matlab code ever works well enough), though plenty is done in Python and a few important libraries have been built in Java, e.g. code produced by the Stanford NLP group. Lisp and its variants were historically used in AI research, but it doesn't seem like anyone uses it anymore. Lisp is built for list processing, not statistical and linear algebraic computation. As the field shifted towards the latter, Lisp seems to have fallen out of style.    Embed Quote Updated 10 Apr, 2012. 8,010 views.
