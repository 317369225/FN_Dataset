★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
"Artificial intelligence is just intelligent programming!" [n.n.(?) 1985]. Given the sufficient incentives and resources, any specific human intellectual process or "feeling" can in principle be simulated to a "Turing Test level", by an intelligently programmed computer equipped with the relevant input (sensory) and output (motoric) systems. In the development of autonomous systems (robots, e.g. for exploring other planets), it is useful to implement various mechanisms for self-preservation. Situations identified as potentially harmful may trigger simple avoidance reactions and -learning, or, if really serious, initiate a high-level state of alarm, shutting down all unnescessary activities to protect the most "vital" systems from destruction and directing all resources to avoid the danger. For ease of communication, the programmer may choose to label this alarm-state "Fear of death". While there are good reasons to give robots such a "Fear of death", I see no reason to implement any of the human superstituos fears about what happens after death!    Embed Quote
