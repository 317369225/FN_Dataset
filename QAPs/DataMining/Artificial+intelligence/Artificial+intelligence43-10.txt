Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
It is possible. And I assume your question is "how" and not"why". Here's how it is possible. Let's take a simple example of crossing a road. You are standing at the intersection, now what's the decision making process? In other words the intelligence. Here are a set of questions your mind processes. Should I cross the road ? Is the signal correct? Did the signal change? Is any vehicle coming? Have I reached the end? Should I hurry up? You'll see that a combination of these questions is about all you ask yourself to cross a road. An intelligent task! And all these can be answered with a yes or no. The other significant part of AI is machine learning. It's again a simple concept. How did you learn not to touch a hot pan? You touched it the first time and you got burnt. Then you realized its not a good experience. The next time you touched it lightly n felt the heat. It didn't burn you or it felt hot. And you touched it or didn't accordingly. But how did you assess if its to be touched or not ? From past experience. You had data that suggested that the last time I touched it, it burnt me. If it burnt me I must be careful. If I am careful I should not touch it next time. The same concept applies to machine Learning. Now lets assume a robot hand doing the same thing. The task is to touch a pan. The response that it gets is rated from 1-10 and you say which side of the range is most favorable. Now you go ahead and as it to touch it 10000 times n then it has now a dataset of temperature vs feeling. You add correction values or tweak the dataset (the temperature of the pan when robot touched it) and rhe more varied the inputs are the better the robot or thw algorithm gets at understanding and telling you if its safe to touch rhw pan. Much like humans. Hope that helps.    Embed Quote
