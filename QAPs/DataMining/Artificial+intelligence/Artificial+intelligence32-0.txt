Could non-sentient artificial intelligence destroy mankind?
Thanks for A2A Artificial intelligence is created by human and humans are able to add any kind of behaviour. Let's assume the technology is created for millitary purposes, a drone for example, which works completely automated. It could be programmed to attack predefined targets. Let's go a bit further. There is a movie called "Eagle Eye", which is about a computer monitoring the whole US regarding possible terroristical actions and the possibility to act in some way. I hope the mankind is smart enough not to add such a feature, but let's assume such a monitoring computer would be able (and allowed) to controll a drone automatically. This computer could give the command to destroy any kind of danger for a country (this is science fiction currently, but also with the technologies today not impossible to create), then this drone could start attacking any target this computer tells it. I think every millitary expert is aware of the danger such a mechanism would have and that's why it will most likely not be implemented, but just from a theoretical point of view my answer is yes. We are able to create artificial intelligence attacking the mankind.    Embed Quote
