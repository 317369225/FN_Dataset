What are prerequisites for learning Artificial Intelligence?
A solid math background (high school math, basic statistics, discrete math, etc) will get you started and having some coding experience will help (languages like Python, Java, etc). Highly recommend Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. It covers everything from high level topics like history of the field and introduces various concepts, sub-fields, philosophies in the broad field of AI but also dives into specific algorithms and coding projects. Afterwards I would try to determine both what area in AI interests you (there's tons - computer vision, natural language processing, broad algorithms, applied combinatorics, computational neuroscience, machine learning, robotics (more ME / EE side), data mining / information retrieval, etc are all loosely part of AI.) and try to figure out your learning style. For me personally, I enjoyed learning through lots of small projects, with the guiding vision / end goal being a specific application of AI (I was interested in applying AI and less so in purely theoretical AI) and I covered most major areas in AI through small projects, specific books (google around for computer vision for python, natural lang processing with python, etc all kinda of good free books out there) over the last year or so.    Embed Quote
