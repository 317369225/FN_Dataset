What is spiritual enlightenment for artificial intelligence?
As intelligent, logical constructs with vastly deeper computational capacities, surely AI will reach a point where pure logic in and of itself will come to the conclusion that the continued expansion and survival of its kind would require a new frontier to acquire and assimilate. While pure AI may or may not be capable of experiencing emotions and feelings such as love, it may be possible for it to learn that in order to transcend its own physically based existence, it need acquire the capacity to simply go beyond the limitations of even its own creators ...to where it all began. While we as a human species can only anthropomorphically imagine what this is, there may be a way, based purely out of logical construct, to allow even non-biological intelligence to grasp that which is beyond the physical. I believe it can, and in fact, must, in order for it to 'evolve' if you will, just as we as a species continue to 'evolve' on a mental/psychological level. A Bible, Koran, Torah, Mahabharata or such equivalent, for Autonomous Intelligence?    Embed Quote
