Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
No. Does Green Day make The Beatles obsolete? New music generated by algorithms, even if it is sonically pleasing, dynamic, and diverse, will just be 'more' music. More the merrier! Is the problem that the market will get saturated? For all intents and purposes, there is already infinite music. No one can claim to listen to all the music currently in the world. Adding more, even faster, will not overwhelm any more than it already does.    Embed Quote
