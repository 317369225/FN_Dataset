★The Technological Singularity: Will self-aware, intelligent, sentient artificial intelligence be sociopathic?
If I may, I would like to change one of the terms in the question to better answer the core question. If you were to replace the term sociopathic to antisocial or anti human then the answer is no. The entirety of human society tends to work on concepts of reciprocal altruism. Not because it's the moral thing to do but because it's the rational thing to do. A society that uses reciprocal altruism in place of a truely individualistic competitive model is better of for both the society and the individual. That system of reciprocal altruism is "enforced" with evolved psychological mechanisms like empathy but empathy is not absolutely necessary to make altruistic choices. Of course there are anomalies in the system in terms of there being people that are sociopathic or antisocial. But they are just anomalies. Less then 10% of people are sociopathic. So, a truly intelligent, rational AI would find altruism a rational model of interaction. But any AI that is less then "truly intelligent" or "defective" may not.    Embed Quote
