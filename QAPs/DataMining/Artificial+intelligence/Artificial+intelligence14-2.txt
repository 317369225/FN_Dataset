What is the ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence?
I suppose you could say that it's to develop a computer that can pass the Turing Test. That is, a computer which you couldn't distinguish from a human being just by talking to it. There would be a lot more goals after that, but this would be a disruptive technology, one which so completely throws everything else into question that trying to predict what you'd do with it is impossible. It would be like looking at the first Internet router and predicting, say, Etsy. Or KHAAAAN. The Turing test goal still seems a long way off, so there are enormous numbers of intermediate goals, some of which themselves have unexpected and beneficial spinoffs.    Embed Quote
