Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
There is no real scientific or philosophical obstacle to the creation of artificial intelligence. The only one that can not be dismantled by a good argument is the precautionary principle: what will be the relationship of humanity with this kind of intelligence, and if they are likely to be catastrophic, do not we there give up? Technologically this creation is already theoretically possible. Of course it will not be anything resembling today's computers, or even a computer numerical skills multiplied a million times. A modern computer contains a lot of knowledge but no intelligence, just mimicry ways of thinking of its programmers (which also greatly influence your own thinking when you use it). Two things currently missing in the project IA: The first is a model of the human mind. Neuroscience officially has none. That does not mean it does not exist. Despite their capabilities, computers operate in a simplistic way in terms of self-organization. Barely they have a few routines to check their own results. Whatever the size of their memories and their computational speed, their work is done at a single organizational level. A "living" model of this kind would be an assembly of a large amount ... of elementary reflexes. The human mind is a self-organized pyramid. Each neural group is backward controlled by another. The successive stacking of these stages of organization explains that with approximately the same number of neurons as monkeys, we think much better ... and some humans think better than others. That's the theory developed in "Stratium," a book published shortly. The second thing missing is a model of the neuron itself. This basic unit is far from a simple transistor. This is a computational unit alone influenced by a multitude of electrochemical and hormonal signals. These two challenges encounter no theoretical obstacle, unlike for example the supra-luminary trip.    Embed Quote
