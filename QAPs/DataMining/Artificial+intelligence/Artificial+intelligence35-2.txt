Will artificial intelligence ever have an idea?
Google has an AI that can look at images and describe the scene in English A picture is worth a thousand (coherent) words: building a natural description of images It is made of two neural networks -- one reinterprets the image as objects, and stores it in vector form (which can be thought of as how the idea is stored), and sends it to the other neural network which figures out how to express this "idea" in English. I would say yes, this AI does have ideas in a similar way that our brains have ideas. It is bordering on conscious, or perhaps already is. After all, if you peer inside our brain, you will find nothing other than a bunch of connected neurons -- unconscious objects that dumbly respond to electrical signals that somehow create ideas in a mind when arranged in a particular way.    Embed Quote
