★What are the most interesting open-source projects in artificial intelligence and machine learning?What projects should people be paying attention to and studying?
Theano  (http://deeplearning.net/software...) is a CPU and GPU compiler  for mathematical expressions in Python. It combines the convenience of  NumPy with the speed of optimized native machine language. For  gradient-based machine learning algorithms (like training an MLP or  convolutional net), Theano is from 1.6x to 7.5x faster than competitive alternatives (including those in C/C++, NumPy, SciPy, and Matlab) when compiled for the CPU and between 6.5x and 44x faster  when compiled for the GPU. You can read more about it in this SciPy  2010 paper:  http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lis...    Embed Quote
