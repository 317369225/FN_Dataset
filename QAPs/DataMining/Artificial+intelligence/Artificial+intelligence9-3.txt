Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
Humans already started "playing God" when they invented agriculture, hunted all the large land mammals and Neanderthals to extinction, and learned how to start fires. Who gave us to right to grow our own food? Who gave us the right to claim the land? Who gave us the right to exterminate an entire species? To kill more animals than we could eat? To create an entire species of creatures bred for our needs (domesticated animals)? Who gave us the right to burn down an entire forest just to clear land for ourselves? Who gave men the right to rule over other men? That's when all our problems began.  Even before the birth of civilizations, we've been depleting entire ecosystems beyond the point of recovery, and creating systems of economic and political subjugation. It is likely that nuclear power, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, or even life extension could turn out to be the nail on the coffin of mankind. But as a species, we started digging our own grave long ago.    Embed Quote
