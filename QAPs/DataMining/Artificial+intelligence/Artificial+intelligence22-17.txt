Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
AI can make predictions based on past data. To compose music, an AI model would be assembling random combinations of notes, melodies, harmonies, and rhythms, and making a 'prediction' of whether human consumers will find the resulting composition aesthetically pleasing or palatable to the ear. An AI algorithm would not be "expressing" itself artistically, therefore probably wouldn't take any risks or produce any pioneering efforts.    Embed Quote
