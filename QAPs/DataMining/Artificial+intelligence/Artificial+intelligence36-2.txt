What is a good sci-fi book on artificial intelligence?
Iain Banks' series of Culture novels feature many sentient spaceships, robots and drones as central and peripheral characters. Highly recommended if you're even remotely interested in the idea of Singularity and extrapolating that idea within the framework of a pan-galactic post-scarcity society - not nearly as nerdy as it sounds and written with great wit and intelligence.    Embed Quote
