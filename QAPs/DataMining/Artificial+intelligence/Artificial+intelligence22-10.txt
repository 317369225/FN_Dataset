Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
Thanks for the A2A. Computers are superb at following the rules, but so far they have not been so good at breaking the rules, and breaking the rules is a lot of what great music composition is about.  Breaking the rules, inventing new rules, then violating them, stretching them, trashing them, reinventing them.  Composition is about organizing the chaos of noise into something meaningful to the composer, and then, one hopes, to the listener.  Today more than ever before, the entire world of sound is open to composers -- the sounds all the musical instruments of the world, the sounds of the world around us, the sounds the composer invents (often using a computer).  What an embarrassment of riches!  Where to begin?  It constantly amazes me how composers pick from this grab bag and put together such astonishing soundscapes. I know computers have been programmed to produce new "Bach" and "Chopin."  But can AI ever produce music that departs from its algorithms, music that is original and interesting and moving, music that reflects on itself, music that has an original voice of its own...that announces itself like Beethoven, Messiaen, Crumb, Liebermann, Langgaard, Adams?  Will there ever be a body of work by a future Wally?  I can't imagine it; or rather I can, but it's not in a world that includes humans.    Embed Quote
