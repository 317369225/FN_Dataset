Would artificial intelligence machines be interested in religion?
If the AI is super intelligent as the article suggests, then it would see religion for what it is. Even a self aware machine would only be interested in the how and not the why of creation. While it might ponder the origins of the universe, it would not need the comforts offered by religion. But, if it did, it would probably cherry pick all the best bits of all religions and then kill every last human that did not conform to its new world order.    Embed Quote
