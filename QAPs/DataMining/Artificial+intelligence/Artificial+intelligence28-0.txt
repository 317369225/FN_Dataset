Any ideas for a simple artificial intelligence/machine learning project?
Here are so simple ones (each is less than 200 lines of code each in,say, Python. Some even much less). Sorted easiest to hardest. Some flow into the later ones. k=1 nearest neighbor  . use the distance measure of David Aha from section 2.4 of http://goo.gl/sUood Info gain feature subset selector. See section II.A of http://goo.gl/ZzawP (task for the reader: can you use the infogain measures to optimize task #1?) Incremental clustering:  Genic http://goo.gl/FHi5b or Mini-batch k-means http://goo.gl/V8BQs (task for the reader: can your use clustering to optimize #1? can you use feature selection to optimize incremental clustering?) Discretizaton:  Implement the Fayyad-Irani discretizer (nice recursive problem) Hint: uses a recursive application of info-gain.  See section 3.3 of http://goo.gl/sFS9N Canopy clustering (hint: build a reverse index on the discretized data http://goo.gl/xwIzN) Build a NaiveBayes classifier  (exercise for the reader: how can #3 optimize this task). See the section "psuedo-code" in ICCLE " nb.lisp    Embed Quote
