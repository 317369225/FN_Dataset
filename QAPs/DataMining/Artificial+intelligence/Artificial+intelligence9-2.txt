Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
Not playing god, being god. AI is a further evolution from the human mind created by DNA.  Where did evolution come from? We play at being human, with all these ideas about free will, self determination, "John Doe", God in a bush, etc.    Embed Quote
