Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
No. The one thing that makes music interesting is the organic, human element of it. This is why a lot of people think techno/trance/house/edm is boring and stupid, including yours truly. It's too sterile, too computer-perfect, not human enough. You can create a piece of artificial intelligence that will sequence sounds in the most perfect way imaginable, perfect and correct beyond what humans can do, but it will never be as cool or real as this guy could do with only an old acoustic guitar on a hissy old mono-recording. Live music is cool because it's not perfect. Human beings are not perfect. I like seeing and hearing little mistakes or inconsistencies here and there. It makes it interesting. The organic process of band members reacting to one another, with their unique personalities and creativity, is something you simply can't replicate with computers, because we can't replicate human beings with computers. A computer can't have a bad night, a good night, or have one too many drinks or take drugs. Ever listen to Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Zeppelin or The Doors? Where do you think that kind of insane collective creativity came from? A computer is a soulless machine. Everything around us is computerized enough as it is, and it doesn't work with music. But hey, that's just me. Maybe I'm old school. Rock on.    Embed Quote
