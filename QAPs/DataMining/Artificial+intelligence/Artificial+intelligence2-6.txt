★Why is artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence?To me the words "artificial intelligence" would indicate it is real intelligence, but is artificial in nature. Real AI would be better described as "faux intelligence", no?
Because it isn't legitimate intelligence created by nature. It's a man made replication to the best of our abilities.    Embed Quote
