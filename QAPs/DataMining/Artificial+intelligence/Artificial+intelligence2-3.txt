★Why is artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence?To me the words "artificial intelligence" would indicate it is real intelligence, but is artificial in nature. Real AI would be better described as "faux intelligence", no?
Artificial diamonds are diamonds. Artificial Intelligence is Inteligence. We have to choose our definitions carefully but I believe there will be no way to tell Artificial from Natural Intelligence – no matter what definition we use – as long as it is applied equally and isn't blatantly carbocentric. Our software will look very different from the kind of software we use today but it will be able to implement "Intuitive Understanding" - the fast subconscious thinking that provides language understanding and production, vision, and situational understanding at speeds that "Logical Reasoning" could never provide. The greatest surprise to AI researchers is that they will have to write software that jumps to conclusions on scant evidence.    Embed Quote
