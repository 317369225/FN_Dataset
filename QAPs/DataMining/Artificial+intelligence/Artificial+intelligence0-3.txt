★What are the most interesting open-source projects in artificial intelligence and machine learning?What projects should people be paying attention to and studying?
For ML, you should start with Weka and R (which has many decent libraries for ML/stats to get started -- including RWeka).  Neither are perfect, nor very fast for huge data sets by default, but once you become a power users, you can extend them (and change the guts, using Java or C respectively) to work well on huge out of core data sets and parallel clusters even.  All other ML projects need to justify why they are better than these two -- and probably provide wrappers for people to try their new algos in both, as well.  One nice, but with more niche applications to text, is LingPipe.  There is also a lot of open source Matlab code from the academics, so having a good install of Gnu Octave (with a good ATLAS BLAS) is useful as well.    Embed Quote
