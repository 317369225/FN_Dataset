Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
We first need to understand that the current growth rate is exponential (taking into consideration past century) there was a significant development in the field of electronics, in the 20th Century. From just introduction of alternating current in late 1800s we went on to develop all the gadgets that we have today in the last 100 years. So, we shld expect similar growth in the coming years as well. We shld expect something similar to our fiction novels talking abt AI with thinking power. So, this would leave us with majorly the task of building relationships among organizations or people or countries. We would also require people with vision to take us further ahead in technology. Two skills which i believe will be most valuable skills for humans over the next century will be  - Interpersonal skills  - Innovative/Disruptive thinking    Embed Quote
