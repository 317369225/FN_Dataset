★What will be the next big thing in artificial intelligence in the next 10 to 20 years?
These are kind of overlapping fields i.e. you can use machine learning to do natural language processing. The next big problem to solve is "context" -- How the next popular social platform will evolve The best way to solve that problem is using machine learning and the latest in tech in machine learning is called Deep Learning. Incidentally the top researchers in Silicon Valley in machine learning have been hired one by one by Google in the last couple of years. Self-driving cars (and then all kinds of other machines) is an example AI product, Google Glass is the new user interface for AI systems. All that is going to happen. Much of that is going to get driven by understanding context by self learning systems which adapt to new situations. In layman's terms build a system such that you do not even tell it what problem it has to solve. It will on it's own identify problems and tell you the best solution for it too.    Embed Quote
