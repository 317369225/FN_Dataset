What are prerequisites for learning Artificial Intelligence?
Basic math and coding skills. But it really depends on what kind of algorithms you plan to work with. I would say first select the algorithms you're interested in, then explore the corresponding math background you feel you need to understand them. Discrete mathematics is the most widely used in computer science and artificial intelligence, but is probably too broad for your needs. If you're undecided on what branch of AI you want to study, the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach gives a very nice overview of AI and will help you spot the skills you need.    Embed Quote
