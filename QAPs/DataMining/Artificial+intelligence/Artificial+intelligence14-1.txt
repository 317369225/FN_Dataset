What is the ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence?
There isn't "an" ultimate goal for AI. There are just new goals for AI. Personally, I don't really care if we can create computers that are really good at pretending to be people. I care that computers become really good at solving harder and more significant problems that truly affect us. After all, IBM's Watson can beat the world's best Jeopardy contestant, and not just trivia questions but questions that require abstract human concepts. How far away are we from getting a Watson that could outperform the top doctors in the world? In a world where doctors are in such short supply, a scalable, automated, robo-doctor that could perform a significant component of that workload could result in huge improvements in world health and prosperity. The human-doctors would actually be freed up to be more involved in research, or in performing the types of medical work that can't yet be automated. What about AI that could beat the world's greatest driver? We could eliminate the laborious task of driving everywhere, we could drastically reduce injuries and fatalities from accidents, we could lower the delivery costs of goods, we could easily orchestrate massive carpooling efforts that could be decentralized, privatized, and more efficient than public transit.    Embed Quote Updated 13 Dec, 2012. 513 views.
