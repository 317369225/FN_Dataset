Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
So many thoughtful answers here...but I'm not sure anyone has yet directly touched on what I would personally consider the most basic reason that human music-making can never be rendered useless or obselete by a machine. Put simply, the utility of music-making to the musician himself means that obseletion of the human element in musicianship isn't even a remotely tenable concept. That is, if we think of a musical product as the starting point and then ask if a machine could make such a product, we can think about obseletion of the human musician. But the product in fact isn't the starting point. Musicians most fundamentally make music because they want to for completely intrinsic reasons. In that sense there is no product, only a byproduct. And while computers could profoundly affect the creative process -- they already do, of course -- they won't ever eliminate the human impulse to make music. In this respect, it is the computers which are useless, not the humans. The question to me seems quite similar to asking, "Since Mom can pick out clothes for me, what's the point in me doing it?" Maybe even more to the point, it's like asking why I would bother to continue as a pianist if I know I'll never be as good as Martha Argerich, or why I would try to compose anything if I'll never be the genius that Bach was. Even assuming that an AI could one day be just as strong a source of inspiration, there's absolutely no reason to believe it would lead to obseletion of human musicians. But if AI does advance to a point at which computers make music out of their own sense of creative impulse -- well, that would be awesome!    Embed Quote
