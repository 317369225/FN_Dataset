Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
Not for me. Even if a computer could write a soulful tune that gave me an emotional feeling what I really love is the live music experience. I am an multi-instrumentalist and seeing someone play an instrument and expertly or not, is always a fun experience for me. To me it is respect to see someone who has put the time into playing something so well, or simply expressing emotion through an instrument, or melding and blending with other musicians to create a greater whole. That understanding of the work they have put in, their ability to turn that into something unique them is what I find impressive and fun. If we could just had a style library where we could grab Bert Jansch, Ali Faraka, Roy Buchanan, Bruce Molsky, Mitsuko Uchida, download it into your brain, and play like them would it be impressive? I might enjoy the performance but the respect certainly would not be there.    Embed Quote
