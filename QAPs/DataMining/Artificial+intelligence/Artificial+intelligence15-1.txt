Will artificial intelligence make traders redundant?
In what time-frame? If we are talking about a thousand years from now, perhaps. Also, again, in what time scale? In smaller timescale, even rudimentary pseudo-intelligence is more efficient than most traders. However, a lot of computer scientists seem to be as disillusioned about how little was accomplished in even niche AI (like trading AI), let alone a general AI. Now there is a whole cottage-industry of computer science / ethicist commentary about scary dangers of AI. Consider how an entire field of bioethics was invented to give academics job security when even one tenth of the promise of synthetic biology has yet to materialize? There is a growing anxiety over how sluggish innovation has become, and it materializes itself in forms of commentary about dangers of the things we can't yet accomplish. Through regulation, science has become science fiction where college professors argue over potential harm. We're arguing over artificial wheat, when millions are starving. It's absurd, and now we have scaremongering about AIs. Think about AI in the terms I have described, and you will see how disappointing a prospect this really is. Oh, and yes, human traders get to keep their jobs after all. Thanks for reading.    Embed Quote
