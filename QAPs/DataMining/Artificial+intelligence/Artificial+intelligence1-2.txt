★What will be the next big thing in artificial intelligence in the next 10 to 20 years?
According to McKinsey (Page on Mckinsey) , the potential of economic impact of "automation of knowledge work" is $5.2trillion - $6.7trillion. In this sector, the area i am really hopeful for is the automation in diagnostics by machine learning techniques make a lot of (unavailable) technicians (maybe doctors as well) redundant. Another area where i see a lot of potential is automation of legal work helping the lawyers a lot. This is because there is a lot of legal work that doesn't require a huge amount of skill (or finding loopholes) but a lot of knowledge and can be automated.    Embed Quote
