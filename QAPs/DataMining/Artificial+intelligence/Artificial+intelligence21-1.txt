★How do I get started in Artificial Intelligence?
For the beginning I would recommend you the following: - Machine Learning course on Coursera (Coursera) - CS188.1x course (UC BerkeleyX: CS188.1x: Artificial Intelligence) - Get the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach) Solve exercises from the book and the courses and then try to find the challenges from the real world where you could apply the concepts from the courses. The courses listed above and the book are great to gain theoretical background and gaining experiences from applying it on real-life challenges, I believe you are on the good way. When solving real-life problems many times there are some obstales specific for the given problem. So at first, try to solve some simple toy problems and then use your imagination to gradually increase complexity.    Embed Quote
