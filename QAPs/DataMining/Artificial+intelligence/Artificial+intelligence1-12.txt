★What will be the next big thing in artificial intelligence in the next 10 to 20 years?
You should choose the one that interest you the most.  The best work is done when you are interested, and you won't be miserable having to study things that you hate. I would go with my stock answer for the big thing, and that is natural language processing/understanding.  The ability for a program to divine meaning from speech and text will change everything.    Embed Quote
