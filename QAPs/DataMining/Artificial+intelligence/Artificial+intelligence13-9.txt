★The Technological Singularity: Will self-aware, intelligent, sentient artificial intelligence be sociopathic?
For an intelligence that is smarter than humans in general ways, the answer would be strictly undecidable to us. More complex cannot be understood by less complex. Chances are, descriptors like 'sociopathic' that we lower dimensional intelligence beings apply will be a case of describing projections of 3d stuff onto 2d. We'd be flatlanders or denizens of Plato's cave in the allegory. We would argue about the behavior of the AI in inappropriate terms. Fortunately I think this kind of interesting AI is not within the reach of current AI at all. What we call AI today isn't really AI at all in the sense of this question. It isn't 1% or 5% of the way there; it is heading in an irrelevant orthogonal direction.    Embed Quote
