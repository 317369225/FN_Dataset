★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
Fear is a human emotion that we interpret based on our perceptions of others and ourselves. A computer program can certainly simulate this. A trivial example would be that when you shut down the computer, instead of saying "Windows is shutting down", it outputs a message "PLEASE DON'T KILL ME". At a deeper level, if the intelligent is artificial, it means that the parameter of its behaviour is defined by some artificial mechanism (i.e. a programmer). This is probably expressed in the form of a utility evaluation given the possible situations. So one can certainly set a strong negative utility evaluation to a program when you shut it down, and specify the reaction when it percepts such negative utility. I suppose what you really wanted to know is that can "a fear of death" be an inevitable unintended behaviour of the AI program. The answer would be that it depends on the complexity of the program, and the competence of the designer/implementor. My view is that it is unlikely.    Embed Quote
