Is designing an ideal artificial intelligence an NP-hard problem?
it's not necessarily NP-hard. [I disagree with those who say it is] Because your only real specification about the difficulty of the problem is that it capable of emulating human brain. The construction of human brain by itself is a result of a polynomial ( or even sub-polynomial), approximation algorithm (evolution). While this by itself does not guarantee that it is not NP-hard, because we may have simply gotten lucky with evolution, the limitations of human brain does. As humans, we can at best generate approximate solutions to difficult problems. There is no occasion where a human can solve NP-hard problems (beyond trivial instances) efficiently. That's basically one reason they are interesting. Hence by your definition, the ideal A.I. does not reduce to a NP-hard solving oracle as others suggest, which means it is not necessarily an NP-hard problem.    Embed Quote
