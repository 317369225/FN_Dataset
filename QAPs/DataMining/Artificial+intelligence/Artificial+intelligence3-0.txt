★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
We are trapped in a "white box" where we have to look at these qualia things happen like vision, fear and thoughts from inside the machine.  If we examine ourselves from a black box perspective, fear looks like an avoidance maneuver.  In terms of AI, fear might look like a weapon system defending itself.  Fear might look like a Google car avoiding obstacles.  Fear might look like the internet detecting a down link and rerouting traffic.  In all these cases the AI is avoiding death or damage.  Don't expect an AI to need human qualia, that's such an anthropomorphic mistake. When an Aegis missile cruiser identifies a bogey, does it feel fear?    Embed Quote
