Is designing an ideal artificial intelligence an NP-hard problem?
There's a distinction to be made. Designing an ideal artificial intelligence. Having that AI system solve NP-hard problems. You might be able to design an ideal AI system, but it would be no better than us at solving NP-hard problems. That doesn't mean it couldn't solve them.  It just would take a long time. Your question is not about point (2), but about point (1), and you're using the term "NP-hard problem" in a metaphorical way to ask: is it really hard to design an ideal AI? You can't interpret your question more precisely than metaphorically since the creation of an AI doesn't have a parameter n in it.  If you could describe what AI(n) is somehow, then you could ask if creating AI's is NP-hard. So, as to the metaphorical interpretation of your question, is it really hard to design an ideal AI?  Yes, however, it would sure be interesting if someone did.    Embed Quote
