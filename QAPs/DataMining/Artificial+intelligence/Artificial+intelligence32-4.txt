Could non-sentient artificial intelligence destroy mankind?
It can't destroy mankind if it is non-sentient. It could only fail to do its job and that would only create some casualties. If an AI was in charge of managing a nuclear power plant and it failed in its job then the plant would go off killing a number of people. This would be a very bad situation indeed but it wouldn't spell doom for mankind.    Embed Quote
