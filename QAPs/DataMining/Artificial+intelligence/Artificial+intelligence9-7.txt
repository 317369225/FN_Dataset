Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
I would posit that a machine intelligence has all the rights of a person, when it can also demonstrate that it can act as a responsible being and hold other sentient life with as much respect as its own existence (if not more). What do you call a human with no respect for life or feelings? A sociopath. Yet this is what we can expect a machine intelligence to be.  It will be logical,  not empathic.  And we will likely need to hard-code safeguards into it to keep it from pursuing logical yet socially destructive lines of reasoning.  I'm sure other people would balk at being saddled with "thought limiters"... but that's because they don't need them.    Embed Quote
