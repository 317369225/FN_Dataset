Could we say that Cortana is an artificial intelligence?
We have first to define a couple of things: We can refer to a weak artificial intelligence (AI) or to a strong artificial intelligence (AGI, as Vadim Berman said before). The difference is that a strong artificial intelligence is supposed to be capable of understanding: not only knowing what to do but being able to recognise abstract patterns and meanings. This sound like sci-fi (in fact, it is nowadays), but what you can see in many places are weak AIs. They are not supposed to "think", they are just capable of recognise certain patterns, to be able to do what they have been made to: they are "intelligent" but only in a certain field. Referring to weak AIs, yes, Cortana is considered one, as all personal assistants like Siri, Google Now... However, you said "Or just an algorithm [...]?" and all AIs are just incredibly complex algorithms, even your train of thought reading this answer was an algorithm. We only have to decipher what was it about.    Embed Quote
