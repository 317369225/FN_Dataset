★What is artificial intelligence?
What is an apple? "Apple" is a collection of symbols, a pattern, and a code. It is an interface to the concept that evokes everything an apple is to you and your computational system. It is that thing we can pick from trees and eat, but that is only one encoding of the concept which we have happened to directly associate to a physical entity our system can distinguish from other entities. And when we identify one, the internal code is triggered and associated with the physical object automatically and immediately. What is artificial intelligence? AI is as the apple, an expression that provides an interface to all things the phrase evokes in our minds. Some are intentional, some are unintentional. And what is evoked differs based on the decoder of the message. What we do with the message is another issue, and how we express or articulate our response, is again another. The above is just a small sample of what we know regarding how intelligence works. What we know is not enough. But once we have the science down, then we can begin the engineering, and the application of the science. This application is the technology, and the technology is what will help us make artificial intelligence a physical reality. That machine is to artificial intelligence, as that apple in your fruit bowl is to apple. We don't have it yet, but we will get there.    Embed Quote
