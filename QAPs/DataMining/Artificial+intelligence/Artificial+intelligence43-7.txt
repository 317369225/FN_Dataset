Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
Yes, it is. It is very limited by modern technology, but in the future it is a very real possibility.  The human brain is very complex, and not too well understood yet, but could likely be well simulated by a computer.  Imagine a computer that simulates a human brain except that as a computer it has perfect recall.  It can also perform mental feats in seconds that few humans could hope to do in a lifetime.  It could interface with the Internet, acquiring knowledge at a rate no human could even imagine.  But there are ethical questions and possible dangers involved. I won't go into them here though, as they go outside the scope of your question.    Embed Quote
