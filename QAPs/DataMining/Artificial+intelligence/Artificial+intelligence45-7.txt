What are the chances of Strong AI (Artificial Intelligence) emerging within this decade?
Strong AI is an old promise with new forms. I saw this documentary episode when I was college in the early 1990s.  Provides some insight on the views of AI.  Old promise, new technology.  We're still wrestling with problems in the field today that were promising smart computers within 5-10 years by its pioneers in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.    Embed Quote
