Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
I think that AI may make for a very interesting new genre of music. But I don't think that AI will replace all musicians. Computers are great at many things, but humans are still the source of creativity and there will always be something new that people imagine and create. I am reminded of a quote by John Lasseter of Pixar, "The art challenges technology. Technology inspires the art."  I think that AI will lead to more inspiration in other parts of music and art and will allow for humans to create other things. I also believe that part of the power of music is the ability for a person to connect with another person and internalize and understand what the performer or author is expressing. I'm not convinced that a computer will have the same affect; a computer is an inanimate object and that form of connection is not really possible.    Embed Quote
