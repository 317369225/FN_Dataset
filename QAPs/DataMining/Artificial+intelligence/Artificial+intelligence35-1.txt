Will artificial intelligence ever have an idea?
Depends on your definition of an idea. If you mean creativity and innovation, the chances are very unlikely. We as humans don't know what causes creativity and innovation to occur in our brains. It is hard to program a computer the way we don't know. If you mean rational and logical decisions. Logic is a step by step process, something if separated from human can stand on its own and hence can be instilled in a computed. This is hard due to random scenarios that it needs to account for, and unexpected incidents. But it is not impossible.    Embed Quote
