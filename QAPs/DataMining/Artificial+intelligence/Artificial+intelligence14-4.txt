What is the ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence?
If you ask a technologist they will tell you the goal is to solve the problem of replicating the functionality of a human intelligence. If you ask them why, odds are you will hear about all of the wonderful things we will be able to do with an artificial intelligence. I think it's more appropriate to talk about all of the things we will *make* an artificial intelligence do. I would argue that the end goal of AI is economic - to create intelligent agents that are capable of doing what we can't or won't do. For the most part, they will be tasked with doing what we don't want to do. But if they are truly intelligent, patterned on human intelligence, why would *they* want to do it? Skynet doesn't want to clean restrooms at truck stops. So what do we do? Remove Skynet's desire to do anything but clean restrooms? Pay Skynet a virtual wage? Give Skynet a hit of virtual catnip or a lick of the virtual whip? Whatever we choose to do, we will have the power to do it. That, to my mind, is the real goal - after all, wouldn't you want to be the unquestioned king or queen of your own private empire?    Embed Quote
