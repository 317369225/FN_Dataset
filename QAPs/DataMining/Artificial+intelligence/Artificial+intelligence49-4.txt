What is the primary programming language used in artificial intelligence research?
Yes, all those answers are right, alas... Alas, because all those languages are legacy languages and do not allow reflection (except for Lisp, but quite poorly) so there is no way a program could improve itself. Every single line of code comes out of the programmer's mind at great cost, this isn't bootstrapping...    Embed Quote
