How is artificial intelligence the biggest threat to humanity?
AI will either be the biggest threat, or the biggest benefit to humanity. Just imagine, if you are a millenial, everything you get from your iPhone is now automatic and enhanced.. You want to talk to a friend, just mention their name. You want to travel somewhere, just think of the location. You are looking for some information, think about it, and it will be there. You want to learn how to cook a new dish? Just think about the style of cooking and you will have it. You want to know if a company is a good bet, just wonder about the last 10 years of performance. You want to know if that electrical switch is bad? Think about it, and you have the answer. Sure AI could be intrusive, but I'm betting that you will be able to control the security of what is provided, and how, just like you can now with a browser or Google. Just think how life has changed for people with hearing loss, vision loss, or even limb loss. Their lives are now much richer for existing in this time. Why not intellectual achievements? /edit I would like to add here a comment I made on another answer.. Issac Asimov was way ahead of it.. Read the "4 Laws of Robotics." 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. He later introduced a fourth or zeroth law that outranked the others: 0. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm. edit/    Embed Quote Updated 7 Dec. 93 views.
