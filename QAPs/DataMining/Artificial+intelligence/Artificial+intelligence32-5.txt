Could non-sentient artificial intelligence destroy mankind?
At this point, the AI that has been developed has fallen far short of the expectations for it.  AI that could destroy the human race would most likely NOT be developed by the human race.  And at the pace that we have made with current AI, I doubt the AI we would develop would be smart enough to develop another AI that would be destructive. The other problem we have is that at this time we do not have the computing power or the languages that could make this "deadly" AI.  We are very very very very far off in computer development and language development to even equal the intelligence of the average 3 year old child, or your 8 old chimp.  The machines that could end mankind are already developed, mostly in the form of weapons. It would be their UNINTELLIGENT use that would end it for us.    Embed Quote
