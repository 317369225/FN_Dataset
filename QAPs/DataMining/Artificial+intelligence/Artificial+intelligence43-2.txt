Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
I think It is not possible to create artificial intelligence. Because, if you go deep inside intelligence, you will see that intelligence is something that is naturally born. In animals and humans, it is present from childhood. Actually, intelligence is nothing but some set of decisions and logic and learning capacity. Computer can take decisions and do logical works. But, can't learn new things unless it get programmed. So,  you can fool a person by showing a intelligent program. But that is not a whole system. That's just a program. Not enough to be considered as intelligence    Embed Quote Updated 28 Jul, 2014. 116 views.
