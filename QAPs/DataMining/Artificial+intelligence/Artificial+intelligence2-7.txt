★Why is artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence?To me the words "artificial intelligence" would indicate it is real intelligence, but is artificial in nature. Real AI would be better described as "faux intelligence", no?
AI is called "artificial" because it has not yet reached the stage of development, where it can be indistinguishable from the awakening intelligence of the universe itself. That awakening is produced in a slow-motion dance of human and machine intelligences. For quickening, watch out for singularity.    Embed Quote
