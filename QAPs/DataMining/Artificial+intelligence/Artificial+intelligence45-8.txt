What are the chances of Strong AI (Artificial Intelligence) emerging within this decade?
As things stand machines are not intelligent.   They simply respond by dint of clever programming.   Intelligence implies all sorts of things beyond being able to follow instructions written by programmers. I don't know what the breakthrough will be or when it will happen (who knows, it might have happened already) but machines that play chess and Jeopardy are not intelligent.   They are dumb machines programmed by intelligent people.    Embed Quote
