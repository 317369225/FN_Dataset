★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
If it were programmed to. I suppose it could learn to as well. Fear of death is rational. If we wanted the AI to preserve itself, fear of death would be a good way to do it. Fear increases vigilance at the cost of energy and attention (to things other than the current threat). If this state is achieved, you could call this fear, although whether or not the AI "feels" the emotion is up for debate (or is an implementation detail).  You could say "feeling" fear is simply awareness of being in a state of fear. If this awareness is useful for the AI, we'll probably include it as well -- "awareness" meaning having access to some information (in this case, the AI's emotional state) when making decisions or storing memories. Or you could argue that "feeling" necessarily includes many bodily sensations that are unique to animals (incl. humans), in which case an AI probably would not have that experience, although to define "feeling" this way may be more restrictive than is useful. Regarding the two possibilities in the question details, why only those two? Each of those behaviors would require specific programming to achieve, and there is everything in between that is also possible. Those behaviors evolved in humans presumably because they are useful, but computers have not evolved those same behaviors.    Embed Quote
