Why would you prefer artificial intelligence?
It will be a very long time before AI systems will be making people unemployed , there will have to be an enormous industry building AI machines in the fist place thus increasing employment. I think about 100 or more years is a reasonable time period before we have the simplest of AI systems actually working. Don't forget that we know virtually nothing about how the HI ( human intelligence ) works , not much of a basis for building an artificial version.    Embed Quote
