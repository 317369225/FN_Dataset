Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
Those are interesting questions, but there's no reason to feel any pressure about answering them. We're a very long way from being able to build a computer that is actually intelligent and self-aware in the same sense that humans (and even some animals?) are. 40+ years ago it was thought that it would be done in 10 years or so. Now we're not really much closer than we were then. Mostly we've learned how little we actually know about how minds work. Without the benefit of such naive optimism, I'd say we're many many decades away.    Embed Quote
