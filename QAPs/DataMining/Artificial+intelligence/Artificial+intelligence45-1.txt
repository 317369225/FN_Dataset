What are the chances of Strong AI (Artificial Intelligence) emerging within this decade?
I think this distinction makes more sense on a task-by-task basis.  There are plenty of tasks for which computers have been better than humans for decades (e.g., arithmetic).  As the years go by, the range of tasks for which computers are more effective will continue to grow.  I'm not sure it makes sense to ask whether a machine exceeds human intelligence in some absolute sense; machines will be better than humans at some things and will not be as good as humans at others.    Embed Quote
