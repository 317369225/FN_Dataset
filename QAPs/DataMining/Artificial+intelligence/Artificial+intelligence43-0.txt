Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
We don't know yet.  After over 50 years of research in artificial intelligence, no artificial intelligence has been created yet, so it's definitely a hard thing to accomplish. Various philosophers have said it can't be done. You'll have to evaluate their arguments to decide whether they're valid.  My personal opinion on the ones I've read is that they're enjoyable to think about, but they aren't convincing.    Embed Quote
