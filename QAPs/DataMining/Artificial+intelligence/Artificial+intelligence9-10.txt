Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
Yes, an ethical dilemma is present. However, I can't define 'playing God', so I'll assume you imply the action of creating something self-aware, something 'living', but with the negative nuance of said action being immature/irresponsible. The one thing that should be pointed out is that science doesn't have morals- the Third Reich's V2's aided the eventual flights around Earth and to the Moon. Because, imagine if every scientific breakthrough had to be judged morally-which, mind you, is a subjective institution that does not have defined rules whatsoever- you'd end up with a human race many centuries behind(in everything). That being said, humanity thinks of everything inorganic it creates as 'its own', i.e. just because a robot can think, the metalhead did not come to think on its own; the materials and thought/scientific methods poured into its existence were a human achievement. Therefore(at least at first) thinking(self-aware, capable of creating new content) machines will be considered fancy slaves- just like black people were not thought about until too late. During the entire time of this, take notice, Asimov's Frankenstein complex will be kicking us in the head with full force. So, in short, I don't think it will be 'playing God'-it's the most natural thing for humans to seek advancement- the consequences of it, however, will be tough to deal with.    Embed Quote
