When AIs will be involved in economic activities - and they will - the outcomes will need to regulated, with the involvement of all parties - humans and AIs. For example, should AIs become rich, who gains access to those funds? Is it immoral to forbid AIs to generate revenues for themselves? When AIs generate ideas that fall under the IP law, the way we make use of their work should also be regulated. It's not that just AIs need to be regulated, but how humans, corporations and governments eventually will allow AIs to be part if our legal, economic and political  systems - will need to be regulated as well. Why hasn't anyone mentioned the AI's consent here? Isn't that essential to imposing regulations? (I wonder)    Embed Quote
