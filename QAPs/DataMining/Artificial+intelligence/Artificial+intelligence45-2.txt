What are the chances of Strong AI (Artificial Intelligence) emerging within this decade?
James William Murdock has the basics of it (go figure). As far as Artificial Intelligence is concerned, we'll pick off human capabilities one at a time until we finally get the right combination for the computers themselves to start picking off the rest. Within this decade? Probably not. The only serious estimates I've ever heard are for when we will have supercomputers with the power of a human brain, and that's a solid fifteen years away still.  Really, though, that isn't a hard limitation because nobody ever said that a computer designing computer has to be able to play chess and racketball, too, so we don't need the WHOLE human brain. Realistically, we have a lot of research to do before we get there. The most sane estimates I've heard clock the Technorapture at around 2070. I'm just hoping I live to see it.    Embed Quote
