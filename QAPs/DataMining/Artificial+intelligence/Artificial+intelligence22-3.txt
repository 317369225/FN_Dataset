Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
I'll take a different approach. No, because, even if artificial intelligence is capable of making music (that sounds good, and not an "uncanny valley" that would give us the creeps) - people will still make music because they want to. Photography didn't make painting obsolete. Besides, the A.I. can take care of the boring tasks of making music - and let human brains and emotions focus on the fun part.    Embed Quote
