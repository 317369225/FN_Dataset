Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
Probably not dissimilar to the skills that are valuable locally when jobs  are being replaced or outsourced overseas.  In the first phase of the new global economy, first manufacturing jobs were outsourced (through automation and overseas outsourcing), then service jobs (first customer service, then jobs requiring more problem-solving and creative elements, such as tech support, basic marketing, etc.)    Now, creativity is always rewarded, so that is unlikely to change much. But other services that require local physical proximity, like massage, dentistry, physical therapy, etc., or relationships, such as sales, or an appreciation of cultural nuances, such as law or public relations, will likely to continue to be in demand.    Embed Quote
