Can artificial intelligence replace managerial jobs?
If you wish to completely eliminate the emotional process then yes. If AI develops far enough to make all rational choices without any overlook of human insight then sure. However, this itself is far from achieved. While there has been a huge improvement in AI decision making algorithms. There isn't a set base yet. However, if this is achieved sometime in future. (Which is plausible) then sure. Can this completely replace management roles, or should it? No. You see emotional aspects are something most people believe disadvantage. This is not necessarily true.  Managing humans, means managing emotions. This can't be achieved without understanding emotions, which can't be achieved without possessing emotions. You have to understand the moods, the interpersonal relationships, etc. to achieve a good team and work life balance. True sometimes these emotions might lead to unfair decisions. But that is exactly why this is not everyone's job.    Embed Quote
