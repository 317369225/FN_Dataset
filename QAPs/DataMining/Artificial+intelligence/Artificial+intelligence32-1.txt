Could non-sentient artificial intelligence destroy mankind?
Many things more likely and far less "intelligent" can destroy mankind, and even the most basic AI built into arsenals of WMD's can malfunction and blow us all up.  In that sense the answer would be yes. However, based on the way that you structured it, your question is not so much about whether it can destroy mankind, but whether there is the possibility that AI can have the specific intent to do so.  So let's start with some underlying concepts.  Sentience refers to the ability of an entity to have sensory experiences that they can interpret subjectively - or in other words, sentient entities make subjective judgments of value, norms or standard based on what they experience through their senses. Non-sentient being will lack this ability.  The lack of this ability can spring from either a) not having the sensory system (with the accompanying subjective processing) to have experiences, or b) having such sensory systems but lacking the subjective capacity to make judgments of value, norm or standard. For AI to work it needs inputs from somewhere.  More likely than not, a system that would have the inherent potential to destroy mankind would have a myriad of sensory systems that feed into the main intelligence process.  This means that your non-sentient AI would be fall in the category of lacking subjective capacity...essentially, not caring. The question then follows if something that does not care, can have the intent to destroy mankind.  And the answer is no - without subjective valuation of inputs that may lead to a conclusion to kill, it cannot have intent.  AI can only destroy mankind, if mankind provided AI with the rule set that could lead to such a conclusion.  It is then not AI that did the destroying, but mankind.    Embed Quote
