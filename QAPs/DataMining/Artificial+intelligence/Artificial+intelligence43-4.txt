Is it possible to create artificial intelligence? And why or how?
If we define intelligence as the ability to solve problems, then it is clear that non-biological intelligence is already present and growing.  A person armed with a laptop computer is able to solve a great many more problems than one without.  Therefore, the laptop is contributing a fraction of the intelligence in the human+laptop system.  Although the fraction contributed by humans is still significant and qualitatively distinct from the fraction contributed by non-biological intelligence, the trends are obvious: computers are allowing us to solve ever more complex problems, and are increasingly able to contribute aspects of problem-solving that were qualitatively 'human' in nature.  Non-biological intelligence improves with each passing generation.  Human intelligence does not.  We often read of yet another area where non-biological intelligence has matched or bested human intelligence.  There is no obvious barrier on this continuum preventing non-biological intelligence from eventually supplanting and exceeding all human contributions to problem-solving, and the trends are in that direction.  From where we sit right now, it is not a question of whether, but when.    Embed Quote
