Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
No, because we understand that artificial intelligence is simple an  algorithm, or group of algorithms working in computers that WE designed,  doing things that it was preprogrammed to do. It's actually not  intelligent at all. It is doing exactly what it was told to do.    Embed Quote
