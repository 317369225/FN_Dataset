Can artificial intelligence replace managerial jobs?
I certainly think so and they might be much better at it. Managment has at its basis determining what tasks are needed, what resources are required, what progress is being made to completing tasks and shifting resources as needed. Humans for the most part are terrible at doing this: they spend to much time talking and not enough time doing. Furthermore, humans allow emotions to get in the way of making crisp decisions. Computers do not have this problem.    Embed Quote
