How is artificial intelligence the biggest threat to humanity?
Currently we have only been able to make "weak AI", but the goal that continues to elude us is "strong AI". Weak AI is not considered dangerous because it can only do what it has been programed to do, its behavior is predictable. Strong AI on the other hand is potentially dangerous because it can change its programming, so we do not know what it will do, especially when it becomes orders of magnitude stronger than human general intelligence. It is the uncertainty that causes fear in some. The fear is a little premature because there is no AI that comes close to human general intelligence yet, but the rate of advancement in the field of AI is moving at an amazing pace, so it is good to have some concern so that we are not caught unawares.    Embed Quote
