Would artificial intelligence machines be interested in religion?
I'm sure that AI would be interested in religion in much the same way that Computer Science is interested in language parsing, it is a method of communication that could provide elegant solutions to difficult problems (such as preventing people from dying when eating tainted animals).  AI would seek to use religion as a tool just as math is a tool because presumably AI would constantly seek to build on itself.  Religion could manifest itself once AI had effectively exhausted all that it could learn from us and our immediate surroundings since religion is effectively providing vague, simple answers to unanswerable questions.  The idea of religion would be far more complicated than the Bible most likely and might be something similar to Neil Degrasse Tyson's Cosmos.  The central tenants of AI religion would have to be answers that seem to work for questions that are currently unsolveable.    Embed Quote
