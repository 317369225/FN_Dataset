★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
I think this is a very interesting question, and no one should answer with a boring answer or quote or stupid image. The good thing of quora is that it can give inspiration, sometimes spoiled by obvious answers. Of course we cannot know it by now, since an artificial intelligence doesn't already exist, therefore only suppositions and philosophical squiggles can be done about. This question should stay unanswered.    Embed Quote
