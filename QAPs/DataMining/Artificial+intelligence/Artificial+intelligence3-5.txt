★Would an Artificial Intelligence fear death?I know it's difficult to define what death would mean for a computer. But it seems to me that there are only two possibilities: it either does everything in its power to prevent shut down, or just becomes so bored due to experiencing events at such speed that it ultimately embraces death. Or maybe lack of gratification and pleasure like us? What do you think?
Human beings have addtional functions like instincts and feelings. We can program our computer with a bias for survival. Like when you detect electricity supply being at risk try to avoid the risk. We can even go one step further and code something like if survival is at risk initiate fear routine. Then to an external observer it may seem like computer is afraid. But like animals and everything else other than humans computer would not identify itself with fear. That would require an additional and more complicated "me" construct. Humans have this bug, why to replicate it again ?    Embed Quote
