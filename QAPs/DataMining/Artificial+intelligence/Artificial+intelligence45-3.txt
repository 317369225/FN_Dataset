What are the chances of Strong AI (Artificial Intelligence) emerging within this decade?
None. David Deutsch ("The Beginning of Infinity") claims that for all the advances made in computation in recent years no progress has been made toward achieving strong AI, meaning here human-like conscious intelligence. That's not surprising, because we know a great deal about computation but almost  nothing about consciousness. He believes we would need to understand and explain consciousness before we could program it. Seems reasonable to me.    Embed Quote
