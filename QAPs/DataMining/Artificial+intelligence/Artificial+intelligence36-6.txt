What is a good sci-fi book on artificial intelligence?
The short story by Isaac Asimov, "The Last Question".  If you want the strength of the topic A.I. in a short amount of time, this is a perfect read.  It's a short story, with the feeling of a saga... heck, the feeling of multiple sagas.  For what you're looking for this author is classic at providing.  Also, a short story is a fast conduit to knowing how much you'll like his other work (which i doubt you'll have trouble enjoying, since he's a founding father of the modern field).    Embed Quote
