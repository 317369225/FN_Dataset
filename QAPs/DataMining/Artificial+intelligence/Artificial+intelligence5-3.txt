★Should artificial intelligence be regulated?Do you agree with Elon Musk that AI needs to be regulated to protect from "skynet" Elon Musk Compares Building Artificial Intelligence To “Summoning The Demon” | TechCrunch
It's very premature to worry about regulation. For example physics, chemistry and biology were fields of study that went for over a century as hard science before they unleashed their demons: atom bombs, chemical weapons, and bioweapons. Certainly, I'd agree that parts of these fields should be regulated. I would not be very happy having David Hahn as my next door neighbor for example, without the Nuclear Regulatory Commission looking out for me. But we are nowhere near demon-summoning danger with AI, and most of the things we do in AI actually benefit people. So by and large the field should be unregulated. The only exception I can think of right now is lethal military autonomous weapons that use AI. Anything that kills people without direct human intervention should be banned.    Embed Quote
