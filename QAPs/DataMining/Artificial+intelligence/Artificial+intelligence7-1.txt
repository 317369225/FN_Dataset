★How is artificial intelligence programmed?Generally / high level -- what concepts are important and how does the code to "learn" something actually work? Bonus points for code snippet examples...
Ryan Donahue has given a very good answer. So let me take another approach to learning or programming intelligence as proposed by Roger Schank. His view point is that our decisions are based on experiences. This kind of view has evolved into a branch of artificial intelligence called Memory Based Reasoning. In a Programming Perspective, you encode a series of problem/experiences along with the solutions. The main assumption is that similar problems have similar solutions and similar problems repeat. So for a new problem, you encode it and retrieve the problem in the database of problems and take the corresponding solution. Adapt it to this new problem and propose the solution. This is also called Case based reasoning.    Embed Quote
