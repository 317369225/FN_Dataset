Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
You assume there is a God, I don't. But everyone wants a child. When people have children they assume serious responsibility for making decisions about the future of that child. Would it really be different morally, if the intelligence you gave birth to was artificial? In my day it was always said about artificial intelligence that it would always be more effective to produce natural intelligence by means of cheap organic labour. I still believe in the truth of that. So this is just a hypothetical scenario, I think. Nowadays, people seem to believe in the supremacy of quantum computing over the frustrating constraints of the Universe: they imagine that a singularity is coming any moment, and all of us will somehow escape the inevitable. Suppose that you perform the magical act of designing an artificial intelligence ... let's grant you that achievement, which is well beyond the ability of any living human at the moment or in the foreseeable future. Who would you or I or anyone else be to limit the freedom of such a creature of our own beyond the ordinary laws that we agree should apply to all of us?    Embed Quote
