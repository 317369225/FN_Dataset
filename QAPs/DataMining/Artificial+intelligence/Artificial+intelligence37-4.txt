Which human skills will increase in value over the next century as artificial intelligence changes the global economy?
Ability to connect the unconnected.  The information is not a problem. Knowledge (and its widespread and easy availability) is not a problem. Availability of resource is also not as major a problem as it used to be. So what then is the problem? Like they say, Knowledge is no longer power in today's day and age. It is at best potential power. Not getting overwhelmed, inundated and swept away by this massive information overload is the real problem and a massive challenge to all of us. So which is going to be the skill set of the future? Having the ability to maintain the big picture thinking (remaining focused) and at the same time be comfortable with ambiguity/uncertainty that typically results while sifting through information in order to create something of value.    Embed Quote Updated 13 Mar, 2014. 831 views.
