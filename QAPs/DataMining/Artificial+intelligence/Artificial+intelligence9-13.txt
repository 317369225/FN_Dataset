Isn't developing artificial intelligence playing God?
It makes a difference whether a machine that is human like and/or mimics humans actually has human experiences or not. The fact that IBM dismantled Deep Blue does not amount to murdering a chess player. If IBM decided to dismantle Watson it would not amount to killing a Jeopardy player. This is because neither Deep Blue nor Watson have human experiences. Or do they? This is the question of philosophical zombies which is not a trivial one. It seems trivial in these cases, but not trivial in general. One can delete a program that one has written, but one can not kill one's own child.    Embed Quote
