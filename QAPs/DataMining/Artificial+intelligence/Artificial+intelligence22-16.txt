Will artificial intelligence render human music makers as useless?
I think yes, that it is at least possible in the distant future. (I think it should be obvious, though, that this WILL NOT make human musicians and composers useless. Music is maybe most primarily about conveying feelings that cannot be put into words, and listening to it knowing that it came from a person with those feelings. Live performance is more sensational than a recording. As well, we will still enjoy the process of making music regardless of how well AI could do it.) I think one's answer to whether AI could ever be as sophisticated and artistic as us depends on one's beliefs about the materialistic vs. ethereal properties of our own brains. We as humans, with feelings, and existential thoughts, and a bias toward over-estimation of our own importance (given to us because this species narcissism is beneficial to our survival), uniqueness, intelligence, etc., deep in our psyches, instinctively reject the idea that our memories, mental capacities, creativity, can possibly be quantifiable or viewed as a commodity. The scientific, neurological reality is that these are quantifiable even with our current limited understanding of the brain. To say that we can break rules to make art implies that AI never can. But we don't know that. We can only guess. Look what advances in computer science and neurology we've made in what--half a century? It's also up for debate as to whether the human brain is actually capable of "breaking rules" in the artistic process. Maybe "breaking rules" is just a matter of a subtly complex system of systems of algorithms working themselves out within various parts of our brain? Do you know what goes on in our brain when this happens? If you don't even understand what goes on in the brain during this process, how can anyone assert that AI is incapable of this if we haven't even pinned down what "this" is?    Embed Quote
