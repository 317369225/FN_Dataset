★The Technological Singularity: Will self-aware, intelligent, sentient artificial intelligence be sociopathic?
Seems to powerfully depend on how this intelligence is constructed. After all, some humans are sociopathic and intelligent, and there is a reason for this. So, to answer, yes some A.I.s will fit what we call "sociopathic" but this isn't necessarily the case.    Embed Quote
