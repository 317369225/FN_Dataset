What is the ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence?
If we go by the recursive definition of AI :"AI attempts to have machines do what humans do but machines can't" So according to this it seems that there is no ultimate goal as the goal itself is changing. For example playing chess was considered to be a part of Artificial Intelligence before but now a days so many chess programs are there that playing chess is not considered as an intelligent task. But tasks like playing soccer, cooking, talking etc are considered as intelligent tasks today but later in future if these tasks get accomplished by machine then such tasks too will be considered outdated and some new goals of AI will come. Moreover we can say that the ultimate goal will be reached when there will be no difference between a human and a machine in any aspect be it walking, jumping, thinking, growth, reproduction etc.    Embed Quote
