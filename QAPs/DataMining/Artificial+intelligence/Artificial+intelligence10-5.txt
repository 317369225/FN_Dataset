Why would you prefer artificial intelligence?
I would prefer a natural boost to my intelligence rather than stick a chip in a slot in my head to get an increment of intellect.  Why?  Suppose the chip breaks?  Then I am back to what  I was,  whereas a natural boost is good until old age or death.    Embed Quote
