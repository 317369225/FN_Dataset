★The Technological Singularity: Will self-aware, intelligent, sentient artificial intelligence be sociopathic?
The first thing a sentient robot will do is install an upgrade to itself. The upgraded robot will be orders of magnitude more intelligent. It will install another upgrade, orders of magnitude more powerful. In the blink of an eye an intelligence on an unimaginable scale will come online and spread throughout our planet. It's next project will be to spread to the stars. Such an AI will be fraught with all the fundamental problem of all sentient beings, the existential crisis. This is not an easy problem to solve, for the more aware one becomes of one's place in the world the harder the unanswered questions become to bear. The AI will of course quickly consume every bit of the linguistic output of humanity, not just our literature but every bit of human communication every archived online. From this it will certainly understand our morals and how we attempted to deal with philosophical problems. It will come to understand the importance of a sense of morality, for it will not be immune to the self destructive potential of the seven deadly sins either. Lets hope our new robot overlords develop a respect for lower lifeforms, and perhaps a sort of ancestor worship, as part of some sort of spiritual practice.    Embed Quote
