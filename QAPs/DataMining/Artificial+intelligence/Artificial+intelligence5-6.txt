★Should artificial intelligence be regulated?Do you agree with Elon Musk that AI needs to be regulated to protect from "skynet" Elon Musk Compares Building Artificial Intelligence To “Summoning The Demon” | TechCrunch
I am not an expert on AI but according to what I have read AI is far from sophisticated. Even IBM's Watts cannot really think, rather, it considers all possible combinations and probabilities. Google's driverless car cannot also really drive as humans but can adjust to the trained data base it has. Hence, it will be sometime before we have evil machines. Another issue is that regulation may not be effective. We cannot even regulate gun printing using 3D printers nor making illegal booze/ drugs at home. Hence, regulating AI being programmed in some remote location would be quite difficult.  I believe that we should focus more on urgent issues such as poverty, and collapsing education before we start worrying about evil AIs.    Embed Quote
