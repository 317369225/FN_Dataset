Is self aware Artificial Intelligence possible?
Possible, sure. It's really hard to dismiss something like that as impossible. While I'm not 100% up to speed on the current state of research, I can say this with fairly high confidence. We are not anywhere close to developing a self aware AI and it's unlikely to happen in my lifetime.    Embed Quote
