★In text mining is there any standard way to measure cool?
This is an interesting one. I absolutely agree with Benedikt Koehler on the answer, you need to find what's "cool" and use it as a benchmark. I did a case study with one of our clients last year, Seattle Pacific University. A professor used Semantria, our text and sentiment analysis service, to analyze blog posts his students submitted to him. He found that the more themes (noun + adjective = theme) each post contained, the better the student scored at the end of the year. Since then, he's been using our service regularly to measure student performance. How is this relevant? Simple: humans aren't that creative. We have specific speech patterns and linguistic mechanics which give away whether or not something is cool, funny, smart, and in the case of the students, self-reflective. Here's what I suggest you do. 1.Grab some articles that you are certain are "cool". These will be your benchmark articles. 2. Paste them in Excel, one article per cell, in one column. Run Semantria's Discovery mode on them. The Discovery tutorial can be found at Tutorials | semantria.com)   3. Don't worry, we have a free trial, you can analyze up to 10,000 articles free, more than enough for this. 4. Discovery mode will show you the main "facets" and "attributes" (nouns and adjectives, respectively) that occur in "cool" content. Now you'll know exactly what words to look for. 5. Run Queries on all subsequent articles to find those keywords that you found in step 4. If enough are present, the article is probably "cool".

I find this kind of stuff really cool (pun intended).    Embed Quote
