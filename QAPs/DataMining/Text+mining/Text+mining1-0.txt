★Are there any successful NLP and Text Mining companies?
Lexalytics has been working in the text mining industry for about 10 years now and released the first working sentiment analysis product. Salience (their NLP engine) has everything from named entity recognition (and extraction), sentiment bearing phrase extraction, noun-phrase (key theme) extaction, wikipedia based categorization and boolean logic based categorization. Check out their web demo to see them live in action. Semantria is an API that uses Salience as a backbone and has added additional features on top of those included with Salience. They also have a Microsoft Excel add-in so you can use the features of text mining right inside an Excel worksheet. You can try Semantria API or Semantria for Excel for free if your register.
