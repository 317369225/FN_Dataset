★Is there any deep learning model that has already been trained in NLP and the text mining field?One deep learning model which has been "trained" is word2vec. People can just download it, feed textual data, and retrieve semantically similar words of a given word. Also, I heard that there are some developed DL model in computer vision field. Is there any other deep learning model that has been developed and ready-to-use?
Stanford's RNTN - Recursive Neural Tensor Networks are an example of deep learning models being applied for sentiment analysis. Its currently the state of art in sentiment analysis and labelling. You can read more about them here: Page on stanford.edu A cool part about it is you can experience a live demo of the trained model and help it improve by correcting the incorrectly classified labels.
