★Why so many lame questions are there in NLP and Text Mining topics in quora?People are asking questions about NLP which are purely imbecile in nature. The questions which are not debatable and rather a web search would suffice the answer? For instance, questions as simple as "Name any POS tagging library in java?". Aren't people aware about the google-search?
I concur with the fact that some questions may appear lame to the researchers or experts in the field of NLP etc. But for some questions, I would say that yes they appear stupid even to the common audience. The reasons for such questions could be: NLP is an emerging field. There are people who have less prior knowledge about it and are technology enthusiast. They want to learn the technologies from ground up. Nobody is born with all the knowledge. So they are asking simple and basic questions and it's perfectly normal. There may be a conspiracy by a few users to gain popularity. For example, some attention seeking and publicity desiring person might be asking his friends to post simple questions on quora and he would quickly answer those questions with 1-2 wikipedia links or top 5 google results. Quora has a recommendation system that presents one as an expert in a particular field by the number of answers and number of vote ups (which again could be from friends) rather than evaluating the actual value addition or the actual reasonability of a question/answer. But then such users are also infesting the reasonable questions by just "summarizing all of the above" answers and getting a count++. You will have bear with it, for now. This problem could be tackled by quora once they change their recommendation algo.    Embed Quote
