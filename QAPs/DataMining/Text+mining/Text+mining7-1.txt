★What are some of the most important papers in text mining?
It's too general with Text Mining term. Focusing on some techniques is better, i think. Of course, there are many techniques in this field. For classification problem, we should consider Vapnik's study in Support-vector networks, Text categorization with support vector machines: Learning with many relevant features by Joachims et al. In clustering, A comparison of document clustering techniques by Steinbach et al. was given a good way to know how clustering algorithms work. It still remains a lot of papers for each issue that I cannot list here right now, :).    Embed Quote
