★Is there any deep learning model that has already been trained in NLP and the text mining field?One deep learning model which has been "trained" is word2vec. People can just download it, feed textual data, and retrieve semantically similar words of a given word. Also, I heard that there are some developed DL model in computer vision field. Is there any other deep learning model that has been developed and ready-to-use?
Here is a list of important works I can think of <I might be missing the ones I did not study/use in my work > : 2005 Benjio et al : Word Vector Representations 2006 Hinton et al: Semantic Hashing <He says that this model can be used on text in his Quora course> 2010 Collbert Weston : 2-3 wonderful papers describing how to use word vectors for NER, POS and other NLP tasks 2010-2014 Richard Socher : Various works on using Recursive Neural Networks for <mostly> supervised tasks like sentiment prediction. 2013-onwards K Cho / Bahdanau and others : Neural Machine Translation and other supervised tasks using Recurrent Neural Networks. 2013-onwards A research group in Oxford is working on use of convnets in NLP All of these algorithms are available as open source code. Search for terms like SENNA, groundhog and on the stanford/google website . Edit: Forgot adding Google research papers like Word2Vec and Paragraph Vector .    Embed Quote
