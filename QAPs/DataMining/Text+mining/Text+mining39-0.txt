★Is there any deep learning model that has already been trained in NLP and the text mining field?One deep learning model which has been "trained" is word2vec. People can just download it, feed textual data, and retrieve semantically similar words of a given word. Also, I heard that there are some developed DL model in computer vision field. Is there any other deep learning model that has been developed and ready-to-use?
I made a survey about this topic in last year and here are the main parts of my survey. The information was collected in last year, so may be out of date, but the link is available. Hope these help :) SENNALink: http://ml.nec-labs.com/senna/ Dim of word vector: 50 Vocabulary size: 130K Word RepresentationLink: http://metaoptimize.com/projects...
