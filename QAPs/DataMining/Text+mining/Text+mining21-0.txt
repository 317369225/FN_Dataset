★What are some interesting text mining application on web forums?resulting patterns discoveries in online discussions. (users recommendations, users needs, users FAQ, etc.)
foodmood.in is an excellent application of data mining.   It uses twitter feeds about food,in real-time, and tells us about the "food sentiment" of each one of them. Each recognized food item is represented by a rectangle, of which the size corresponds to the number of times that food has been mentioned, and the colors stand for a range of positive to negative sentiments. Users can compare an arbitrary number of countries against each other, and filter the data by time, by country or by popularity.    Embed Quote
