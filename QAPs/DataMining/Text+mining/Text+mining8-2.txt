★What's the best way to get into text mining?
If you know R or Python, you can get started by using some good examples. R  has a package called tm (text mining). There are some tutorials which  can help you use tm for classification using Naive Bayes/Decision Trees.  cran.r-Page on project.org Python's scikit-learn has support for Text Mining too. You should look at the api for sklearn.feature_extraction.text which will help you extract features from raw text. You  can consult introductory books such as Machine Learning with R" or  "Machine Learning with Python (using scikit learn)". They have working  code which you can try out. In addition, you should read about  Text Mining, Feature Extraction, Vectorization/Tf-idf, classification  techniques such as Naive Bayes, clustering such as k-means.Edit    Embed Quote
