★Which platform / tool / language should be good for text mining ?For developing Search engine kinds of project
You can use text-mining API (like www.wikimeta.com for exemple). Such tools will give you the possibility to send a text document to a server and to retrieve it with various annotations layers. Depending of what kind of mining you want, you should verify witch annotation layers are returned by the API. Usually, you can retrieve Part Of Speech tags (nature of the words like verbs, adjectives, and so on), Named entity labels (if a sequence of word depict a Person, an Organisation and so on), and semantic annotations (like URI links to the Linked Data Network). Using web services like API can be considered as a less flexible solution than using local text-mining and labelling software (like Stanford NLP tools or Lingpipe) but let you focus on your global project, and let the API developers maintaining a good text-mining solution and improve it.    Embed Quote
