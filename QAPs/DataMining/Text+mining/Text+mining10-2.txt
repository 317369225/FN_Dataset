★What are the best tools available for content/text mining?I have a huge pile of unstructured data I would like to analyze for themes/phrases, etc.  I don't code, so it would be great if it was something easy to use, that allowed me to scrape data from websites for analysis.
If you don't code, Semantria's Excel Add-In may be the perfect option for you. It lets you analyze content from directly inside Microsoft Excel. For your use case specifically, you can extract the main themes and phrases from all of your content and the engine is fully configurable. All you'll need to do is copy/paste your content into an Excel spreadsheet and press a button to analyze your data.    Embed Quote
