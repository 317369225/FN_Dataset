★Is Python the best programming language for Text mining?I'll be happy for advantageous\disadvantageous list compared to other languages
Natural Language Toolkit was developed for Python. It's one of the best frameworks for text mining. In Java, you can use Apache UIMA - Apache UIMA , which is pretty nice tool from what I heard. Also, there is The Stanford NLP (Natural Language Processing) Group  for named entity recognition. Comparing Python/Java, I would say, the only disadvantage of Python is that it doesn't support any decent multithreading, which can be painful.    Embed Quote
