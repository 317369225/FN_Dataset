★In text mining is there any standard way to measure cool?
A low-tech solution: 1. Search the authors in the net. 2. Determine their ranking and number of connections, if possible. If we assume that those who imitate the style of expression of the popular kids, are "cool" themselves, then the following may work: 1. Extract the list of meaningful words, removing those too common, function words, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns. 2. Search every meaningful word in social media, determining some kind of aggregate score for the count of words mentioned in the top tier of the "most popular" posts. There, you got a simple naive Bayes classifier for coolness.    Embed Quote
