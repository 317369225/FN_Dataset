★Where can I find a comprehensive list of text mining methods?
Text mining is a huge field that covers many subfields (text classification, summarisation, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, information retrieval, etc.), each with its own set of methods. So a comprehensive list of methods for text mining is quite difficult to establish.  Scanning through the table of contents of the following books should give a pretty good overview of methods within the different subfields: Amazon.com: Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing (9780262133609): Christopher D. Manning, Hinrich Schütze: Books Speech and Language Processing (2nd Ed.): Updates Introduction to Information Retrieval    Embed Quote
