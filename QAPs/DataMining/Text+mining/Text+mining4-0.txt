★What are the seminal papers on Text Mining?Looking for papers that would give great insight into common problems and techniques.
I'm not sure if i'm truly qualified to answer this question, as i only, always prefer open source books going around(..they come highly recommended, and are quite awesome), but the great thing about books are they use and explain pioneer papers in a sequential order which makes understanding aspects quite easier. Anyways, my personal list for books related to the subject containing all of the newest approaches and some places where they can be applied are: 1)Mining of Massive Datasets ..Jure Leskovec et al. [ Mining of Massive Datasets ].. 2)If you're into mining, you need to have a sound knowledge about the Information Retrieval approaches and models. For that, i recommend "Introduction to Information Retrieval" by Christopher Manning  [Introduction to Information Retrieval ].. It has an aggregate of some of the most important papers on the topic of IR, easily explained. 3)Since you've added tags for NLP+Text Analytics here's one of my favorite book on that topic by prominent Yahoo Researchers.. "Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis" [ The Book ].. The best thing about these books are that they are so beginner friendly, you don't need to peruse through the entire Chapter/Book to get a hang of what you want to know. You jump straight to the sub-section. Learn it, and, that's that. PS: if you want to learn about NLP more than the normal text-analysis part there's another great book, again by Christopher Manning called "Statistical Natural Language Processing". you might wanna go through that. [  Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing ]..    Embed Quote
