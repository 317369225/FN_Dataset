★What are some common causes of failure/low ROI in Text Mining projects?
I'm not sure if I follow your question correctly? Do you want to a) know the typical reasons why text mining projects fail or b) believe that all text mining projects fail? I'm going to make an assumption and go with (a). Typical reasons for text mining projects to fail: 1) Not taking into account the scale of the project 2) Making assumption that semantics are handled automatically 3) Applying just one technique (say rule based, ML, etc) 4) Not understanding the domain of the problem that you are solving I guess there could be other reasons as well. But with the information provided, this is all I could think of.    Embed Quote
