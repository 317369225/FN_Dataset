★What are the best tools available for content/text mining?I have a huge pile of unstructured data I would like to analyze for themes/phrases, etc.  I don't code, so it would be great if it was something easy to use, that allowed me to scrape data from websites for analysis.
This question has already been answered many times on Quora in various forms. See: 1. Which platform / tool / language should be good for text mining ? 2. What are good starting points (books, tools ) for learning text mining?    Embed Quote
