★How do I detect sarcasm in phrases or sentences while text mining? Is there any methodology used?
I comment not as a self-professing expert, just as a lifelong student of English syntax. When reading text, we still need a working context in order to grasp the sincerity  (or lack thereof) of a statement. That working context may come in the form of an article in a magazine, advice column, or campaign. We have to examine the writer's arguments for or against it, as well as the bent or viewpoint of the article's writer.      After reading that article for the writer's sentiments, it's safe to bet that any commentary (emotional or not) by said writer that seems contrary to the writer's central argument (often heightened to ludicrous effect) is the polarized extreme used to draw more attention to the problem the writer wishes the reader to take note of - which is sarcasm.    Embed Quote
