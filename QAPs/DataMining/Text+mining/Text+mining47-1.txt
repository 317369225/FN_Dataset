★I'm looking for resources and previous work on using Text-mining / NLP techniques to infer location information from articles. Any pointers?
Tim, I think you have set us a challenge!! I am working with a team building classifiers.  We are close to having a naive bayesian classifier in a useable form.  In creating and testing this, we have gone for what is rapidly becoming our default twitter data set - a search for Bristol (we are based in Bristol, UK).  There are, however, a number of Bristols in other parts of the world, so we have attempted to filter out references to these other Bristols in data collection, though some got through.  In our training set, we have a classification of "Wrong Bristol".  IF the classifier correctly separates out the tweets for North American Bristols from British Bristols, then we might be a step on the way to doing what you want to do. (that is, assuming I understand you correctly).    Embed Quote
