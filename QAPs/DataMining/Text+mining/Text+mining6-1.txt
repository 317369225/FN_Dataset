★Is Python the best programming language for Text mining?I'll be happy for advantageous\disadvantageous list compared to other languages
n=1 data point: I had a small summer research project involving mining natural text found on the Internet for medical trends. The pipeline itself was made up of several components from different sources (one in Java, as I recall...), but the glue that kept it together was Python. It was definitely a good choice of language. It's easy enough to do basic read/parse/write operations with appropriate libraries, and when that fails, to call other programs from the shell. YMMV, of course, and I don't have anything to compare it to here, but it gets the job done, and actually makes it kind of pleasant, in a Pythonic sort of way.    Embed Quote
