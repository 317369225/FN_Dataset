★Are there any successful NLP and Text Mining companies?
Clarabridge is one. They specialize in customer experience text analytics - surveys, phone support conversations, and other customer verbatims. This helps businesses better understand their customers' pain points, see how sentiment correlates with account performance, and make other strategic and/or tactical customer experience decisions. I know that might sound lame and corporate, but I honestly think that tools like this should be used in any heavily consumer-facing industry. It's in everyone's interest. As for their NLP technology, I'm not sure how thorough or accurate it is, either in an absolute or relative sense (compared to the competition). What I do know, however, is that they do provide some basic sentiment analysis on customer verbatims. For example, they have algorithms for detecting negative or positive words and generating overall scores for entire verbatim instances. So, nothing too intense, based on what I've seen many coders blog about (Twitter sentiment analysis with NLTK + scikit, anyone?). That said I've only just started checking out their (Clarabridge's) offerings. I'll edit this if I find additional noteworthy functionalities.    Embed Quote
