★Which platform / tool / language should be good for text mining ?For developing Search engine kinds of project
Language is more of a personal choice, and tool is more of convenience. The most important feature for a tool is continuous support and documentation. Since it is mentioned that it is for a search engine kind of project. I have 2 suggestions: Use Python with NLTK, Natural Language Toolkit - contains a very good set of tools for text processing, and scikit-learn, a nice set of tools for machine learning. No text mining process is complete without some underlying learning. Another option, more tuned towards building and developing a search engine is to use Terrier(http://terrier.org/). It is an open source tool/library which runs with Java, and can be used especially for search engines. Or u could check out Lucene and LingPipe with Java.    Embed Quote
