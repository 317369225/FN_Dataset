★What is the best open source database for text mining/ text analytics?What is the best open source database for text mining? Please note that the data could have a lot of random special characters too...
PostgreSQL - Its optimizer is the most mature of all the opensource RDMS platforms.  It handles hierarchical data very well in key value store models and allows for a wider amount of operators than other platforms.  Do not attempt that in MySQL.  It also can handle multi key index questions much better than any nosql solution which is essential in text analytics.  It allows for dynamically adding values to data sets without having to re-index / re-calculate / re-cache things.   Of course if your problem space has questions that you know ahead of time and your data is mostly static you can always create a special separate subject area for pre computed questions and use hash indexes. In addition you can use all the more common models like 3nf and star schemas as well which may be useful in supporting text analytics.  One final bit of fun is it even has a way of interacting with string pattern matching in a regex fashion for those who enjoy such forms of geek flagellation.    Embed Quote
