★What are some usual recommendation algorithms that were used by social network,information retrieval system or text mining system?
If you are talking about the most common recommendation algorithms, I would have to go with Collaborative Filtering. The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly. Nothing explains collaborative filtering better than this gif image.    Embed Quote
