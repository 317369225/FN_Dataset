★What is the difference between sentiments (positive and negative) and emotions in text mining (NLP)?For example Anger is negative emotion as well as negative sentiment both seems the same.
Sentiments can be expressed mostly in binary format (+ve & -ve) in a simplistic way. To add further, you may varying degrees of +ve and -ve sentiments, and perhaps neutral. However, emotions have multi-dimensions. Anger for sure is -ve sentiment, and so is sadness, but they aren't really the same. To talk more specifically about text mining (NLP based), it's much simpler to do sentiment analysis but very hard to carry out emotional analysis. The next level of sentiment analysis is the field of intent analysis where few researchers have been working on mining out intent from the chunk of text, which seems of very high business value.    Embed Quote
