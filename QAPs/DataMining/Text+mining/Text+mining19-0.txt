★How popular is text mining as compared to data mining in general?
From my very biased opinion, text mining becomes less and less popular. If the amount of data available is large enough, text mining does not give a significant win over more generic data mining techniques. If the amount of data available is small, hand-tuned natural language processing often accomplishes good results faster, and in more predictable fashion. As I understand, text mining nowadays is moving into less explored areas, like sentiment analysis. "Understanding" texts using text mining has not been broadly successful, at least on the B2C market. Siri or Google Contextual Search might be good examples of where one can get with human-driven text mining. Not impressive, if you ask me.    Embed Quote
