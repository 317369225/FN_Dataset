★What are the best text mining software that can product tags or keywords?
Check out the Natural Language Tool Kit at nltk.org, a Python library for text processing that will take you into advanced linguistics but has the basic tools you need. In outline, it would work something like this: With the lxml or another library, grab the blog and de-HTML it. With nltk, "tokenize" the extract, dividing it into words Possibly filter out stop words such as "a," "an," "the," "this," ... that are not likely to be interesting to your purposes. Use an nltk "tagger" to identify parts of speech, since you may only be interested in nouns, for example. Look for named entity recognition code, such as http://timmcnamara.co.nz/post/26... to identify people and placenames Adapt nltk code like http://www.alexbowe.com/?tag=nltk for identifying other keywords (although if you've got keywords selected in advance, it's trivial to just check the tokenized list of blog words with the keyword list).    Embed Quote
