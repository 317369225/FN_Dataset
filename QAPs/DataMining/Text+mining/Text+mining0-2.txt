★What is the relationship between text mining information retrieval and text mining?I know the two topics are closely related. But is it appropriate  to say "when the information is text format, the IR and TM are equivalent"?
The intuition of text mining evolves while one studies data mining in general and constraints himself to text. Majority of the techniques learnt/applied to general data can be extended to text. Information Retrieval is more to do with search engines - concerning mostly about queries , document retrieval (though its text most of the times). This is more of hybrid topic evolved using ML, NLP techniques quite heavily. These days getting more attention thanks to search engines.    Embed Quote
