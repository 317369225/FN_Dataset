★What are good starting points (books, tools ) for learning text mining?
Steven Bird and his colleagues have developed a great toolkit, tutorial, support system built on Python called NLTK, natural language toolkit. http:www.nltk.org There's a text with a free online version. As an undergraduate text aimed at students in linguistics who may have no programming experience (or none in Python), it provides the essentials to follow along. Even though I was an advanced beginner, I particularly appreciated the exercises that both bolstered my Python fundamentals and introduced the methods of text analysis. It goes further into linguistics in the later chapters than most nonspecialists may be interested in, but there's plenty for the rest of us: Concordance: key words in context Bigrams Frequency analysis Stopwords Bayesian analysis Named entity recognition Sentiment analysis    Embed Quote
