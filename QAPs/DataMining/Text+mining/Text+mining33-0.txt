★What are the most useful text mining blogs?
If you write about fashion, your life, or anything like that, you can have your name in your blog. but if you're writing about tech (specially hacking, cracking or if you provide any cracks) or politics (criticize any politician) you shouldn't mention yourself. Many times name might put you in trouble. For instance, check my site (particularly blog) www.k3t4n.tk. I write tech. I don't put my name in it, but I've linked it with my FB and Twitter page...    Embed Quote
