★What are some interesting text mining projects in political analysis?There are bunch of speeches from different politicians including Presidents as well as Parliament members. I was wondering whether there have been any analytical attempts using this data. If not, what are some interesting ideas?
Lexalytics used to have a very interested political analysis web demo during the 2012 U.S. presidential elections. They pulled tweets from different states about the campaign, political parties and hot issues at the time. The tweets were analyzed with Lexalytics Salience engine for sentiment amongst a number of other relevant factors, including themes, keywords, and more. With the output data users could identify trends in the election.   In the same vein, Semantria has worked on political analysis to identify trends for ABC Australia, Sky News in the UK, and CBS in the U.S.   It would be interesting to do what you suggest and analyze the speeches of politicians over time and to identify trends. As well, you could examine the overall sentiment of speeches and look into whether they had any major impact on people’s opinions or attitudes towards the discussed topics overtime. Text analysis in this manner could be very insightful. If you’d like to try it, you can get a free trial with Semantria (http://semantria.com/trial) and we’d be happy to work with you to gain insight into this area.    Embed Quote
