★Which open source NLP/text mining framework has the best support for Japanese? In Java?This is a follow-up question to Which open source NLP/text mining framework has the best support for Chinese?.
NLTK (natural language processing toolkit) can be used to process not only English but also Japanese text without any problems. It supports corpus processing, tokenization, morphological analysis, parsing, etc, with minor modifications and installations of some tools listed below. Some good starting points regarding how to process Japanese text are [1] and [2], both of which I wrote. Because it's all written in Python, you need some extra care when dealing with Unicode strings. This is also explained in [1]. Also, NLTK itself does not include a Japanese morphological analyzer and/or parser, so you may want to install some extra tools such as MeCab [3], JUMAN [4], CaboCha [5], and KNP [6].
