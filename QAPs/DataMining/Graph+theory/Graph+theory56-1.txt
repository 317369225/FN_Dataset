★Why are there so many seemingly basic unresolved problems in graph theory?Perhaps even moreso than number theory, there are numerous statements in graph theory that are extremely intuitive to formulate and simple to explain to someone with limited mathematical background, but which are thought to be very difficult to prove. What is the reason for this?
Numbers involving combinatoric structures on graphs grow very rapidly as a function of the number of vertices. Consider as an example, some of the problems that arise from Ramsey Theory (see Ramsey's theorem), such as finding the Ramsey Number, R(5,5), which is the number of vertices of a complete graph, with edges colored red and blue, which forces the existence of a monochromatic K5 subgraph. The current lower and upper bounds for R(5,5) are 43 and 49 respectively. If we look at the number of edges in the complete graph with 43 nodes, it is 903. If we label the nodes, then there are ways to color the edges red or blue. Or equivalently, there are     graphs of 43 labeled nodes. That number is much lower for unlabeled nodes... The number of graphs on 43 unlabeled nodes = 1119281727569404733432563702422031665449023527748984617871173864596489232605670041518766486136483238813098716357833468938790808348251036820595742925378527198266948161727385131688229821811000465943799297219907784199503872 ( source: A000088 - OEIS ) Obviously, to rule 43 in or out as a possible value for R(5,5), we cannot look at every possible graph on 43 nodes, so more powerful techniques have to be used. Note that Graham's Number is an upper bound for a Ramsey-like problem.    Embed Quote
