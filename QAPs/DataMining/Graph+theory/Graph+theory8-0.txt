★What is the significance of graph theory?
I can speak for many classes of problems in Game Theory involving Matching, which is essentially problems that involve players being assigned goods. In the Housing Market Problem, where players start out owning an asset, we look for "trade cycles", which is best modeled in terms of graph theory, and whose tools are extremely helpful. My research is actually in the Housing Market Problem with non-strict preferences. When you model it in terms of a graph, it can look very intimidating, e.g. a 50 player graph pointing to players who belong to 1st preference: But since we are using graph theory, I can utilize some of its tools, such as Depth First Search, and a little probability, to arrive at my solution: In other words, graph theory is extremely helpful when it comes to programming, as it does drastically speed it up.    Embed Quote
