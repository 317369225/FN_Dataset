★Which are the best books on Graph theory?
Note: this answer refers to the original details of the question, which were "I want to learn Graph theory because someone told me that is useful in theoretical and system neuroscience." The easy but somewhat misleading answer is: See What are some good books for self-studying graph theory? A more honest answer is that your motivation for studying graph theory is quite misguided. What "someone told you" relies on the assumption that since neural networks can be modeled as graphs, the mathematical theory of graphs must be important in neuroscience. There is a very limited amount of truth in that. It may be helpful to know about some basic concepts of graph theory when studying neuroscience but for the most part, the questions studied in a typical graph theory textbook would be entirely irrelevant for the serious study of system neuroscience or related disciplines. There may be some very specific approaches to neuroscience that rely more heavily on the mathematics of graphs than others, but until you get very deep into the subject you're unlikely to benefit materially from this sort of abstract math. Don't get me wrong - graph theory is fun to learn and very enriching intellectually. I'm not one to stop anyone from reading and solving problems in Diestel's or Bollobas' textbooks. But I'd caution anyone against diving into that just because someone told them it's useful for neuroscience.    Embed Quote
