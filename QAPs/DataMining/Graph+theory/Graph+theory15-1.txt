★What are some recent advances in graph theory?I took a grad course in graph theory, but the results I use from graph theory (spectral and random) are over 50 years old. I am wondering what's new out there and what are the big recent breakthroughs.
Here's some good stuff from Spielman and Teng. Essentially, solving for x in a linear system of equations Lx = b where L is a Laplacian of a graph can be approximated in time linear to the number of edges of the graph! There's a ton of mathematical machinery necessary to make this happen, and over the last decade Spielman and Teng (and many others) have developed it extensively. http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/Research/topicList.html    Embed Quote
