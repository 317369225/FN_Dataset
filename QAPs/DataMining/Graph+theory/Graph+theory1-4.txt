★What is your favourite graph theory problem?
One of my favorite graph theory problems is a problem on increasing paths in edge ordered graphs. Here's the problem: Suppose you assign distinct numbers from to each edge of a complete graph on vertices, prove that there is always an increasing path of length at least . i.e. a path were all the labels form an increasing sequence. The proof is also as sleek as the problem itself. Here's the argument. Imagine you have pedestrians standing on each vertex, now call out the edges in increasing order from to . Each time you call out an edge, the pedestrian currently on the two vertices of that edge swap places. After calling out all edges, the pedestrians will have moved a total of times. By the piegonhole principle, there is a pedestrian who has moved times. In fact, this tells us something even stronger, it says that if you label the edges of any graph with distinct integers, there is always an increasing path of length A more formal proof is given in this paper by Ronald Graham et. al. here. Also, the above proof is due to P. Wilker    Embed Quote
