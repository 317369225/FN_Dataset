★What are some interesting results in graph theory?
In any cluster of people, at least two people have the same number of friends. Friends can be represented by edges of a graph (these edges are not directed). The people in a cluster can be represented by the vertices of the graph and the number of friends of a person is then denoted by the degree of the vertex. (The degree of a vertex is the number of edges which touch the vertex.) Now, let's assume that the degrees of the vertices are distinct. The possible degrees of a vertex are 0,1,...,n-1 for a graph with n vertices. This means that there are only n distinct degrees possible for a vertex. Therefore, it implies that if the degrees of the vertices are distinct, then one of the vertices has 0 as its degree and another has n-1 as its degree. But if a vertex has 0 as its degree, it means that it is not connected to any other vertex.This means that no other vertex can have n-1 as its degree (as it can be connected to only at most n-2 vertices). So we can infer that at least two vertices have the same degree and so in a cluster of people, at least two people have the same number of friends.    Embed Quote
