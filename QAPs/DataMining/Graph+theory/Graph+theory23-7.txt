★Graph Theory: What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search?
I am going to differentiate them on the basis of their applications. Using a bfs it is easy to find the shortest path from a given node to any other node..that is it forms the basis for shortest path algo.. While dfs can easily verify the different properties of a graph..if u now what does a back edge,forward edge,cross edge means,u will noe what i mean.. Basically both visits the graph..when to use which search basically depends on question..for example if we want to prove whether a graph is singly connected or not a dfs search does it easily..while as i said before if we want to know the shortest distance a bfs search does it easily.    Embed Quote
