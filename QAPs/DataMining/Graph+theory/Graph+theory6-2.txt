★What are the applications of graph theory?
Integrated circuit design, in a surprising number of different ways: In calculating whether a digital circuit can run at a given clock frequency, a process known as static timing analysis. This is modeled as a longest path problem. In estimating the lengths of wires. This is an NP complete problem called a minimum rectilinear Steiner tree, which starts from a regular minimum spanning tree In standard cell placement, where the goal is to minimize the total wire length or some function of it, the circuit may be modeled as a hypergraph and various techniques such as minimum cost cuts may be applied. In Spice and related analog simulators, networks of transistors, resistances and capacitances are modeled as graphs. I'm not familiar enough with this area to know what the algorithms applied are - they may be more numerical. Routing signals through pre-defined networks (eg. in FPGAs) may use breadth first or A* routing or even more complex search heuristics. There are probably more I've forgotten. Circuits lend themselves well to graph models.    Embed Quote
