★Graph Theory: What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search?
DFS as name suggests is depth first search, will start it's searching from the root node. For each node it search till the leaf of that node and mark all the visited node as true. To do this it uses stack. Once the leaf node is encountered it starts popping out the elements. In case of BFS it start it's search from level. In other words it is also called as level order traversal. Again here also we use a array of visited node to keep track whether the node is visited. Once we start traversal we push all the connected node from the root to queue and start our traversal. Now coming to second point of delayed checking in DFS, it is called so because in case of DFS first we push the encountering nodes until we get a leaf node. Once we get leaf we start popping out and check for its state whether it is visited or not.    Embed Quote
