★Why are there so many seemingly basic unresolved problems in graph theory?Perhaps even moreso than number theory, there are numerous statements in graph theory that are extremely intuitive to formulate and simple to explain to someone with limited mathematical background, but which are thought to be very difficult to prove. What is the reason for this?
There do seem to be a lot of unsolved problems in graph theory.  Here are a few lists of them: Wiki List of unsolved problems in mathematics S.C. Locke's page of Unsolved Problems Open Problem Garden graph theory problems Douglas B. West's page of Problems in Graph Theory and Combinatorics Fan Chung's article Open problems of Paul Erdös in graph theory I don't know why there are so many, but here are some possibilities Graph theory is relatively young. Nearly all of it was developed in the last 100 years, and most of it in the last 50. It encompasses all models of single binary predicates (or binary relations).  That's very general.  You can interpret a predicate like "x influences y" as a graph whose vertices are all the x's and y's under consideration, and a directed edge whenever x influences y.  A lot of theories boil down to single binary predicates.  That means that graph theory has applications galore, and the natures of different graphs are limitless. Because we can draw them—small ones anyway—we can understand them a way that we can't understand most abstract algebraic structures.  That may help us form more conjectures about them.    Embed Quote
