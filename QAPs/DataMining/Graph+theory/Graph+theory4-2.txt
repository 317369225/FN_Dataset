★What are the most ingenious theorems/deductions in graph theory?
Two results originally proposed by Leonhard Euler are quite interesting and fundamental to graph theory: Seven Bridges of Königsberg Euler Characteristic (V - E + F = 2) Euler's Seven Bridges of Königsberg solution is one of the first celebrated graph theory problems and is said to have laid the foundation for 19th and 20th century topology. Euler proved that it was not possible to walk through the city of Königsberg (show below) and cross each of its 7 bridges exactly once. Euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass is irrelevant. The only important feature of a route is the sequence of bridges crossed. This allowed him to reformulate the problem as the graph below. Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge, one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In other words, during any walk in the graph, the number of times one enters a non-terminal vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. Now, if every bridge is traversed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except possibly for the ones chosen for the start and finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass is even. However, all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an odd number of bridges - so it is not possible to traverse all bridge exactly once. It was later proved that if a graph has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree, then an "Euler walk" of the graph exists. For convex polyhedra and planar graphs, it holds that V - E + F = 2 where: V is the number of vertices E is the number of edges F is the number of facesThe Euler characteristic is fundamental to proving that there are precisely 5 platonic solids (all edges, vertices and angles are congruent) - namely, tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, isocahedron.
