★Graph Theory: What is the most efficient algorithm for finding the center of a tree?For exact definition of a centre of a tree, please refer this:  Eccentricity, Center, Radius, Diameter . Currently I have a simple algorithm: "Remove all the leaves of the tree ,and update to get new leaves,  until there remains only 1 or 2 vertices." , This can be easily implemented in , using balanced binary search trees. Also,will it be simply the middle node of a diameter of the tree ?
The centre of a tree is simply the middle vertex/vertices of the diameter of the tree. Let u-v be a diameter of a tree. If d{u,v} is even, there is one middle vertex on the diameter. Let it be w. d{u,w}=d{v,w}=d{u,v}/2. We can prove that this is e(w), the eccentricity of w. We will do this by contradiction. Suppose that there existed some z such that d{w,z}>d{u,w}. Obviously, such a z cannot lie on the diameter. But that would mean that max(d{u,z},d{v,z})=e(w)+d{w,z}>d{u,v}, contradicting the fact that u-v is the diameter. It is easy to see that any other vertex on the diameter will have a higher eccentricity. Any non-diameter vertex will have a higher eccentricity than the vertex closest to it on the diameter. Thus e(w) is lower than the eccentricity of any other vertex and thus, w is the unique centre. On the other hand, if d{u,v} is odd, there will be two middle vertices on the diameter. Let those be w and w'. Then using a similar argument as earlier to prove that there is no other vertex further from w or w' than the furthest vertex on the diameter, we can find that e(w)=e(w')=(1+d{u,v})/2. Also, any non-diameter edge will have higher eccentricity than the vertex closest to it on the diameter, and thus w and w' are the only vertices in the centre. Thus we have proved that the middle vertex/vertices of the diameter form the centre of the tree. Incidentally, this also proves that even though a tree might have multiple diameters, they all share the same middle vertex/vertices. Since the the diameter of a tree can be found in O(N), the centre can be found in O(N) as well.    Embed Quote
