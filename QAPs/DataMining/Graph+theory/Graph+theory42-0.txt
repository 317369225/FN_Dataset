★Is there a generic approach to proofs in graph theory?I am currently taking a Graph Theory course at my high school. The material is very much centered around mathematical proofs. However, I have virtually no experience in "higher-mathematics" and, consequently, I struggle to understand when to utilize specific approaches. Is there a strategy that I should look into in order to improve my understanding?
Proof writing is very much an art and not a science, and your first class in it is generally not going to be pleasant.  That said, you can develop a good intuition for what sort of techniques are likely to work in a given situation with enough practice.  Read and write more proofs, and you'll get better at it.    Embed Quote
