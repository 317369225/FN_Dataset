★What texts are a good introduction to graph theory?At different levels please! I'm looking for the good texts.
If you want a sound mathematical introduction, go for Reinhard Diestel's book …"Graph Theory". There is also an e-book edition available at http://diestel-graph-theory.com/... , for only 5€.   I've seen quite some introductory texts on graph theory and discrete mathematics, each of which has its own merits, but this is my personal favorite. I have to add, though, that I've left academic graph theory ten years ago, so I cant't compare this one to the more recent publications.    Embed Quote
