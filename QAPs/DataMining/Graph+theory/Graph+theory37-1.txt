★What machine learning problems can be solved using graph theory/algorithms?
There are a few well-known ones. Using the Min-Cut algorithm If you are trying to divide sets of data into groups in a situation where you have pairwise distances between them, then you can use the min-cut algorithm to try to find the "best" subdivision. (Picture from a great presentation on the applications of min-cut to clustering here: http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev...). The most obvious application is data clustering; but Blum and Chawla (http://www.cs.uic.edu/~xkong/icd...) have applied it to semi-supervised and supervised learning tasks as well. Graph Classification There are some learning problems where the observation language is a graph (e.g. drug classification -- a drug molecule is really a graph with labelled edges, for instance). This field of research was less popular for most of the 90s and 2000s, but with the resurgence of social graphs and patterns, there's something of a resurgence (e.g. http://www.cs.uic.edu/~xkong/icd... -- using a GPU to help with the search). It was, however, also explored previously, and one of the key problems there is subgraph isomorphism; i.e. trying to identify subparts of graphs that are identical. Like many good problems, it is NP-Complete.    Embed Quote
