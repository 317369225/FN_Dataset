★What is your favourite graph theory problem?
My favorite one is NWERC 2007 Problem B: March of the Penguins We are given the coordinates x,y of N (<= 100) ice floes and the number of penguins (<= 10) standing initially on them. A penguin can jump from one ice floe to another if the distance is no larger than a given D. However, the ice is melting and so each ice floe has a limit on the number of times (<= 200) the penguins can jump off. Landing on an ice floe does not damage it. Given these restrictions, we want to know all floes where all penguins can meet. It's not very hard but I enjoyed solving it very much!    Embed Quote
