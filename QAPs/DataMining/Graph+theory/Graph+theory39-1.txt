★Graph Theory: What are the best online courses on networks?I am reading "Networks: An Introduction" by M. Newman (Networks: An Introduction: Mark Newman: 9780199206650: Amazon.com: Books)  and I found it particularly good and I am wondering if there is an online course that covers the topic presented in the book. I tried searching but I didn't find much
This is not a final answer but I found this  - CS798: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Networking  -  There is a book related to this course which in my opinion  is  very good. Other resources are available here - Mathematical Foundations of Computer Networking . The only problem with this is that i covers only the math behind computer networking but with a little bit of abstraction it can be used for other type of networks.    Embed Quote
