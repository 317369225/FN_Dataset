★What are the more interesting applications of graph theory in scheduling problems?I'm looking for interesting insights that viewing schedules as graphs might provide. For example, an old one might be the Critical Path Method. But there are probably other, newer insights that can be drawn by laying schedules as a graph with precedence and constraints as directed and undirected edges.
Graph coloring - which can capture various scheduling problems such as airline scheduling, bandwidth allocation, etc. Take a look at the wikipedia page for more information -  Graph coloring    Embed Quote
