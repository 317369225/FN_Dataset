★Graph Theory: What is the difference between depth-first-search and breadth-first-search?
I think in the case of DFS,you start with a node and visit one of its unvisited neighbours and proceed with that till you find no neighbours. That is,you push everything into the stack without any check(mark).And if there is no neighbor ,you stop and pop the top of the stack,now you mark it(Or the other way check it).So,as soon as the vertex is checked,it is popped from the stack(no sooner). But in the case of BFS,you start with a node,check it(mark it) and then push all it's unvisited neighbours. DFS: Check(mark) only after pop. BFS: Check at first. I think this is what meant over there.Feel free to correct me if i'm wrong.    Embed Quote
