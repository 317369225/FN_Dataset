★What are some applications of graph theory in social network analysis?
By creating a mathematical model of a social network, we can calculate the betweenness centrality of each individual node and estimate which node might influence the social network more than the rest of them. We can even calculate the shortest path for reaching node B from node A. These kind of parameters are used in finding key targets in terrorist organizations, calculating social score of a person (e.g. Klout ), etc. We can find out clusters among the social network and draw inferences regarding location or psychology. One study of high school students' social network indicated clusters based on ethnicity, color, etc.    Embed Quote
