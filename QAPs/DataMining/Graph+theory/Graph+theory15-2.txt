★What are some recent advances in graph theory?I took a grad course in graph theory, but the results I use from graph theory (spectral and random) are over 50 years old. I am wondering what's new out there and what are the big recent breakthroughs.
I would preface this by saying that everyone will have a different take on what is important/interesting. For my part, at the end of my first courses in Graph Theory I felt like I'd seen just a handful of things: 1 - Kurotowski 2 - Cayley Graphs 3 - A Definition of Graph Homomorphisms that seemed never to be used again. In short, I walked away wondering why people would have cared about any of it. It seemed like mathematical machinery was introduced and then we switched to, for lack of a better word, "games." Colourings, widgets, calculation complexity, etc. etc. At the beginning of my grad years, Robertson and Seymour finished up a long-ago started project (c. 1984) which was the generalization of Kuotowski (in extreme brevity): To each genus (2-manifolds) there is a finite list of graphs which are unimbeddable. To me, this is a significant and meaningful theorem. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R...    Embed Quote
