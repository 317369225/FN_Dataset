★Are there any applications of Graph Theory in cryptography?abstract
Yes, there are applications of graph theory, specifically expander and Cayley graphs, for hash functions, stream ciphers, proofs of security, and cryptanalysis. Some examples: "Cryptography and Graph Theory" http://www.win.tue.nl/diamant/sy... "Cryptographic Hash Functions from Expander Graphs" http://research.microsoft.com/en...
