★How can graph theory be applied to neuroscience?I'm a high school student learning graph theory for a program at UC Davis, and it was mentioned that it can be applied to neuroscience. Since neuroscience is a field I am considering pursuing, I was wondering where exactly the relationship is.
Well, neural networks are an extremely simplified model of the brain, where nodes represent neurons and weighted graph edges represent neural synapses of varying strengths.  For example, a feedforward neural network is an example of a weighted, directed acyclic graph (i.e. a weighted DAG).  So, that's one thing your teacher might be thinking about.    Embed Quote
