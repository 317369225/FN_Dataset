★What is a good way to learn coding that involves graph theory from scratch?starting from BFS,DFS and similar things.
Buy a hard copy of Dasgupta's algorithms text. Religiously and slowly read through it understanding everything. Incorporate the concepts into a project, modifying your code as you learn a better way to do something. In doing this you are remembering the layers of learning you put yourself through, and the successively better implementations. Focus on the graph theory portions of the book if that is solely what you are interested in learning. Here is a free online copy of the Book.    Embed Quote
