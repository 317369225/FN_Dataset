★What is your favourite graph theory problem?
In a connected graph which has a cycle we have the following (easy to prove) relation between the diameter d and the girth (length of shortest cycle) g: It's a natural question to ask, for which graphs do we have an equality? Turns out such graphs are highly regular and have been almost completely classified. It's a good exercise to try and proof that for such a graph every vertex has the same number of neighours. A similar problem for bipartite graphs would be to look at those graphs which have g = 2d, since such graphs do not have any odd cycle. Those graphs are even more interesting and have a nice geometrical interpretation. They are called Generalized polygons. In fact, they are useful to study some of the Sporadic groups!    Embed Quote
