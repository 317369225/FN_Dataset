★What texts are a good introduction to graph theory?At different levels please! I'm looking for the good texts.
There's many books but it really depends on what your doing.  If you have no knowledge of graph theory then I think `social network analysis for startups` would be very helpful as the examples are pretty interesting and its taught in python(using networkx for graphs). On the more challenging side, there's `probabilistic graphical models`(which is also a course online at standford). Another option to get a introduction is to look at packages like networkx(or anything depending on your language of choice) and do some tutorials.  The tutorials won't give you a deep understanding but they'll give you a very high level idea what is possible and may make reading books and papers a bit more easier.    Embed Quote
