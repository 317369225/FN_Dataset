★What are the best resources to learn about graph theory?Introductory material with an aim of understanding structure of social networks.
I'm a fan of the course material from CS 103X at Stanford: http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs... The course isn't taught anymore, but Professor Koltun's lecture notes are a great introduction to combinatorics and graph theory, if you can handle the occasionally dry level of rigor and see the intuition through his notation. (His presentation and style won't appeal to everyone, but it's worth giving it a chance; you'll learn quickly if his writing is right for you.) Check out chapters 14-17 for a good primer on graph theory. Chapters 9-12 are also worth a look if you're rusty on basic combinatorics. Problem sets 6 and 7, also found on the course page, will push your intuition and proof skills. Give them a shot when you're ready to take the next step.    Embed Quote
