★Is there a generic approach to proofs in graph theory?I am currently taking a Graph Theory course at my high school. The material is very much centered around mathematical proofs. However, I have virtually no experience in "higher-mathematics" and, consequently, I struggle to understand when to utilize specific approaches. Is there a strategy that I should look into in order to improve my understanding?
No, there is no general approach. Proving mathematical statements is a creative process and requires invention. On the other hand you can learn a lot of tricks which often help. I suggest you to read Proofs from the Book (Aigner, Ziegler) to get a general grasp of proofs. For graph theory I think Graph Theory by Diestel is very good. BTW you're very lucky to have a graph theory course at a high school.    Embed Quote
