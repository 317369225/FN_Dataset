★How is graph theory used in systems biology?
While the work shown in Feizi et al.'s paper is certainly beautiful in its supposed simplicity, there are problems with this approach, as outlined in detail in Lior Pachter's series of blog posts, The network nonsense of Manolis Kellis [his title, not mine - I need to read more in-depth to be able to critique the work of Kellis nor Pachter]. That said, the repository of knowledge-bases with entity relationships at all levels of biology is always growing, and I think the challenge now is in integrating these different graphs. For example, StringDB has protein-protein networks, but how does this relate to the regulatory net defined by ENCODE? What is going to be our model system to validate these network claims, and more so, how do we validate these claims? And as pointed out by Sam Sinai, at what level of detail do our models begin to represent the actual biology, and how far can we take it? Definitely an exciting approach to keep a pulse on.    Embed Quote
