★Is there a website dedicated to learning Graph Theory?Wiki: Think Complexity Graph Theory Lessons
I am not an expert and I generally learn from books. However there is a book called Think Complexity that covers many problems in graph theory in a hands-on way. It is available for free download from: http://www.greenteapress.com/com... The lab of Albert Laszlo-Barabasi has links to books, publications and courses, but they are real world courses. His book Linked is a great place to start, as is the paper Statistical Mechanics of Complex Networks, which you should be able to Google. I also found Duncan Watts book Small Worlds very useful and he defines many basic statistics of interest. I'm sorry that's really all I know on the topic. If you find more/better resources I hope you'll consider an answer wiki to help out others. Good luck.    Embed Quote
