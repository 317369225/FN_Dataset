★What are some recent advances in graph theory?I took a grad course in graph theory, but the results I use from graph theory (spectral and random) are over 50 years old. I am wondering what's new out there and what are the big recent breakthroughs.
A almost linear time algorithm for approximate maximum flow in undirected graphs     ([1304.2338] An Almost-Linear-Time Algorithm for Approximate Max Flow in Undirected Graphs, and its Multicommodity Generalizations)   This work by Kelner, Orecchia ,et al. gives a O(m^1+o(1) (error)^-2) time algorithm for approximate maximum flow. The core of this algorithm uses a collection technique from spectral graph theory and optimization. This work uses lots of tools which could be of independent interest. It describes an efficient method for oblivious routing. Also, the results for max flow is extended to the multicommodity flow generalization. This work also gives an alternative approach to graph sparsification. And more importantly, it gives a sparsification method where the flow in the sparsified graph can be mapped back onto the original graph.    Embed Quote
