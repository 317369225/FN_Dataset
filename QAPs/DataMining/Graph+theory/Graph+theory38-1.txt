★What is the difference between graph theory and network theory?According to Wikipedia, network theory is a subset of graph theory, but it's not clear to me how that is exactly.
The answer is in the question. A graph is hypothetical structure that does not exist in the real world. Any real world data representation may be reduced to a graph, but it is NOT a graph. A network topology can be first reduced to a graph and then algorithms like Dijkstra's and Kruskal's can be applied to it for various purposes like routing. All real world situations are subsets of graph problems (of that domain). Most problems of networking, especially those concerning routing reduce to a graph based problem. You will never find a graph in real world scenario. But you will find its subsets or derivatives in practical applications.    Embed Quote
