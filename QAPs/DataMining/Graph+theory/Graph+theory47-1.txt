★What is a good way to learn coding that involves graph theory from scratch?starting from BFS,DFS and similar things.
If you are trying to learn from scratch i will suggest the following steps 1. Learn how to represent a graph There are few standard methods for representing graphs , every method has its own merits. There are situations in which one is much more effective then the others. 2. Pick a language and start implementing basic graph features Choose a language according to ur interest/use and implement basic graph features like connectivity etc. 3. Learn and implement most basic graph algorithms i.e. BFS and DFS. 4. Learn and implement graph algorithms like Floyd warshal , Dijkstra etc 5. Start doing questions from Topcoder http://community.topcoder.com/tc... By this time you will be at a very good level 6. Start going for advanced graph algorithms  like bipartite matching etc.    Embed Quote
