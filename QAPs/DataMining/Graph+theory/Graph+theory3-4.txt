★What are some of the great projects implemented using the concepts of Graph Theory?Real Life Products or Projects that involve the usage of graphs for  implementing them.
USB audio devices can be pretty complex. The result is some standard structures to make them easier to configure and use. But the standard structures aren't required. The electronic configuration information available can be used to construct a directed graph, possibly cyclic, that represents the audio paths through the device. To play audio out the speaker output the software finds an acyclic path from the computer-side data source to the speaker connector. It then sets all the mixers, switches, mutes, and volume controls to "on" for that path and everything not on the path to "off". Then it plays audio through it.    Embed Quote
