★What are some interesting results in graph theory?
Let be a graph representing friendships. is the set of people and is the set of edges which represents friendships. So, the tuple belongs to iff and are friends. Please note that friendships are undirected. Now, the interesting fact is, for any person having at least two friends, there will be at least two friends both of whom have the SAME NUMBER OF MUTUAL FRIENDS with A. i.e. there exists friends of such that if and have mutual friends then and also have mutual friends. The proof is very interesting. Let have friends. Then, the number of mutual friends between and friend is from the set . However, an interesting observation is that if any friend has mutual friends, then no friend can have mutual friends with and vice-versa. So, number of mutual friends can actually be from the set or . But since we have friends, and the number of possible distinct values of mutual friends is , by pigeonhole principal, at least two friends of will have to have the same number mutual friends with .    Embed Quote
