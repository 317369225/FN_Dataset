★What are the most ingenious theorems/deductions in graph theory?
I'm partial to Ramsey's Theorem which states that given a set of colors, there exists a sufficiently large complete graph which has at least one monochromatic complete subgraph (i.e., a complete subgraph whose edges are all the same color). For two colors (say, red and blue) Ramsey's Theorem says that for any pair of integers there exists an integer such that the complete graph on vertices has either a complete subgraph of size r with all red edges, or a complete subgraph of size s with all blue edges. For example, .  This means that no matter how you color the edges of this graph with red and blue you'll either have a red triangle or a blue triangle.  Think about that for a second: it's not that a red or blue triangle is likely to exist, or even that there's a vanishingly small probability that it doesn't exist, it's that it must necessarily exist. Applying this to social networks, it means that in any group of 6 people there are 3 people who are all either mutual friends or mutual strangers. Ramsey's theorem is also true for infinite graphs. Ramsey numbers are notoriously hard to pin down.  For example, we only know that Erdös thought that we'd never know the exact value of , stating Suppose aliens invade the earth and threaten to obliterate it in a year's time unless human beings can find the Ramsey number for red five and blue five. We could marshal the world's best minds and fastest computers, and within a year we could probably calculate the value. If the aliens demanded the Ramsey number for red six and blue six, however, we would have no choice but to launch a preemptive attack.    Embed Quote
