★What texts are a good introduction to graph theory?At different levels please! I'm looking for the good texts.
What mathematical background do you have? Studying Graph Theory doesn't have any specific prerequisites really (though there are areas which require some understanding of linear algebra and probability), but it does require a certain level of mathematical maturity; the amount of which you have will determine what kind of text is right for you. I often hear people say that they find books a more difficult or time-consuming way to learn a topic from scratch, rather than, say, a set of decent lecture notes. At any rate, I'd highly recommend both of the following: Typed notes from a 24 lecture course given by Professor Imre Leader at The University of Cambridge in 2007: http://tartarus.org/gareth/maths... with accompanying problem sets: http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study... (see 2007 for those most closely relevant to the notes) Modern Graph Theory by Bèla Bollobás: http://books.google.co.uk/books/... The notes are considerably less formal than the book, and (as to be expected) the book is substantially more extensive. The book is also difficult (notice that it's designed to be a Graduate Text) - it has lots and lots of problems, many of them hard (solving problems is fundamental to a good understanding of Graph Theory). I have no experience with any other texts - everything I know about Graph Theory is contained within these two sources - but I think they're both good. Depending on your level, I'd recommend using the notes to become used to definitions, concepts, methods etc, and supplement this with the examples, explanations and problems in the book.    Embed Quote
