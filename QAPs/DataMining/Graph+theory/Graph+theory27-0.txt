★How does graph theory apply to Quora?
Quora still hasn't started recommending people one might wish to follow based on people and topics that one is following (like twitter does). This is clearly a place where the graph structure of people connections will come handy. Quora can use this graph to find community structure among people to recommend not just people but also topics. Information flow: One can study how the information flows in the network. At what rates different topics spread through the network? What topic posts have longer life times (first time visited to the last time visited)? How long does it take people to notice new topics?    Embed Quote
