★What is your favourite graph theory problem?
König's theorem : In a Bipartite Graph, Minimum Vertex Cover is equal to Maximum Bipartite Matching. Apart from its proof, I like it because we can use this idea in solving many interesting problems.  For example : City of Byteland can be described as a 2D grid of cells. Each cell may or may not contain a demon. You are given the list of cells that contain demons. In a single Kamehameha attack, Goku can kill all the demons stading in a row or in a column. But using Kamehameha drains Goku's power. You are to tell the minimum number of Kamehameha attacks that will be required by Goku to destroy all the demons. Problem source : Kamehameha    Embed Quote
