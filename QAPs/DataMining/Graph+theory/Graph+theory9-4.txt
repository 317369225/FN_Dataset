★What are some good books for self-studying graph theory?
If you're interested in just the basics, I used both Douglas West's Introduction to graph theory and John M. Harris, Hirst, and Mossinghoff's Combinatorics and Graph Theory. There are lots of branches even in Graph theory but these two books give an over view of the major ones. The problems in Combinatorics and Graph theory are a very easy to easy for the most part, where West's problems can sometimes be a test in patience and may not be the best for someone who has no experience proving concepts in graph theory. If you have access to a professor who specializes in graph theory considering talking to them about some of the more concentrated areas and see if any of the strike your fancy. Hope that helps.    Embed Quote
