★Is Applied Math 107 (Graph Theory and Combinatorics) worth taking at Harvard?Topics in combinatorial mathematics that find frequent application in computer science, engineering, and general applied mathematics. Specific topics taken from graph theory, enumeration techniques, optimization theory, combinatorial algorithms, and discrete probability
I took this class my freshman year with Prof. Valiant and later was a TF. I absolutely recommend this class for several reasons. (a) The topics AM 107 covers are very different and orthogonal to what you would learn by taking the regular sequence of math classes (analysis, algebra, topology) at Harvard. Graph coloring, generating functions, Hall's theorem, recursive methods, etc. are all interesting areas of math in themselves as well as helpful for any computer scientist. (b) The proofs in the class explore new ways of thinking that usually need less machinery than comparable classes in the math department. I took this class concurrently with math 25, and I remember math 25 proofs being a lot more rigid/formal than AM 107's. For a lot of the problems, 1 or 2 key insights would be enough to yield a decent solution. One concept I found really cool was the Probabilistic method. (c) Leslie Valiant is a genuinely nice Professor and down to earth. Despite being incredibly talented, he is willing to take his time to help you learn the concepts. The TFs are usually accommodating as well. The British accent and Turing award also doesn't hurt. (d) It's good training for brainteasers and mathematical puzzles. You probably should not take this class just for this benefit, but I have seen a fair share of brainteasers asked by quantitative hedge funds / tech companies where techniques from this class are directly applicable.    Embed Quote
