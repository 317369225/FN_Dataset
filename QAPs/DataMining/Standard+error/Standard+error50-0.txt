★Why is the standard error of the mean also called the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean, when the two values could be different?The former is calculated by population standard deviation / sqrt(n), whereas the latter is calculated by the variance in the sample distribution.
Q: What's the difference between a standard deviation and a standard error? A: Hard to say what the difference is, but the ratio is the square root of the sample size. By definition, the standard error of a statistic is its standard deviation (which, again by definition, is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution). The reason for having separate terminology is to reduce the risk of confusion with the population standard deviation. The statement "the latter is calculated by the variance in the sample distribution" is not correct. Specifically, let be independent random variables, with Let be their sample mean, which is the natural estimator for . Then the standard deviation of is . This is known as the standard error of the sample mean, to avoid confusion with the population standard deviation .    Embed Quote
