★I am using 3 features/independent variables in a multiple regression model trained on only 12 data points (times series).  My R^2 is high (97%+)/standard error low, but am I likely over-fitting my model given the few data points?How can I tell?
Since you're doing a time series, your data points are probably highly correlated and thus standard errors will be lower than they actually are. First, I would just recommend fitting a time series model (as simple as possible ARMA model) on your 12 data points. Then you can evaluate whether or not you will need the predictors. With only 12 data points you'll probably need some very strong evidence to justify inclusion of another predictor.    Embed Quote
