★How can I calculate the skewness of a distribution if I have the regression equation, R square and standard error?Here is the regression equation: Earnings = 696 + 9.6 * Age, R square = 0.023, SER = 624 Question - Given what you know about the distribution of earnings, do you think it is plausible that the distribution of errors in the regression is normal?
That is not sufficient information to calculate skewness. EDIT to reply to question details There is still not enough information. To assess the skewness of the residuals you need to look at all the residuals.  I would be surprised if the residuals were normal, but that is not proof or anything.    Embed Quote
