★In regression analysis, does it make sense to continue adding independent variables to predict a dependent variable so long as your adjusted R^2 improves and your standard error falls?Say you don't have a large enough sample to run meaningful cross-validation techniques.  Is your best bet for prediction to feed enough independent variables to maximize R^2 and minimize standard error?  Why or why not?
Neha Shitut, Analytics Trainer , Jigsaw Academy Modelling they say is an art, not just a science. A lot of the independent variables you introduce in the model need to make business sense where you can derive actionable insights because thats what the models are ultimately going to be used for. You need to decide how much of R-square and SE you can compromise on to call a model valid as well as robust. If you are running a OLS model, introduction of too many independent variables which are correlated may also lead you into problems of multicollinearity and such.    Embed Quote
