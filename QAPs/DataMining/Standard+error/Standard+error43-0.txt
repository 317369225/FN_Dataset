★If I booked a deluxe Las Vegas hotel room for the price of a standard room - an error on their website - should I expect them to honor the booking as is?
If you were dealing direct with the Hotel, on their own website and not with hotels . com or a site like that.  Then I would expect them to honor the deluxe room.  However it would depend on the terms and conditions on their website.  I'm sure they have a get out clause somewhere.  But in terms of customer service it make sense to honor your booking, esp since you have documentary proof.  I would say absolutely nothing about noticing the standard room was more expensive at the time of booking.  I would just say I had purchased a deluxe room and got a confirmation saying it was standard.  I would be polite, firm and adament that they honor the booking for the deluxe room. It would cost more for them to fight you on it, than it would to upgrade you.  Unless forty other people found the same bug and they have run out of deluxe rooms.    Embed Quote
