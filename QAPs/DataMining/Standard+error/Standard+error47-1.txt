★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
I can "color match" from memory.  Not sure if that throw pillow we are looking at in Macy's matches that shade of peach in your comforter set at home?  If I've seen it, I can tell you. This lame superpower does actually come in handy. I have never had to return a blouse, sweater, or pair of shoes because when I got home, it didn't match whatever I had bought it for perfectly. I thought everyone could do this, until a friend told me different.    Embed Quote
