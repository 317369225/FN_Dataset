★What are the interview questions on regression modeling?
All the questions posed in the responses are essential for any potential analyst to know. I'll add some more questions from my experience as an interviewee that I believe are just as important.  What are the conditions for Omitted Variable Bias and how does it affect the coefficient estimates? Why? What are some fixes for OVB? How do you interpret the coefficients in a log-log model? Why? What does the Gauss-Markov Theorem say and why is it important? How does heteroscedasticity affect the coefficient estimates and why? What are some fixes for heteroscedasticity? Given a regression setting with a binary response variable, what probability model should be used and why? What happens to the errors in the logistic regression function? Design a regression model to test the Law of Demand. Explain the Central Limit Theorem to a five year-old. (This one gave me the most trouble).    Embed Quote
