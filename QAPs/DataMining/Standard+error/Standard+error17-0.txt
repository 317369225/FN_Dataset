★How do I show the standard error of an estimated proportion is largest when p = 1/2?Show that the standard error of an estimated proportion is largest when p = 1/2.
You can do it with calculus, but there's a very simple intuition here.  Imagine a game where you're repeatedly flipping a coin, and you have to predict whether each flip will be heads or tails.  The worst case scenario is when the coin is perfectly fair, and in that case you're not going to get more than half your predictions right.  If the coin favors heads, you can do better than half just by calling heads every time, and similarly if the coin favors tails.  So in some sense the fair coin is the most unpredictable, and we would expect its standard error to be highest. Making this intuition rigorous is not easy, but it can be done.  If you need to know a proof, do the calculus and be done with it.    Embed Quote
