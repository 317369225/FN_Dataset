★How does one build a stronger predictive regression model?  Optimize for highest adj. R^2?  Lowest standard error?Why not keep adding variables that bumps up your adjusted R^2?  Or only add insofar as it reduces your standard error?  If your goal is maximum prediction power, how do you build the strongest regression model?  If you have a weak R^2, can adding other relatively weak R^2 independent variables/relationships contribute to an overall stronger R^2?  Any resources to learn more on this topic?
While I'd echo all the sentiment on cross validation, as that is the most effective way to evaluate your model, I'd keep in mind the adage: shit in, shit out. In terms of modeling, better data beats better algorithms. Feature engineering and large amounts of good, well cleaned data (the more the better) are far more important for predictive power than whatever specific model you use. To understand why, I'd highly recommend checking out Edwin Chen's answer to What are the advantages of different classification algorithms?
