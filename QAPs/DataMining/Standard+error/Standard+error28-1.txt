★How can I show a  standard error page instead of an SQL error when a MySQL query fails on  my site?PHP codebase. This is a follow-up question to How do I make users see a default error page whenever they type an invalid URL on my website?.
I started a developing a social site and i I set my self myself the goal of using object oriented programming all through as well as PDO ,the PDO. The way i I designed my architecture is to have a global application exception manager or controller that recieves receives the any exception that is thrown any where in the application. My db models generally throws throw a PDO exception which get re-throwned thrown by the respective models to the global application exception manager,. I do log this these errors for later viewing while returning friendly error message to the end user onuser. [codecode php] //The model sample code //An array of result data object $data=array(); try{     $model=new Namespace_Modelname_Model();     $model->doSomething();     return $data }catch(PDOException $e) {   throw new Global_App_Exception($e->getCode(),$e->getMessage());   return $data; } [/code]
