★What are the interview questions on regression modeling?
Some more: Why do the residuals from a linear regression add up to 0? Is this still true if you fit a regression without intercept? What's so bad about collinearity? We first regress on and , then regress on and , where . How are the coefficients in the two regressions related? We regress on categorical data . This is a large data set (that's right, big data!) but many of the rows of the design matrix are duplicated. We  can summarize the data by averaging for each unique row of the design matrix, and perform a weighted regression with each row of the design matrix weighted by its number of duplicates. This gives us a much smaller data set to work with. How do the regression coefficients and their standard errors compare to regression on the raw data?    Embed Quote
