★Why are we not using median at all times instead of mean?
Because the mean and median have different properties and sometimes we want the ones associated with the mean. For example, in large samples from a normal distribution, the median has a larger standard error.  For another, the mean is the expected value.  For a third, the mean is influenced by outliers and, while that is often a justification for using median, sometimes we want a measure that is influenced by outliers.    Embed Quote
