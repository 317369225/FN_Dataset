★Does any multi-level modeling software not ignore correlation among students within the same clusters in computing the standard errors of the impact estimates?
Yes,  but doesn't an issue arise when random assignment occurs at the  cluster-level, say level-2, but the analysis (and outcome variable) is  conducted at level-1?  Isn't the level-1 correlation of individuals  within the same level-2 cluster ignored in computing the standard error  of impact estimates? For  example, I am using HLM software, but after running the model, I have  to compute by hand an adjusted t-statistic and associated p value. This  corrected t-statistic (and degrees of freedom) are adjusted for  clustering based on sample size, number of clusters, and ICC.  I was  wondering if a different software package produced these values as well.    Embed Quote
