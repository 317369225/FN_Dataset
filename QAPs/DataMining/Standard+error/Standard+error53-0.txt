★Why is Carl Gauss revered so much by mathematicians?i often hear many mathematicians widely consider him the greatest mathematician or one of the greatest... (archimedes, newton gauss) is the usual common answer it seems... i hear he was extraordinary brilliant, what did he do in the field of math to essentially get this legacy?
If you just look at the number of concepts named after Gauss (e.g., Gauss's law, Gaussian distribution and Gaussian integrals, Gaussian elimination, Gaussian integer, the Gaussian plane (of complex numbers), Gaussian integers, just to name a select few) it should tell you that even today, Gauss's work has significant influence in both mathematics and physics. So keep in mind that every time a statistician speaks of a standard error, a physicist calculates the strength of a force field, an engineer deals with alternating current using complex numbers, or a programmer writes code to solve a set of linear equations, they are likely relying, at least in part, on work performed by Gauss some two centuries ago.    Embed Quote
