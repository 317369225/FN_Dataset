★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
I can fall asleep anywhere. I have fallen asleep on bicycle rickshaws, on motorbikes and while standing up. As a result I can't drive at night. I can make anywhere look like home (the kind of place you feel happy to come home to at the end of a long day) if you give me a day. I've successfully tested this in mud huts Africa.    Embed Quote
