★Why is Carl Gauss revered so much by mathematicians?i often hear many mathematicians widely consider him the greatest mathematician or one of the greatest... (archimedes, newton gauss) is the usual common answer it seems... i hear he was extraordinary brilliant, what did he do in the field of math to essentially get this legacy?
Carl Friedrich Gauss was responsible for an enormous amount of mathematical developments in his very long career. For instance, he invented the Gaussian distribution and Gaussian elimination at the same time, to do Least squares estimation. (Though there is some question as to whether he reinvented it or nicked it from others, possibly Legendre and Robert Adrain.) Here's a List of things named after Carl Friedrich Gauss.    Embed Quote
