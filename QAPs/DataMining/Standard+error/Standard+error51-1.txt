★Why are we not using median at all times instead of mean?
When looking at a process with an asymmetric payoff, the median is not particularly useful. Rather we are interested in the average, i.e. the expected value. Poker, marketing and finance are full of examples where you want to compute the expected value and not the median. For example, let's say 90% of call options for a certain stock expire worthless. 5% will yield a $500 payout, and 5% will yield a $1000 payout. This is a case where an investor is interested in the expected value. The median option payout is zero. The expected value of an option, chosen at random, is .05*500 + .05*1000 = $75. If we can buy the option for less than $75, it's worthwhile. Nassim Nicholas Taleb has written extensively about this subject in Fooled By Randomness.
