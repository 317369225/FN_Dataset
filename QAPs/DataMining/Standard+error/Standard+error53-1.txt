★Why is Carl Gauss revered so much by mathematicians?i often hear many mathematicians widely consider him the greatest mathematician or one of the greatest... (archimedes, newton gauss) is the usual common answer it seems... i hear he was extraordinary brilliant, what did he do in the field of math to essentially get this legacy?
Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) was a German mathematician and physicist. He had a remarkable influence in many fields of mathematics and science and is ranked as one of history's most influential mathematicians. Why? Well, he was a child prodigy and published Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in 1798 when he was only 21. This publication established Number Theory as a coherent subject and it set a standard for theorem proving which is essentially still followed to this day. He also had influence across a very wide range of disciplines. At only 24 he managed to predict the position of the dwarf planet Ceres (which had been discovered three years earlier, but had been lost in the glare of the Sun). He is sufficiently recognised in the field of magnetism to have a unit named after him (although he has been outdone in the SI system by Tesla). He also has a whole List of things named after Carl Friedrich Gauss perhaps the most important of which is the Gaussian (or Normal) Distribution in statistics. Many (apocryphal?) anecdotes exist of Gauss' genius. The most well known perhaps is the task he was given to correct his misbehaviour at primary school: add up all the numbers from 1 to 100! It took the young Carl only seconds to come up with the answer, 5050, to the astonishment of his teacher and the teacher's assistant. And, perhaps, to your astonishment as well?    Embed Quote
