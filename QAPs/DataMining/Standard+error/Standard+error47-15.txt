★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
My lame super power is the ability to have awesome bowel movements. I've had this super power my entire life. The quality of a bowel movement can be graded using the following criteria: • Time Scale from 1-10. Lower numbers denote less time. • Effort Scale from 1-10. Lower numbers denote less effort. • Consistency Scale from 0-10. Lower numbers denote better consistency. Too hard or too soft the higher the number. The volume of toilet paper use is also a factor. If it is a perfecto and you get the pinch and pull precisely accurate, and use no TP, then it is possible to score a zero.  BUT, if you leave a stain on your undies, you get a disqualification and a dope slap. This hubris of this move has ruined many a good score and is not recommended. • Throw weight Scale from 1-10. Lower numbers denote larger volume. The total determines the quality of the movement. The max score would be a 3. To get a three means you didn't use any toilet paper AND you didn't stain your undies. That is, the consistency was such that TP wasn't necessary.

Consistency - 1 I have often thought of, but never have, waived the right to a wipe. Not too hard, not too soft, perfecto. Throw weight - 1 I have been known to throw down some monsters in my time. But they are usually medium-large. ... (more)Loading...
