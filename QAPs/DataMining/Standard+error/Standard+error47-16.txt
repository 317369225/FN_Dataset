★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
Every one of the hundreds of movies I've seen, I can recall which cinema I saw it at, which theater in the cinema, and where I sat. Which leads to Lame Superpower 1a: I can annoy my wife to no end. When we go to the movies and they tell us which theater the movie is in, I will recite every movie we've seen in this particular theater and where we sat until she threatens to gouge my eyes out with her car keys.    Embed Quote
