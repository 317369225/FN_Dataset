★I am using 3 features/independent variables in a multiple regression model trained on only 12 data points (times series).  My R^2 is high (97%+)/standard error low, but am I likely over-fitting my model given the few data points?How can I tell?
Plot your residuals in the order that they were observed.  If they look like "noise" (i.e. scattered around with no order).  If so, it starts to suggest that your errors are not correlated.  However, If they appear to have a "smooth" pattern, your errors are correlated.  This would mean that the typically standard errors are not trustworthy. There are other things to consider, but it looks like no one has yet proposed this diagnostic.    Embed Quote
