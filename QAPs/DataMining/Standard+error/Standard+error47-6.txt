★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
I am right handed. With my left hand I can write backwards with almost the same type of writing of my right hand. I have no idea how I do that. It's always fun at parties when there is fog on windows. My friends ask me to write anything with my left hand and they go on the other side of the window to read what I wrote. It is effortless. It feels so natural for me. In my naivety, I thought everyone could do this. Apparently, it is not so. I have met very few who could. Actually, I only know of one person that can do it too.    Embed Quote
