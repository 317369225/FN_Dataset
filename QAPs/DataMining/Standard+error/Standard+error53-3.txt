★Why is Carl Gauss revered so much by mathematicians?i often hear many mathematicians widely consider him the greatest mathematician or one of the greatest... (archimedes, newton gauss) is the usual common answer it seems... i hear he was extraordinary brilliant, what did he do in the field of math to essentially get this legacy?
When I was very young, my father taught me how to do sums to keep his books. My first year in the schoolhouse, the teacher was upset at the fact that the class wouldn't settle down, and asked the students to sum the numbers from 1 to 100. I had known from early on that even sums of natural numbers can be taken as a sum of pairs: And I used it right there in class to produce the sum 5050. My whole life was like that. Royalty took interest in me and saw to my private schooling. I became one of the most famous astronomers and practical mathematicians that ever lived, rising to a point where I only worked on problems that mattered most to me, holding true to my motto "few but ripe," meaning I only published the highest quality work. I published broadly in physics, linear algebra, algebra and astronomy. There are so many techniques named after me, it's hard to keep track. I had a huge family and a successful marriage, and died in old age, full of financial and personal success.    Embed Quote
