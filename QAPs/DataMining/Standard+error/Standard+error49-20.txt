★What is the best way to respond when someone tells you his/her IQ?I put this in humor because I'd like to see some funny/witty answers :)
Just say, "That's great" (assuming it was an impressively high number, because they probably wouldn't be telling it to you otherwise) and change the subject. Unless you really want to suck up to them. In that case ask them what their greatest strengths are, and try to look like you're paying attention while they go on and on about them. If you want to show them you know IQ means as much as the number of hairs on a dead goat's butt, ask for the details as Steve Allen suggests.    Embed Quote
