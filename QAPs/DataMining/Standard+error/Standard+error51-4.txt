★Why are we not using median at all times instead of mean?
The biggest compelling reason to use mean is because the math is a lot more simple for mean than it is for median.  Mean does not reflect reality: it gets pulled by outliers, distorting the picture; it cannot reflect the asymmetry of the distribution; it makes everything appear boringly the same.  Average patient's temperature in a hospital is 36.7 degrees Centigrade, but some are running fever and some others are in the morgue's freezer.  Comparing the means to make calls about mutual positioning of asymmetrical distributions is an extremely dangerous proposition, especially in healthcare.   The 4 quartiles give a much clearer - and frankly more intuitive - picture of the world than the 4 central moments.    Embed Quote
