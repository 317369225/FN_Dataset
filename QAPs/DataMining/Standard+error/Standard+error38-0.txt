★Two financial assets A and B. The expected return and standard error of A are: E[R] 25%, 10% and for B are: E[R] 8%, 2%. The correlation coeffecient between A and B is 0.5. Portfolio C is made up of A and B. What are the optimum weights of A and B that minimise the risk () of Portfolio C?
I used excel's solver, since I'm not the greatest at optimization mathematics. (see derivatives from other Gram's answer).I see that B is the less risky asset for return, since it has a higher sharpe ratio with 4 instead of 2.5 for A. The correlation is so high, that both will go down or up together 50% of the time (I hope I said that right). This is portfolio optimization, and the method does not really get interesting till you have multiple assets with different correlations. Then, you use a correlation method and you'll have unique weight changes with the multiple correlations.    Embed Quote
