★Why are we not using median at all times instead of mean?
One additional reason to consider is that, before the recent decades of affordable computing, minimisation based on L2-norms (squared distance) have been preferred over L1-norms (absolute deviation) for reasons of computational ease and the existence of closed-form solutions in the case of many distributions. Not to take away anything from the creativity of their respective inventors, this also explains why a few L1-norm based techniques (such as regularisation with Lasso in statistical learning, or the quantities being minimised in compressed sensing too) have only been practically possible in the era of pervasive computing power.    Embed Quote
