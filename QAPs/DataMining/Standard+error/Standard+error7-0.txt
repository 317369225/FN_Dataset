★How do we estimate a standard error from an MCMC sample?Suppose X1,..., Xn is a sample obtained from mcmc algorithm, which means that there is autocorrelation between them. So can we still use the ordinary sample variance to estimate population variance? Thanks!
Presuming that you have a large sample, and that the sampler has reached a stationary distribution, you compute any statistic of interest in the usual way. That is, you use the ordinary formula for the standard deviation. However, in computing confidence intervals, you must be careful not to presume that the samples you have drawn are independent. One way around this is to compute the effective sample size, and to use that in your calculation of variances and standard deviations, assuming you do wish to create a confidence interval, which of course is a frequentist approach. Instead, you can Google "highest density region", and follow the directions for calculating sample statistics from that.    Embed Quote
