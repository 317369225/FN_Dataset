★Statistics (academic discipline): What do statisticians think of the book "The Cult of Statistical Significance: How the Standard Error Costs Us Jobs, Justice, and Lives"?
Statisticians don't think about this book much at all. I've never even heard it mentioned, although I am in contact with many statisticians. That' s not to say that statisticians are not concerned with the limitation of statistical significance. All good statisticians, and good data analysts who do not identify as statisticians, understand that statistical significance does not equate to real-world importance. Statistical evidence is just that, evidence. Any individual significance test must be viewed in context of other available evidence (additional research) and complemented with measures of magnitude (effect size). Significance testing can be used badly, it's true. At least one journal (Taylor & Francis Online) has "banned" significance testing (hypothesis testing, inferential statistics), in favor of descriptive statistics. But descriptive statistics can also be used badly. The descriptive statistics that some investigators prefer is grounded in the same theory as the significance testing they spurn. Rather than reject significance tests, it would be better to return to fundamentals. Understand significance test for what they are, acknowledge their limitations and make the effort to view results in the context of all available research before drawing conclusions.    Embed Quote
