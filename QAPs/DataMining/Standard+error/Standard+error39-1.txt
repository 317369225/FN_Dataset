★What is the publishing industry standard acceptable error rate in proofreading/copy editing?How many typos, etc. per word?
The acceptance rate is zero. Having said that, even a very good copy-editor will make or not notice typos and other mistakes, so the standard rule is that at least three sets of eyes should examine a manuscript for mistakes at each stage of the editing process. Many publishers, on the other hand, have cut back on or even eliminated copy-editing positions as a cost-saving move, and may no longer have at least three layers of editorial oversight, especially for Internet publishing. This is why typos are currently epidemic. This does not mean that they are at all tolerated, however. It just means that there is an increasing and at times almost unbearable pressure on a single writer or editor to get things right the first time, and sometimes harsh penalties for making mistakes. For example, I know of one newsroom where the manager posts mistakes that reach print on a whiteboard with the name of the writer or editor responsible, and then docks their pay. This is an unhealthy atmosphere that breeds unrealistic expectations. It would be better to accept the fact that people are human, and provide more editorial oversight. In this atmosphere, if you are working as a freelance writer or copy-editor, it may be wise to assume that there are one or two mistakes in your manuscript that you were unable to find, and to have someone else quickly look over the manuscript before submission just to make sure that nothing was missed. Very few people are able to spot all of the mistakes in their own copy.    Embed Quote
