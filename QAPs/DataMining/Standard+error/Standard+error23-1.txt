★How can I calculate the skewness of a distribution if I have the regression equation, R square and standard error?Here is the regression equation: Earnings = 696 + 9.6 * Age, R square = 0.023, SER = 624 Question - Given what you know about the distribution of earnings, do you think it is plausible that the distribution of errors in the regression is normal?
You can't. The only information preserved about the distribution in those estimates and statistics are the mean and standard deviation (and only partially). You need at least three raw data points or residuals to estimate skewness.    Embed Quote
