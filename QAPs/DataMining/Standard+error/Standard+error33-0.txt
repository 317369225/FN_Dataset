★When trying to calculate the standard error of the mean, do you use n-1 or n?Apparently when calculating the standard deviation if you use the whole population you use n, and if it's a sample of that you use n-1. Is the same true when calculating the standard error or do you use just n regardless? I've tried searching this on google and it keeps telling me about the standard deviation.
The standard error of the mean is usually estimated by the sample standard deviation (the one with n-1 in the denominator) divided by the square root of n.    Embed Quote
