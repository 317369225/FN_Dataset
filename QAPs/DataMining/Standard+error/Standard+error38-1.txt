★Two financial assets A and B. The expected return and standard error of A are: E[R] 25%, 10% and for B are: E[R] 8%, 2%. The correlation coeffecient between A and B is 0.5. Portfolio C is made up of A and B. What are the optimum weights of A and B that minimise the risk () of Portfolio C?
Actually I don't understand the problem.  You have to assets  which are positively correlated, which means that if you lose/win with A,  the same thing in average will go for B.  But the risk of A is 5fold of risk of B.  Thus to minimize risk of C you have just to take 100% of B. This is clear even without math.   You have  . Taking your formula which seems sound to me we get: Thus     and you're looking for the minimum of this quadratic function for . Taking derivative you see for .  It means your function is growing. Therefore it reaches its minimal value at . So you should take only B, but it was  clear from the logical point of view anyway.  Maybe your task is not just to minimize risk but also reach some level of return?    Embed Quote
