★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
Best internal body clock in the world. I can wake up exactly at the time I'm supposed to, no matter how little sleep I have, without the aid of an alarm clock. This would even include non-routine times. I've never missed an early morning flight.    Embed Quote
