★How does one build a stronger predictive regression model?  Optimize for highest adj. R^2?  Lowest standard error?Why not keep adding variables that bumps up your adjusted R^2?  Or only add insofar as it reduces your standard error?  If your goal is maximum prediction power, how do you build the strongest regression model?  If you have a weak R^2, can adding other relatively weak R^2 independent variables/relationships contribute to an overall stronger R^2?  Any resources to learn more on this topic?
is a measure of your in-sample fit.  If you're building a predictive model, you presumably care about your out-of-sample fit, so why would you optimize ?  Instead you should use cross-validation to estimate the performance of your models. In general model-building is a huge topic.  The Wikipedia article on feature selection is a good place to start.    Embed Quote
