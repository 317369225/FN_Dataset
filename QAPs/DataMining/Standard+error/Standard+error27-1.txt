★I am using 3 features/independent variables in a multiple regression model trained on only 12 data points (times series).  My R^2 is high (97%+)/standard error low, but am I likely over-fitting my model given the few data points?How can I tell?
Throw away a couple of data points and see how much it changes the best fit. (parameter-wise). The more it changes - the higher is the general overfit. If you want more quantitative method - calculate the Jacobian of your regression model; this will not only show you the level of the overfit, but also the points and variables to which the overfit applies the most.    Embed Quote
