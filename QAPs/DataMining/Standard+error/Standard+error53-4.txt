★Why is Carl Gauss revered so much by mathematicians?i often hear many mathematicians widely consider him the greatest mathematician or one of the greatest... (archimedes, newton gauss) is the usual common answer it seems... i hear he was extraordinary brilliant, what did he do in the field of math to essentially get this legacy?
Gauss was one of the greatest scientific minds of all time. In mathematics, his contributions span number theory (quadratic reciprocity, theory of quadratic forms,...) analysis (fundamental theorem of algebra, Gauss' divergence formula, arithmetico-geometric mean, Gauss representation of the Gamma function,....), algebra (Gauss' lemma on factoring polynomials, ...) differential geometry (Gaussian curvature and the theorema egrerium),  foundations of geometry (discovery of the hyperbolic plane), numerical analysis (Gaussian elimination, method of least squares, Gaussian quadrature,...) astronomy, electromagnetism (Gauss's laws), electrical communication engineering (the first ammeters and the first telegraph). Any one of these contributions would make a man famous. The fact that all of them were made by the same person is truly astonishing.    Embed Quote
