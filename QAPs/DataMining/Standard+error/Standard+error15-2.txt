★In regression analysis, does it make sense to continue adding independent variables to predict a dependent variable so long as your adjusted R^2 improves and your standard error falls?Say you don't have a large enough sample to run meaningful cross-validation techniques.  Is your best bet for prediction to feed enough independent variables to maximize R^2 and minimize standard error?  Why or why not?
You'll overfit the regression if you do this without a separate training set. In a case like this -- without much data to go on -- you might simply have to rely on intuition in deciding which variables to include.    Embed Quote
