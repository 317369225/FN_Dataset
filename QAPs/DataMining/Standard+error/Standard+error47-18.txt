★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
I can throw up just by deciding to and then staring at the toilet for a bit. I know. That's not fun to think about. And no, I'm not bulimic. But it's true that I have this... "talent". Crazy strangers find me very approachable. One example was an old man at North Station in Boston who asked me if he could please kiss my feet a bit. Another was a woman who, out of nowhere, provided me with a list of online stuff she needed printed out and an address to send it all to. This sort of stuff happens to me almost constantly. I constantly run into people I know, even in unlikely areas at unlikely times. I could never publicly do anything I wouldn't want to get caught at, because I'm sure I'd suddenly run into an entire group of friends.    Embed Quote
