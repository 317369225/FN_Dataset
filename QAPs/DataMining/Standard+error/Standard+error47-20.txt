★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
I can hold an entire conversation on auto-pilot and convince someone trying to wake me up that I'm fully awake. When I actually wake up hours later, I have no recollection of the events and am in fact pissed that said person let me sleep in. It's like a split personality kind of thing. I can say horrible things, too, when my other self takes over. The bastard's hurting the ones I love.    Embed Quote
