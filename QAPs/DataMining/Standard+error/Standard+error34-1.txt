★When conducting an experiment, should I repeat measurements on one sample from a batch, measure multiple samples of a batch once or repeat measurements for multiple samples of a batch, in order to determine the mean, variance and standard error?
I am a practical person, so my approach would be first to measure one brick to the point of getting a great sample for the range of outcomes and any trends, like they are likely to be softer in the middle and harder in the corners. Let's say, you got 100 observations, and you know everything you would ever want to know about that brick. Then, measure the second brick with half observations to see if the variation pattern is the same. Proceed to reduce the number of observations until you are comfortable to make a conclusion about a brick from that minimum number of measurements - knowing where best to measure is going to be helpful here. Then, use that number, and maximize your total (inter-group) sample.    Embed Quote
