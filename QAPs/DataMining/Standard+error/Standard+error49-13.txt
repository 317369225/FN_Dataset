★What is the best way to respond when someone tells you his/her IQ?I put this in humor because I'd like to see some funny/witty answers :)
This happened to me once. A guy who I had just met (we lived in the same dorm) told me his IQ was 150. I replied that mine was 120. He didn't quite know what to say next.  I am glad that that was the entire conversation because some of my fellow dorm residents told me they had to really hold back their urge to slug him when he would engage them.    Embed Quote
