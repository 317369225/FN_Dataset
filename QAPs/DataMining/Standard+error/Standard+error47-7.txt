★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
I have superpowers at crane machines. Once I spent $10 in quarters and walked away 12 of the big stuffed toys from a single machine. A small crowd gathered as I played for an hour. When it was all done I gave most of them to some kids having a birthday party, kept a few as souvenirs and called it a day. I can tell if a machine is rigged on the first claw and if it is a good one I will usually walk away with at least three. When I usually pay about $4 for $36 worth of toys I call it a nice easy Christmas.    Embed Quote
