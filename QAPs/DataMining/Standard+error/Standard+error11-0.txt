★What is the difference between standard deviation, standard error, variance of a sample, variance of betas, and variance of a collection?of, let's say means, from many different samples and how standard error or deviation is related?
I'll start with standard deviation and error, though you should really be looking this up on Wikipedia. S.D. is variability inherent to a distribution.  For example, if you flip a coin, there is uncertainty in the outcome no matter how well you understand the coin. S.E. is error introduced by incomplete sampling.  Say you're trying to determine how loaded the coin is.  You might flip it a few times and estimate the loadedness as the fraction of heads you observed -- but you won't be certain, and your guess won't go to many decimal places.  As you flip more and more times and redo the calculation cumulatively, S.E. approaches zero.    Embed Quote
