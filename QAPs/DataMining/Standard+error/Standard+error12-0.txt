★How can one estimate the standard error of the mean in a sampling experiment ?
Hi Subramanian, This is not a problem that calls for the "standard error of the mean" -- there's no mean. You have samples of a Bernoulli process (an unfair coin), of which were successes (or heads -- or your species of interest). You're trying to express your confidence in the success probability of the underlying process (the heads probability of the coin) from the count of successful outcomes. Classically, the solution is a confidence interval for a "binomial proportion." The "best" such interval is called Blyth-Still-Casella and is complicated to calculate, but a simple approximate approach that generally works fine is called the Agresti-Coull interval: The middle of your interval, . The 95% confidence interval is (Approximate Is Better than "Exact" for Interval Estimation of Binomial Proportions, Alan Agresti and Brent A.
