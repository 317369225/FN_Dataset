★Why is Carl Gauss revered so much by mathematicians?i often hear many mathematicians widely consider him the greatest mathematician or one of the greatest... (archimedes, newton gauss) is the usual common answer it seems... i hear he was extraordinary brilliant, what did he do in the field of math to essentially get this legacy?
Together with Euler, Gauss invented basically all of mathematics. At least, the stuff that is used by engineers and physicists today. He was also instrumental in modernising mathematical notation. Gauss has a lot of mathematical stuff named after him, but it's worth remembering that a lot of mathematical stuff is named 'in honour' of a mathematician, rather than after the person who invented it. In fact, nearly everything that originated during Gauss's life that isn't named after Gauss was invented by Gauss and named after someone else.    Embed Quote
