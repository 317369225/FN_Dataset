★In standard mean variance optimization, how do you account for different standard errors in the predicted returns for different stocks?
Standard error of the predicted return is the (square root of the) variance of the return -- so that's already part of the mean variance optimization setup.  What is more difficult is the standard error of the variance -- for example, if the variance is 20% measured over 20 years, how should that be treated differently from when the variance is 20% measured over 1 year?  There are more advanced methods to deal with that but outside of the scope of standard mean variance optimization.    Embed Quote
