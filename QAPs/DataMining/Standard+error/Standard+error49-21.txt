★What is the best way to respond when someone tells you his/her IQ?I put this in humor because I'd like to see some funny/witty answers :)
Announcing your IQ is irrelevant contexts is a pretty dumb (and insecure) thing to do. And the funny thing is, people usually do this when their IQ is on the higher side. So 10 points off right there! A high IQ is like a shiny high-end gadget - you might posses it, but it's pretty useless if you're not doing anything with it. If you're using it then everyone can quite obviously see that and you won't have to announce to the world that you have it. Which is why I'd reply with "That sounds like a nice number, but what important national and global problems have you actually solved with it?"    Embed Quote
