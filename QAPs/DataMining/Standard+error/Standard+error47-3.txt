★What's your lame superpower?99.9% of the time a few seconds after meeting someone in person I can guess their age either spot on or within a year's difference. What is/are your lame superpower(s)?
My lame superpower is unconscious mimicking. During conversations, my brain subconsciously tries to relate. I end up in the same body positions, accidentally copying accents, and sometimes facial expressions. If they cross their arms, I may also do so. If they transition into an table-top elbowed lean, I may shortly follow. After I realized this was subconscious, I tried to catch myself. Sometimes when I notice, I force myself into another position, but then some kind of weird behavioral locking happens. They start coping me. The conversation continues normally but it's probably weird watching us from a third person. Ran into someone else that had the same super power once, we both ended up self-conscious and lost track of the original conversation while trying to not copy each other.
