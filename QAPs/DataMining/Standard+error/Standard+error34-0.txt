★When conducting an experiment, should I repeat measurements on one sample from a batch, measure multiple samples of a batch once or repeat measurements for multiple samples of a batch, in order to determine the mean, variance and standard error?
You should sample more extensively where you expect the most variability.  In all cases, you would expect to have the most variability at the highest level - i.e. at the sample level.  However, there are diminishing returns.  At a certain point, you want to account for subsampling (i.e. multiple measurements) error.  Note that subsampling goes by many names, including pseudoreplication, technical replication, or observational units. So the answer is repeat measurements for multiple samples of a batch or measure multiple samples. The exact number depends on the variability of each.  There are actually formulas to calculate this if you have an estimate of the variability of a batch and the variability within a batch.  (If I remember correctly, they're not hard to calculate, but I can't find an easily accessible version at the moment.)    Embed Quote
