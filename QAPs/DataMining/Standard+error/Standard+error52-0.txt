★When do you use standard error of the mean rather than the standard deviation?
Standard error represents the standard deviation of an estimator.  It should be used when you are making inferences or trying to describe your estimate. The standard deviation is a parameter of the population (not the sample). Make sure you understand the difference between a statistic and parameter; as well as sample and population.    Embed Quote
