★How is VC pattern recognition different (or not) from stereotyping?
I think the suggestion that it may add value is kind of absurd. I think it leads investors to miss opportunities rather than recognize them. I think the question is, do people actually recognize that they're doing it? The fact that you cite the "white male college dropout" (what, no hoodie?) suggests that you mean the phenomenon described here: Jeremy Lin, women in VC, and the bigotry of pattern matching. Which leads to stupid outcomes like this:  Billionaire's Failed Education Experiment Proves There's No Shortcut To Success and How to Succeed in Silicon Valley Without Really Trying: The slides he showed potential investors noted that he was “dropping out of Harvard University” to work on the start-up full-time. But the way Bannon spoke about his Harvard days was dubious. At one point a prospective investor asked whether he had been an undergrad or a graduate student at the university. “Yeah,” was Bannon’s response. “As VCs and angels, we have this ‘We’re smarter than anyone’ kind of thing,” says one Amicus investor. “But we’re lemmings like anyone else. There are signals we think suggest more success. And those biases weren’t lost on Bannon, who seemed to tailor his persona to fit them. During Y Combinator, Bannon lived in the same house where Zuckerberg binge-coded an early version of Facebook. He played host to a CNN Money reporter, who noted that “like Zuckerberg, Bannon is a Harvard drop out,” and asked if there were other similarities. “Hopefully, there will be more,” Bannon responded. (In a blog post reflecting on some of his mistakes, Bannon noted that he’d “sacrificed my credibility for little benefit other a sense of false prestige and a sexy line in a press story.”)    Embed Quote
