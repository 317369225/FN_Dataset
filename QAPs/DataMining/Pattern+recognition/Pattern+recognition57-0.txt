★What is the usecase of whitening transform in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning?
You can use simultaneous whitening to convert the graph moment tensor to a orthogonally decomposable tensor through a multi-linear transformation.i.e. consider  a known rank SVD of the modified adjacency matrix (in terms of the vector, that gives normalised count of edges from X,A / can be disjoint /  and  the Dirichlet parameter ) , under exact moments e.g. and define the whitening matrix , use it to define (in terms of ) and use  both to establish the linear transformation that works in your case and type of graph that you ve defined. PS: complexity is ,where tensor is being orthogonalized with singular vectors.    Embed Quote
