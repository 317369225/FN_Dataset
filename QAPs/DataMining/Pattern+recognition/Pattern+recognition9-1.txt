★What are good textbooks for pattern recognition?
I really recommend this one. Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques. It seems the cover changed I have the green version with a chameleon. Anyway I was a total noob on Data Mining and ML before that book (still am I just have basic notions). The great thing about that book is that it goes hand in hand with the Weka software which is a great tool for experimenting and getting to know what pattern recognition from datasets is about. I was able to learn from that book. Practice in weka and then implement several scripted algorithms with a Library in Python. The concepts are the same so you basically you can use an API with different algorithms in many languages (most which are explained on that book). I really really recommend it and its not that hard to read.    Embed Quote
