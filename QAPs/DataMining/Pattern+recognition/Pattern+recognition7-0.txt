★What are some online (open-source) resources for learning pattern recognition?
The trend in academia is to publish all course materials online. Find a person whose pattern recognition, machine learning, or computer vision ideas you like, and go to their homepage. Visit the course websites and go through the slides they put online. Definitely not as valuable as being in the classroom, but nevertheless a great way to learn! Use the internet! Use Google! Ask questions. Read PDFs, watch lectures on YouTube. You will not get an official degree, but knowledge is knowledge. Go learn!    Embed Quote
