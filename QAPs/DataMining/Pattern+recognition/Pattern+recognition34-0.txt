★What processes are involved in pattern recognition?
In the most conventional approach for classification in pattern recognition (hand coded features), it's something like this: Have a training set of data which approximates the distribution of the set of data you will be testing your algorithm on. Have an algorithm to extract feature descriptors from your set of data - apply this algorithm to both your training and testing data. Have a learning algorithm which will learn a model based on the training data and using this model predict the class that each instance in the test set belongs to. Using the labels of the testing data available prior to this stage, calculate the accuracy of the prediction. Now the methodologies might vary in case of using things like deep learning algorithms, or training labels being unavailable. Basically the pattern recognition task is unique to the problem statement but there are certain established methodologies (as above) which researchers follow.    Embed Quote
