★What is the application of artificial neural network in pattern recognition?
There are lots of use cases for NN in pattern recognition even in supervised and unsupervised manner. - CLASSIFICATION: given a labeled data, train a NN to label novel ones. multi layer perceptrons is exp. - CLUSTERING: given unlabeled data define the intrinsic structure or bounding regions that groups similars items. Self Organizing Maps is exp. - FEATURE LEARNING: Find discriminative representation of given instances for capturing regularities. Convolutional NN - DATA ENCODING : Find lower dimensional representation of the data to compression and decoding from the generated code to original data. Restricted Boltzman Machines - OUTLIER DETECTION: Find outlying instance different in shape from the majority. RSOM proposed by myself ( not published work) So on so forth...    Embed Quote
