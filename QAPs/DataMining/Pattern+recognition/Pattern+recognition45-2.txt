★Why do I find the notations in book pattern recognition and machine learning strange and confusing?
Remember, many concepts in "machine learning" have been tackled by very many difference communities, each with their own initial professional vocabulary: Control engineering, Statistics, AI Computer Science, are the main three I can list off the top of my head, but of course, there's also Physics (hello Charles ;)). It gets worse, when you look at application domains (eg Image recognition, Speech recognition, Information retrieval, Computer Aided Tutoring, blah blah blah). Write Answer    Embed Quote
