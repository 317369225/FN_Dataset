★If stereotyping is a form of pattern recognition and pattern recognition is the method by which all humans learn, so why do people regard it in a negative light?
People don't view all stereotypes in negative light - for example nobody would complain about your stereotype of red hot stoves being painful to touch. It's just about the ones that are potentially hurtful to the prosperity of society - where the result would be some individual not doing something he might be good at, or him doing something he might not be good at (for example Asians being good at math, even though some of them are not, like any other continent's inhabitants), or otherwise preventing cooperation. There is also another thing, namely that all generalizations are false (including this one). Generalizations are very, very useful, and indeed the method by which our brain works and learns, but you have to always be on the lookout - nature rarely fits in patterns. When you say something looks "organic", this means there is no clear pattern - no geometric shapes, no clear rules of formation, no simple formula that describes it - but our brain can't work with that, because it needs the information in a compact form; so we generalize, which means we ignore the thing itself and replace it with a representation. It helps you understand, but at the same time makes you blind to the reality. EDIT: A quote I read here, on Quora - "the average person has one breast and one testicle". It's true, but also wrong on so, so many levels :) The same can be said about any stereotype, and even inductive reasoning in general.    Embed Quote
