★Is deep learning pattern recognition going to improve and give even better results in the future?
I believe presently Deep Learning is a very promising tool for the future and generic AI solutions relying on data. We observe some of the traces from Object Recognition, NLP and Reinforcement Learning problems. Actually for many of the DL based solutions, main idea is same with the last decades but the only difference is to know learning non-linear relations with DL models more efficiently from theoretical and computational sense. I also believe that the real achievements of Machine Learning and AI are very correlated with Hardware. If you look at the emergence of DL as a buzzword, it is just after the usage of GPU programming. In that sense, I am waiting more Hardware improvements for better AI. Beside, there are very limited number of tools that can be enhanced by better Hardwares. DL models are one of those since as the Hardware goes well, you can train more complicated more large models with better performances. However, I need to point Bayesian and Variational ML models as a good competitor to DL models. Bayesian models are not very popular right now, at least as much as DL since they are computationally bounded by the present machinery for especially large problems. Nevertheless, once we get another Hardware Revolution like the GPU case, and people start to use these intrinsic optimization routines of Bayesian Methods, then things can change and we can hear more about these or maybe Bayesian based DL models.    Embed Quote
