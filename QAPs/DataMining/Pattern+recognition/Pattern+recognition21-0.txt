★To what extent is pattern recognition dependent on working memory?
I do not think pattern recognition is dependent on working memory as the pattern that becomes apparent has little to do with memory.   Pattern recognition is an "aha!" moment that comes like an epiphany, seemingly out of the sky rather than a labor of the mind. Although one may have immersed themselves in the subject of interest consciously working towards a goal, the moment of pattern recognition comes when the subconscious mind finds the key and this can be when a person is asleep, talking with someone, or walking down the street window shopping.   Having had a career as a systems specialist primarily brought in to solve problems that others could not, I had always considered that my success was due to pattern recognition. An intriguing question, thanks for posting it.    Embed Quote
