★What are the best beginning books about Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning?
1) "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop Probably the best book in this field. The treatment is exhaustive, consumable-for-all and supported by ample examples and illustrations. Would suggest this as a primer. The author is a well known ML scientist. 2) "Pattern Classification" by Richard O. Duda , Peter E. Hart, David G. Stork A handy book for pattern recognition and probably used as text book by most of the universities. The reading is concise, theoretic and math heavy, so not the best one for newbies, but best book to get a sense of PR. Suitable for engineers and practitioners. 3) "Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms" by David J. C. MacKay This book may look like little out of context, but splendidly unifies three domains : information theory, statistical inference and machine learning. This  would help to get a big picture and better understanding of ML. The book has an interesting chart that directs people to read just parts of it, based on their background and needs. 4) "Machine Learning" by Tom M. Mitchell A good overview about machine learning, but little outdated 5) "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig This book is one of the popular text books used by universities. Would be a good start for AI and also some chapters deals about Machine learning. The book is not math heavy and suitable for freshmen and graduates.    Embed Quote
