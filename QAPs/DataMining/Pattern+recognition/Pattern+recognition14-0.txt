★How do I improve my pattern recognition skills?And could someone break down this skill into smaller sub skills if they exist, and perhaps talk about how to improve each one if possible?
The only  way I know is practice , practice and then more practice.  After a while you develop an "eye"  for the pattern types you are interested in.  The practice builds up a network of concept association in your intellect (which lives in your brain).  Physiologically you are strengthening  certain neural connects and inducing your brain to actually grow more axons.    Embed Quote
