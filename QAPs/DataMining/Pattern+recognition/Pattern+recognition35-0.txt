★How is pattern recognition different from computer vision?What kind of opportunities can I expect if I work on pattern recognition as compared to computer vision? Which areas/ industries are different?
Computer Vision mostly involves processing and analyzing images for applications such as - Object Detection, Segmentation, Vision based learning. Pattern Recognition, on the other hand, is more of a subset of Machine Learning, even though there are similarities between CV and pattern recognition. It is used for classification. You're not restricted to images in this case. It can be anything like "Classification of Proteins" or in Signal Processing. From what it might seem, Computer Vision, even though dependent quite a bit on maths can still be just application specific whereas Pattern Recognition is extremely Maths intensive.    Embed Quote
