★What is the application of artificial neural network in pattern recognition?
the pattern you want to recognize might require a complicated model, that's easiest to 'train' a neural network on.  in other words, the application of a neural network in pattern recognition, is to first train the neural network on some input data (as well as optionally provide ongoing feedback as to whether you agree or disagree with the conclusion that was reached) as to what sort of pattern you are looking for, then using the neural net to notify you when specific input is similar enough to something in the training set.    Embed Quote
