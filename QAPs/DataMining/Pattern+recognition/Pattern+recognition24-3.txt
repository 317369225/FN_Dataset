★What is a good introductory article/textbook on the subject of statistical pattern recognition?
These two books, as their names imply, follow exactly a statistical approach in pattern recognition: [1] Introduction to statistical pattern recognition, Keinosuke Fukunaga [2] Statistical pattern recognition, A.R. Webb Although [1] & [2], specifically [1], haven't been written recently, I believe that both of them still have many things to tell us. Also, as John mentioned, Bishop's book is a fabulous text in pattern recognition as well as regression problems, and in dealing with most of the problems, Bishop adopt a statistical viewpoint. The classic text referenced by most of the SPR courses worldwide is: [3] Pattern Recognition, S. Theodoridis et al. Although all the subjects in this book are not covered in a statistical framework, you might find some interesting materials in it. In addition, you can find some outstanding researches and studies in the recent papers of its well-known author.    Embed Quote
