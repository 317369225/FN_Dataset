★Is topological data analysis revolutionary in terms of data mining and pattern recognition?Data-Visualization Firm's New Software Autonomously Finds Abstract Connections | Wired Design | Wired.com
Yes and no. Yes it's revolutionary in that its another way to do it :) and gleaning insight from structured data and graphs is another field in of itself, which spawns many of its own proprietary algorithms and approaches such as No in that Facebook and many other large companies (such as AOL, and Yahoo)  have been doing it for quite some time now. If you think about it, many of the ancients did machine learning (in a sense) when deriving their models, e.g. the heat equation, and graph mining is just a special subset of structured data mining.    Embed Quote
