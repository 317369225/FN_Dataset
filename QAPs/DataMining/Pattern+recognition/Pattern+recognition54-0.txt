★Who are people in history with notable pattern recognition skills?Some people have the analog ability to recognize patterns better than others.  Who are they, and what have they contributed?
Pattern recognition is extremely valuable in cryptolinguistics. In the 1940s, there was a scholar named Alice Kober working on the decipherment of Linear B.  She received her PhD in Classics from Columbia University in 1932, and worked as a research assistant at Brooklyn College.  Sadly, she died of cancer in 1950, just 2 years before the decipherment of Linear B was announced. With access to only 750 then-published sign groups, she was able to distinguish a pattern in the endings of Linear B words and isolate a variety of declensions.  Declensions are changes to a word that specify its number, case and sex; "geese" (number: plural) is a declension of "goose" (number: single) in the English (language), as "chica" (sex: female) is a declension of "chico" (sex: male) in the Spanish (language). In 1946, she published a rigorous proof using the Scientific Method which identified that Linear B did indeed have declensions in the American Journal of Archaeology v. 50 "Inflection in Linear Class B: 1 - Declension".  When Michael Ventris' decipherment of Linear B as Mycenaean Greek was confirmed, it became clear that Kober's earlier discovery identified several forms of toponyms (place names). Applying Ventris' work to Kober's, we get, for example: KO-NO-SO (place: Knossos) KO-NO-SI-JO (male from Knossos) KO-NO-SI-JA (female from Knossos)    Embed Quote
