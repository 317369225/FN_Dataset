★How can I implement stock chart patterns recognition?I'm thinking of patterns like those - http://thepatternsite.com/visual...
One method is fractal analysis. While controversial and somewhat mathematically complex, it is an interesting method of market analysis. Some claim that it is analogous to numerology, or astrology, with mathematics and astronomy being the scientific equivalents. The chief drawback, aside from questions about it's validity, is that the predictive power is limited. Indeed, any form of pattern recognition is a "lagging indicator."
