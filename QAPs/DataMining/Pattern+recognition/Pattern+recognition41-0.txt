★What is a good way to read Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning?I read this book for a few weeks. When I finish the chapter 2, and do some exercises, I found lots of details are missing(need to read again for some parts), I just wonder is it exercise will cover all the points in each chapter, I just do not want to miss something and need I read chapter again?
a2a. I remarked the same feature. It seems to be a dense book. Re-reading the chapters unveiled some other parts which I overlooked at first sight. Doing the exercises and making some proof of concept implementations where appropriate (e.g. figure 2.6 page 79 in took 3 Octave lines to reproduce).    Embed Quote
