★Pattern Recognition: What are some machine learning resources for a beginner?I am looking for any good source to learn pattern recognition source and easy to understand.
I'll give you 3 advices that worked for me: If you're looking for something easy to understand, you should watch some classes. Check out Coursera ML course, it is really easy and gives you enough understanding of how ML works. Check out some surveys on ML. Take the subject you like the most and find a survey on it. For example, if you like instance selection you should read the Garcia Taxonomy paper, and so on. With classes + papers, you should be able to code something yourself, do it, that is the only way you can actually learn and improve ML algorithms. Good luck,    Embed Quote
