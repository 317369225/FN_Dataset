★Are there any books on Pattern Recognition by logic and linguistics rather than statistics and mathematics?
Yes, but they were written more than 20 years ago.  Most AI / PR books written before 1990 emphasized "neat" (not "scruffy") symbolic- and logic-based approaches to pattern recognition, planning, and learning.  But the inability of such models/systems to improve through optimization made them too brittle to scale up to the point that they could tackle human-level performance in PR or learning tasks.  The greater successes of systems modeled on more numerical approaches (markov models, bayesian networks, markov decision processes, kalman filters, random forests, n-grams, probabilistic parsing and tagging, etc) simply outperformed earlier models built using structured manually-curated symbol-driven substrates.  Unlike earlier "neat" systems, these often "scruffy" quantitative approaches could be incrementally optimized, combined, error-corrected, and made measurably more reliable.  Eventually the engineers beat out the logicians.    Embed Quote
