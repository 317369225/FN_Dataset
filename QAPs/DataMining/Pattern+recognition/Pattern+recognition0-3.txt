★How can I implement stock chart patterns recognition?I'm thinking of patterns like those - http://thepatternsite.com/visual...
As mentioned, pattern recognition looks for lagging indicators or in other words, the side effects of events that have already taken place. If the stock price declines after bad news about oil, the event has already happened and the market has reacted. You will be reacting to the markets reaction and it's likely too late.    Embed Quote
