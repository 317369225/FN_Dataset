★How can I become better at pattern recognition?
Everything is one total pattern. Our individual minds perceive this totality in chunks. Sometimes, the piece in focus doesn't have a pattern unto itself. It might take "background knowledge" from prior observations to fill in some details and complete the pattern. However, it's really easy to see false patterns or illusions based on incomplete data. From experience in seeing false patterns, this is the only real tip I have on improving at pattern recognition: understand when not to look for one.    Embed Quote
