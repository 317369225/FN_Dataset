★How can I implement stock chart patterns recognition?I'm thinking of patterns like those - http://thepatternsite.com/visual...
I don't agree that pattern recognition looks for lagging indicators.  Pattern recognition relys upon the formation of patterns within the price charts.  While these charts may be overlayed with lagging indicators such as moving averages or relative strength indicators (which do lag) the patterns which form within the price charts are live, their zenith can be predicted and therefore traded.  It is important when adopting such a strategy to employ robust trading discipline and have effective stops in place but success can be acheived.  See: www.tradepatterns.co.uk for further advice.    Embed Quote
