★How can I implement stock chart patterns recognition?I'm thinking of patterns like those - http://thepatternsite.com/visual...
Everything can be programmed. One idea is to use many different timezones at the same time to add confirmations. This is example of todays market, Oil futures generated bearish gartley pattern in hourly datachart while 15 min generated at the same time also bearish ABC pattern to the same area.    Embed Quote
