★Why do I find the notations in book pattern recognition and machine learning strange and confusing?
Well PRML is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students so don't expect an easy ride. Using concept like noise, precision and bias do make sense in the application domain. It may take its language from signal processing where its common to talk about the signal and the noise. (A2A) These are all well established terms see for example accuracy and precision, bias of an estimator, Image noise, Noise (signal processing). Noise is perhaps a better term than error, there is often a physical process producing the noise and you can model that noise.    Embed Quote
