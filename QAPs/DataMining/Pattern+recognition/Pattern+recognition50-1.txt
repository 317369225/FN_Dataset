★Pattern Recognition: Are there open-sourced image search engines or image comparasion systems?for personal use
I'm not aware of any fully open source, or wrapper for openCV for instance.   However, if you are interested in get going i highly recommend a book from Jan Erik Solemn, "Computer vision in python" which have a complete chapter on CBIR (Content based image retrieval) and open source code available at Github for a complete CBIR system, online based, which actually gives quite good results, depending on what type of images and so on. Further with some minor enhancement which are actually also discussed in the book, you could get it even better. The approach he describes is actually a very common appproach for many visual search systems.   This system is perfect to build upon and learn from.    Embed Quote
