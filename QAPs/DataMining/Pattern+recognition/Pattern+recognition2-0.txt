★What types of pattern recognition are humans better at than computers?Despite advances in data and machine learning, there are still types of patterns that require humans to notice. For example, http://www.galaxyzoo.org/ asks people to recognize the shapes of emerging galaxies, something I would have thought computers are far better at. What are the properties of this kind of problem that make it so hard for computers?
Arfon Smith, then-director of Citizen Science at the Adler Planetarium (home of the Galaxy Zoo project referred to in the question), addressed this issue in an interview at the Public Participation in Scientific Research conference in August 2012 (http://www.citizenscience.org/co...). Basically, he says that algorithms do OK, but you don't know what they're getting wrong; humans are more reliable.  The question comes about 1:30 into the following video:    Embed Quote
