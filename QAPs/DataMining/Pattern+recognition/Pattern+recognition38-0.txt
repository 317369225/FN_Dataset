★How do you improve your pattern recognition skills?I want to improve my pattern recognition skills in basketball. My brother is adept at recognizing the tendecies of a player on offense and it is very mesmerizing. I wish I had it too
Deliberate practice against different players/situations. Studies of chess have demonstrated that masters can recognize and hold in their mind thousands of patterns. Take those same masters and randomly distribute pieces on the board and they fair no better than the average person. Basically, repetitive practice, playing against the same players at the same skill levels will result in the same patterns. Instead, deliberate practice, where you intentionally drop down a level, move up a level, play against different players, play different positions, etc. etc. will help with pattern recognition. For instance, if you always play center because of XYZ reason, switch it up and play point guard, then switch and play power forward for a few weeks.    Embed Quote
