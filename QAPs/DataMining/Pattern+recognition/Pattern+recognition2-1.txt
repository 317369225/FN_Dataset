★What types of pattern recognition are humans better at than computers?Despite advances in data and machine learning, there are still types of patterns that require humans to notice. For example, http://www.galaxyzoo.org/ asks people to recognize the shapes of emerging galaxies, something I would have thought computers are far better at. What are the properties of this kind of problem that make it so hard for computers?
(My opinion): Humans are just far better at generalizing That said: This video is awesome. I think it might answer your question. Andrew Ng talks about the problems he is working on and the future of the field    Embed Quote
