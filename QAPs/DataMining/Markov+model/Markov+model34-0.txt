★What are some ways in which Hidden Markov Models (HMM) can be applied to computer vision?
Hey I am no expert in this domain but one could check out my blog Human Computer Interaction : Blending the Real and Digital Worlds . . .  and look for the post "Hidden Markov Model for Dummies". This is something I wrote with a view to help beginners such as myself deal with HMM using my experience with using HMM in my Computer vision based project (using Dynamic hand gestures). Hope it helps. In addition, there are numerous papers which talk about computer vision techniques using HMM.    Embed Quote
