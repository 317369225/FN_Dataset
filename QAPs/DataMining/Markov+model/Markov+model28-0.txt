★What is a Hidden Markov Model - Artificial Neural Network (HMM-ANN)?ANN=artificial neural network
A traditional HMM is a model which computes the likelihood of a sequence of data using latent variables which are the HMM states and conditional likelihoods which are the HMM state emission distributions and state transition probabilities which define the topology of the HMM. An ANN is a model which given a sample estimates a posterior of a class .  One trick used in ASR is to train an ANN to estimate posterior probabilities of HMM states .  Then the emission distributions are replaced with the ANN posterior estimates using Baye's rule .  Since doesn't change with the state alignment, it can be ignored.  This approach can work quite well depending on how the ANN(DNN) is trained.  Typically this requires a traditional state-of-the-art ASR system to generate labeled training data.    Embed Quote
