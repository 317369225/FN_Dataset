★What does the "order" mean for a Markov model?Prompted by What does random text generated from a Markov model look like for prominent Quora users?
You can think of the HMM order as the amount of history used for the transition probabilities.  For example, for a three state "left to right" HMM the states in the first order HMM have transition probabilities   .  The transition probabilities for the second order HMM expand the state history so you have more transition probabilities .  The second order HMM is effectively a first order HMM with an extended state space using pseudo states and transition probabilities .  where the HMM emission probability of pseudo state is the same as the emission probability of real state .  The pseudo state representation allow you to easily maintain history and apply the same algorithms for decoding and training as you would for first order HMM's. It should be noted that higher order HMM's have a fair amount of additional complexity.  One has to worry about how to estimate the transition probabilities when data is sparse.  Backoff techniques used for N-gram language models may be worth considering.    Embed Quote
