★What is the probability of the model in the hidden Markov model?as you know the posterior distribution of the hidden Markov model when given observation is: p(model | observation) ∝ p(observation | model)*p(model) p(observation | model) is clear and can be obtained. but Is There any way to find p(model)?
Warning: I don't do ML type stuff. So, in general there isn't a way to do that, I don't think. P(model) implies 'model' is an event, or a well defined set, which seems unreasonable. There are workarounds. Let us say that you know the structure of the model, but not the exact values of its parameters. Well, assuming you have probability density functions for those parameters, you then can find a resulting probability density function for the model, that is, a function that answers "What is the probability that my model has this set of values for its parameters?" So you see, one can actually redefine 'model' into a set in a reasonable manner, and proceed to get P(model). Take a simple candidate linear system model: d/dt (x) = k x where k is an unknown random variable. Given the PDF of k, you can immediately answer the questions like " What is the probability that the model could be d/dt (x) = x ?" " What is the probability that the model could be approximately d/dt (x) = 5 x ?" Which should be P(model).    Embed Quote
