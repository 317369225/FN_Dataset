★What is a Markov model?
Markov Model is a probabilistic model that based on Markov Property that is underlines that at a given index point xi on the state space (say on time t) your decision is just depended to the last state before  xi (say time t-1). Therefore a given decision is just related to the one before decision you made. As an example you might consider the below image. It a simple diagram of so called Hidden Markov Model. Assume the shaded nodes are observations and the others are the variables you aim to estimate. Suppose shaded ones are weather condition like sunny, cloudy and other nodes are the weather temperatures. You have the conditions and try to come up with temperature of the weather. For that decision you are only using the weather conditions the observation and the temperature of the yesterday. ( I realized that the figure based on Tune and Chord relation but tsill the idea is same :) ) For more information you might look at the Coursera Probabilistic Graphical Models Course archives.    Embed Quote
