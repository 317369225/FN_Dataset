★What does the "order" mean for a Markov model?Prompted by What does random text generated from a Markov model look like for prominent Quora users?
This may not be a formal definition, but when using Markov models for predictive data compression or speech recognition, the order is generally the number of previously seen symbols that are considered when calculating the probabilities for the next symbol. As an example, if I was using an order-5 markov model to predict individual letters in a text stream, and the previous five characters were BARAC, the probability of letter K being next might be 93%, A might be 2%, H might bet 4%, and so on. Increasing the order of the model usually improves the quality of the predictions for the next symbol, resulting in better speech recognition or higher compression ratios.    Embed Quote
