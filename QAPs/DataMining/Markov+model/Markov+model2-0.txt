★What is the difference between Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models?
A "Markov Model" process is basically one that does not have any memory -- the distribution of the next state/observation depends exclusively on the current state. A Markov Model may be autonomous or controlled -- an autonomous Markov process will evolve by itself, and in the case of a controlled Markov process you can apply actions to a system that affect the outcomes. A Markov chain is a simple Markov process, in which states can be observed directly. For example, you could model a corpus of text as being generated by a Markov chain. In a Hidden Markov Model, the states themselves are not directly observed, instead we assume that there are some sequences of states in a Markov chain that we cannot observe directly, and these states generate observations. Each state can have a different distribution of observations. Speech is often modeled using HMMs.    Embed Quote
