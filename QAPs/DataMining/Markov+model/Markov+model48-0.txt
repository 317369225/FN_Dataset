★How can one record human actions, and produce Markov modeled animations?
This is a pretty specific query, and if I could tell you in detail I would probably have a PhD. But I can give you some basic ideas regarding commercial tools which may be of interest. Natural motion Euphoria and Autodesk HumanIK are both worth investigating. Software frameworks and tools such as Massive, Softimage ICE, Houdini or FabricEngine may be of use. Motion capture technology such as Polhemus, Vicom and optiTrack are often used for creating snippets of animation or movement which can be sequenced and blended. Even hardware like the Microsoft Kinect can help to capture natural movements and is popular with researchers on a budget. I hope this at least helps, good luck.    Embed Quote
