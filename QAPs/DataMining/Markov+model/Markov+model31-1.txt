★What is a hidden Markov Model (HMM) and how can it be used in speech recognition?
A hidden Markov model can be considered a generalization of a mixture model where the hidden variables (or latent variables), which control the mixture component to be selected for each observation, are related through a Markov process rather than independent of each other. What this basically means is that its an effective way of achieving machine learning. Hence it can be used not only in speech recognition but any pattern recognition system. You can read more about this on wikipedia and various papers available on the internet.    Embed Quote
