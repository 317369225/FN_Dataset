★What are some good resources for learning about Hidden Markov Models?
Of course all the material and references provided in the other answers are great. And yes Rabiner's paper is almost like the first step everyone should take. But here is a link to a post I wrote myself based on my own experiences with HMM and Computer Vision+Pattern Recognition. I wrote this with a view to help beginners get started because HMM can be very intimidating for newbies (especially the reference papers, written by experts..!) It may not be very great but I do hope it can help people get started and gain a few pointers regarding HMM's implementation....Here: Human Computer Interaction : Blending the Real and Digital Worlds . . .    Embed Quote
