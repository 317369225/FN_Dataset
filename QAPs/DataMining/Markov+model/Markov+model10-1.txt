★What does the "order" mean for a Markov model?Prompted by What does random text generated from a Markov model look like for prominent Quora users?
"Order" basically means the degree to which the generated text will resemble the source text. The greater the number the greater the fidelity. Order 0 would produce totally random characters, Order 5 would produce gibberish that, if heard by a non-english speaker, would sound very similar to the source-text aurally. Order 8 is where sentences kind-of start to make sense. Anything higher than Order 10 usually resembles the source text too much to seem novel.    Embed Quote
