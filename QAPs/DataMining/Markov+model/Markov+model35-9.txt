★What are some good resources for learning about Hidden Markov Models?
The best resources/tutorials on HMM I found back when I was trying to learn about them: What is a Hidden Markov Model? - great overview detailing the math in english phrases. :) www.isi.edu/integration/courses/csci548_2006/Slides06/mallet.pdf (this is mostly Rabiner's slides in ppt form - but concise and comprehensive) IR Math in Java : HMM Based POS Tagger/Recognizer- Implementation specific http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/no... - explains in extremely simple mathematical terms the math behind HMM's - look specifically at the slides - It's as easy as abc, Bugs on a Grid, and later in the PDF file MEMORANDUM - Runs through an application and an example of HMM's - sequencing in biology. There are a couple more at my delicious link page: https://delicious.com/javadi82/hmm    Embed Quote
