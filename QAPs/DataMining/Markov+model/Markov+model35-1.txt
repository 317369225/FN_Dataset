★What are some good resources for learning about Hidden Markov Models?
The references Alex lists are good.  Here's a quick overview in case that's useful. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a type of Bayesian network. Like all Bayes nets, they're used to represent conditional independence relationships between random variables and show how to neatly factor a joint probability distribution. HMMs, in particular, are a generalization of normal Markov chains. A simple first-order Markov chain is a collection of random variables such that the joint distribution simply factors into a a product of conditional distributions: . That is, the value of the random variable at a particular timepoint only depends on the previous timepoint, not the entire history of the chain. A HMM is just a first-order Markov Chain where we can't see the states . Instead, we observe a sequence of emissions that depend only on the current state of the hidden Markov chain. HMMs are very useful for modeling time-series data in problems like parts-of-speech tagging for a sequence of words or DNA sequencing.
