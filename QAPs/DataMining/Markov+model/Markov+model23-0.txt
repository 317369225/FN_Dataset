★Hidden Markov Models: What are some ways to speed up HMM training and decoding?
In bioinformatics HMM based searches;multiple segment Viterbi filters are used as speed up heuristics instead of a full Viterbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubm... There is an IEEE 2011 paper by Jesper Nielsen on a parallel implementation of HMMs for bioinformatics database searches that report achieving speedups by tweaking the Forward and viterbi algorithms. So while the actual performance/traversal/speed of an HMM is a function of the complexity of its state probabilities, playing with the heuristics of the expectation maximization reporting step seem to benefit speed improvements    Embed Quote
