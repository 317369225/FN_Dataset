★How do Conditional Random Fields (CRF) compare to Maximum Entropy Models and Hidden Markov Models?I am interested in the sequence tagging task specifically.
CRFs and MEMMS are discriminative sequence models whereas HMMs are generative sequence models. HMM essentially uses Bayes Rule as a local model over the transition and emission probabilities, whereas CRF and MEMM's local models are MaxEnt models over transition and observable features. The chief difference between MEMM and CRF is that MEMM is locally renormalized and suffers from the label bias problem, while CRFs are globally renormalized.    Embed Quote
