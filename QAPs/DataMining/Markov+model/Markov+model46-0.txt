★I know basic probability. What are some good online resources to learn about Markov Models and Markov chains?I have been hearing about Markov models and chains and hidden markov models a lot, but I have no clue as in to what they are. Can anyone point me to some good resources where I can learn about the same? Thanks!
Check out these fine Hidden Markov Models tutorials: Laurence Rabiner's HMM tutorial Rakesh Dugad's HMM tutorial Wikipedia's Markov chain looks like a decent start on Markov chains.    Embed Quote
