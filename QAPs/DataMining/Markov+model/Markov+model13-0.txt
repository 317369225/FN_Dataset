★Can Hidden Markov Models be used as binary classifiers? If yes, how?
HMM is used for structured predictions, for example on sequence data like Speech, text, DNA If you need to predict labels (binary or not) on each token in a sequence, HMM is very good for that. If you just need a single binary prediction on the whole, you can't just use HMM, perhaps you can feed output of HMM into other classifier though.    Embed Quote
