How does file compression work?
Suppose I have a text file with the following contents: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX That's twenty X's in a row.  Further suppose that my original file format only consists of letters A through Z.  Well, since we know that no numeric character will ever appear in our file, we can easily compress this input like so: 20X More generally, we just replace all sequences of some letter with the number of letters in the sequence (20) followed by the letter being repeated (X). Viola!  Lossless compression!  Now if we want to decompress this, we just need to find every numeric digit in the compressed file, then check the next character and repeat it that many times. That's obviously a simplified example, but it illustrates the basic idea: Lossless compression relies on the fact that large chunks of information are often repeated.    Embed Quote
