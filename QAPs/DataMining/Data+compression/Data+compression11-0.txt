How does file compression work?
Non-Compressed That Sam-I-Am! That Sam-I-Am! I do not like that Sam-I-Am! Do you like green eggs and ham? I do not like them, Sam-I-Am! I do not like green eggs and ham! Would you like them here or there? I would not like them here or there. I would not like them anywhere. I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am. Total Characters = 322 Compressed 1=hat 2=Sam-I-Am 3=I do not like 4=green eggs and ham 5=you like 6=here or there 7=I would not like them T1 2! T1 2! 3 t1 2! Do 5 4? 3 4! Would 5 them 6? 7 6. 7 anywhere. 3 4. 3 them, 2. Total Characters = 186. Compression rate = 58%. Would almost certainly get much better as you go throughout the story    Embed Quote Updated 22 May, 2013. 76,391 views.
