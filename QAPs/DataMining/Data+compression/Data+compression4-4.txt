Is data compression a dual of learning? If not, why?
No. The dual of compression (source coding) is channel coding. Compression removes redundancy in data, channel coding adds redundancy to make data more robust to noise. There is a duality between the maximum compression achievable for a data stream, and the theoretical capacity of an information channel. Shannon pointed this out in his source coding theorem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha...) which gives a dual to his noisy channel coding theorem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noi...).    Embed Quote
