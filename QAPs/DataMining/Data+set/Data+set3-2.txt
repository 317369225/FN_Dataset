How can I crunch big data sets with my laptop?
There are two alternatives which have not been discussed so far in the other answers: 1. GraphChi: Effort from the CMU (same group that came up with GraphLab): allows you to perform disk based graph processing on billion node graphs fast in non-distributed (single node) setting. May not be completely useful in this context, but they do have some machine learning algorithms as part of GraphChi, which could be used to crunch the CSV file. The complete software is available for download at: GraphChi. This is very interesting work - they were able to triangle count on a Twitter-2010 graph in less than 90 minutes on a single node, while a Hadoop based solution uses 1400 workers on a distributed setting and takes 400 minutes! 2. I was @strataconf in NY in Oct 2013 and saw a demonstration of a terabyte being crunched on a single node by Sisense, a small startup. See this news item: SiSense "10X10X10 Challenge" Shatters Record at Strata Big Data Conference (They were able to crunch 10 TB of data in 10 seconds on a 10K$ machine).
