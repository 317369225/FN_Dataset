How do data analysts at companies like Facebook and Twitter run queries on extremely large data sets?
At Facebook in particular, the practical answer is (or was, anyway, when I worked there) something called HiPAL, an in-house UI for Hive. Hive will translate your SQL-ish queries into Map-Reduce jobs to be run in a distributed fashion on flat files stored in a massive HDFS cluster. The latency can be somewhat annoying, and various other systems exist that are less general but give answers faster, but Hive was always the gold standard, because it could deal with truly enormous tables.    Embed Quote
