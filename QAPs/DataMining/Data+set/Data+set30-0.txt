What open data sets are available for the Netherlands?
A player that could have a HUGE impact in this space would be the CBS (http://www.cbs.nl), the national statistics collector. Instead of them publishing aggregate reports, let them publish the raw data (anonymized if necessary, or aggregated on a very low level) and let other analysts have a go at the data.
