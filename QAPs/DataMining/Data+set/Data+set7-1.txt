What is the best way to implement an autocomplete search feature when dealing with large data sets?
If you want Autocomplete without having to setup or install software or servers, Searchify offers Autocomplete as part of our hosted search service.  You could call it "Autocomplete-as-a-service."  You just index some documents using our API, and you automatically get autocomplete suggestions based on your documents. You can either use just the server-side part, and implement the client-side yourself using something like jQuery-UI, or you can use our client libraries to get up & running faster.  And if you want to go even further, it's pretty easy to get "instant search" going using InstantLinks. It's all based on IndexTank's autocomplete functionality mentioned by James Thornton here. Links: Autocomplete Tutorial with quick start -  http://www.searchify.com/documen...
