How can I crunch big data sets with my laptop?
It’s better to choose perl, python, R and esproc on laptops, for they are programming languages with agile syntax and easy application environment, not like Java that needs quite a long time to prepare before starting to work. The top one tool for processing structured data is esProc which is easy to learn. R language ranks second because it is a little difficult to learn. Inferior to esProc and R, Perl and python are equals in this aspect, with the latter easier to master. For complicated statistical computations of mathematical expressions, R language is almost the first choice. With a relatively small RAM, a laptop can perform computations by using esProc’s file cursor without worrying that memory overflow occurs. esProc can increase computational speed by using stand-alone multithreading for multi-core CPU.    Embed Quote
