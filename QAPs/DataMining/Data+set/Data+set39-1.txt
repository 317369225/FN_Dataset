What are some good publicly available geolocation databases/downloadable data sets?
The GeoPlanet dataset is an excellent data set of named places with parent child relationships, but doesn't include polygons or bounding boxes in the downloadable.  It also uses "WOEIDs" as a canonical identifier which is currently the best bet for a place lingua franca (but Yahoo seems to be screwing that up) http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/g... You can get the bounding boxes from the free GeoPlanet API keyed by the same WOEIDs. Natural Earth Data is another excellent, and rapidly improving public dataset http://www.naturalearthdata.com/    Embed Quote
