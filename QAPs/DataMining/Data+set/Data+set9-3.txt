Are there any products like Socrata, but for private data sets?
Love these data discussions. I am the co-founder and CEO of Junar. We also love data, we launched in March, and our focus is on allowing people to make sense out of the good data sets that are becoming available thanks to the open data movements. Companies like Socrata, Factual, Infochimps, and even Google and Microsoft are making interesting data available. There are some other new initiatives such as BuzzData, PublishMyData, or even Zanran that are doing interesting stuff.    Embed Quote
