As a data scientist, how do you start investigating a data set?
Clearly, this answer depends on the nature of the data you are considering and the questions that you are trying to answer. So I'll attempt to answer this at a high level by posing some questions and being a little more specific than just saying "graph it" or "run a statistical test". Important high level questions about the data:  Is it panel data or time series data? How big is the sample size? 1) Which variables are your dependent variables and which are your independent variables? What assumptions are you making when you choose this classification? 2) What do the individual distributions look like of each variable? Look at histograms. Is there clustering? 3) Check for correlations between variables. Make scatter plots. 4) Which important variables have you omitted, and how might those variables relate to and influence the one's that you have? 5) Keeping the conclusions from 1) - 4) in mind, consider hypothesis testing, fitting functions, and running regressions.    Embed Quote
