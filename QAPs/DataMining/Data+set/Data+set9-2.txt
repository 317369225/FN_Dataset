Are there any products like Socrata, but for private data sets?
One of the struggles in building a platform for people to work with open data is that it's a little bit like the classic Microsoft Word feature creep scenario. 1000 features, but nobody uses more than 10%. The problem is that everyone uses a slightly different 10% of the features. This question makes several difficult or even uncomfortable assumptions about what a general purpose data hub should include in order to be useful or "feature complete". In some ways, it reads like a spec for a specific solution that you want. It's not clear that this is what everyone wants, or even exactly what anyone else wants. There are many ways to slice the problem scenario.    Embed Quote
