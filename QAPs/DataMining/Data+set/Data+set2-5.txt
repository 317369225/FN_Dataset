★What papers have shown that for machine learning, data set size is more important than the model being trained?
The Microsoft Kinect paper also makes claims along these lines: http://research.microsoft.com/pu... Their input was a depth image, and they were building a per-pixel classifier of one of 31 body parts that they defined. They mention explicitly that the huge amount of data they were able to generate using computer graphics was one of the key factors in their success. The classifier itself was then just a simple random decision forest. Worked out well for them!    Embed Quote
