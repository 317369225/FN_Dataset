How do you deal with large data sets in Excel?
I'm late to the game on this one, but I wanted to add a few things. Excel does have it's limits. I typically have issues when my Excel files consume ~1GB of memory, but at some point you will add so much data that the Excel file just will not work. Before you get to that point you should be looking at alternate storage options. They can be simple, like an Access DB, or PowerPivot (though this can have it's own issues), or they can be more complex like storing the data in a database then adding an analysis cube and pulling smaller slices of the data from these into Excel for analysis and reporting. Regardless of what you end up doing you will have to change how Excel interacts with the data. You need to move all of the raw data to another system (Access or SQL are the easiest, but Excel supports a lot of other DB options) and pull smaller chunks of data back into Excel.    Embed Quote
