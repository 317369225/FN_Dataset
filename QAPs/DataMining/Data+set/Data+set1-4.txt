As a data scientist, how do you start investigating a data set?
Simple Visualize it. Look for the holes. Have good idea on how clean, how uniform and how organic the data is. Afterwards Find outliers using simplest techniques and try to explain them. (Linear models and correlation analysis would work just well).   Train some unsupervised models trying to predict some parameters given others as variables. Examine outliers found this way as well. (I like entropy-based models on this stage but YMMV). Find a way to share your data with colleagues and interest them. (You may want to have it loaded into framework that allows interactivity, since interesting questions would appear, and the easier it is to answer them on the spot the higher the chance is you will successfully involve more people in helping you.)    Embed Quote
