Which startups in San Francisco Bay Area are working with massive data sets?
The company I'm at, Marin Software (http://www.marinsoftware.com) is working with very large amounts of data - we manage tens of millions of paid search keywords for such large advertisers as GAP, Macy's, Kayak, PriceGrabber, etc... We correlate all of their clicks and conversions with revenue and daily cost data, which amounts to a lot of data. In general, any company that's working in advertising industry with click data is going to be handling very large data sets. I also imagine that everyone's favorite, Palantir, munges through a lot of data. And, of course, Facebook and Twitter, if they are still considered startups, handle an immense amount of data.    Embed Quote
