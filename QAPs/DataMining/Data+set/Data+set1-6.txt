As a data scientist, how do you start investigating a data set?
Me, the BI guy thinks: "Where the hell are all the dimensions? What are actually the facts and can I build a star schema out of this set to perform any kind of analysis? Where is the DB I can load the set into?" Me, the statistician thinks: "How many categorical variables do I have in this set? Does it have statistical significance? Is the data skewed?" And then I run some descriptive statistics to understand the data better... Me, the business consultant thinks: "Another stupid exercise just to prove I was right from the begin. What a waste of time.."    Embed Quote
