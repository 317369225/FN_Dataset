★Where can I find large datasets open to the public?
Here is a useful link. Finding Data on the Internet Finding Data on the InternetBy RevoJoe  on October 6, 2011 The following list of data sources has been modified as of 8/19/13. Most of the data sets listed below are free, however, some are not. If an (R) appears after source this means that the data are already in R format or there exist R commands for directly importing the data from R. (Seeexamples :: intro for some code.) Otherwise, I have limited the list to data sources for which there is a reasonably simple process for importing csv files. What follows is a list of data sources organized into categories that are not mutually exclusive but which reflect what's out there. Economics American Economic Ass.
