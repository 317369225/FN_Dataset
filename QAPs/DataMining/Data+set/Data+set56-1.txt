What is the easiest way to extrapolate a data set?
As Michael Grainger suggests, the first step should be to plot the data and look at it. Victor Alyn Davis also makes a good point about adding a human expertise to the development of your predictive data model (this is where looking at your data may help). I once worked for a company that made predictive models of debtor behavior based on data collected from credit reports and change-of-address data. Along with the raw variables, our models had many derived variables, which were designed according to a human understanding of the data. For example, if a particular debtor had a dozen charge-offs, the number of charge offs would be a raw variable, but by knowing the dates of those charge-offs, you can construct derived variables such as number-of-charge-offs-in-last-6-months, number-of-charge-offs-in-last-12-months, etc. For our earlier models, we used linear regression to model the data (written in SAS). Later on, we used a neural network simulator (NeuroShell) which produced some impressive results. We also had models that were hybrid, using both linear regression and neural network simulation.    Embed Quote
