Are there any products like Socrata, but for private data sets?
I'm the founder & CEO of Socrata and am glad you like our Open Data platform. Open Data is an emerging trend that is most commonly associated with public or free data. But an interesting statistic is that across our entire customer base of mostly government organizations using the Socrata Open Data Platform, more than 50% of the data is private. In other words, our customers are enjoying the benefits of the platform - the ones you enumerate - for internal data. Every dataset can be public, private or explicitly shared and when shared, the dataset owner/publisher can specify the role for each grantee - editor, viewer, etc. At Socrata we have a broader definition of Open Data: it's any data you want to make generally more accessible and useful to an audience beyond yourself. Here's a conceptual diagram of all the things you can do with your data once its in the Socrata Open Data Platform: If you have internal/private data that you want to share or even API enable so that your internal developers can work with it, the Socrata Open Data Platform is a great solution.    Embed Quote
