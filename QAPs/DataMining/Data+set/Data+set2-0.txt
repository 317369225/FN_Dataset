â˜…What papers have shown that for machine learning, data set size is more important than the model being trained?
You'll probably be interested in "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" [1] and "More Data Beats Better Algorithms" [2]. Also, I just came across a summary, from 2003, of the 2001 Brill arguments noted below. The title of the book chapter is "Processing Natural Language without Natural Language Processing" [3] [1] http://googleresearch.blogspot.c... [2] http://anand.typepad.com/datawoc...
