As a data scientist, how do you start investigating a data set?
As a SEO analyst, I always start with -assuming you're using Excel- inserting mini graphs to the end of each line and row. These graphs instantly gives me the critical high and low points about traffic, revenue etc. Then, I try to summarize data with some logical calculations. You can convert data to some percents or index them to a starting point. This'll give you the insights about where to start working (or in my situarion, fixing). If you're mining in a longer timeframe, sum it up to days, weeks, months and years. But of course the key point is to know the reasons for this data to change. Holiday seasons, weather conditons, whatever situations effects the data you're working on.    Embed Quote
