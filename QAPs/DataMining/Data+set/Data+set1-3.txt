As a data scientist, how do you start investigating a data set?
Here are some questions I usually try to answer myself regarding a dataset: Which are the variables in the dataset? Which of those are more meaningful and which can be discarded? What types of cleaning procedures make sense? Which is the general meaning of each variable? Which is the task specific meaning of each variable? Does the data follow any specific data distribution? How does the dataset support the parallelization of the task I am trying to solve? Which part of the dataset is certain and which part involves uncertainty? Is there any profit from exporting the dataset in a database system?    Embed Quote Updated 18 May, 2013. 404 views.
