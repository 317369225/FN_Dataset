How do you deal with large data sets in Excel?
Excel is brilliant but it has its limitations. More and more data being added is one of them. It actually has a real limit in terms of number of rows it can handle. It also relies on the power of your computer you're working on. When the dataset starts getting to big, you really need to "upgrade", not only to add more data, but also get back to the original speed of processing, maybe even faster. That's one of the reasons you should try Business Intelligence solutions. As Elana pointed out, you can consolidate all your Excel data, along with numerous other data sources, all in one place. Using a cloud business intelligence solution such as BIME, you can use the power of the cloud model to accelerate data driven decisions. This sample dashboard is easily handling over 10 billion rows of data. BI tools can deal with terabytes of BigData without a problem. This might not be your case in the future, but it's good to know about it and worth the try. Just like Microsoft Excel has set standards it terms of simplicity, BI should be the same, and that's why it's such a pleasure to work with BIME. Hope this helped!    Embed Quote
