As a data scientist, how do you start investigating a data set?
This of course depends on the type of data you have, but here are a few general approaches: 1. Think about WHY you have this data, so that you will primarily be examining the most relevant variables. That is, what question do you want your data to answer? This reduces the chance of stumbling upon false positives by analyzing too much. 2. Graph the key variables of your data. Seeing a picture of your data is more helpful than staring at acres of text output. (Though it is not a replacement.) 3. Graph and compare relevant subsets of your data to get some further insights. 4. Determine relevant statistical tests, not so much for significance, but instead to find general patterns. 5. Since your conclusions will probably be wrong, conclude as little as possible.    Embed Quote
