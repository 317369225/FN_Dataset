Why are the eigenvectors of a co-variance matrix the principal components of the data-set?
The eigenvector that has the largest eigenvalue is the vector along which  the data has the maximum variance. You want to maximize variance of the dimension-reduced data. If the original data is in the basis of vectors and has a cov-matrix . Then, when written as a projection to the vector v that is a lin combiantion of x's, the variance of that data is . Maximizing is basically like looking for the first principal component. Because is symmetric it is relatively easy to see that the vector v that maximizes is the largest eigenvector in . It is then a bit less intuitive, but you can work it out on paper, that if you look for a projection onto a n-dimensional basis V, then you need the n first eigenvectors to maximize .    Embed Quote Updated 28 Nov. 993 views.
