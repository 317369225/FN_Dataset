★What problems in biology involve the collection and analysis of multi-terabyte data sets?
Molecular dynamics simulations on the microsecond scale are getting more and more common. Lots of sampling is required to study thermodynamic properties in both small (disordered peptides) and large systems (such as membrane proteins). A few terabytes of data can be easily generated every week on a large cluster. Also, genome-wide association studies will soon (maybe they are already) be using complete genome sequences of every person in the study (instead of just SNPs).    Embed Quote
