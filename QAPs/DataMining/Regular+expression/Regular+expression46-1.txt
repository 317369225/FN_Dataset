★Do I need to learn regular expressions before using Django?I realize regular expressions are used in django's urls.py files, but is it necessary to learn them or can I use some other type of resource (maybe one that will give me the regex with a sample url) to build my urls.py files?
There are lots of good examples in tutorials, so you could get by without knowing a lot about regular expressions. Obviously it doesn't hurt to learn (knowledge is power), and for security reasons it would be wise to make sure you understand what you are doing.    Embed Quote
