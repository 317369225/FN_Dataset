★Regular Expressions (computing): What are the best resources for learning RegEx?
Not a popular answer but IMHO the best resource for learning Regular Expressions is the book "Mastering Regular Expressions (3rd edition)" by Jeffrey E.F. Friedl www.regular-expressions.info is an online resource which is also very good and is authored by Jan Goyvaerts who is a co-author (along with the regex legend Steven Levithan) of the book "Regular Expression Cookbook". Jan also built the Windows based regex program "RegexBuddy" which is tragically not available on any other platform :-( this program has amazingly good features. The best feature being a regex performance/backtracking tool. Well worth buying if you're on a Windows machine. UPDATE: an online backtracking regex tool is now available! http://www.regexter.com/    Embed Quote
