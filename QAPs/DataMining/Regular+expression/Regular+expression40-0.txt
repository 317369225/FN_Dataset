★What does '/msi' do in regards to regular expressions?I'm sure this is a ridiculous question to most of you, but I can't find it on Google
Those are modifiers in a Perl regular expression: Matching operations can have various modifiers. Modifiers that relate to the interpretation of the regular expression inside are listed below. Modifiers that alter the way a regular expression is used by Perl are detailed in Regexp Quote-Like Operators in perlop and Gory details of parsing quoted constructs in perlop. m Treat string as multiple lines. That is, change "^" and "$" from matching the start or end of the string to matching the start or end of any line anywhere within the string. s Treat string as single line. That is, change "." to match any character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would not match. Used together, as / ms, they let the "." match any character whatsoever, while still allowing "^" and "$" to match, respectively, just after and just before newlines within the string. i Do case-insensitive pattern matching.    Embed Quote
