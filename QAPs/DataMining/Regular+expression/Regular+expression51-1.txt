★Is it necessary to know 'regular expressions' for admissions testing? For class?
As someone who has attended Hack Reactor, I can tell you first hand that as part of my admissions process, I didn't have to use regular expressions. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that the admissions process is not aimed at discovering whether you know every piece of technology out there ... well because that'd be impossible :) Instead, Hack Reactor is an environment that fosters learning and giving you the tools to learn and think logically. Regardless of whether or not it's part of the admissions process, why not learn some of the basics of regex? It's a super valuable skill especially since JavaScript supports it natively!    Embed Quote
