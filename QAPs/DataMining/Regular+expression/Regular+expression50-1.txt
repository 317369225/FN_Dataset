★What is the proper use of / \ ? and + in Regular Expressions?
Hi there, Regular expressions are a great way to extend your Google Analytics implementation in goal set-up and filter enablement. When setting up regular expressions to identify pages, I recommend the following: Open up your Google Analytics reporting interface in a separate tab. Navigate to the 'Top Content' report. This is labeled as "Content > Pages" in the new version of Google Analytics. Search for the page or pages you are identifying in your goal set-up using your regular expression. If your page(s) are identified with the filter, you can feel confident that your regular expression is correct. About the characters... + - This character matches one or more of the previous items. For example,  "regu+lar" matches "reguuuuular", "reguular" and "reguuular". ? - This character matches one or zero of the previous items. For example, "regu?lar" matches "reguular" and "regular". . - This character is a wildcard. It will match any single character, including numbers, letters and symbols. For example, "..." matches "123", "1#2", "ab?", etc. \  - This character turns a regular expression into a regular character. You want to use this character before the character you want to turn into a regular character. For example: "\ ." turns the period into a regular character, and not a wildcard. For your homepage... Unless you have a filter applied to show the full subdomain, you can identify your homepage using "^/$". The "^" requires that the proceeding character be at the beginning of the field, while the "$" requires that the preceeding character be at the end of the field. If you do have a filter applied which shows your homepage in your top content report as "homepage.com/", your regular expression will be "^homepage\.com$". The forward slash, "\", is required because a period, ".", is a wildcard character. Other resources: http://www.regular-expressions.i... http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/r...    Embed Quote
