★What are most interesting (crazy) use cases of regexes (regular expressions)?I recently read this article Battlecode: MIT's longest-running hardcore programming competition and was really impressed with the way regex were used to encode Dijkstra's algorithm. That got me wondering about people who have use regexes in interesting places.
Ever since that fateful day in college, when I learned about Pumping lemma, I've been waiting patiently to use my RegEx skills in an unusual and interesting way, that makes people go, "Wait! Did you just order pizza with our favourite toppings using regular expressions on our facebook timeline?". Never happens. Source: xkcd - Regular Expressions    Embed Quote
