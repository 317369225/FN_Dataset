★Regular Expressions (computing): What is the correct way to pronounce "regex"?I can think of three possibilities: 1.) Reh-gex (hard g) 2.) Rej-ex 3.) Rejects
It is usually pronounced reg (with a hard g as is regular), ex (as in expression). Jan Goyvaerts, the author of RegexBuddy, pronounces it reejecs.    Embed Quote
