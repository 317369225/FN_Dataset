★Are there any good tutorials for learning regular expression?
I can suggest two regular expression tutorials, one for unix shell and one for python. Python The most helpful python example (for me) was the google developer's python course module on regular expressions: Python Regular Expressions There is a lecture on youtube, notes on the google education site, and some excellent practice exercises. Unix shell For a generic unix shell, the most helpful example (for me) was the GREP searching tutorial included with the text editor program TextWrangler. Bare Bones Software | TextWrangler This tutorial is constructed in a purely practical way, clear and concise. It separates writing search patterns from replacement patterns. It provides many examples. One caveat, I do not believe that it explicitly distinguishes basic from extended regular expressions. For that you need a proper UNIX guide.    Embed Quote
