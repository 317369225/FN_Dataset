★Regular Expressions (computing): What is the correct way to pronounce "regex"?I can think of three possibilities: 1.) Reh-gex (hard g) 2.) Rej-ex 3.) Rejects
It depends on what word you think you're saying. The short form "regex" should be treated as a word unto itself, so if that's what you want to say then you should say it /reh-JEKS/. If you're saying "regular expression" but shortening it for convenience, you should pronounce it /REG-ex/ with a harder G. I don't think anyone should say "RegExp" for any reason, unless they're using a language that forces them to (like JavaScript).    Embed Quote
