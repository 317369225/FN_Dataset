★What's the best tutorial on regular expressions?The emphasis is on regular expression theory concerning string matching in computer programming.
I recently discovered http://regexone.com (Learn regular expressions with interactive examples), and have been progressing through the online tutorial.  So far, I'm finding it easier to understand than most of the non-interactive "tutorials" I've found.  I'll probably go through it a few times just to get the concepts to "stick", but I'm taking my time, trying different approaches to each test problem, and trying to figure out the most efficient solution to each one. EDIT: Wow, I didn't realize this thread was so old; it was on the first page of Google when I searched for a similar question.  Hopefully my answer helps someone anyway.    Embed Quote
