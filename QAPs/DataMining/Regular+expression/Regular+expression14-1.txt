★What's the difference between a wildcard and a regular expression?
A regular expression is a pattern used to match text. A wildcard is a component you can use within a regular expression that indicates you are trying to match a more broadly-defined pattern than a specific set of characters. All of these can be regular expressions: word word* (word)* but only the last two use wildcards. The first will match any occurrence of "word", the second will match any occurrence of "wor" followed by any number (including zero) of occurrences of "d", and the third will match any number (including zero) occurrences of "word". The asterisk is the wildcard while the whole thing is the regular expression.    Embed Quote
