★What is wrong with the listed regular expression for use with an IP address?
Evan Priestley's answer is an excellent start to things you should consider. Here are a few others: The numbers in an IP address are limited to 0-255, so [0-9]{1,3} will allow "999" which is invalid. Many IP address ranges are reserved: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res... Finally, your regular expression only handles IPv4 addresses. You should decide if you want to limit your application to not use IPv6. While it's possible to write a regular expression to validate IP addresses, it's not easy and it probably won't be easy to read. Here's a gross example: http://www.regular-expressions.i.... It's probably much easier to do this without a regular expression:  1
