★What are the best resources for learning regular expressions?
This might not be a real answer to your question, but consider it a supplement. If you're like me, your best bet is to come up with something that you want to do that involves regular expressions, and fumble around with it until it works. Try making some regex website scrapers in Ruby (which has very natural and perl-ish syntax) or Python (which is very OO structured and full-featured). Pick a section of Craiglist and make something that extracts the titles and prices of cars or whatever. Yes, I know that regex is not the preferred way to work with HTML, but it's an exercise. It won't give you the in-depth understanding of mechanics that reading a book will, but you'll have a functional, practical base to move forward on. For bonus experience, do the above in vim.    Embed Quote
