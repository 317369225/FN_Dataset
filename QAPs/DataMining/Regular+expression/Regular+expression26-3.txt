★How common is it to be asked to implement Regular Expression matching in interview?
It is practically impossible to implement a full fledged regular expression matcher in a typical interview scenario and I have never heard of such a question being asked to anyone whom I know. But I have heard of such a question being asked few times in interviews for a restricted regular expression syntax. See Regular Expression Matching for one such example, a simpler question is forget the wildcard character also just build a regex matcher with support for * i.e. patterns like ab*caade*f*g. These kind of restrictions allow one to attack the problem even without the knowledge of formal language theory. When faced with such a scenario it is better to inform the interviewer that you are touch of automata for whatever reasons than trying to reformulate automata theory from ground rules in an interview. Probably then interviewer can give you a hint that the problem can be solved without the knowledge of it. If it really requires the knowledge of automata ideally the interviewer should move on to a different question as there is no point picking a candidates weak points and testing on them unless the interviewer (or their company) feel that it is too core a area for which the candidates ignorance can't be allowed. I personally feel finite automaton is a must know thing for all CS graduates, probably the perception will change after spending few more years in the industry. If I were to ask a question based on it in an interview I would never ask something that needs deeper theoretical knowledge like equivalence classes and stuff. I would ask something that exploits basic functioning of an automata and I would even help someone who has lost touch with the field to recollect how a automaton functions to be fair enough for them.    Embed Quote
