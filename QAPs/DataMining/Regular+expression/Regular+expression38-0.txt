★What does {mean in regular expression?Could anybody explain this with an example? Try this one: [0-9]{2,4}\.
That {} stands for repetition. <exp>{x} matches with <exp> repeated x times. <exp>{x,y} matches with <exp> repeated x times or x+1 times or ....y times. The given <exp>=[0,9]{2,4} matches anything from 00 to 9999    Embed Quote
