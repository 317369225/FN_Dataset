★Which method of regular expression in Python is more efficient and why?
Honestly, the mild inefficiency of regular expressions is unlikely to be noticed given the enormous inefficiency of reading a file from disk. Still, it's likely slightly more efficient to compile your expressions before using them, as in your first method. This is more likely to be true if the expression is complex. Using the regular expression on each individual line means you're recompiling it for each line (maybe!). Given that you're using a script language, you should probably run a timer on both methods and see what actually happens. It's quite common for something unintuitive to be faster due to the arcane machinations of the underlying execution environment.    Embed Quote
