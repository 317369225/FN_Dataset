★What is a good regular expression to match spaces?I want to check if a string contains only spaces. Single spaces are allowed, but not as a full string of spaces.
Tristan's will work but will also match an empty string. If you don't want this you can use: ^\s+$ To only match multiple spaces: \s\s+    Embed Quote
