★How would you make a regular expression match everything but a certain string?
This might be too hard for me as now since I'm just learning how to use regular expression like 4 days ago.  Nonetheless, I came up with this regex and using it under egrep tool/flavor.  So my regex solution to your question would be: egrep -i '^(.*([^h][^e][^l][^l][^o]))$' With regex above, I was able to single out any string that carried a word "hello" within it.  Since egrep -i means it's case insensitive, therefore no matter the case of the word hello, the regex is still going to single out the word "hello."  I hope this would help you! So for you to single out any string, just use the format and replace the negation of each single letter of a word or string in place of the hello one.  K?    Embed Quote
