★Do I need to learn regular expressions before using Django?I realize regular expressions are used in django's urls.py files, but is it necessary to learn them or can I use some other type of resource (maybe one that will give me the regex with a sample url) to build my urls.py files?
No you don't. They don't have anything to do with each other. But they are a powerful programming tool which you should know as a programmer. I'm offering a Django class this fall in case you're interested: Building Great Web Backends with Django    Embed Quote
