★What is a good regular expression for preventing XSS attacks in JavaScript?
Although it depends how restrictive you want to be like do you want to block just java scripts and sql tags or want to restrict even formatting tags like <br/> etc. The base expressions can be something like below and you can add any tags which you want to permit.  /^(\s|\w|\d|<br\/>)*?$/    Embed Quote
