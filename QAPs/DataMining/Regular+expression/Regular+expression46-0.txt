★Do I need to learn regular expressions before using Django?I realize regular expressions are used in django's urls.py files, but is it necessary to learn them or can I use some other type of resource (maybe one that will give me the regex with a sample url) to build my urls.py files?
No. Firstly, you can just refer back to documentation if you ever need to do anything. Secondly, really basic operations are quite simple (extracting a single number, etc).    Embed Quote
