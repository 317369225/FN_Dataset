★How common is it to be asked to implement Regular Expression matching in interview?
I have not been asked to implement a regex matcher in an interview, but the concept of a state machine has come up several times. The most common example is the implementation of an HTTP communication library in a browser. Many protocols and designs of web technologies have a state machine as a component. I think it's fair to ask this question because most developers have used regexes at some point and it's natural to wonder how one might implement a regex matching function. If the interviewer restricts the regex capabilities to a small set, it's possible to implement a matching function without knowing automata theory at all. Although, automata theory is certainly fair game considering it's part of the curriculum for most computer scientists. If anyone is interested, here's my quick and dirty implementation of a regex parser and matcher: https://github.com/milkbikis/min...    Embed Quote
