★What are most interesting (crazy) use cases of regexes (regular expressions)?I recently read this article Battlecode: MIT's longest-running hardcore programming competition and was really impressed with the way regex were used to encode Dijkstra's algorithm. That got me wondering about people who have use regexes in interesting places.
The core ideas of regex, our beloved string matching and extraction language, can be easily generalized for other kind of sequences - such as byte streams, matrices, and even code itself! See this talk by Erik Osheim to see this generalization in action, for byte streams and matrices - flatMap(Oslo) Erik Osheim. The generalization is called Kleene Algebra. A couple of screenshots from the talk to pique your interest - seqex, a library for Clojure, attempts to do this specifically for sequences. Since sequences are the data structure that primarily make up Clojure code, this can be put to good use when dealing with macros, and so this library provides a module that does just that!
