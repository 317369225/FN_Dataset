★What is a good regular expression to match spaces?I want to check if a string contains only spaces. Single spaces are allowed, but not as a full string of spaces.
As an add on to Tristan and Patic above I would add that it depends on what programming language you're using. For example, in Ruby "foo\n \nbar" matches /^\s+$/ because ^ and $ only represent newline. In Ruby you would want to use /\A\s+\z/. The sub-heading on your question mentions allowing a single space but not all spaces. If you want to accept "" and " ", but not "  " (two spaces), then consider /\A\s?\z/. Keep in mind also that in many programming languages \s does not include U+3000, the Unicode space character commonly used in Japanese.    Embed Quote
