★What's the best tutorial on regular expressions?The emphasis is on regular expression theory concerning string matching in computer programming.
Constructing an NFA (and from that, a DFA that can be implemented in software) from a regular expresssion is described in the Dragon book  (Compilers - Principles, Techniques and Tools -- Aho Sethi Ullman, 1st edition) in sections 3.6 and 3.7. http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/reg... also runs through most of the same thing. From either (or maybe better, both) you can learn most of what you need to know to construct software that can match input strings to a regular expression.    Embed Quote
