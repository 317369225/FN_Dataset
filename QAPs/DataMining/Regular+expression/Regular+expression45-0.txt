★Are regular expressions a Turing complete language?Can regular expressions do everything that Turing machines can do? If so, may I have an example of computing using Reg Exp?
Regular Expression is not Turing Complete. This is because regular expressions can be turned into Deterministic Finite Automatons (DFAs), which you can read more about on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Det... DFAs are not Turing complete, intuitively, because as an input string travels between two states, its letters are used up and can never be accessed again. Some key aspects of a Turing Machine are that it can move back and forth and access parts of the input string that it has already visited, and it can write symbols down which is like a "memory". Anything that a DFA can do, a Turing machine can do. But a Turing machine can determine much more sophisticated languages than a DFA with its added capabilities, so DFAs are not Turing complete. One simple example of a non-regular language that a Turing machine can decide is the language {"", "01", "0011", "000111", ...}.    Embed Quote
