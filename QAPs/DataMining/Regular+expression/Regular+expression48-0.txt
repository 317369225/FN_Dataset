★Regular Expressions (computing): How would one write a reverse regex engine?Two strings as inputs. Multiple regex expressions are returned that would select string two out of string one. Edit: The above might have been a little unclear. Regular Expressions are used to select parts of a string that follow certain criteria. The task at hand is to, given two strings A and B, generate a regular expression that would return string B if executed on string A.
Trivial answers- $input = string1 $output = s/$input/string2/ or s/.*/string2/ There are infinite ways get string2 from string1. You will need to specify more conditions/restrictions on solutions.    Embed Quote
