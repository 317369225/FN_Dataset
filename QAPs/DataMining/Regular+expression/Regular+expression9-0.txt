★Are there any tools for automatically generating a regular expression from text?Are there tools that can accept a set of strings and automatically generate a concise regular expression that describes the strings in that set?
The Aho-Corasick (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho...) string search algorithm searches for many strings in parallel in a large amount of text. It does this by first building an automaton from the set of strings and then efficiently matching strings using that automaton. Automatons like this can then be converted to concise regular expressions.    Embed Quote
