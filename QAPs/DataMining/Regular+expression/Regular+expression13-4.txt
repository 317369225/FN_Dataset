★What are the most common Regular Expressions one should know?
Go through a tutorial. The easiest regexes are super-simple (like "Bob" to find "Bob"). Character classes and ranges, optional parts, one-or-more or zero-or-more instance matching, n-m instance matching are all easy. Groups and backreferences are handy. I'm ashamed to admin I have to look up positive or negative lookahead whenever I do it: I do it often enough to remember it's there, but not often enough to remember the syntax (maybe once a year). I know there's more to it than I know, but it's one of those happy things where just scratching the surface gives you some benefit, and learning a little more makes it quite a bit more powerful.    Embed Quote
