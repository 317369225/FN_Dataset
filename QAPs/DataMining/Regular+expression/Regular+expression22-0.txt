★Regular Expressions (computing): What is the correct way to pronounce "regex"?I can think of three possibilities: 1.) Reh-gex (hard g) 2.) Rej-ex 3.) Rejects
TMTOWTSI...There's more than one way to say it. The 'reg' part can rhyme with either 'egg' or 'edge'. I prefer 'egg' because I think of it as a shortening of the full phrase (which is what it is).    Embed Quote
