★What are most interesting (crazy) use cases of regexes (regular expressions)?I recently read this article Battlecode: MIT's longest-running hardcore programming competition and was really impressed with the way regex were used to encode Dijkstra's algorithm. That got me wondering about people who have use regexes in interesting places.
I was quite impressed the first time I looked at a Java library for recognising gestures (ezGestures ) and discovered the guy using regexes to decode them. Basically he had an object turn mouse or wii movements into a series of up / down / left / right strokes, represented in a string "UDLR" etc. From that, you could then use regexes to match any combination of strokes and dispatch to whatever you wanted to do. Take home message : if you can translate a sequence of interesting data into a simple alphabetic encoding, you can then use regexes to match and extract patterns from it. They're not just for things that we traditionally think of as "text".    Embed Quote
