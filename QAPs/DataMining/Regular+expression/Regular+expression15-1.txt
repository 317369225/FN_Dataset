★What are some uses of regular expressions in bioinformatics?
Regular expressions are a way to parse text, since we deal with unstructured records or makeshift formats it becomes very evident that we need to have some means to extract only those interesting sections from a data file that we need. Motif search, data preprocessing, format conversions are all ways where regular expressions will save the day. While Perl predominates with its regular expressions engine other languages borrow heavily on its capabilities such as SAS and R. It maybe cryptic to understand but investing enough time to learn that will save u a big amount of hassles and drive your innovative spirit to boundless arenas.    Embed Quote
