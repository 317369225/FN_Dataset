★Are there any tools for automatically generating a regular expression from text?Are there tools that can accept a set of strings and automatically generate a concise regular expression that describes the strings in that set?
A trivial regex is to enclose each of the strings in quotes, but this is  not adaptable and I think this is the missing requirement from your question. Instead of thinking of this in terms of the tool to produce a pattern it might be more productive to think of the nature of the problem itself.  If the problem is to take arbitrary strings and filter the results and then use those results in a post process then instead of regular pattern matching you could consider statistical Bayesian filtering. Although you will always get a small number of false positives with the Bayesian method I have an itchy feeling that it will outperform regex in processing arbitrary strings once a pattern has been learnt.    Embed Quote
