★What are the regular expressions for abbreviations?
Frankly speaking your question is bit difficult to answer not because I can't answer but cause I'm unaware of all the abbreviations and the list is huge, besides, rest 2 answers are not answering the question. Moving on it'd be possible to answer your query partially if you'd seek answer for a group of abbreviations let's say, regex for abbreviations in medical industry or civil society etc. But again since the list is huge, regex should be designed so that it'd cover all the abbreviations. Also as nabarun said you can create the table and use it as regex.    Embed Quote
