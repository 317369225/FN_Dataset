★Which method of regular expression in Python is more efficient and why?
The short answer is to measure the different approaches; e.g., using the timeit module. It seems like the question is about whether pre-compiling a pattern is faster, and that should be the case.  The global functions (re.search(), re.sub(), ...) cache compiled patterns, but if your code can compile the pattern once, then it's faster to just use it.  Also, doing pattern.search(line) is faster than re.search(pattern, line) because it skips the caching code. The other consideration is to avoid scanning the line more than once if it's not necessary. For example, there's no need to do a regex search before the substitution. You can just call pattern.sub(...) since it will return the line unchanged if the pattern isn't present.    Embed Quote
