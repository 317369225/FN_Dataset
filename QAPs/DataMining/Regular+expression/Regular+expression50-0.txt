★What is the proper use of / \ ? and + in Regular Expressions?
Here's the documentation for the Google Analytics Regular expressions. It's what you'd expect, but I needed to check in order to be sure: http://www.google.com/support/an... It's almost always best when talking about regular expressions to list out example texts. I'm already a little bit confused by your first question. Does your home page include characters that come after the dot.com? An example of something that would come there is a tracking code like dot.com/?utm_campaign=foo. I'm just going to use my home page as an example. Visitors to my blog come in to these three cases: http://stubbleblog.com http://stubbleblog.com?blahblahblah http://stubbleblog.com/ http://stubbleblog.com/?blahblah... So the regular expression to match all four is (caveat, I didn't test this) \.com\/?(\?.*)?$ The core characteristics and differences from your example are: The optional quanitfier (?) needs to come after the thing that's optional. In the case above, the trailing / after the domain is optional and the "?blahblah" query string is optional. I'm using the anchor ($) like you did which means we need a regular expression that matches all the way to the end of the string. That way you don't get hit by something weird like dot.com/foo.com. This is probably a really minor edge case. (\?.*) describes the query string. I think this replaces the reason you might have been tempted to bring out the + quantifier. In your second question. What you want is the first option with the \. That modifies the start of the query string (?) so that it isn't treated like a regular expression operator. Don't use the + in your second example. That plus modifies the preceding w and would match something like newwwwww.    Embed Quote
