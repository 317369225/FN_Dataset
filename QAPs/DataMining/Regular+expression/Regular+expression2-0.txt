★What are good examples of regular expressions?
You’ll definitely want to take a look at Russ Cox’s articles before you write a regexp library.  In “Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast”, he uses the regexps a?a, a?a?aa, a?a?a?aaa, … as benchmarks.  It turns out that most common implementations take exponential time to match those regexps against a, aa, aaa, …, respectively, although good algorithms do this much faster. I think my favorite example is the 10793-character regexp that I wrote to test a positive (base 10) integer for divisibility by 7.  (I constructed it using an algorithm that translates a nondeterministic finite automaton into a regexp.)    Embed Quote
