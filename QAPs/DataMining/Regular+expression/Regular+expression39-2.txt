★Can you explain what this regular expression r'^$' means in Python?
A regular expression of: ^$ is an empty string.  (When not in "MULTILINE" mode then it will match an empty line). In this case the r prefix on the string literal is superfluous.  However, it is conventionally used for regular expression literals.  r'' (and other r prefixed Python quoting forms) are for defining "raw" strings ... which is to say that they are strings for which the (almost) no evaluation of the string is done for \ character sequences. Raw strings are preferred when defining regular expressions in Python because otherwise the use of \ characters in regular expressions is easily conflated (by the human readers of the code) with those used to express various (normal) string literal characters.  So using normal (evaluated) strings for regular expression entails many \\ sequences which are harder to read and maintain. I say "almost" because \' (backslash, single quote) is actually available to escape the single quote character, for example.  It's just that the various \n \t \xXXX (ASCII hexadecimal) and other escape sequences are not evaluated in raw strings).    Embed Quote
