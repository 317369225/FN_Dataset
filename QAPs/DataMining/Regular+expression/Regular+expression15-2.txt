★What are some uses of regular expressions in bioinformatics?
Example: Suppose you have the human genome data, and you only want to work with coding regions.  We know that each of these sequences must begin with a start codon (plus initiation factors) and end with a stop codon.  For this example, assume the only possible start codon is AUG, the only possible stop codon is UAG, and initiation factors can be ignored.  Thus, we can write a regular expression to match sequences that begin with AUG and end with UAG, and then we run a script that only keeps sequences that match the regular expresison.  s/AUG.*UAG/g In reality, there are many possible start/stop codons and initiation factors must be accounted for, but regular expressions are very powerful and can be modified to match multiple types of patterns.    Embed Quote
