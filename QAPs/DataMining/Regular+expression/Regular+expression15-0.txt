★What are some uses of regular expressions in bioinformatics?
To add to Jonas' answer, I think regular expressions is one of the things about programming that make biology bareable. Imagine you receive a dataset with about a million sequences, each sequence being about 300 base-pairs long. The DNA alphabet is only 4 letters long, so you will see a zillion A's, T's, G's, and C's in what will seem like zillions of combinations and permutations. Now imagine you only want to examine sequences which have a certain coding region, lets say ATCCCCAGTACAACAAGTAG. Or imagine the case where you want to extract sequences which start with ATGCACAG, have a certain combination of bases following immediately after (something variable), and end with GGTCACCCCC. These are just a few examples. Thinking about when I most often use regular expressions, it would have to be when I work with gene expression datasets or am looking for homologous genes.    Embed Quote
