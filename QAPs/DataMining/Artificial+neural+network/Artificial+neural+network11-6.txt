How can I learn about artificial neural networks if I don't know anything about this field?
Engulf yourself in the research and seek opportunities to engage in mock or reversed engineered experiences.  The most often overlooked source of experience is in colleges.  Your free labor to a professor and approached the right way, you can learn from ground up by providing your time and energy for his menial tasks gaining increasing knowledge and as a result, opportunity to learn. Ultimately, fields like this are still bleeding edge and the superstars have yet to emerge.  You have the opportunity to gain a foundation quickly, if you apply yourself.  Read articles,  connect with anyone who knows the slightest about the topic, take courses, take extensions of courses related to it, read books, read journals, experiment, and fail often and fast.    Embed Quote
