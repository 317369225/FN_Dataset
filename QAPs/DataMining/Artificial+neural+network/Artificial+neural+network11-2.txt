How can I learn about artificial neural networks if I don't know anything about this field?
Thanks for A2A. If you are new to the field of machine learning then neutral networks will be a lot easier to get to grips with if you learn some simpler models like linear / polynomial regression and logistic regression first. As mentioned in a comment I would highly recommend Prof. Andrew Ng's course (even if you just preview the lectures): https://class.coursera.org/ml-00... This covers the basics in a very accessible way to get you up to speed and able to implement more complex algorithms like neutral networks surprisingly quickly. It is worth noting that this is not a field you are likely to become an expert in overnight, so whilst you should (with a decent maths and programming background) pick up enough from this course to be able to implement learning algorithms for a lot of problems you will still be learning for some time to come. https://www.kaggle.com is a great way to practice your new found skills. It is also a good way of assessing how far your skills have come and measuring yourself against others in the field.    Embed Quote Updated 18 Mar. 671 views. Asked to answer by Anonymous.
