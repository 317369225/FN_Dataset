How can I learn about artificial neural networks if I don't know anything about this field?
Don't bother with neural networks, it's waste of your time. As AI students we were all interested only in neural networks. Holy grail of our study was to learn magic behind NN and solve all world's problem by our own NNs. University has been trying to teach us something about statistics, linear regression, decision trees, expert systems. No no no, we didn't listen too much. Had flaps on our eyes and wanted only NN. It's the most cool algorithm, superior to all others! Isn't it? Actually NN are one of the worst algorithms for all machine learning novices. Because: 1. They are black boxes and don't tell you much about your data. 2. When you don't know your data, you make ugly mistakes. 3. There's no feature selection process in NN, you have to pre-select right predictors with another algorithm or process (PCA, ...) 4. Training of NN takes ages and usually produces overfit models (perfect on training data, useless on unseen). I would recommend everybody interested in machine learning to start with Decision Trees and Linear/Logistic regression. Learn about KDD process, CRISP DM methodology, master data understanding and preparation process. Then it's easy to use many other machine learning algorithms including NN, SVM or Random Forests. When you know how to use them properly you'll achieve great results with each of them.    Embed Quote
