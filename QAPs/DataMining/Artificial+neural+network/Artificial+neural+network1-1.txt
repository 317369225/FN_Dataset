Why aren't artificial neural networks used for everything?
Because there's generally better solutions available for most problems. While in theory multilayered neural networks can approximate any function, in practice you need a huge amount of training data and processing time to even approach something useful. In most cases it makes more sense to just use a human designed heuristic solution or alternatively a more modern machine learning approach such as SVMs or RandomForests.    Embed Quote
