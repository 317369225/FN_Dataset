How can I learn about artificial neural networks if I don't know anything about this field?
I am currently doing my summer project in this topic. You can follow the following books and links to gain a basic knowledge and then you have to work through yourself. There are many good online references and ebooks available for this particular subject. 1. "Neural Networks, a comprehensive foundation, 2nd edition" by Simon Haykin. This is considered as the most basic book to gain theoretical knowledge of the subject. 2. You can follow lectures of IIT Kharagpur here: http://nptel.ac.in/courses/11710... 3. You can also follow this course on coursera: https://www.coursera.org/course/... 4. This page is also good for gaining understanding of neural networks http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs94... You must also gain a good knowledge of statistics and probability as it plays a vital role in artificial neural networks. Best of Luck. :)    Embed Quote
