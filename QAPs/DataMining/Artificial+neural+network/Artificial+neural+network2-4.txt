What problems in artificial intelligence cannot be addressed using artificial neural networks?
Neural Networks by nature are algorithms that can be applied to any data set. So it is not a binary yes or no for where you can apply them.  The important thing is to have a proper score function that operates on test data that was not used to train the NN. And by proper, I just mean something that can give you a metric as to how well your algorithm performed out of sample (if its a classification problem, you could use sensitivity vs 1-specificity). Also to echo Sjoerd, NN's are in fact black boxes that do not reveal anything about the underlying nature of the data corpus. The genesis of NN's was geared towards predictive problems, unlike normal statistics which was and is concerned with underlying nature and distributions. There exists a whole body of well researched and robust techniques to model data and fit it to a distribution ( hypothesis testings, goodness of fit tests, etc) and it is all unrelated to the goal of Neural Networks.    Embed Quote
