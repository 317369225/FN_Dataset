How do artificial neural networks learn?
Your question is too broad. Neural networks include Artificial Neural Networks, both software and hardware simulations, and the real deal inside your brain. This latter is still a black box in many senses. Assuming you meant ANN, this is relative. Giri Gopalan and others here gave a very good answers for second generation neural networks - the Multi-Layer Perceptron and the paradigms it inspired. But these aren't the sole representatives of the field of neural networks (see Types of artificial neural networks at Wikipedia. Other neural networks, like the McCulloch-Pitts Neurons, don't learn - they are static, pre-programmed, calculus tools. Other like Kohonen's SOM (or Goal Seeking Neurons and related weightless ANNs) just try to map neighboring concepts using topological and geometrical concepts, without any cost or goal function. Other like the   Neural Assemblies by João Ranhel have potential for learning, but noone implemented it yet.    Embed Quote
