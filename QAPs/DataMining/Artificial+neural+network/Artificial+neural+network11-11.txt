How can I learn about artificial neural networks if I don't know anything about this field?
You would learn it my friend. Artificial neural network (ANN) is an algorithm which try to replicate human brain in a form a computational model that can be used for solving  problems in the field of Artificial intelligence (AI).  If you don't know any thing about AI then you have to first get an introduction to  AI,  in this case I would advise you to  start online course on Coursera  for an introduction to  Machine learning and AI, may be this one  Coursera in this course you will also get an introduction to ANN at the right moment. And if you already have a good feel about AI and only want to learn about ANN my advise would be to follow this course Coursera.    Embed Quote
