What is better for creating artificial neural network - python or lisp?
I'm not sure which is better inherently, but I know python fairly well and I think it's well suited to everything (cue smug look) because it's easy to get something up and running quick, with possibility of performance optimizations in areas you care about (bottlenecks) without sacrificing development time, like if you wrote it in C++ (or Lisp, since it takes some more brain power I think). Also, there are lots of resources for doing NNs in python, most importantly libraries, so this might be the ultimate reason to use python.
