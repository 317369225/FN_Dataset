★How do outliers affect normal distribution in statistics?
Technically, a distribution doesn't have outliers. I'm assuming you mean a sample of data from a distribution that is thought to be normal. First, you have to define "outlier" more precisely. Second, you have to consider the sample size.  Some people define an outlier as being more than X sd from the mean; this is not a good definition, in my view, but it is common. Then if you have a large sample size, you ought to get outliers if the variable is normally distributed. In a large sample of adult humans you will find some who are 7 feet tall. Not many, but some. However, I think a better definition of an outlier (albeit one that is not precise) is "a surprising point".    Embed Quote
