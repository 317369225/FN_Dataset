★What is an intuitive explanation for how the t-distribution, normal distribution, F-distribution and Chi-square distribution relate to each other?Why do all these different distributions exist and how do we use them in statistics? What influences the choice of distribution in statistical testing?
It all starts with the Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit theorem. Consider sample mean . According to Central Limit theorem ~N(0,1). Now when you square a standard normal random variable Z~N(0,1) the resulting distribution is a Chi Squared distribution ie ~. If Sn is the sample standard deviation, using the definition of Sn and the above result we can show that ~. Thats why we use Chi-Squared test for Variance. T- distribution is a little complicated. Consider a standard normal random variable Z~N(0,1) and Chi Squared random variable U~ We can prove that ~t-distribution with (r-1) degrees of freedom. Using this result we can show that ~t(n-1). So, if you don't know the population standard deviation you can use sample standard deviation but the resulting distribution won't be standard normal but it will be a t-distribution. For F-Distribution, consider U~ and V~. ~F(r1,r2). So ratio of distribution follows F distribution. We know that Variance follows distribution, so for ratio of variance we use F distribution    Embed Quote
