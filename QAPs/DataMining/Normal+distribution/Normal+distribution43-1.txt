★Is it possible to visualize covariance in a bivariate normal distribution in a straightforward way, similar to variance in a univariate normal distribution?
Yes. In fact, the diagonals of the covariance matrix are simply the independent variance terms of the different dimensions. For example, a 2-D normal distribution with covariance matrix 5 0 0 2 means it's formed from 2 independent normal distributions with variance 5 and 2, respectively. If the off-diagonals are 0, it means there is no correlation (correlation is a normalized form of covariance) between the different components of the normal distribution.  If they are not zero, then there is correlation between the components. Covariance matrices are always symmetric because the covariance between x and y is the same as between y and x. For your second question, it's answered here: Covariance and correlation. But essentially, you can say that the correlation between x and y is equal to the covariance between x and y divided by the square root of the product of the variances of x and y. E.g. for the covariance matrix 25 10 10  4 We get the correlation between x and y as: 10 / sqrt( 25 * 4 ) = 1.0    Embed Quote
