★How do I derive normal distribution and why can it apply to so many things?I never understood why things would converge to normal distribution, and how people derived the complicated formula. Can anyone try to explain that?
The story of the discovery of normal distribution goes something like this: Abraham de Moivre, our resident gambling consultant, was looking at probability mass function of the binomial distribution. (Image Source: Wikipedia) de Moivre observed that as he increased the number of trials, the "blocks" increased in number and outline was getting smoother and smoother into a curve. This was the first discovery of the curve, however de Moivre did not discover the form of the distribution. However, it seems he did discover the equation for the curve in terms of the binomial parameter [1]. In a different branch of statistics, people were studying errors in estimation and those who studied them found that errors were usually symmetrical and that it seems to follow the curve discovered by de Moivre. Later, Gauss produced the precise expression of the curve as we know it today. Now, I don't know how Gauss proved it, but one way to discover the expression for normal distribution is to look at the binomial distribution and then studying its limit when we let the number of trials tend to infinity. I will leave this as an exercise for you, since you asked "how *you* could derive the normal distribution". [1] de Moivre–Laplace theorem    Embed Quote
