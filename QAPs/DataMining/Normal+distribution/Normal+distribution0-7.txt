★Why do we use the normal distribution?
The central limit theorem states that under fairly general conditions, a wide range of distributions - binomial, poisson, - that are characterized by an analytic equation tend to the normal distribution as sample size goes to infinity. This is useful to know for things that there's a large number of - atoms, for instance - useful for statistical mechanics. So using the normal distribution is justified insofar as any natural processes closely fit a wide range of distributions. An open question remains. Why teach parametric statistics first instead of non parametric statistics (distributions not assuming you are able to characterize them with a few judicious parameters)?    Embed Quote
