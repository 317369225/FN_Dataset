★Why is the probability of a normally distributed variable being an exact value 0?I understand that it's like taking the area of an infinitesimally small rectangle, but it seems unsatisfying as surely there has to be at least some chance in a lot of situations of X being an exact value.
Look at it this way.  In any real experiment you can never measure a value to perfect accuracy.  You can only measure a value to within a certain range of error.  Thus for any real situation you only really measure whether the observed value falls in some range (of error), so, in this case, you always have a non-zero probability for any measurement.    Embed Quote
