★Why normal distribution has an indefinite integral?Unless you integrate from minus infinite to infinite, you can't do integration on normal dist. formula. Why?
The density of the normal distribution can be integrated: we have where .  There's no closed form expression for in terms of elementary functions, but we understand its properties very well and we can easily compute its numerical values.    Embed Quote
