★What is a Normal Distribution curve? What does its Y-axis denote?I understand that a normal distribution can be observed with a Histogram. But I do not understand how this can be represented using only a curve. Given a Data set, could someone give me an example of the calculation and the significance of a continuous normal distribution curve?
The curve is a theoretical construct, and not something you can directly observe from data.  The distribution of a continuous random variable can be represented by its density, which is the function such that .  A random variable has a standard normal distribution if .  We can use all this machinery to calculate the probabilities of whatever events we're interested in assuming that our data is normally distributed. There is some limit theory that says that if you get a lot of data and make the bins of your histogram sufficiently narrow, then your histogram will be close to the normal curve, but that's really the only connection between data and these curves.    Embed Quote
