★How do I derive normal distribution and why can it apply to so many things?I never understood why things would converge to normal distribution, and how people derived the complicated formula. Can anyone try to explain that?
You can derive the Gaussian or normal distribution as the maximum entropy distribution with a given mean and variance.   As we know from thermodynamics, entropy in the universe is increasing, so we expect to find the universe in relatively high entropy states.  So we expect maximum entropy distributions to describe many physical conditions.   You can't really define a maximum entropy distribution with a single parameter (say the mean), so most other maximum entropy distributions will have lower entropy than the Gaussian.    Embed Quote
