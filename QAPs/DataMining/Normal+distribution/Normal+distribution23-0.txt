★Why is normal distribution the most popular and the most feasible?
I don't think "popular" and "feasible" are exactly the right words here, but I get your point (I think). The normal distribution arises a lot because of the central limit theorem. Under the CLT, physical quantities that are the sum of many small independent processes are distributed (close to) normally.  That would cover things like height and weight. If I understand "feasible" correctly it is because (despite the complexity of the formula) the normal distribution has some nice mathematical properties. This was vitally important for a long time, but is becoming less so since computers are becoming powerful and ubiquitous.    Embed Quote
