★Why does the frequency of so many events appear to be normally distributed?This may be  unanswerable, but I'm looking for some explanation as to why the frequency of so many events (especially in nature) manifest as a symmetrical cluster about a mean, with frequency decreasing as it moves away from the mean.
As I mentioned in my comment to your question--normal distribution of data is easily explained by the central limit theorem.  Your observation that events and/or their frequency are normally distributed does not fit that paradigm.  An example of a dataset for which this seems to be the case would be helpful. Page on wilmott.com The Dynamics of Financial Markets—Mandelbrot’s Multifractal Cascades, and Beyond by Jean-Philippe Bouchaud et al is useful as a mid-level summary of the mathematics of scaling, fat-tailed distributions and black swan events. Many distributions for which a normal or Poisson distribution is mathematically convenient, upon further examination are NOT!  Failure to recognize the exceptions leads to unforeseen risks and, for markets, severe crashes and disruptions.    Embed Quote
