★Does human intelligence really follow a normal distribution?
IQ scores are normally distributed because they are designed to be so. Even  if the distribution of scores starts to become skewed in one direction or another over time, the scores will eventually be renormalized to correct for this. Intelligence, which IQ aims to measure, is a much more nebulous term which (as far as I'm aware) has no commonly agreed upon definition which is rigorous enough to be quantified. I know this doesn't answer your question but I think it's something to keep in mind. Precision is not the same as accuracy.    Embed Quote
