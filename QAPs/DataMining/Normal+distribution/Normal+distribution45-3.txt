★What does the value of a point on the normal distribution actually represent, if anything?I know that the CDF is just the definite integral of a certain interval of the normal distribution function, but what is the meaning/significance/application, if any, of the actual y-values of the function?
This reminds me of a very nice expression: "a text without a context is just a pretext."  As Michael Lamar kind of stated, you really need to look at each "point" in relation to [the] others. The whole function is what uniquely determines your model, not any one point.  You can definitely find an infinite number of models that will pass through each "y-value" (in [0,1] ) for any x value on the reals. I think that this would necessarily imply that your answer is -how you have stated- "if any."  There really is no interpretation without the entire function. And just to reiterate: the "y-value," aka F(x), is -by definition- the probability of observing a value less than or equal to x, under your specified model.  That's some fairly strong information, you know.    Embed Quote
