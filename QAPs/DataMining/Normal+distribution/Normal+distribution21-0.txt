★Why is the Normal distribution called Normal?
Initially the normal distribution was called as "Gaussian distribution" after the famous mathematician ”GAUSS”. The name normal was attributed later due to great statistician Karl E. Pearson, who said, “Many years ago [in 1893] I called the Laplace-Gaussian curve the normal curve, which name, while it avoids the international question of priority, has the disadvantage of leading people to believe that all other distributions of frequency are in one sense or another abnormal.” At first it was customary to refer to Gauss’s error curve as the Gaussian curve and Pearson, unaware of De Moivre’ s work, was trying to reserve some of the credit of discovery to Laplace. By the time he realized his error, the normal curve had become one of the most widely applied of all mathematical tools and nothing could have changed its name. The popularity of the curve was driven further by the advent of central limit theorem and its applications in drawing statistical inferences over the mean of random variables relevant in experimental data. And thus the name of the error curve was based on a misconception!! Credits: Online GATE, "The Life and Times of the Central Limit Theorem"    Embed Quote
