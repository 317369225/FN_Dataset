★Why the normal distribution can't be integrated from minus infinite to infinite?
In the comments to your question, you explain that you want to know why isn't there an elementary function whose derivative is the density function of the normal distribution. There are a lot of functions that don't have elementary antiderivatives.  An elementary function is built out of arithmetic operations, powers, roots, trig functions, inverse trig functions, logarithmic functions, exponential functions, and composition. is not the derivative of any elementary function.  Another way of saying that is that is a nonelementary integral. For some time it was suspected that lots of vexing integrals were nonelemenary. In the 1830s Liouville determined the form the elementary integrals had to have and verified that this and other suspected nonelementary integrals were, in fact, nonelementary. If you write down any moderately complicated function, there's a good chance that its integral is nonelementary. Since many of these integrals are important, new transcendental functions have been defined for them. Although they're nonelementary, they can still be studied using calculus and power series.    Embed Quote
