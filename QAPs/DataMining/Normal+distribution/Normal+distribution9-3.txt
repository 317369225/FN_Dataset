★Why does π appear in the density of a normal distribution?What does the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter have to do with the distribution of heights in a first-grade class?
"Why?" is a tough word in mathematics, since it's all connected. And, in any case, things are either true or not, so it's not like we can flip a switch on the truth or falsity of one statement and see how it affects others. That said, I'd like to offer a small correction to Michael's otherwise superb answer. There is NO reason to expect the actual heights in a first-grade classroom to follow a normal distribution, and this in fact has nothing to do with the central limit theorem. To see this, consider that, in the adult human population, Men and Women have VERY different height distributions -- their means differ by about 5 inches in the US population -- and a random assortment of adults with about half men and half women will in fact not be likely to be normal. What you WOULD expect to see as roughly normal is the AVERAGE heights in a large number of first-grade classes. That is when the central limit theorem applies, and the normal distribution kicks in: when we look at the MEAN of a "large" (greater than 30 or so, usually) number of randomly selected units, and do this many times.    Embed Quote
