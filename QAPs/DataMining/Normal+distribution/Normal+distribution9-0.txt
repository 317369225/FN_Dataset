★Why does π appear in the density of a normal distribution?What does the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter have to do with the distribution of heights in a first-grade class?
There are two questions combined here: Why does the normal distribution describe the distribution of heights in a first-grade class? How does enter into the mathematics of the normal distribution?Part 1 might be explained by the Central Limit Theorem (look it up), if it's even true. But I think you're more interested in part 2. The standard normal density is proportional to . It needs to be multiplied by the constant in order to integrate to 1. So we can rephrase the question: why does The trick to seeing how circles are involved is to make this into a two-dimensional question. Why is: In other words, why does Now it is starting to look a little bit circley. We are integrating the function   over the whole plane. Since is the squared distance from the origin to the point (x, y), this function is constant on each circle of radius r centered at the origin.  This makes the integral a good candidate for rewriting in polar coordinates (ranging over the plane in terms of angle and distance from the origin instead of horizontal and vertical displacement). And that's where the comes in.  The rest is easy.    Embed Quote
