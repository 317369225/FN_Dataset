★How do I derive normal distribution and why can it apply to so many things?I never understood why things would converge to normal distribution, and how people derived the complicated formula. Can anyone try to explain that?
I don't understand what you mean exactly by 'deriving' the normal distribution. To understand why normal distribution is everywhere in the world, let's think about an example. Consider the height of homo-sapiens, i.e., height of people. The average hight of a (adult) person is 170cm (~67in). Most of the adult population have height between 150cm-190cm, right? There are few people below 150cm or above 190. There are very very few people below 130cm or above 210cm. This is what exactly normal distribution is! Most of the data found to be around the mean, and very few data at the extreme values. Here is the distribution of height. The same idea will apply to almost any other variable you can think of. Surely, one can find examples where this will not be the case (e.g., some very persistent or crazy behaving variables or always increasing/decreasing variables).    Embed Quote
