★Why is the probability of a normally distributed variable being an exact value 0?I understand that it's like taking the area of an infinitesimally small rectangle, but it seems unsatisfying as surely there has to be at least some chance in a lot of situations of X being an exact value.
Maybe this will help. The probability that it takes on the value 3 is less than the probability that it falls between 2.9 and 3.1, and it is also less than the probability that it falls between 2.99 and 3.01, and it is also less than the probability that it falls between 2.999 and 3.001, and so on. We can make these probabilities as small as we like, so if the probability of hitting exactly 3 is less than all of them it must be 0.    Embed Quote
