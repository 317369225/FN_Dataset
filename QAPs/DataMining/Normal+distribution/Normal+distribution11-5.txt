★Why is the probability of a normally distributed variable being an exact value 0?I understand that it's like taking the area of an infinitesimally small rectangle, but it seems unsatisfying as surely there has to be at least some chance in a lot of situations of X being an exact value.
This will always happen with a variable that has a continuous distribution. 1)  There is an uncountably infinite number of values on the real number  line.  Even if you take a small subset of the line like [-1,1] or even  [-0.0001, 0.0001] there will still be an uncountably infinite number of  real numbers on the segment. 2) In statistics, the sum of the the  probabilities of *all* possible outcomes must be 1 (or 100%).  In other  words, when we're looking at a plot of a normal curve (Probability vs  Value), we expect the area underneath the curve to be 1. 3) Given the two previous statements:     * There are uncountably infinite points, or "exact values" on the real number line.     * The integral of P(X=y) for all real numbers y must be 1. We can come to the conclusion that if P(X) were nonzero, the integral of P(X) would be infinity. Consider  the dx in calculus. It's value is very very similar to 0, but it's not  exactly 0, otherwise we wouldn't be able to integrate. When  working with continuous distributions, we look at *densities*, not  probabilities.  Densities are each value's relative likelihood, in ratio  to other values.  In other words - divide by 0. ;)    Embed Quote
