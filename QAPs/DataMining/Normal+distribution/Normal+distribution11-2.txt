★Why is the probability of a normally distributed variable being an exact value 0?I understand that it's like taking the area of an infinitesimally small rectangle, but it seems unsatisfying as surely there has to be at least some chance in a lot of situations of X being an exact value.
Another piece of intuition - while your experiment must take on "some" value, that value is rational with probability zero. There are infinitely many real numbers between any two rational numbers. So your brain just thought of a number "3" and that seems like a totally reasonable possibility. It isn't. Probabilistically, the only way you get a number you can write down is due to measurement error. So yes, you must get "some number" and that seems to contradict the fact that every number occurs with probability zero. But the number you get is going to be irrational with probability one. And when you think of a random number, you're probability thinking of a rational number (or some common transcendental number like pi or e).    Embed Quote
