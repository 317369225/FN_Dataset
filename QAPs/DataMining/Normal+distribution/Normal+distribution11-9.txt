★Why is the probability of a normally distributed variable being an exact value 0?I understand that it's like taking the area of an infinitesimally small rectangle, but it seems unsatisfying as surely there has to be at least some chance in a lot of situations of X being an exact value.
Excerpt from Wikipedia: In probability theory, one says that an event happens almost surely (sometimes abbreviated as a.s.) if it happens with probability one.[1] The concept is analogous to the concept of "almost everywhere" in measure theory. While in many basic probability experiments there is no difference between almost surely and surely (that is, entirely certain to happen), the distinction is important in more complex cases relating to some sort of infinity. For instance, the term is often encountered in questions that involve infinite time, regularity properties or infinite-dimensional spaces such as function spaces. Basic examples of use include the law of large numbers (strong form) or continuity of Brownian paths. The terms almost certainly (a.c.) and almost always (a.a.) are also used. Almost never describes the opposite of almost surely; an event which happens with probability zero happens almost never.[2] (Link: Almost surely. The entire article would be relevant for this question.) So the idea is that for an event that has probability zero, it is not necessary that it never happens, rather it happens almost never. If the sample space is infinite, and the event happens only for a finite number of outcomes from this infinite sample space, then the probability comes out to be zero, but the event still has some (very little) chance of occurring.    Embed Quote
