★Why is the probability of a normally distributed variable being an exact value 0?I understand that it's like taking the area of an infinitesimally small rectangle, but it seems unsatisfying as surely there has to be at least some chance in a lot of situations of X being an exact value.
I imagine that your intuition comes from considering a discrete system, such as a computerized random number generator.  For any discrete system with only a finite number of possible outcomes (e.g. if a number is representated by N bits, then there can only be 2^N possible outcomes), then a truly normal distribution is impossible, and each possible outcome will have a small nonzero probability.  A truly normal distribution must be defined on a continuous field.  In this case, the probability of any particular number really is zero    Embed Quote
