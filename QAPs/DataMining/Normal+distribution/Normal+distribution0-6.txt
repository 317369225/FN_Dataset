★Why do we use the normal distribution?
Normal is very much observable in nature. Distribution of most things in daily use (rainfall, height, weight, manufacturing error, hundreds of examples) is Normal. Central limit theorem indicates than even non-Normal distribution tends to close to Normal or large enough sample size. Lot of statistical techniques, even daily-use ones like linear regression, have Normal distribution at their heart. It's a very good approximation if it is one.   Since it's so plentiful and useful, why not memorize couple of numbers which are so central to it? Just because we are making some error by making one assumption doesn't imply that we make bigger error in by adding another assumption. Specifically if cost of not making first assumption is much more complex distribution with higher mathematical rigour and cost of not making second assumption is few bit memory space save in your brain.    Embed Quote
