★Should grades be normally distributed?If so, what does it mean that the histogram of the grades is not Gaussian?
No.  First of all, my classes have a relatively small number of students and thus do not represent the range of intelligence, study habits, preparation, etc., which add up to a student's classroom performance. In my honors and AP courses, the students all belong at the very high end of the intelligence spectrum.  In my other classes, the range can be from weak to strong or from weak to medium or ...  Therefore, a normal distribution curve would not be appropriate for a non-normal distribution of students. Secondly, I teach with the ideal that all students can do well.  Yes, some of my chemistry, physics, and math students learn more easily than others.  But I assume that they can all learn and succeed.  Many times students surprise me with their achievement.  Therefore, a normal curve which assumes a range from excellent to poor is not what I want--I want everyone at the good/very good/excellent portion of the curve.    Embed Quote
