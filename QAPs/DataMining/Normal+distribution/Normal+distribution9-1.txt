★Why does π appear in the density of a normal distribution?What does the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter have to do with the distribution of heights in a first-grade class?
I'm not as smart as these guys with fancy formulas but I may be able to offer a helpful conceptualization. Forget about the exponential part of the distribution for a moment and focus on the: This is equivalent to the radius of a circle whose area is 1/2. Since we know we need to create a distribution that is symmetric about the y-axis we know we need the area under the curve to be 1/2 on each side. Therefore, and perhaps this is a little simplistic, we can think of exp( -x^2 / 2) as a transformation of the unit circle (circle around (0,0) with area 1 and radius 1/sqrt(pi) ). In other words, we are stretching a circle infinitely across the x-axis while maintaining an area under the curve of 1, a maximum y value at x=0, and a exponential curve to fit it all together.    Embed Quote
