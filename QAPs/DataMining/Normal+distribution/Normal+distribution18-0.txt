★What is good way to prove conditional multivariate normal distribution given multivariate normal distribution?
Looks like a homework problem. So i dont want to give you the answer. If you are really stuck, what i can tell you is that the text at the end of your post is itself a big hint in solving this problem. For a multivariate normally distributed random variable the quadratic form is . Expanding this we get where is the precision matrix. Now if you look at this quadratic form closely, the precision matrix (or the covariance matrix) can be deduced from the second-order term of z and the mean can be deduced from the first-order term of z. The last term doesnt matter. Now in your equation (2.70), do some algebraic manipulation and then look at the second-order and first-order terms of xa (treat xb as constant since you are computing the conditional). This should help you arrive at the solution.    Embed Quote
