★What county has a normal distribution of wealth?or as closest as possible.
You will get better answers than this, but a normal distribution of wealth in absolute terms is rather unlikely.  In the first place there is typically a significant portion of the population that will be in debt, thus having no net wealth.  Moreover, at the top end of wealth distributions there are large accumulations of assets that are in no way offset dollar for dollar on the bottom half of a national income distribution.  Looking instead at income distribution only improves this situation a bit.  The Gini coefficients are a common way to measure income inequality, and international comparisons are available on Wikipedia [1], and, in general, the less income inequality there is, the closer you will come to a normal distribution.  It will always depend on whose statistics you are using, but in terms of so-called developed countries, the Scandinavian countries of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark fair well along with Japan, Austria, the Czech Republic, and others.  Historically, communism was designed to equalize wealth with China, for instance, periodically breaking up and redistributing farmland.  Today, Cuba and North Korea has a much less income inequality.  If you really want a normal distribution, I might look at some tribal societies, possibly some of the Pacific island countries.  Vanuatu comes to mind. Good luck. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...  There is a nice feature in the chart that allows you to click at the top of the columns and rank order the data..    Embed Quote
