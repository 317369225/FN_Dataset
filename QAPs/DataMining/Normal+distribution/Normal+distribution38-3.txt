★How do I derive normal distribution and why can it apply to so many things?I never understood why things would converge to normal distribution, and how people derived the complicated formula. Can anyone try to explain that?
Central limit theorem on wiki contains several derivations. I was naively modeling the sum of perhaps 10 dimensions and their tolerances to come up with the tolerance of their sum when Myron Tribus , the former Dean of the Dartmouth School of Engineering pointed out to me that their sum was so close to a normal distribution that modeling to get the result was silly.  Since then I became perhaps too reliant on the principle. Answering the second part of your question: as long as a quantity is the sum of more than a few sub-quantitities, the summed quantity will almost invarably be distributed normally. The components themselves do not need to be normally distributed. There are a few extreme cases, for instance involving fat-tailed distributions (Levy Stable), where the pre-conditions are violated but quantities like sales volume, earnings, dimensions, etc are all instances of the sum of variables.    Embed Quote
