★In statistics, how do t and z/normal distributions differ?
Justin Rising and Jay Verkuilen have great answers. One curiosity that they do not mention is that the Student-T distribution is not an exponential family [1] of distributions. On occasion, this makes it somewhat more difficult to come up with. Also, unlike the Student-T, the normal distribution enjoys the following properties: it is a stable distribution linear combinations of normally distributed random variables are again normally distributed it can be derived as the maximum entropy distribution over when mean and variance are knownThe three points above make it a very popular choice for modeling, as one can often come up with closed-form results and also justify the choice of a normal distribution.
