★Why does the frequency of so many events appear to be normally distributed?This may be  unanswerable, but I'm looking for some explanation as to why the frequency of so many events (especially in nature) manifest as a symmetrical cluster about a mean, with frequency decreasing as it moves away from the mean.
This has already been addressed in the other answers. In short, this remarkable phenomenon comes from the CLT. As long as you have enough observations and finite variance (or something similar and slightly weaker), you will get this behavior. Hope this helps! A link for you to read more about this remarkable phenomenon: Central limit theorem. I will try to find a link to a proof or a better explanation later.    Embed Quote
