★Why is the normal distribution important?
As you said, the assumption that the r.v.s are i.i.d. is often too restrictive for applications "on the street".  Luckily, as long as your r.v.s are "well behaved enough" (in a sense of satisfying the Lyapunov condition (Page on Wolfram) then a generalization of the CLT (Central limit theorem) still holds.
