★How do outliers affect normal distribution in statistics?
It depends on how you treat them.  If you believe they are valuable and representative, you can continue to include them in your sample and you will have a skewed distribution.  If it is skewed you may need to use a chi square probability distribution for analysis or some other similar method of dealing with a distribution that's not normal.  If you believe the outliers really are not representative, and you remove them you maintain the normal distribution along with the assumptions that go along with it.  Here, the risk is that the assumptions may be wrong or invalidated if you removed data that was inconvenient simply to retain a normal distribution.  Just a thought here that Chebychev's inequality can provide usable assumptions in lieu of those behind the empiracle rule when you are dealing with a non-normal or skewed distribution.  So, your probabilities may be less accurate for a skewed distribution treated essentially as a Normal distribution but that may be more acceptable than results from a modified sample. It's really just a judgement call, but you can smooth the data by just obtaining more random samples...and that may be the best solution in the end.    Embed Quote
