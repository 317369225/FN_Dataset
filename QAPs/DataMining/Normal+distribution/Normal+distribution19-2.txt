★Is a contaminated normal distribution distributed normally? Why or why not?Where the contaminated normal distribution is defined as: where is the standard normal density, and .
I'm not nearly clever enough to respond to this using mathematics. Let me do it numerically and graphically. Here's some Python language code that gives values of H(.) and its derivative, using some readily available libraries, and a line to plot the probability density function corresponding to H(.) for the arbitrary values of epsilon and kappa shown: >>> from sympy import * >>> from sympy.mpmath import * >>> def H(x,epsilon=0.01,Kappa=.1): ... return (1-epsilon)*ncdf(x)-epsilon*ncdf(x/Kappa) ... >>> def h(x): ... return diff(H,x) ... >>> plot(h,[-5,5]) Here's the plot. Now, as I've said, I won't attempt to prove it but, if the density function is so non-normal, surely H(.) can't be normal either.    Embed Quote
