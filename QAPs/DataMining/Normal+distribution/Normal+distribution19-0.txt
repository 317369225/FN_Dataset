★Is a contaminated normal distribution distributed normally? Why or why not?Where the contaminated normal distribution is defined as: where is the standard normal density, and .
As Justin Rising noted, this is a mixture of Normals. A mixture of two Normals is not Normal, except in the degenerate case where you're mixing a distribution with itself (for example, when above). Note that as currently stated is not a valid probability density function -- a factor of is needed in front of the second term, so that the function will integrate to 1. For a concrete example of such a mixture and an interesting result that contrasts them with the Normal, see Stat 110 Penultimate Homework #3 (Fall 2011): Page on harvard.edu. That exercise involves a stock that has high volatility on some days and low volatility on other days. It shows how to calculate the kurtosis, which is a standard measure of how heavy the tails of a distribution are. The exercise I mentioned shows that even though any Normal has zero kurtosis, if you mix together two different Normals you get positive kurtosis!    Embed Quote
