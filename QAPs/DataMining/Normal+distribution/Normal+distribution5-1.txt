★What is special about the normal distribution?What special properties does the normal distribution have that cause it to be the distribution that falls out of the central limit theorem? I.e., there are various distributions that are symmetric, roughly bell-shaped, etc. What properties cause the normal distribution to be singled out? What is the intuition behind its specialness?
In addition to Justin's nice point regarding the Normal and the CLT, there are a few other interesting characterizations of the distribution, which might make one think it is "special": The sample mean is independent of the sample variance. If the sum and difference of iid RV's are independent, they must be normals. The normal maximizes entropy for fixed variance and mean. Credit goes to Professors Joe Blitzstein and Carl Morris for teaching me these characterizations.    Embed Quote
