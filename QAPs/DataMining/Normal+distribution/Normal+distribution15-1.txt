★Why do prices and income follow a log-normal distribution?
Suppose you are buying a $100,000 car.  Would you be willing to pay $5 to make it the right color?  Probably...  Now suppose you are buying a $1 pencil.  Would you still pay $5 to make it the right color?  Not unless you really like pencils.  500% mark up for color is ridiculous. And it's that line of thinking is exactly the answer you're looking for.  The value of work/price change of an improvement to a product is based on the % change it creates in that product NOT on the cost to make the change. But you've stumbled on something more fundamental here.  Investment (and therefore income) is exponential: every dollar/hour you put in earns so many more dollars.  But marginal utility is logarithmic (buying an expensive watch makes me much less happy than a bag of groceries makes to someone with less money).  And that's why the world is such a sad place...  Rich people spend a lot to get themselves very little happiness, and there are way more poor people than rich people.    Embed Quote
