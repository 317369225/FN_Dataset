★What does the value of a point on the normal distribution actually represent, if anything?I know that the CDF is just the definite integral of a certain interval of the normal distribution function, but what is the meaning/significance/application, if any, of the actual y-values of the function?
What do you mean by "point on the normal distribution?"  There are two things I think you might mean, and I'll answer based on my guess.  First, you might mean the point with describing the "bell-shaped" curve of the normal density function.  The height of any density at a specific value of is a measure of how likely a value in the vicinity of is to occur, but it isn't a probability and can be tough to understand.  It is most meaningful to look at the ratio between heights at different values.  For example, tells us how many times more likely we are to see the random variable take on a value of about than a value of about . Second, you could mean the height of the cumulative distribution function .  This function is easier to understand.  The height of this curve at the point is exactly (i.e. the probability that the random variable takes on a value that is less than or equal to the number ).    Embed Quote
