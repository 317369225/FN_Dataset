★Why the normal distribution can't be integrated from minus infinite to infinite?
Apart from the tricks shown in the above posts ….one can also use ‘contour Integration’ , Fourier transform methods  or properties of gamma function to evaluate Gaussian function.But these methods will work only when the limit is between minus infinity to infinity or from zero to infinity. If you want to determine indefinite integral of Gaussian function or integral for any other values of the upper and lower limits, all these methodologies will fail. This is because Gaussian function is among those rare functions that is an  Elementary function but do not possess any elementary Antiderivative. This fact can be rigorously proved using the Risch algorithm. But still we can use numerical method of integration like ‘Newton-Cotes’ to calculate the integral of Gaussian function for any upper or lower limits.That is how we get  ‘Z-table ‘ which  is used to calculate values of  cumulative distribution function of normal distribution.  (note: although normal distribution function is a gaussian function....term  Gaussian function may sometimes refer to multiples of the  normal distribution that cannot  be directly interpreted in terms of  probability theory. Anyway we use  same techniques to integrate both of  them )    Embed Quote
