★What is an intuitive explanation for how the t-distribution, normal distribution, F-distribution and Chi-square distribution relate to each other?Why do all these different distributions exist and how do we use them in statistics? What influences the choice of distribution in statistical testing?
T-, F- and Chi- squared distributions are all derived from standardized normal distribution (i.e. Normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal to 1). By "derived from" I mean they are linear or non-linear tranformations of standardized normal distribution. Details can be easily found using Google.    Embed Quote
