★What would the world be like if the normal distribution had never been discovered?
Since it's an inevitable consequence of anything in statistics, the only way we could avoid discovering it would be if we never thought about statistics at all.  (Or if we never developed a way of thinking about continuous processes, in which case we wouldn't have any of the modern world...) What does a world without statistics look like?  Well, no efficient supply chains, so we're basically consuming goods produced locally.  No statistical research on public health, so we have infant mortality rates and life expectancies resembling those in the 1800s.  No to a whole lot of engineering, too -- without stochastic filtering we don't put a man on the moon. Then we ask what it is about society which prevented us from doing the obvious thing and thinking about statistics, and you realize that for that to happen we must not have had modern math and science at all.  So, essentially, imagine the pre-Newton world, forever.    Embed Quote
