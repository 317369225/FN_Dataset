★What is a Normal Distribution curve? What does its Y-axis denote?I understand that a normal distribution can be observed with a Histogram. But I do not understand how this can be represented using only a curve. Given a Data set, could someone give me an example of the calculation and the significance of a continuous normal distribution curve?
The normal distribution is an abstract thing (see the formula in Justin Rising 's excellent answer). The interesting thing is that many things are distributed approximately normally - e.g. height. The histogram is a cruder tool for measuring the shape of a continuous distribution than a kernel density estimate is. Histograms have a number of problems including the fact that changing the bin width and starting point can make them look very different. If you do use a histogram for a continuous distribution, you should superimpose at least one density estimate.    Embed Quote
