★Why do prices and income follow a log-normal distribution?
Suppose I told you that a company's value increased by $10 million last year.  Do you think it's more likely that the company's value increased from $500,000 to $10.5 million, or from $100 million to $110 million? The second case is much more likely, right?  We expect changes in the value of a company to be related to that company's current value, not to some abstract number of dollars.  In other words, it's the percentage change in a stock price that should have a simple random distribution, not the dollar change or the price itself. Consequently, it makes sense that prices might be at least approximately lognormal.    Embed Quote
