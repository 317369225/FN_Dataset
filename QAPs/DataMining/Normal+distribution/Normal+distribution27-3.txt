★Why does the frequency of so many events appear to be normally distributed?This may be  unanswerable, but I'm looking for some explanation as to why the frequency of so many events (especially in nature) manifest as a symmetrical cluster about a mean, with frequency decreasing as it moves away from the mean.
I don't think that events of a given nature are normally distributed more often than any other distribution.  For example, coin tosses will not exhibit a normal distribution, but rather a Bernoulli one; the result of a 6-sided die is uniformally distributed; the number of people entering say a restaurant during lunch time is modeled as a Poisson distribution;  the time between phone calls received by an operator on a given hour of the day more closely resembles an exponential distribution. There seems to be a misunderstanding about the Central Limit Theorem. Loosely, the CLT says that the mean of a sufficiently large number of (independently identically distributed) random variables will approach a normal distribution.   So, say, if you throw a 6-sided die 30 times then take the mean, and consider this as your observation; then do this again (i.e. throw a 6-sided die 30 times, then observe the mean) and again and again, for say, 100 times (that's 30x100 = 3,000 tosses); then you'll have observed 100 means.  These 100 means will then approximate the normal distribution. The distribution of a given event, each individually observed, will probably be as likely to be normally distributed as it will be uniform, or binomial, or poisson, or exponential, etc.    Embed Quote
