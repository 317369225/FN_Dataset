★In statistics, how do t and z/normal distributions differ?
The t distribution and the normal are both symmetric and unimodal (i.e., singe-peaked).  The difference between them is that the t distribution is less concentrated around its peak. You know the rule of thumb that states that if data follows a normal distribution, then 68% of the observations will be within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three.  There are similar rules for the t distribution, but all of those figures are smaller, and they decrease with the degrees of freedom of the distribution. In the extreme case, which is a t distribution with three degrees of freedom, you have about 61% of the data within one standard deviation of the mean, 86% within two standard deviations, and about 94% within three standard deviations.  When there are two or fewer degrees of freedom, we can't talk about the standard deviation for technical reasons.    Embed Quote
