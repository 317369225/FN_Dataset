★Can binomial data come from a normal distribution?
If you draw N-element samples from a normal distribution such that x = 1 for each value equal to or greater than the mean, and otherwise x = 0, they'll make observations for an approximately binomial sample X ~ binom(N, 0.5). EDIT: Or even better: If you take a sample from a normal distribution and then draw N-element samples from it (without replacement), you'll get something even closer to binomial distribution. set.seed(123) norm2bin = function(N, s) {   k = sample(s, N)   return(sum(k > mean(s))) } samp = rnorm(10000) X = sapply(1:100000, function(x) norm2bin(20, samp)) hist(X, breaks=0:20) points(0:20, dbinom(0:20, 20, 0.5) * 100000, col="red", pch=19)    Embed Quote
