★Why is normal distribution the most popular and the most feasible?
If anything could convince me of the existence of God it would probably be the normal distribution*. Only the most benevolent creator would fix it so that the mean of any independently identically distributed variables would have the same distribution irrespective of the distribution of the individual variables (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen...). These figures show the distribution of the mean of n samples from the distribution shown in the top left.  So the mean of just 5 samples from a uniform distribution is pretty much normally distributed: It works quickly enough even if the original process is very much not normal That blows my mind every time I see it. Many natural process do arise as the sums or products of i.i.d. component processes and so many distributions in nature are either normal or log-normal. Not only that, but the maximum likelihood estimate of the population mean is also the least squares estimate (and all sorts of other mathematical niceties that others will be better qualified to explain).  This makes estimating parameters that come from normal distributions very very easy. So the most commonly occurring distribution in nature is also a useful approximation for almost any other, and it's also one of the mathematically easiest to work with. Just imagine how hard life would be if none of those things was true. * it is going to take more than that    Embed Quote
