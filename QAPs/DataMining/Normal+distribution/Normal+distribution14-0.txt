★Does the number of false cognates among all languages exceed a statistically normal distribution?With the knowledge of the number of languages and average words/language
How would you work out a "statistically normal distribution" of false cognates? I'm not sure that's possible. Also, how would you work out anything at all about "all languages"? I'm not sure that's possible either. I feel as though I'm missing something in this question. If you also feel this, please clarify.    Embed Quote
