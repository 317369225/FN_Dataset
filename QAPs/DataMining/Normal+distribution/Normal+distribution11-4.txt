★Why is the probability of a normally distributed variable being an exact value 0?I understand that it's like taking the area of an infinitesimally small rectangle, but it seems unsatisfying as surely there has to be at least some chance in a lot of situations of X being an exact value.
if you are dealing with a discrete distribution, in which 0 actually can occur, and you are using a normal approximation with a large number of trials, then you can 'cheat' and give a probability estimate.  Similarly, if you know the mean and standard deviation of the random variable, say mu=1000 and sd=2,  then you can reasonable say the probability of occurence is 0    Embed Quote
