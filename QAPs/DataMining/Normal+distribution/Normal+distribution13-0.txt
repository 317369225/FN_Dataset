★Why does the normal distribution show up so often in nature?In layman's terms, please
Let's say we have some probability distribution -- any probability distribution whatsoever. Now draw N samples from the distribution and calculate their average -- let's call this number . Now draw another N samples from and calculate the average again, and repeat this process over and over, so that we get a whole stream of numbers (each the average of N separate samples): What do you think we will see if we make a histogram out of these numbers? It turns out that no matter what distribution we start from -- binomial, Poisson, chi-squared, chinese restaurant process, anything -- as N gets large, we will always see a normal distribution: More formally, in the limit as N goes to infinity, the distribution of the the mean of N samples from a distribution is itself distributed as a normal distribution. This is the Central limit theorem.    Embed Quote
