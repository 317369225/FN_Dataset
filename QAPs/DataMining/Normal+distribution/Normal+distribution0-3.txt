★Why do we use the normal distribution?
Because the normal distribution is extremely tractable. If one multiplies a Gaussian distribution by a scalar number, the result is again a Gaussian distribution. Also, one can add and subtract Gaussian distributions and the result is again a Gaussian distribution. These two properties (and there are many other useful properties) are extremely valuable so that computations with Gaussian distributions are generally more or less straightforward. Consequently, the first thing that one generally tries to do when solving a new problem is to do a Gaussian approximation so that all the computations become doable. That would not be the case with other more complicated distributions.    Embed Quote
