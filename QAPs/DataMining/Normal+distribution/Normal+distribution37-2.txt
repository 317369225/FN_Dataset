★What does the standard deviation metric tell us for a non-normal distribution?What does the standard deviation tell us, if anything?  I know the standard deviation metric is relevant for normally distributed data (68, 95, 99 rule), but can we infer any such information or rule for non-normally distributed data?  If not, what's the point of examining the metric for non-normal distributions?
It contains the same basic information as for a normal distribution - it tells us how spread out the distribution is. What is unique about a normal distribution is that it is defined by just its mean and standard deviation, with all its other cumulants being zero. As long as the other cumulants aren't too far from zero (and they often aren't, as a result of the central limit theorem), we can approximate other distributions using the normal distribution. In that case, the standard deviation is vital in defining that normal distribution. Most of the time you see standard deviations being used for non-normal distributions, there is an underlying normal approximation being used.    Embed Quote
