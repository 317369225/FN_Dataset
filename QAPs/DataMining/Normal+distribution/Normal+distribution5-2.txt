★What is special about the normal distribution?What special properties does the normal distribution have that cause it to be the distribution that falls out of the central limit theorem? I.e., there are various distributions that are symmetric, roughly bell-shaped, etc. What properties cause the normal distribution to be singled out? What is the intuition behind its specialness?
There's no good intuition for this.  In general, if are iid random variables and some sequence of the form has a limiting distribution, then that limiting distribution must be stable.  The normal distribution is the only stable distribution with finite variance, and for technical reasons that's enough to guarantee that whenever that the limiting distribution is normal.    Embed Quote
