★Why is the normal distribution important?
Definition from Wikipedia The normal distribution is The parameter μ in this formula is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode). The parameter σ is its standard deviation; its variance is therefore σ 2. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate Now let's see why Normal distribution is such a beautiful phenomenon. Nice, huh? Let's see now how we can find X for a particular probability. The relation between probability and Z is fixed and can be found out from Standardized Normal Probability Table (more info here Standard normal table). From Standard Normal table, you get the Z, and then X, simple as that :) PS: I copied the pictures from my classroom slides, the credit goes more to my professor than me    Embed Quote
