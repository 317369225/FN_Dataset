★Should grades be normally distributed?If so, what does it mean that the histogram of the grades is not Gaussian?
The distribution of grades is determined by the performance of the students and the grading system. There are two ways to interpret the question: Is student performance normally distributed? Should the teacher's system distribute grades normally? I believe the first is more or less true. A normal distribution is the outcome of many small variations in inputs added up. Student performance depends on a number of factors, including luck, raw intelligence (if such a thing exists), preparation, education, experience, specific circumstances on the day of testing, etc. Those things, being 'physical' aspects of a large population, will have a normal distribution. If student performance is the sum of these factors, it will therefore also have a normal distribution. As to question number 2, my answer is a definite no. Teaching a class is not a zero-sum system. If you grade students to a curve, their only interest is to do better relative to other students in their class. You take away their incentive to improve their absolute performance by working together. This is observed in very competitive environments that grade to a curve directly: I've heard stories about law schools where people steal each other's notes. If you have a consistent grading system that evaluates students' performance based on an absolute level and you collect the results of a large group, you will still get a normal distribution because group cooperation is just another normally distributed factor. Grading on a curve is still a popular tool, however, because it provides an answer to 'how well did someone do versus their peers?', which a student's future employer will be interested in. Because employers are interested in it, it will induce some people to work harder than they otherwise would have.    Embed Quote
