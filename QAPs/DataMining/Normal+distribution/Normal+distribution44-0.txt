★What are the proofs that the IQ curves follow a normal distribution?
IQ really doesn't. For the relatively "reasonable" range of IQs it's approximated by a Gaussian, but partly this is by the way the tests are constructed. However, for very low or very high values it really doesn't anymore. It's not even clear that the test provides useful information at the extremes. I'll also state that I personally (and professionally) do not believe in any kind of realist interpretation of tests like IQ, so its distribution is really no more than a potentially useful fiction.    Embed Quote
