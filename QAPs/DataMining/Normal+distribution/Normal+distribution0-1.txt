★Why do we use the normal distribution?
Just to be a little contrary (and not to question the answers already given) I'd say we overuse the normality assumption and we do so for historical and not statistical reasons. Several people mentioned that the normal is "tractable". Indeed it is. When we assume the normal there are often analytic solutions, at least asymptotically. This is important, but it is less important nowadays, with fast computers, then it was when all this stuff was being invented (especially from Gauss to Fisher). We should note that the CLT works asymptotically; many distributional results are true asymptotically and sometimes the asymptote either occurs at a very high N or at some unknown N. We could be doing a lot more with statistics that make much more minimal assumptions, often at minimal losses in power. I think we are going this way but will go further    Embed Quote
