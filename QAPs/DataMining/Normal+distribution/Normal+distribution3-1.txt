★Why is the normal distribution important?
First and most obvious is the Central Limit Theorem: it's the limiting distribution of an additive combination (i.e. average) of random variables with certain properties (independence, finite variance, identical) so it comes up often. Even when those assumptions are relaxed, normal distributions often come up. For example, stock returns are (approximately) normally distributed, being the sums of impulses (but not identically distributed, and not always independent) coming from the external market. Moreover, it's the highest-entropy (in a way, least assumptions) distribution when there is a known mean and standard deviation (two statistics that are straightforward to compute). Since a general design principle in modeling is to use least-assumptions components when outside of the explicit assumptions of the models, Gaussian distributions come up quite a bit. For a bit of historical trivia, the original discovery of the Gaussian distribution is in the distribution of experimental errors in science. Although the sources of error were not identically distributed and not always independent, they were enough so as to produce the bell-shaped distribution.    Embed Quote
