★Why do quantities in nature tend to be normally distributed, such as students' grade, human's height, size of snowflakes and so on. However, we find the returns of assets (like stocks, bonds, options) don't follow normal distribution (fat tail),How to explain it?
When you have lots of small independent contributions, you get a normal distribution according to the central limit theorem. So for example height in humans is a result of lots of contributing factors from genetics, nutricients, and physical training. As these are mostly uncorrelated aka independent height becomes normally distributed. If you have a dominant source, not many small ones, the outcome is a distribution resembling the dominant source. If you have many small positively correlated contributions, the tails gets fatter as in the pricing of stocks. There are many buyers and sellers of stocks, but their decisions to sell or buy are not independent. They are positively correlated with for example the news, so you get fat tails as compared to the normal distribution for stock price movements.    Embed Quote
