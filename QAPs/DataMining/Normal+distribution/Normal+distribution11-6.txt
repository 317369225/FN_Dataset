★Why is the probability of a normally distributed variable being an exact value 0?I understand that it's like taking the area of an infinitesimally small rectangle, but it seems unsatisfying as surely there has to be at least some chance in a lot of situations of X being an exact value.
This issue will come up whenever you look at any continuous distribution. Here's another way to look at it. What's the probability of someone being 6 foot tall? Surely in the billions of people in the world there is someone who is 6.00000000000... ft tall, right? Nope. Maybe if you're lucky (and have really good measuring equipment) you will find someone who is 6.000000000000000001 feet tall. Once in a million years, you might meet someone 6.000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 feet tall. You will never, ever, meet a human being that is exactly 6 feet tall. There are infinite possibilities, with only one leading to the desired outcome. Even if all of these possibilities are not equally likely, your probability is where x is some finite value. While it seems like there should be a possibility of it happening, the chance is so small we don't have a number small enough to capture it... unless you count zero.    Embed Quote
