★What is special about the normal distribution?What special properties does the normal distribution have that cause it to be the distribution that falls out of the central limit theorem? I.e., there are various distributions that are symmetric, roughly bell-shaped, etc. What properties cause the normal distribution to be singled out? What is the intuition behind its specialness?
Shannon proved [1] that if one wants to measure the uncertainty contained in a probability distribution , the essentially unique way to do so is to use the entropy . It turns out that among all the probability distributions with mean and variance , the Gaussian distribution maximises the entropy functional . One can then see the central limit theorem as convergence towards the distribution that maximises the entropy [2].
