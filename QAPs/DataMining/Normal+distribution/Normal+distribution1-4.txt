★Should grades be normally distributed?If so, what does it mean that the histogram of the grades is not Gaussian?
No. Class tests have an inherent error of measurement, so you can never really test students enough to assume their test scores/grades reliably measure how much they've learned. I believe all classes should be pass/fail, based on a fixed standard, not relative performance.    Embed Quote
