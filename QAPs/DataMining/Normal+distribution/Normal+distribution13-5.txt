★Why does the normal distribution show up so often in nature?In layman's terms, please
This example should help to get some intuition. Say, you ask some 2000 people to pick a natural number from { 0,1,2, ... 100 } and write it on piece of paper. Then, shuffle/mix them all Now, Each number in isolation may not be as interesting. Instead, grab some 30 bunch ( of 2000 papers ) and note down the average. Repeat this as many times as you wish to notice that the average hovers around 50 most number of times. and if you plot it, it looks like normal Simply put, this metric average has central tendency and can take values any where from 0 to 3000 ( all 30 are 100s) and it's distribution looks like normal. It only gets better if you grab more at a time - say 250.. 650 etc. This is called sample size. More the sample size, the more confidant you feel :) Normal distribution can nicely fit ( of course, am omitting the assumptions & details involved ) in where there is central tendency.  In fact, you can derive it from a case of throwing a dart aiming at the bull's eye. What we see in nature are averaged out by many micro interactions that may not themselves exhibit central tendency. For ex. "Height of human being" - so many inner factors at play for about 20 years and the result?  some average height - 5,9". For some, they interact extremely to be too small/tall while the rest fall in between Here you can say, Nature has natural tendency for 5,9" for human beings. or you can visualize nature as "making machine" with set target ( aiming) of 5,9" but like any other machine, it errs to produce other values - much like some ball making machine errs in producing balls with slight error margin This was the original intuition idea from Gauss for Normal distribution and he developed it as 'theory of errors'. He was working with telescope lengths though instead of balls.    Embed Quote
