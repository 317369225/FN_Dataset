I will present the plot to help you make your own judgement. Below is the histogram of (unsigned) volume of S&P500 futures on three weeks of September 2013 with log scale on x axis: As you see most of the trades are of small 1 lot, 2 lots. To better see the large trade, here is a histogram of volume for large trades only (>= 50 lots) with log scale on y axis. Finally, a plot with log scale on both x and y axis: TLTR: It is power law, but the round number trades (50, 100, 200,...) have their own law. Data: Historical Futures Data | Tick Data Inc.
