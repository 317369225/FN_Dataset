★Should grades be normally distributed?If so, what does it mean that the histogram of the grades is not Gaussian?
It's probably good that the numerical grades on a test are not normal.  It's an indication that the test is actually testing something.  One of the main purposes of a test is student assessment.  It's supposed to show what students know about a subject.  It's supposed to distinguish between those that don't understand it and those that do understand it. A test will have several questions on it, and every student will do well on some and not on others, but you expect there to be a high correlation among the questions.  If there were no correlation, the sum of the scores for all the questions on the test would be normally distributed.  But there is a correlation, and it should be pretty high.  So the overall test scores should be flatter than a normal distribution. Sometimes you'll see a bimodal distribution.  That would indicate that there are two populations of students in the class.  It may be worthwhile investigating what those populations are.    Embed Quote
