★What are some interesting results in normal distribution?What I aim at to know in this question is some examples for some unusual normal distribution. For instance: the amount of honest people obey a normal distribution, or people's skills follows the normal distribution (or other kind of distribution). Other interesting results not related with the above are welcome as well, though.
No offence, but I believe you have not understood the main idea of normal distribution. The idea is that anything that happens in a random basis is bound to follow a normal distribution. Take the example you said, the level of honesty in people is bound to follow a normal distribution since to a great extend honesty occurs randomly in people. However, to give an answer to your question there are many things that follow random distribution: 1- The height of men or women in a country 2- The amount of salary in a city 3- The number of slices of bread each family have in a city 4- The umber of days a child remains in their mother's before they are born. 5- The number of pages PhD candidates use for their dissertation in a country. 6- The length of men's sexual organs in a country ... it's just about anything, my friend.    Embed Quote
