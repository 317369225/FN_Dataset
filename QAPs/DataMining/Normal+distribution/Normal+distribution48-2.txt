★Why do quantities in nature tend to be normally distributed, such as students' grade, human's height, size of snowflakes and so on. However, we find the returns of assets (like stocks, bonds, options) don't follow normal distribution (fat tail),How to explain it?
This is unknown A normal distribution follows directly from the central limit theorem (CLT)...any sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)  random variables, with finite variance, will converge to a normal distribution There are several  arguments for why asset returns do not fit into this 1.  They are random and maybe even  (i.i.d.) , but do not have finite variance.  One can then apply a generalized CLT, which relies upon Levy (fat tail) distributions.  This argument has been made by Mandelbrot, and it popular with econo-physicists 2. There is not enough data , which means that returns on assets may obey the CLT, but require corrections due to finite size effects.  Also popular with econo-physicists, this argument means the returns do fall into a normal distribution, but with large skew and kurtosis 3.  They are random and maybe even  (i.i.d.) , but underlying variance/volatility itself is a stochastic process. This is the most common argument in options theory, and is called the stochastic-volatility model.  Here, one usually models the volatility as a mean-reverting process, which yields a model with just a few adjustable parameters 4.  None of the above.    There are lots of other models.  Lots    Embed Quote
