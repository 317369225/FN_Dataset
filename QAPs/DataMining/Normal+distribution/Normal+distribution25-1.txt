★Does IQ in people follow a normal distribution?
The IQ follows a normal distribution by construction. There is no natural unit by which you can measure intelligence. At best you may be able to rank people by their level of intelligence. Given such a ranking you can now assign points such that the percentiles line up with the expectations based on a normal distribution with a chosen mean and standard deviation. For IQ tests the chosen mean is 100 an the standard deviation is 15. So by definition 95% of a population will have an IQ between 100 - 15 * 1.96 and 100 + 15 * 1.96. This also means that IQ tests are constantly recalibrated for new populations, which also makes it hard to compare IQs unless they have been established with the same test. But you can also ask how a population would perform on IQ tests calibrated for another population. The best known example for this is the Flynn effect which states that with any new generation the threshold for 100 IQ points raises.    Embed Quote
