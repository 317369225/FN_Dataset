★What is a Normal Distribution curve? What does its Y-axis denote?I understand that a normal distribution can be observed with a Histogram. But I do not understand how this can be represented using only a curve. Given a Data set, could someone give me an example of the calculation and the significance of a continuous normal distribution curve?
I think the difficulty you are having may be as follows. In a histogram the x axis shows the possible outcomes and the y axis shows the number of times each x outcome was observed. If there are N observations in total then dividing each number on the Y axis by N will give you the observed probability that each outcome happened so the histogram can also graph the probability of each x outcome. Now when we have a continuous distribution the y axis no longer shows a count or a probability. Why not? Well, in a continuous distribution the literal probability that any particular outcome is observed is zero! This seems odd but just remember there are an infinite number of points between 0 and 1 or 1/2 and 1 or 3/4 and 1 etc. so the probability that any individual pt. happens is zero. Even though the probability of any pt. is zero the probability of observing something within a range is well defined. e.g. if there is an equal probability of observing something between 0 and 1 then the probability of any specific pt. happening is 0 but the probability of a number between 3/4 and 1 happening is 1/4. Now to answer your question, the normal distribution is defined so that when you integrate or sum the area under the normal distribution between any two points it gives you a probability as detailed in Justin's answer. Many processeses are well approximated by a normal distribution so you can use the distribution to estimate the probability that a range of outcomes will occur.    Embed Quote
