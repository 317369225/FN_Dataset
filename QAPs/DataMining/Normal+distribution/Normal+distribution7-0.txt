★Why is beta normally distributed?Why ?
The Beta distribution has support [0,1] and the Normal distribution has support , so they can't be the same distribution. So I'll interpret the question as asking when Beta(a,b) is approximately Normal, and why. The approximation holds when a and b are both large. It's better if a and b are approximately equal, since Normal distributions are always symmetric but Beta(a,b) is only symmetric when a=b. Error in the normal approximation to the beta distribution discusses the quality of the approximation in some examples, and a transformation to improve the approximation. But why does asymptotic Normality hold when the parameters a and b grow? There are several ways to prove the result. One way to see it intuitively (which can also be turned into a rigorous proof) is to use representation and the delta method. Let a and b be large, and for simplicity assume they are integers. We can represent a Beta(a,b) r.v. as G/(G+H), where G~Gamma(a) and H~Gamma(b), with G and H independent (here a and b are the convolution parameters of the Gammas, and the scale parameter is 1). We can represent G as the sum of a i.i.d. Exponential r.v.s and H as the sum  of b i.i.d. Exponential r.v.s. The usual Central Limit Theorem gives that G and H are approximately Normal, and then the delta method shows that the Beta is also approximately Normal.    Embed Quote
