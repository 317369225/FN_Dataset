★Why do prices and income follow a log-normal distribution?
My experience shows that logarithms of prices (I can't tell the same for incomes, I never worked with them) follow Student's distribution much more than normal. I tried to forecast Asset Prices of Synopsys Corporation and Chevron companies using their past 10 years price data . At first I examined log-prices, their statistical characteristics and tried define their distribution. For both cases distributions were like normal, but much more they were like Student's distribution... After checking by statistical tests it was proved that they have Students' distribution. Also there is another distribution which describes prices' distribution very well- so called Generalized Error Distribution (GED), which is a "heavy tail" distribution... P.S. Daniel McLaury's answer is felicitous... thanks    Embed Quote
