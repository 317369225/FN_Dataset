★How do I derive normal distribution and why can it apply to so many things?I never understood why things would converge to normal distribution, and how people derived the complicated formula. Can anyone try to explain that?
Claude Shannon, a researcher at Bell Labs, famously developed the concept of the "information content" of a probability distribution.  As later expounded by E.T. Jaynes (can be googled), if you know nothing more about a randomly distributed variable than its "rms "(root mean square) deviation from some average value and want to be "maximally non-committal" in assigning a probability distribution, what you should do is find a distribution which has the given rms value and otherwise has the least information content (in the Shannon sense).  This turns out to be none other than the normal (or Gaussian) distribution, as can be proven using a method called the "calculus of variations", as I recall.    Embed Quote
