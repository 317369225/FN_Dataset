★Why do we use the normal distribution?
I, like everybody, wondered about this when I was first learning about probability distributions and observed that the normal/gaussian distribution tops the chart for popularity. The most resounding answers I have, time and again, come across are: Normal distribution arises from the Central Limit Theorem, which implies that if you have a population with any probability distribution, and you draw a large sample from this population while ensuring that the entities in the sample are mutually independent (like in case of drawing with replacement), then the mean of the entities in this large sample is normally distributed (no matter what distribution the underlying population has). This result is the backbone of statistical hypothesis testing. Like it has been mentioned in all the above answers, normal distribution is very tractable. For example if you're stuck with a bell shaped curve in physics or social sciences (pretty much anywhere, actually) and it looks suspiciously like a normal distribution, and on the top of that you have a fair reason to believe in its normality, then by all means assume normal and it'll smoothly zip you forward as far as calculations ans deriving results/inferences are concerned.Looks like my answer is much inspired by this article I read recently: http://www.askamathematician.com...
