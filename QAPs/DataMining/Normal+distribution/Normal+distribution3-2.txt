★Why is the normal distribution important?
Undoubtedly the Normal Distribution owes much of its importance to the central limit theorem. There are four other characterizations of the distribution taught by Professors Carl Morris and Joe Blitzstein in their course Stat 210 that tend to go by the wayside in the limelight of the CLT. (At least I didn't know of them previously!) The normal maximizes entropy for fixed mean and variance. If the sum and difference of two i.i.d random variables are independent, then they must be normals! If the sample mean is independent of the sample variance of a bunch of i.i.d draws, then they are normals. If the sum of a bunch of i.i.d draws that have a finite variance is of the same family, it must be a normal! (It's the only distribution with finite variance that has a "Stable" law.)    Embed Quote
