★Are trading volumes normally distributed?
A2A. No - trade volume is not normally distributed. John cites some pretty good papers in his answer. If you look at a relatively short period of data (say a year) in which no major crashes happened, the distribution of daily trade volume looks roughly normal. Extend the time frame to include any market crash and it immediately becomes a power law distribution. Intuitively, this is quite clear - and you can pull the data yourself for any major index like NASDAQ or S&P 500 on Yahoo Finance. A histogram of NASDAQ volume for the past year will look normal while a histogram of that data for the past ten years (including 2008 crash) will appear to follow a power law distribution. Historically, there have been arguments on whether or not a market crash was an outlier, lending to some beliefs in normality of trading volume, although lately that has ceased to be the case.    Embed Quote
