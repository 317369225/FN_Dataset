★Why do we use the normal distribution?
Agree with all facts about real world scenarios etc. But there is something more to do with Normal distributions, i.e., dealing with the Differential Entropy. In simple words entropy indicates the disorderliness (higher the entropy, more disordered it is) in the data. A data set where each point is equally probable has maximum entropy. If we are given 26 letters of the alphabet and each one of them appears equally often, and independently of each other, we need log(26) [base 2] bits to encode the 26 letters. If we do not put any constraints on the data, the uniform distribution has maximum entropy. Now, assume that we are given data points from a specific problem and we decide to keep only the mean  and the variance as 2 descriptors of the data. The question would be, which distribution, among the many possible probability distributions, should we use later on to describe the data? Which is the distribution which makes no additional spurious assumptions? Which distribution most effectively models our ignorance by maximizing disorder? Not surprisingly, the answer is that the Gaussian distribution is the one with maximum entropy.                     Proof: Differential entropy, Refs: Page on inf.fu-berlin.de [On a retrospect it keeps me wondering starting from the Second law of Thermodynamics, Gaussian Nature of events in nature (weight/height of humans, temperature, air pressure etc etc.) and Shannon's entropy, the dots seem pretty much connected, isn't it?]    Embed Quote
