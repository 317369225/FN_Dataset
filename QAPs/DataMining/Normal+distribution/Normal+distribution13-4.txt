★Why does the normal distribution show up so often in nature?In layman's terms, please
As others have pointed out, normal distribution does not occur as often as people think. But wherever it does arise, you can think of it as a result of large number of independent effects. Most of the real world phenomenon are affected by a large number of variables (effects). The combined / superimposed effect drives towards the 'bell curve'. The mathematical details are explained by central limit theorem. You can also google about 'Galton's box' or 'Bean machine' to see a visual demo of Normal distribution in action.    Embed Quote
