★How can one establish whether residuals are normally distributed in statistics?
Both Prateek and Dan recommended quantile plots; in particular, what you want is a quantile normal plot. In `R` these can be plotted with the qqnorm function in the stats package. There are also ways to plot them in other packages: Which are you  using? To do it "by hand" the essential idea is to plot the quantiles of the residuals against the quantiles of a normal distribution with the same mean (0) and standard deviation (whatever it is).
