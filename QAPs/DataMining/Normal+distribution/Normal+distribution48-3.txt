★Why do quantities in nature tend to be normally distributed, such as students' grade, human's height, size of snowflakes and so on. However, we find the returns of assets (like stocks, bonds, options) don't follow normal distribution (fat tail),How to explain it?
To build on the above In nature not all distributions are Normal. Take earthquakes, the distribution of these events in time are more of random walk or flicker type distributions ( the power spectra density is -1.5 or -2 ) The normal distribution with a nice gaussian curve is really very theoretical and as said in this threads is subject to very stringent conditions, like each sample needs to be statistically independent etc. etc. So normal distributions are in fact rare in real life ....    Embed Quote
