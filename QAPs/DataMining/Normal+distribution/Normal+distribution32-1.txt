★In statistics, how do t and z/normal distributions differ?
The t is derived from the Gaussian by considering a standard Gaussian and dividing it by the square root of an independent chi square distribution with corresponding degrees of freedom. The Gaussian is a limiting case of the t when the df gets large so when df is big you can use the Gaussian, but the whole is an antiquated rule from the pre-computer days. For smaller df the peak of the t is lower than the Gaussian and the tails are heavier. It is the sampling distribution for the standardized mean of a sample from the Gaussian when it is normalized by the sample standard deviation. Both have the same qualitative shape, i.e., a bell curve, thus both are unimodal. A t with 1 df is Cauchy, which is itself a famous distribution, particularly known for having no moments. Because of the central limit theorem, it is a good approximate sampling distribution for the sample means of many other random variables, though it is exact for Gaussians. Assuming you decided the sample mean was a good summary statistic it would likely be fine for all of the pictures you made, though I would perhaps be skeptical of using the sample mean for the bimodal distribution.    Embed Quote
