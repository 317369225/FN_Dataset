★What are the pros and cons of kmeans vs. hierarchical clustering?
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~piyush/t...: K-means clustering produces a single partitioning Hierarchical Clustering can give diﬀerent partitionings depending on the level-of-resolution we are looking at K-means clustering needs the number of clusters to be speciﬁed Hierarchical clustering doesn’t need the number of clusters to be speciﬁed K-means clustering is usually more eﬃcient run-time wise Hierarchical clustering can be slow (has to make several merge/split decisions) No clear consensus on which of the two produces better clustering    Embed Quote
