★Can a k-means or general distance based clustering algorithms clustering approach make feature or dimension importance null?
Your question isn't too clear, but it seems like you want a way to be able to specify a custom "distance" calculation (using feature importance or what not). If this is the case, look at k-medoids (a.k.a: Partioning Around Medoids or PAM). It's similar to k-means, except each cluster center is an actual data-point, rather an arbitary point in your vector space, and it allows you to specify your own cost function. This works well for categorical data (which you seems to have). K-medoids is significantly more computationally expensive though. Google "k-means vs k-medoids" and you'll see various discussions on the differences / similarities. (Apologies if I'm completely misunderstood your question).    Embed Quote
