★How can I apply the K-means clustering algorithm to a flight dataset?
Firstly, as Sean Owen suggested, you need to first know what you want to do with this data. You cannot arbitrarily cluster data based on a predefined category i.e. 'airport' as you mentioned. Secondly, your dataset appears to be a mix of numeric and categorical features. So K-means (for numerical data) or K-modes (for categorical data) cannot be directly applied on this dataset, unless you remove one type of feature but that may not be the right approach. Clustering mixed data is not as straight forward as K-means or K-modes but the key there is to define the distance metric. Here is a highly cited paper that may be useful for your problem (http://edu.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/E...)    Embed Quote
