★What happens when you pass correlated variables to a k means clustering? Also, is there a way by which clustering can be used to group similar pattern observed for a variable over time?I have a data set in which there are different dimensions associated with a entity. Each dimension has a lifetime value, a duration value and metrics that capture its evolution over time. the goal is to cluster similar entities. 'Similar' meaning same pattern over time, same range of lifetime value and duration
To work with correlated data points, try clustering based on Mahalanobis distance, a generalization of Euclidean distance.    Embed Quote
