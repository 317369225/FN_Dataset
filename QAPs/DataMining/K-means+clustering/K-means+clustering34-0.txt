★How do I combine a k-means clustering algorithm for uncertain data along with Euclidean distance/Mahalanobis distance? Is this feasible?
Can you be clear? . what did u mean by uncertain data? On what problem statement you working on?  structure of clusters decide on use of distance measure. Assuming and answering ! in short. 1.You can use both distance measures by merely replacing existing one. expanding 2. if your cluster is of elliptical structure ie  if co-variances vary then use mahalanobis . 3.if you have identical covariances then you can use either of them (same benefits) as Mahalanobis reduces to Euclidean in identity covariance situations!    Embed Quote
