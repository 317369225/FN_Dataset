★What are the pros and cons of kmeans vs. hierarchical clustering?
As the number of records increase the performance of hierarchical algorithm goes decreasing and time for execution increased .  K-mean algorithm also increases its time of execution but as compared to hierarchical algorithm its performance is better. Hierarchical algorithm shows more quality as compared to k-mean algorithm. As a general conclusion, k-mean algorithm is good for large dataset and hierarchical is good for small datasets. Comparison between these algorithms can be implemented on the basis of normalization, by taking normalized and un-normalized data will give different results. ref: http://www.ijarcsse.com/docs/pap...    Embed Quote
