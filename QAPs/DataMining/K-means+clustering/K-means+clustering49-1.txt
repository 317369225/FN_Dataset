★Is it necessary to use k-means algorithm or any similar clustering algorithm for data processing in hadoop cluster?I am working on hadoop 2.4.0 and I want to implement analysis application on a cluster of 6 nodes. I have got a suggestion of using k-means for dividing the task over the cluster but my doubt is, will it work if I don't use any such algorithm (not only k-means), or is it must in order to perform analysis task over the cluster?
in your question : dividing the task over the cluster : thats what MapReduce defined.   MapReduce is a programming model designed for processing large volumes of data in parallel by dividing the work into a set of independent tasks. Eeven simple MapReduce wordcount will do the same. its upto you, u can implement any algorithm in MapReduce.    Embed Quote
