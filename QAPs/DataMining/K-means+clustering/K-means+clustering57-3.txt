★What are the best open source machine learning libraries written in C++?
Machine Learning is huge and you have specific libraries for specific set of algorithms. Still, following are some opensource ML libraries apart from the ones mentioned in other answers: mlpack mlpack is a good alternative a scalable c++ machine learning library According to their website: mlpack is a C++ machine learning library with emphasis on scalability, speed, and ease-of-use.  Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C++ language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users.  mlpack outperforms competing machine learning libraries by large margins; see the BigLearning workshop paper for details. Graphlab For Machine Learning on the graph GraphLab According to their website: The GraphLab project consists of a core C++ GraphLab API and a  collection of high-performance machine learning and data mining toolkits  built on top of the GraphLab API.  In addition, we are actively  developing new interfaces to allow users to leverage the GraphLab API  from other languages and technologies. Shogun Mostly Kernel Methods The SHOGUN Machine Learning Toolbox From their Website: The machine learning toolbox's focus is on large scale kernel methods and especially on Support Vector Machines (SVM). It provides a generic SVM object interfacing to several different SVM implementations    Embed Quote
