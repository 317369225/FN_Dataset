★Is it necessary to use k-means algorithm or any similar clustering algorithm for data processing in hadoop cluster?I am working on hadoop 2.4.0 and I want to implement analysis application on a cluster of 6 nodes. I have got a suggestion of using k-means for dividing the task over the cluster but my doubt is, will it work if I don't use any such algorithm (not only k-means), or is it must in order to perform analysis task over the cluster?
K means is iterative algorithm so you have to invoke your map reduce multiple times for proper clustering. Kmeans is already implemented on mahout which is on map reduce , so you can try that . Your any other algorithm will also work if you implement your map reduce properly Thanks Somnath    Embed Quote
