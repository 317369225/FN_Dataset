★Unsupervised Learning: What is most scalable algorithm for K-Means clustering for large dataset?Virtually every paper I have seen so far is evaluated on small scale data. Is there any good algorithm for large scale data set ?   application scenario, K<= 10 , Dataset size= 100 Millions, Dimensionality <=100
You can try mini-batch optimization for k-means clustering. Its relatively fast and suitable for large scale clustering. I managed to cluster 36,000 data-points (D=150) in around 8-10 seconds. Here is the paper: http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dscul... Open-source implementation of it: http://code.google.com/p/sofia-m...    Embed Quote
