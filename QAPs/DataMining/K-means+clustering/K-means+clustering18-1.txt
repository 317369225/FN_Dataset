★How do I understand the characteristics of each cluster when doing a K-Means clustering algorithm?I want to segment my customers using k-mean algorithm, how can I know the general characteristics of each cluster so I can offer new products or send email-marketing to each customer segment? Is there a way to understand the characteristics on R (programming language)?
Well, in order to determine the characteristics of each cluster you will have to analyse the variables separately for each cluster. I dont think any software can help you understand the characteristics. One of the things you can do is calculate mean/median of the variables for every cluster and then determine which variable has a higher value in which cluster. For eg: A certain cluster would have higher mean for design and hence those customers focus more on design perspective. Another would have higher mean for quality and thus the customers of that cluster focus more on quality. Mean/Median is just one of many statistical tool which you can use to find the pattern in the clusters.    Embed Quote
