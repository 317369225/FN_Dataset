★Is it possible to use cross-validation to select the number of clusters for k-means or the EM-algorithm for mixture models of Gaussians?The issue that I see is that CV methods use the true labels, but these are not usually available for these methods. Is the reason (if its valid) for not using CV for choosing the number of clusters or mixing components for EM or k-means style algorithms?
It is indeed possible to use cross-validation to select the number of clusters for k-means and EM clustering. This approach is called v-fold cross validation. See this page for more details: Page on statsoft.com.    Embed Quote
