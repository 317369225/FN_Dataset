★Unsupervised Learning: What is most scalable algorithm for K-Means clustering for large dataset?Virtually every paper I have seen so far is evaluated on small scale data. Is there any good algorithm for large scale data set ?   application scenario, K<= 10 , Dataset size= 100 Millions, Dimensionality <=100
In my PhD thesis I grouped 2 million instances in a 100-dimensional space into 100 clusters under 4 minutes using  ai-ku/wkmeans  (actually I performed 128 random restarts and it took around 8 hours).  It has a weighting option for the repeating inputs.    Embed Quote
