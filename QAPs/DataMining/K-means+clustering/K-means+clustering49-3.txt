★Is it necessary to use k-means algorithm or any similar clustering algorithm for data processing in hadoop cluster?I am working on hadoop 2.4.0 and I want to implement analysis application on a cluster of 6 nodes. I have got a suggestion of using k-means for dividing the task over the cluster but my doubt is, will it work if I don't use any such algorithm (not only k-means), or is it must in order to perform analysis task over the cluster?
K-means is the simplest. To implement and to run. All you need to do is choose "k" and run it a number of times. Most more clever algorithms (in particular the good ones) are much harder to implement efficiently (you'll see factors of 100x in runtime differences) and have much more parameters to set. Plus, most people don't need quality clusters. They actually are happy with anything remotely working for them. Plus, they don't really know what to do when they had more complex clusters. K-means, which models clusters using the simplest model ever - a centroid - is exactly what they need: massive data reduction to centroids. for more i will suggest you have look in Learn Big data hadoop course from online training and tutorial | Intellipaat.com    Embed Quote
