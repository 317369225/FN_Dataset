★Is it necessary to use k-means algorithm or any similar clustering algorithm for data processing in hadoop cluster?I am working on hadoop 2.4.0 and I want to implement analysis application on a cluster of 6 nodes. I have got a suggestion of using k-means for dividing the task over the cluster but my doubt is, will it work if I don't use any such algorithm (not only k-means), or is it must in order to perform analysis task over the cluster?
I will answer from the perspective of what is the benefits of K-Means algorithm. K-Means converges to an answer quickly, because it is mostly linear in its complexity, and we all know in Big Data, how critical is a linear time complexity. Since K-Means is random algorithms, we need to do multiple trials on the training data, and calculate R-Square error and find the best fit for the cluster. The only drawback it has is, It is not deterministic so every time you run it you might get a different answer.    Embed Quote
