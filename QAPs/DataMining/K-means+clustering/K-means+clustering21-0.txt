★Can you use k-means clustering to separate search keywords by performance?
K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, meaning that the algorithm does not optimize based on a pre-defined success metric. Rather, k-means clustering works by using a distance metric and assigning data points based on the underlying properties of your data/features. You *could* try to add in your success metric as a feature in the dataset, then run K-means, but the algorithm will not provide as strong of a result as using a supervised learning technique to classify your keywords that explicitly optimizes the groups by your conversion metric. As an aside, I wrote a blog post about K-means clustering of search terms a while back, using data from Adobe Analytics and R. The example can be generalized to search keywords from any source.
