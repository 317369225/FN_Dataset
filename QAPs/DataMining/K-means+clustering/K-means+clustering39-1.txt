★What is the difference between K-Means and Fuzzy-C Means Clustering?
Though both algorithms comes under Partitional Clustering Algorithms and aims to find best partition of data into k clusters in a way that one criterion is optimized, both are totally different. K–Means algorithmGiven a set of observations (x1, x2 … xn), k-means clustering partitions the set into k clusters such that the within-cluster sum of squares(WCSS) is minimized.                                                                          Where μi is mean point in Si. This results in partitioning of input space into Voronoi cells. This algorithm is advantageous over hierarchical clustering as it is computationally faster with large number of variables. Also it forms tighter clusters than hierarchical clustering, especially if the clusters are globular. But fixed number of clusters can make it difficult to predict what k should be. It does not work well with non-globular clusters. Also, different initial partition can result in different final clusters. Fuzzy-C means algorithmThis algorithm belongs to the family of fuzzy logic based clustering algorithms and was introduced in 1984 by Bezdek. It attempts to partition a finite collection of n elements X = {x1,x2….xn} into a collection of K clusters C = {c1,c2,…..,cK} by associating each gene with all clusters via a real valued vector of indexes. We introduce a partition matrix [0,1], k = 1,…..K, i = 1,…….,n,  where each element Uki tells the degree to which each element xi belongs to the cluster ck. Similar to k-means algorithm it aims to minimize following objective function.                              For the complete algorithm, refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuz... Although FCM is an effective clustering technique, the resulting membership values do not always correspond well to the degree of belonging of the data, and it may be inaccurate in noisy environment.    Embed Quote
