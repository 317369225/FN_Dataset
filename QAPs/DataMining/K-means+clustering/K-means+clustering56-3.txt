★How can we choose a "good" K for K-means clustering?Some datasets have an "obvious" set of clusters that would be found by K-means clustering with the right choice of K. How can we, given a set of data, choose such a K?
The elbow method is a classic way. Brilliant explanation by Daniel Martín. Another option is to compute the SVD of your data matrix and then plot the eigenvalues. You will find the same type of elbow as in the previous method. You can indicate the amount of "energy" you want to retain from your data matrix and find the # of eigenvalues for that then you'll have your number of clusters. Depending on your data and your Kmeans implementation one or the other method can be more efficient.    Embed Quote
