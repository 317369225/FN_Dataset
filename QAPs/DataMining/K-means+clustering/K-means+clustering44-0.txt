★Why isn't Kruskal's algorithm used for clustering instead of K-means?
Kruskal's algorithm is most likely used in practice for clustering. Though, its usage might be dependent on the application. Clustering based on Kruskal is simply a variant of Single Linkage Agglomerative Clustering [1]. Now that we have classified it into a class of clustering algorithm, we can identify what the fundamental assumption behind this clustering scheme is. However, there are other linkages possible, mainly complete-linkage and average-linkage. There have been quite a few papers discussing the results of each of these linkages and these find that, generally complete and average linkages do better than single-linkage at least in practice. Again, there have been other set of papers that show that in certain specific setting, single-linkage can give extremely consistent clusters compared to other linkages. In conclusion, I find that the choice of linkage is primarily based on what works for your specific data setting. And if single linkage does well, then you might as well use Kruskal MST. ========================= I almost forgot to address your other point. Why K-Means? It can be shown that K-means is an EM algorithm (hard EM) which minimizes log-likelihood of the data under specific assumption about the distribution of the data. So, K-means has some amount of mathematical underpinnings and we can understand the assumptions of the data better. This is not the case with linkage clustering algorithms. Also, with development of algorithms like K-means++ [2], the use of K-means as a default choice will only increase. K-means algorithm can be easily kernelized which means you can do k-means clustering in non-linear feature spaces [3]. However, this does not mean K-means is usually used in practice either. K-means relies on 2-norm which is not an ideal distance measure if your vectors are sparse. In such a case, you might use some other clustering method better suited for your data.
