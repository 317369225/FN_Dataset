★How can I apply the K-means clustering algorithm to a flight dataset?
Cluster the airports based on? For example if your trying to find airports nearby, you already have got the answer. It's just Euclidean distance. If you're clustering airports based on  arrival times, you still have a feature existing for arrivals directly in the dataset. You need to do some aggregations or data transformations let's say if you want to find out "what is the ideal destination time(AM or PM) for so and so aircrafts to reach airports which usually are very delayed for different aircrafts which are in the same category"    Embed Quote
