★How do you interpret k-means clustering results?
As K-means works a "greedy" algorithm in which classify the objects into the the K classes. Basically, you start with a initial guess for the means and start measuring their distances against all objects. You assign the object to nearest prototype of class (initial class mean). After the first round is performed, you compute the new "classes means" and iterate. This will lead, in some cases, to a convergence of the method in which after the update of the means no further changes in the cluster is made. You can interpret the result by looking at the position of the means and deciding if they make sense giving your data. Usually for clustering you need to perform some kind of validation for your K value, for that there are several methods (look for cluster validation). This will give you clues about how good is your proposed K (if you don't have a strong believe to assigned a value to it).    Embed Quote
