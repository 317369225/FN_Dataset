★What are the best open source machine learning libraries written in C++?
http://image.diku.dk/shark/sphin... SHARK is a fast, modular, feature-rich open-source C++ machine learning library. It provides methods for linear and nonlinear optimization, kernel-based learning algorithms, neural networks, and various other machine learning techniques (see the feature list below). It serves as a powerful toolbox for real world applications as well as research. Shark depends onBoost and CMake. It is compatible with Windows, Solaris, MacOS X, and Linux. Shark is licensed under GPLv3.    Embed Quote
