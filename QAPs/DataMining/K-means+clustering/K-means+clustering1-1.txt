★Why in categorical data , k-means clustering is weak?
I am no expert in data mining, but I have used techniques like k-means clustering to solve very specific, well-tested problems -- see my answer to What are the problems for which K-means algorithm can be a solution? Clustering is performed in a multidimensional space with each axis representing a different quantifiable metric. Entities which are similar will have little variation between the metrics on each axis, and can be pictured as lying close to each other in a Euclidean space. Clustering algorithms find the center-most point in a group of entities with similar metrics, and use some threshold such as distance from center or cluster density to determine the members of a cluster. As Eeshan Malhotra points out in the question comments, a data set which is purely categorical is by definition one which has no quantitative components. This means that there are no metrics by which to position individual entities, and no simple means for computing similarity (e.g. via proximity). Quite literally, there are "no means", as in no numbers which can be averaged to find the center-most point of the cluster.    Embed Quote
