★Can you use k-means clustering to separate search keywords by performance?
Hi - thank you both. Randy - I will read that article, so thanks. Also - do you mean that k-means clustering will weight each of the metrics I add in (ex: revenue, cost, etc) evenly? Ralph - What I am trying to do is group keywords by quality of the accounts generated from each keyword using conversions, revenue, cost & fund rates (I assumed these variables should be independent of each other) to see if there are any overarching trends that link specific keywords with performance/account quality (I could try and determine this once the clusters are made) I can analyze these performance metrics manually, but I was looking or a way to unite the different metrics in a way that will give a good overview of how a group of keywords tends to perform Ex: one group has higher spend but also converts well If I were to use the four different metrics I mentioned, would I need to normalize them in some way first? Also - what is the best way to determine how many clusters I should use? I tried runnign 5-8 clusters, and it looks like with one of them there are clear trends in keywords and performance, but I assume this may not be the most scientific way of figuring this one :) Any help is appreciated - thanks again! Also - if there is a better way to perform this with a different technique, please let me know!    Embed Quote
