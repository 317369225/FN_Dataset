★What are some Machine Learning algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?I want this to be a general question that could cover different disciplines. If you have any algorithm from an application point of view, then please do mention that as well!
At a minimum - linear and logistic regression are probably the most basic. An understanding of bayes if you're looking at probabilistic analysis of things like text and sets of words. Classification for trees, ensemble and other learning methods (lots and lots of random splits of your data with different starting points) Clustering next for looking at similarities across users and habits    Embed Quote
