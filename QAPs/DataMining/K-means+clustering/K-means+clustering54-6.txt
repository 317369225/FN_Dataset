★What are some Machine Learning algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?I want this to be a general question that could cover different disciplines. If you have any algorithm from an application point of view, then please do mention that as well!
In addition to the above mentioned algorithms, the following methods are very useful - Singular Value Decomposition and PCA Stochastic Gradient Decent approach Generalized Boosting Models K-Nearest Neighbors Hierarchical Clustering    Embed Quote
