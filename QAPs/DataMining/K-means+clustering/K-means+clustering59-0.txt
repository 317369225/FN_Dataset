★How does Mahout implement K-means clustering in hadoop?Mahout splits K-means clustering algorithm to run on multiple machines, with each Mapper getting a subset of the points and nearest cluster computed in a streaming fashion. I wanna know how to implement the algorithem on multiply mapred cluster, but not on a single mapred cluster?
The current Mahout k-means clustering algorithm is a simple translation of Lloyd's original EM based algorithm to use map-reduce as a way of doing each EM step.  Doing this on multiple clusters at once is possible but doesn't make much sense given Hadoop limitations (I assume you mean Hadoop when you say mapred cluster).  MapR is a derivative of Hadoop that would allow easier implementation on multiple clusters since it provides a universal names space and accessibility across multiple clusters.  It still doesn't really make a huge amount of sense. Upcoming in Mahout is a much faster implementation of k-means only that will not have the generality of the current Mahout clustering implementation, but will be blazingly fast.  You can look at that code at https://github.com/tdunning/knn    Embed Quote
