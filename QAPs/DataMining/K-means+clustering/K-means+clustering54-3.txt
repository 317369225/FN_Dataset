★What are some Machine Learning algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?I want this to be a general question that could cover different disciplines. If you have any algorithm from an application point of view, then please do mention that as well!
While developing the curriculum of INSOFE programs, I spent a lot of time pondering about this. We studied university curricula (from computer science, stats and business schools).  The top contenders are linear programming, regression, clustering, Neural networks and SVM. Then we looked at the peer groups.  Obviously, the top 10 algos are published once in 4 years I guess.  The current list is C5.0, KNN, SVM, EM, K-means, Pagerank, CART, Naive Bayes and a few more.  We also looked at competition sites like Kaggle and found the winning algos.  Singular value decomposition, Restricted boltzman machines, random forests, spectral methods seem to be the leaders there. Lastly, we asked industry practitioners.  As expected the focus was on data engineering, feature engineering, cleaning and visualization with modeling sort of not much emphasis! Personally, I would also add genetic algorithms to this list as a very important technique.  I almost always use it for optimization.    Embed Quote
