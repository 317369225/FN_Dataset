★I used dynamic time warping to do k means clustering. I was trying to use silhouette coefficient to score the clusters. How should I modify silhouette coefficient for dynamic time warping?
This  question is very confusing. DTW is a brute force technique for  sequence  alignment. K-means clustering can be done but why to use such  method  when you can do it with simple euclidean metric. Anyway, the  second part  is about silhouette coefficient. The general idea is to  compute this  coefficient for different values of cluster (or K) in the  K-means and  choose the cluster as optimum with smallest value of  silhouette  coefficient.    Embed Quote
