★Unsupervised Learning: What is most scalable algorithm for K-Means clustering for large dataset?Virtually every paper I have seen so far is evaluated on small scale data. Is there any good algorithm for large scale data set ?   application scenario, K<= 10 , Dataset size= 100 Millions, Dimensionality <=100
K-means and Fuzzy K-means are available as part of Apache Mahout open-souce library which is all about scalable Machine Learning. You can find more information here: https://cwiki.apache.org/conflue...    Embed Quote
