★How do I find coordinate boundaries and discard noise using the clustering (k-means) approach?I have a canvas of 1000x1000px and set of elements placed on this area with it's coordinates width & height. I'd like to get coordinates where "the most" of elements are located, so I can discard noisy elements.
I have to say my experience with clustering has been in just two specific fields: text-classification and computer vision; one of which I've gotten academic attention for - as in, a professor reached out to me online and now we're collaborating on a project. The other field was in computer vision, and this is completely self-practiced. One thing that has been common in both such fields, with regards to clustering and "noise" filtering, is that you're first goal is to find a "center" or "centers" of your cluster(s). Once you have your cluster elements and your "mean", aka "center," you can begin to filter out noise by first finding the standard deviation within the sample of elements contained in a cluster, and finally, your noise can then be filtered out using a threshold composed of your mean and two (or 2.3?) standard deviations above or below your mean. High and low pass filtering, respectively, come to mind when I think of getting rid of noise in either text-classification or computer vision. Please let me know if my explanation is too generalized, and I'll try to bring in specific examples.    Embed Quote
