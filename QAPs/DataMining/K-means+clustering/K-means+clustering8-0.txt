★What are the most commonly used ways to perform feature selection for k-means clustering?I have 10,000 data points, each of them having the same 10 features. I want to perform clustering on those data points: what are the most commonly used ways to select the most useful features?
Well in this case I think 10 features is not really a big deal, you will be fine using them all unless some of them are noisy and the clusters obtained are not very good, or you just want to have a really small subset of features for some reason. Anyways, I think you could accommodate forward step-wise regression for k-means: Sf={} #Set of features selected, initially empty 1. Perform k-means on each of the features individually for some k. 2. For each cluster measure some clustering performance metric like the Dunn's index or silhouette. 3. Take the feature which gives you the best performance and add it to Sf 4. Perform k-means on Sf and each of the remaining features individually 5. Take the feature which gives you the best performance and add it to Sf 4. If you have reached the desired number of features stop, else go back to 4 Once you complete it, you will have a curve of the performance metric chosen for each of the cluster-features. Then you will be able to see if adding features helps getting a better clustering and which subset of your features is the best. Hope this helps,    Embed Quote
