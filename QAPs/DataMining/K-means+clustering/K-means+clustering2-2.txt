★How can we choose a "good" K for K-means clustering?Some datasets have an "obvious" set of clusters that would be found by K-means clustering with the right choice of K. How can we, given a set of data, choose such a K?
A quick (and rough) method is to take the square root of the number of data points divided by two, and set that as the number of clusters. The elbow method and kernel method  work more precisely, but the number of clusters can also depend on your problem. For example, if I was trying to separate a population into 3 shirt sizes, I would be optimizing for the best location of the 3 clusters, rather than optimizing for the number of clusters that best segment the data.  From: Determining the number of clusters in a data set Paper on using a kernel matrix to find the optimal number of clusters: Stochastic Simulation of Patterns Using Distance-Based Pattern Modeling    Embed Quote
