★What are some Machine Learning algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?I want this to be a general question that could cover different disciplines. If you have any algorithm from an application point of view, then please do mention that as well!
Must know Regression & Classification Simple Linear Regression Variants of above (Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression) Logistic Regression K-Nearest Neighbors Naive Bayes Linear Discriminant Analysis Optional: Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (If you have time. It is a simple variant of above) Support Vector Machines (Start with Maximum Margin Classifier then go on to Support Vector Classifier and then Support Vector Machines to understand and appreciate) Decision Trees Start with Basics of Decision Trees (Regression Tree, Classification Tree), then Bagging, Random Forests, Boosting Artificial Neural Networks Unsupervised Learning Principal Component Analysis K-Means Clustering Other Techniques Resampling Methods Crossvalidation k-fold, LOOCV BootstrapingSubset Selection Best subset selection Stepwise (Backward, Forward, Both) Shrinkage Methods (Ridge Regression, Lasso)Optional Piecewise polynomials Splines, Smoothing Splines, Local Regression, Generalized Additive Methods Good To Know Implications of Bias-Variance Tradeoff Model Validation Metrics Also, practice all of the above. R is an excellent environment which has built in libraries to do the same.    Embed Quote
