★What is the difference between Naive Bayes and K-Means clustering?
The question doesn't make sense. Naive Bayes is for classification. It is a supervised learning problem where you know the class for a set of a training data points and need to propose the class for any other given data point. k-means is for clustering. It is an unsupervised learning problem where you do not know the class or labels for any data and you are trying to discover or come up with the clusters without this information. You will need a way to assign the cluster for any other given data point here as well. The way of validating, interpreting and benchmarking the results are completely different for supervised and unsupervised learning problems and you cannot compare them.    Embed Quote
