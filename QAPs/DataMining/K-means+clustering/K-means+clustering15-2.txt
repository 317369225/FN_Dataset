★What is a good way to choose initial points of k clusters in k-means clustering?I found some articles discussing how to choose k, but even after I found k, how I can determine centroids for k clusters at the beginning
K-means++ is probably worth the extra effort to use/implement, as it has provable bounds on how much time it will take to stabilize (tl;dr: less).  Combine this with many passes (K-means++ doesn't deterministically pick the starting centroids, it's just a 'better' way of randomly picking them), and you'll be good to go.  :) PS To be extra clear, because it's sometimes confusing, by running many 'passes' I don't mean iterations /within/ the k-means algorithm until the centroids stop moving.  Running the k-means algorithm once until it stabilizes is 1 pass.  Do this many times (think nested for loops), and pick the end result (set of centroid positions) that happened the most frequently amongst your passes.
