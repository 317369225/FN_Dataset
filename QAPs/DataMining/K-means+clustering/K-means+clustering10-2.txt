★How can I assign meaning to different clusters formed by K Means clustering?I have multiple columns in my data. I just want to have some verbal definition of the clusters in terms of the columns.
Typically, you'd want to describe each group by how it most differs from the other groups. Focus on that.    Embed Quote
