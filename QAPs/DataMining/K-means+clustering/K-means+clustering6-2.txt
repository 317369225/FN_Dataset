★How can I apply the K-means clustering algorithm to a flight dataset?
Thanks for A2A The clustering itself is assuming, that your data contains a hidden factor variable, which can be extracted right away. So, if you decided to use k-means, it reduces the countless amount of techniques to trivial estimating the number of clusters. You can dive deep into studies that compare different distance metrics, but it's unlikely that it will make any significant difference. I would suggest the basic ones: Cosine measure Jaccard Manhattan Laplacian What happens next is slightly more complicated. You need to validate the usefullness of your clustering. I will give some examples what you can do: If your goal is to predict some variable, try building two models, one with clusters, one without them. Compare the performance Compute some measures for clustering quality. I find this paper rather comprehensive Page on fsu.edu Project your dataset in some two-dimensional subspace and plot the results distinguishing the clusters.
