★How do I understand the characteristics of each cluster when doing a K-Means clustering algorithm?I want to segment my customers using k-mean algorithm, how can I know the general characteristics of each cluster so I can offer new products or send email-marketing to each customer segment? Is there a way to understand the characteristics on R (programming language)?
Data might be on many dimension,  more than to visualize. Then project into 2D or 3D and plot data, observe the latched centroids on this plot for better observation. You might use PCA or Stochastic Neighbourhood Embedding    Embed Quote
