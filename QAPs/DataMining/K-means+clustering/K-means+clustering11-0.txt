★How do I evaluate k-means clustering in R?
This is how I would approach it, but I believe assessing a clustering solution is both art and science. 1.) If possible, i.e. if you have enough time or computing resources, use the gap statistic to estimate the best number of clusters for your data set. clusGap {cluster} 2.) To actually assess the solution, my favorite assessment statistic is the Silhouette coefficient. silhouette {cluster} I like it because it gives you a more absolute idea of whether your solution is good, i.e. silhouette closer to 1, or bad, i.e. silhouette closer to -1. (This is the standard interpretation and I ASSUME this is the implementation in R.) This paper discusses MANY cluster assessment measures: Page on r-project.org Of these, I prefer Calinski-Harabasz and Davies-Bouldin. Both of which appear to be implemented in several places in R. 3.) Here is where the "Art" comes in. I think that your clustering solution making sense to you and for your data is more important than these measures. So you will need to profile your cluster solution.  The first thing I would do is look at the cluster mean values (centroids). Are they truly separate? Are they covering all the distinct groups in your data?    Embed Quote
