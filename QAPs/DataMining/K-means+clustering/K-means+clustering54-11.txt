★What are some Machine Learning algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?I want this to be a general question that could cover different disciplines. If you have any algorithm from an application point of view, then please do mention that as well!
Support vector machines - even the name is little confusing it is the most easy to use algorithm with impartial results albeit you don't know ml at all. It requires little tuning with a bit of effort to choose the correct kernel function Random forests - it is additionally more viable to proceed on multi-machine systems and parallel execution suppose to get comparable results against svm Deep learning - in traditional machine learning features you emerge have tremendous importance for the success. However this handmade features are not capable to discriminatively project the data. In such a case you may learn the features as well and deep learning approaches are the state of art with promoted success stories. Expectation maximization - it is well known clustering method and more than that. It serves for many other purposes as the underpinning optimization technique. Graphical probabilistic models - obviously in some cases human expertise is necessary for complicated machine learning models . Best use of that human knowledge is contrived via those models and probabilistic inference on those models. Gradient descent and counter parts - this is the main optimization technique for many learning models.    Embed Quote
