★What are the most practical (daily life) applications of k-means clustering algorithm? How exactly has k-means been used in these applications?
K-means (or any other clustering algorithm for that matter) is not directly used 'everyday'. These are used to calculate code-vectors (the centroids of different clusters). For any word/value/key that needs to be 'vector quantized', we calculate it's distance from all the code vectors and assign the index of the code vector with minimum distance to this value. MP3 files, cellular phones are the general areas that use this technique. There are around 40 different types of sounds in English language. Thus we generally use a codebook size >= 64 to quantize these. Now, whenever we speak to the phone's receiver, the analog signal is sampled at fixed intervals, giving certain scalar values (let's assume between 0 and 1000). These values are assigned one number between 1 and codebook_size on the basis of the distance calculated. This compresses the data by a factor of codebook_size:1000B!    Embed Quote
