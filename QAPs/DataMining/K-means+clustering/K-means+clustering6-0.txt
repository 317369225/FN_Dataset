★How can I apply the K-means clustering algorithm to a flight dataset?
ATA First you should be clear about what you want to cluster. This is a dataset containing flights, but you're talking about clustering airports. The key to clustering is a distance metric, that says how close or similar two entities are. Clustering makes sense only insofar as you have a meaningful distance corresponding to your desired idea of similarity. I think you'll also want to think about this as well: do you have any idea of what makes flights or airports similar for the purpose of your problem? Running k-means is trivial. Use an algorithm. Typically your input must be in the form of continuous features, not categorical. If using a distance metric like Euclidean, you'll also want to normalize features if you can. Finally you will need to try many values of k to determine which tends to fit the data best, and that in turn requires picking a quality metric. Libraries can usually help with this.    Embed Quote
