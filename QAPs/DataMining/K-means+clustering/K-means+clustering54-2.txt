★What are some Machine Learning algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?I want this to be a general question that could cover different disciplines. If you have any algorithm from an application point of view, then please do mention that as well!
The stuff that everyone should know are the fundamentals.   Knowing these well gives you the perspective needed to navigate the landscape.  It also helps you understand the relevance of more advanced algorithms.  But just as a programmer first learns how to sort and search and the relevant fundamental algorithms (quick sort, binary search, etc.), every machine learning practitioner should have solid understanding of: multiple linear regression, logistic regression decision trees rule based classifiers naive Bayes back propagation neural networks support vector machines k-means clustering ensemble methods, bagging, boosting, etc. market basket analysis/association rules And of course you should also have knowledge of the basic computer science of sorting and searching, since a large part of your work, before you can apply machine learning algorithms, is data wrangling, so knowledge of basic data processing is a useful background.    Embed Quote
