★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
An idea is just an idea. You can talk to any number of people about your idea, but the MVP (minimum viable product) is when the true value of the idea is projected. Feel free to discuss idea, in discussion, you will refine and know what your idea will look/feel/smell/taste like ;-).... In a crowdfunding context - look at the trend on say kickstarter....the most funded ideas are usually the ones that have some form of MVP, than just an idea.    Embed Quote
