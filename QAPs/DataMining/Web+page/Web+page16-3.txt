★What is a good service that provides visual heatmaps of user clicks on a web page?I have already checked out crazyegg and clickdensity and am not impressed by either. Is there a service you would recommend? Is there an open source solution?
Saw there's an Asian startup is doing another Heatmaps analytics: www.miapex.com    Embed Quote
