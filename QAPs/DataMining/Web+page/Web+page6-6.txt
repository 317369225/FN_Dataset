★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
It is not weird at all. You could make a case for the reverse: designing websites in Photoshop might be the standard, but is actually a strange practice. Even more so now with current CSS capabilities and changes to applications like Illustrator and InDesign. Photoshop was not developed as a design tool. It is software for image editing, whatever features Adobe might have added. For a long time Photoshop was the only tool where you could craft pixelperfect designs. But Illustrator has pixeltools for nearly ten years now. And before InDesign knew about pixels you could use points as a measure (1 point equalled to one pixel). In the latest two versions of ID you do however have to change the scale with a script, since Adobe has different ideas about what is 100% or Actual Size. Some people prefer Photoshop because it gives you control over font smoothing; specifically in simulating how type would look on a Windows machine without font smoothing. You still can make a case for this. On the other hand, it's very rare that clients tell you ‘Hey! the fonts are not smooth in my browser as on my design!’ as long as you communicate to a client what they can expect from a design. There might be some effects in which graphics or buttons need heavy effects. If you like the Flat Design trend and want to put it into your designs, do yourself a favor: quit using Photoshop for design. There is one area in which Photoshop still shines: preparing visuals for the web. These days, a large part of a design can and should be made with CSS. So this leaves only parts of the design which you need to save as an image. Just select what you need in aan AI document, copy and paste into a new PSD. Most of the times you don't even need to slice anymore.    Embed Quote
