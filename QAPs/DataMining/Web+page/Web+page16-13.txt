★What is a good service that provides visual heatmaps of user clicks on a web page?I have already checked out crazyegg and clickdensity and am not impressed by either. Is there a service you would recommend? Is there an open source solution?
Take a look to MouseStats http://www.mousestats.com/ which can be considered as the most professional heatmap provider in the market. Real-time heatmaps including Visitor Playbacks and Form Analytics. Also, MouseStats supports A/B testing and can be integrated in almost all complicated web apps.
