★Will web applications kill web pages?As a trend, mobile applications are becoming valid replacements for web pages.  Seems like we are moving from a world of unsructured information - pages, links - to a world where applications rule - soon on Web, not just Mobile.  How will pages and applications co-exist?  What are the implications on Search engines, discoverability?
I think web apps are great for devices where compute or battery are limited.  They can make intelligent choices of how much should occur in the cloud vs on the client device.  So I dont think they will kill web pages.  But I do think they will become the focus of buzz, development, etc.  Web pages will continue to grow in sophistication and will be the desktop PC experience.     Embed Quote
