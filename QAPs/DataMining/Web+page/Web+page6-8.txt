★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
Not at all. If it's weird to prefer Photoshop or Illustrator it's bizarre to think you need either of them at all when you can design in-browser. With the plethora of breakpoints we now have to consider, not to mention motion design, designing in-browser is usually the best way to form ideas and execute them, especially if you want a swifter, smoother development and QA process.    Embed Quote
