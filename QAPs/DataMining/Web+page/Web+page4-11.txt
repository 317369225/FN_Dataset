★What is the difference between a PHP and HTML Web page?
HTML is used to make static webpages. It does not contain logic or the programming part. Imaging a calculator with no programming at all but there are buttons and the display screen only. The interfaces can be designed by HTML and CSS. But to make these things live, certain amount of programming is needed. Think PHP as a medium where you can make those calculator buttons work and do arithmetic calculations on it. Websites which shows dynamic content and which responds to user interaction needs programming at the backend. PHP is one of those backend language.    Embed Quote
