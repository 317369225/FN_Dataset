★Why are Amazon's web pages so cluttered?
2 easy reasons: 1. Scrolling is easier and faster than clicking. 2. More information helps to make the purchase decision. As for your specific questions, let me just pick one to answer: "Why two columns of customer reviews, one wide and one narrow?" -> The wide ones are the "most useful reviews", Amazon is drawing your eye to them, these are the ones that'll likely be more helpful. The narrow column provides at a glance a sense of what the other reviews say. Remember: scrolling is easier and faster than clicking. It all makes eminently sense, and has been tested to death for years.    Embed Quote
