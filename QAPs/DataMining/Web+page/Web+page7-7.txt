★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
If David S. Rose told me exactly what Gust was going to do, the inner workings, the business model, and the people who would be involved right before he started it.....i still would not have been able to do anything about it. Many fail at the same idea, few succeed due to execution. For example: Fleet management (GPS devices in business vehicles) is a great "idea" but hiring the developers, importing great products (At the right price) building a sales force, joining associations and landing large accounts, hiring sales reps nation wide is what would matter... not the "idea". The idea takes minutes to do, the other side takes years.    Embed Quote
