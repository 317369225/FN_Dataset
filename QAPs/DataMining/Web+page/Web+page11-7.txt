★Why are Amazon's web pages so cluttered?
They simply don't care if we or anybody specific like their design. It has evolved over the years, but was built right from the beginning to work on even the oldest browser and ugliest phone. And millions of users are now used to how it works. It isn't easy to transition such a massive user base to something new, especially if design isn't an issue for them anyway. So Amazon takes the path of slow and small changes, every now and then. You can barely tell it is changing. But that's exactly the point. They don't want a shitstorm of angry users :).    Embed Quote
