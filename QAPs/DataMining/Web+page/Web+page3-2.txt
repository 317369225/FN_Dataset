★Designers: How do I make better looking web pages?
Study, research and copy. You'll learn a lot when you really start looking at websites. The colours, fonts, layout trends, the heirarchy across different websites. Studying themes that have all ready been made is a good way to learn what the design trends are and how you can apply it to your next project. When I was first building my website for my business, I looked through at least over a hundred websites related to my field. I began to see how their websites were setup and how I could apply their formula to my needs. I began to see the negative traits found throughout websites and made sure that I didn't make the same mistake they did. (ie. No cross browser testing, not responsive or outdated) Research. A good website isnt just something that looks good in the screen. It has functionality. A proper UI, solid SEO and website speed and size also make a website go from good to great. Copy. I don't mean literally take another persons design and call it your own. I believe there is a saying that no design is truly original. Every design has been created by a collection of what we have seen in the past, we merely created a design from our own perspective. A lot of websites now have the full width slider or video, flat design or say...Facebook integration. Others in our industry noticed that those little integrations worked well for someone else, so in essence it should work for them in some fashion as well. I hope this insight will help you a little.    Embed Quote
