★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
If you're working on a company's entire branding collection (web, print, signage, packaging, etc.) it's much better to start in Illustrator. Vector first, pixel second. Especially if you're working with a lot of designers — PSDs that are graduated from project to project quickly lose their vector details and high resolution. Inevitably you end up with a lo-res flattened PSD that's good for nothing. Even when Illustrator files are passed around, they still retain all of their vector precision.    Embed Quote
