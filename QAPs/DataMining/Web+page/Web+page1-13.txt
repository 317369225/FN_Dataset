★What is the best website very few people know about?What's great about it?
One of best comedy sites on the Internet: Uncyclopedia Just go and start reading something, if you haven't yet. Seriously recommended for anyone who haven't read it yet: Cracked Most people might know this, but just to make sure. It's one of the most entertaining/addicting sites I have seen. Recommended for anyone who is utterly bored: http://www.wtfshouldidotoday.com I found this one when I Googled those words on a frustrating day. Since then, whenever I am bored - I ask Google wtfshouldidotoday, and this site never fails to entertain me.    Embed Quote
