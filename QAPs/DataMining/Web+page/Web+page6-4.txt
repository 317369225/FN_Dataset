★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
Web designers using Photoshop are just using Photoshop because that's their favorite tool, in fact it's almost everyone's favorite tool. But it's definitely not the most appropriate tool. In Photoshop CS6, vector objects gained a lot of useful features like proper line widths and flexible rounded corners, it introduced a searchable and filtered Layer panel, and many layers can be easily not just exported to bitmap imagery but also be copied as a bunch of CSS properties. Great stuff ! But wait, Adobe Illustrator is indeed much easier in working with objects (in stead of layers) and since CS5 it can draw with "pixel perfect" and "pixel grid based" options. Ideal for web design ! Still, many designers prefer the advantages of working with Photoshop, addressing typically photographic layers directly, combined with reasonably easy vector objects. They don't like to switch between applications for editing bitmaps while working in Illustrator – or the other way around. Many designers have been using FireWorks (formerly from Macromedia, acquired by Adobe in 2003). It's a blend between pixel and vector artwork. Sounds ideal, and it is - oops, was. Back in May 2013, Adobe cancelled the further development of FireWorks. CS6 will be the final version, apart from some promised bug fixes and a few maintenance updates. Adobe will even be taking Photoshop a big step further, by integrating Photoshop with the brand new Adobe Edge Reflow. Photoshop layers will be converted into editable HTML and CSS objects in Reflow, to take the task of making a proper layout (and responsiveness) to a higher level.
