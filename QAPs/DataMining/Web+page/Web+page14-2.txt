★Why is HTML used in web pages?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Each appliaction has it's own markup language, e.g. Android SDK uses XML to design the apps UI, and like it, a browser reads HTML top to bottom, displaying the tags as words or images. E.g. <p>hello world</p> would tell the browser to strip the tags <p></p> leaving hello world displayed on the screen. It's just what language is standard (there are others, such as XHTML which is basically HTML but neater though not often used as HTML is looser and not as strict) for browsers to render on screen    Embed Quote
