★What is a good service that provides visual heatmaps of user clicks on a web page?I have already checked out crazyegg and clickdensity and am not impressed by either. Is there a service you would recommend? Is there an open source solution?
I've discovered a new service with custom analytics and heatmap tool abtoanalytics.com - all features are available for free as they are in Beta so far.    Embed Quote
