★What is the difference between a PHP and HTML Web page?
HTML is the end results, the content that is being sent to the user and displayed on his browser, the content could be sent as HTML to begin with or there might have been a programming language preparing it before it gets displayed on your browser - This is PHP, programming using PHP enables flexibility when it comes to accessing resources such as databases and making calculations like getting input from the user and working with it... The PHP does some work as it was programmed to (in the background) and once done it will output the result most probably as HTML and the server will send it to your browser. Your browser knows to interpret HTML, if you see .php as the file extension it doesn't mean that you are viewing a PHP web page, it just means that in order to serve you that final HTML content - A PHP script ran on the hosting server.    Embed Quote
