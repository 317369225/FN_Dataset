★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
I have fallen in love with Sketch, which is a kind of Photoshop/Illustrator hybrid. It takes the best of both applications and makes a seriously super-charged app for all designers. It’s completely changed my workflow and made me much more efficient. Sketch | The designer’s toolbox Many of the designers started adopting it here at Etsy, and I was hesitant to make the switch. I just started my next project in Sketch and was hooked. There was practically no learning curve. Some of my favorite features: Retains rounded corners while resizing Very lightweight, no heavy graphic editing Great for wireframes too Multiple art boards in one file (I have desktop right next to mobile designs) Export at @2x in one click Export ALL art boards in one click If I need a heavily designed graphic, I do it in Photoshop and paste it right into Sketch. Suggest it to your designer partner!    Embed Quote
