★What's the best way to implement a Mind Map as a web page?Not just a generated picture, but something more interactive, so you can edit it easily. Maybe some services have widgets or APIs.
If you want to be able to edit the map on-line use MindMeister or Mindomo.  With MindMeister you can let anyone with an account edit the map i.e. a Wiki map.  With both of them you can give access to specific individuals or teams. MindManager has the forms the dynamic Flash Player or Player in PDF where you can reveal levels of topics and view notes. Or the static clickable image maps.  There are several other web exports which transform the map in to pages or slides. iMindMap also has a image and outline web export.    Embed Quote
