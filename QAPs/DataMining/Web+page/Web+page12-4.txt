★What separates great "launching soon" web pages from OK ones?Give examples if you have them.
The A/B test. You make as many landing pages as you think you need and have them compete in an A/B test. This will tell you what your audience likes and what they respond to best. Not every audience is the same. So no amount of information can tell you what is "great" vs. "OK". That said, you still want to higher an expert to create the pages for you. needless to say: i design landing pages ;)    Embed Quote
