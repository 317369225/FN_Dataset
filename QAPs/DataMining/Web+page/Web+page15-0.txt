★Why do my web pages look big?I did some HTML development using Bootstrap 3, but the pages appear way too large. Is there a way that I could possibly shrink the page sizes (or perhaps zoom out) to make it appear more normally sized?
you can wrap your page into your costum div element and you have to give it max-width of 1000px for example, then write all bootstrap code into this div    Embed Quote
