★What is the best website very few people know about?What's great about it?
TrueMD A couple of years back, there was an episode of Satyameva Jayate: Does Healthcare need healing. It talked about how generic medicines, being much,very much cheaper and exactly same in terms of quality, effect and risk as other branded medicines, are still not being used by most of us. As a matter of fact, generic substitutes of many life saving medicines are upto up to 100 times cheaper. For example, Plavix, a medicine used by heart patients, costs around Rs.1616 per 14 tablets and has a substitute Caplor which costs around Rs. 17 per 14 tablets. Almost 95 times cheaper! Similarly, Veenat -Rs. 10,560 ,used for the treatment of blood cancer, has a substitute Resimat which costs around Rs 900. The list is very long. But when generic substitutes are this cheap, why aren't we using it?   Its mostly because of our ignorance. We are being forced to buy expensive medicines. We never ask our doctor to prescribe us generic medicines. So to increase the awareness of generic medicines, we have built a search engine to help people search for generic medicines or cheaper branded substitutes of the medicines they are already using. We have also open-sourced all of our data through our API. Anyone can use our medicine’s data to build awesome healthcare apps. PS - This is NOT a startup. It is not for any monetary gains. It’s a small effort to make people more aware about generic drugs. If they will realize how much less they will have to pay, they may probably ask their doctor next time to prescribe generic drugs.
