★What is meant by a generic web page exactly?
Depends on the context but I would take "generic" to mean a web page which is for informational purposes only (like an "About Us" or "Shipping Policy" page) rather than a page which does something dynamic (like a "Shopping Cart Checkout" or "Contact Form" page.) Some web developers advertise website packages in terms such as : $995 - Up to 9 generic web pages and 1 contact page. Alternatively a "generic" web page might be synonymous with "static" web page meaning a page written in HTML only, rather than in some programming language like PHP, Ruby, ASP etc.    Embed Quote
