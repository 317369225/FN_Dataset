★How important is the fold on a web page?
Well there are two central points about the fold. First everything above the fold will define the first impression somebody has about your website. So yes above the fold is important, but users are willing to scroll, this is something that changed in the last decade in user behaviour. The second pont is really important, to get users to scroll they have to know that they might find something interesting. The content above the fold must be interesting, get their attention and clearly signal that there is more below the fold. The worst mistake you can make, which actually happens quite a a lot, is a visual fold by mistake. A big coloured block of text above the fold is followed by a lot of whitespace and something that looks like a footer ... immediately the users will think that there is nothing below the fold and stop scrolling. This is a common problem with layouts that have only one column and use the total width of the page. - get the attention of your user - clearly show that there is more below and you will be fine    Embed Quote
