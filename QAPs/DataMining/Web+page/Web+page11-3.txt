★Why are Amazon's web pages so cluttered?
Because it's using the Gruen Transfer. The gruen transfer is a design term for when designers design things, for the intentional purpose of making you lost. Amazon is one of those websites that wants you to get lost on their site. I've always wondered this question myself, and why they can't design their site in an organised and predictable manner. Learning about the gruen transfer, I then found out the answer. I've always wondered why the product pages on Amazon were so long. I realised that this was because they wanted you to get lost on their site, therefore you're discovering new things to buy, of which you wouldn't have, if everything was neat. Of all the shopping websites, shopping on Amazon is most comparable to shopping on the high street, because you can never know where you'll go, and what you'll discover along the way. I used to think that Amazon's design was stupid, but when I learnt about the gruben transfer, I realised just how clever it is. By having panels such as Listmania, Customers also brought, Frequently Brought Together, it provides an unrivalled experience that no other online retailer has been able to replicate. There's a reason why people love the shopping experience on Amazon, though they don't like the design, and this is why. Supermarkets and Facebook also use the gruen transfer, but let's not change the subject.    Embed Quote
