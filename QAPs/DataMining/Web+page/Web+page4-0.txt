It's the difference between:     Hello David, and    Hello New User, The first can be generated by PHP because it can customize the HTML on the fly based on data, whereas the second one is what you have to live with if you use HTML only because it can't do this. There are literally a zillion alternatives to PHP though.    Embed Quote
