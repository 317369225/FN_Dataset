★Why are Amazon's web pages so cluttered?
Their UI design is time-proven. You get lost in the amount of information and are constantly enticed to check-out other, similar or related products, learning about products you never heard thus making you buy more. It's similar to walking into a cluttered store with many things to explore and having a group of interested people giving their valued opinions about everything you see. The store might be a nightmare in terms of design, but you get lost within it and suddenly find yourself with a bunch of products in your shopping bag that you never intended to buy in the first place.
