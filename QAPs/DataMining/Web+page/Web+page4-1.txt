★What is the difference between a PHP and HTML Web page?
well... Lets talk about Quora.. You are using quora. Quora is a dynamic data driven website. By using quora you are able to publish your comments, status, Bio, questions etc. These all are the dynamic features that quora provides you. That means Quora is using any server side language (Quora uses django framework that is written python language). PHP is also a server side language. you can make data driven websites in php like facebook (facebook is built in php language). By using server side language you can allow your users to play with database  just like you do in your facebook account. But if you are using only html.. your pages will be static. Your users can not give any input in your application they can only view your page. I hope it will help you :)    Embed Quote
