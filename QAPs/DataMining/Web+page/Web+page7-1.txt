★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
I'm pretty sure it's harder to convince someone to steal your idea than to prevent them from stealing. If they really did steal it and you can't out execute them your idea would have failed anyway.    Embed Quote
