★Why aren't web pages designed to fit the screen resolution?Space wasted on both the sides with centered overlay if used will save so many scrolling efforts and also gives opportunity to broader information poistioning. (More on same page or wider with same content)
I can see a couple of reasons: not-so-wide screen, yes it still exist browser not in full screen mode reading excessive long line is difficult, because it's harder for the eyes to pick the next line of text when they have to go back far away. more effort to design and implement something which is increasingly less important. The world is heading toward mobile browsing, and the trend is reinforcing. For me the last one is the most compelling. Unless your audience is geeky and desktop only, you'll spend time and money developing something marginally useful.    Embed Quote
