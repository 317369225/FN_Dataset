★Designers: How do I make better looking web pages?
You've asked a very deep question here. People study this question for years — even decades — so it's impossible to give a simple, boiled down answer. You're right when you say that the front end part has a certain intangible quality. There is no short cut to becoming a good designer. Good design draws on knowledge of layout, typography, structure, colour, psychology, physiology, semantics, culture, physics, fashion, history, ... Preferences for border radius, drop shadow and other small design details like those you mentioned differ with trends and between audiences. Trying to improve your design by tweaking such details won't get you very far. I'd say you have a few choices here: 1) work with a good designer. This is the fastest way to get good design. 2) rely on templates. This is fast, but will leave you restricted if you want to do anything outside what the template allows 3) learn to design. This is the slowest route, and you'd better really want it! There are some good answers elsewhere on Quora for how to teach yourself design. That said, my top tips would be: Know what your goals for the design are. Know who your audience are. See your designs through your audience's eyes. Know what you want their response and reaction to be. Start with a broad range of ideas for solutions and narrow down later. Your first ideas probably suck. The best design evolves. Always start with the most important part of the page you're designing. This is usually the part that moves the user closer towards their or your goal Focus on fundamentals: typography, grid, alignment, contrast, proximity, repetition... Ignore what's cool. Look for what works. Look for what's clear. Taking things away is always better than adding things. Testing will always tell    Embed Quote
