★How much does a web page cost?
I'll answer this by asking you a similar question... How much does a car cost? You can pick up a 20+ year old banger for £250, a new sensible Ford Focus family car for £15,000, a new Bugatti Veryon for £1,500,000 or you can buy a very rare vintage Ferrari 250 GTO at auction for £23,000,000. They're all cars, so that's how much cars costs. Now as for websites, there are literary millions of permeations (like cars), so you really need to be specific, otherwise one person will say £250.00 and someone else will say £23,000,000.    Embed Quote
