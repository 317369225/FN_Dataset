★What is a good service that provides visual heatmaps of user clicks on a web page?I have already checked out crazyegg and clickdensity and am not impressed by either. Is there a service you would recommend? Is there an open source solution?
There are many effective click tracking tools out there, but if you weren't impressed with the ones you tried I recommend UsabilityTools - Page on Usabilitytools There are several reasons: - you can measure both clicks and mouse moves - you can generate heatmaps of dynamic elements (like drop-down menus) - you can draw areas of interest that can include anything you want on the website and measure number of clicks there - it's pretty affordable and there is a free trial option - you can test 10 000 pageviews for free before you buy subscription. - there are more tools in that platform that you can integrate.    Embed Quote
