★What is a good service that provides visual heatmaps of user clicks on a web page?I have already checked out crazyegg and clickdensity and am not impressed by either. Is there a service you would recommend? Is there an open source solution?
As Ania wrote, I recommend you to take a look at UsabilityTools - Remote User Testing. By using their Click Tracking you can: visualize clicks and mouse moves, discover which areas draw visitors’ attention and which go unnoticed, test every part of your page and find room for improvement, instantly create customized statistical analysis of chosen web areas, interactive heatmaps allow you to see which parts of the website generate the highest conversion rates, interactive area of interest functionality helps you get quantitative data to make the most of heatmap analysis.    Embed Quote
