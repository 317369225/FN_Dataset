★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
As has been discussed in many answers here and elsewhere, ideas actually have surprisingly little value by themselves; it's the execution of the idea that matters. The most graphic (and accurate) explanation of this was put forth by Derek Sivers, who is one of the smartest guys in the business. He wrote it for his blog on O'Reilly ONLamp many years ago, and then republished it on his own blog some years later. But I think it deserves even wider distribution, so I've taken the liberty of fancying it up a bit and turning it into a graphic, which I am pleased to post here for the first time: What makes this simple formulation so important is that it is scarily accurate. Think about anything in the tech space, do the numbers in your head, and you'll see that the economics work out pretty much as Derek predicts! With particular regard to crowd funding, 'protection' is close to the antithesis of 'crowd-anything'.  So if you want the crowd to fund your app or web page, the more you tell them up-front, the more likely they will be to support your project.    Embed Quote
