★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
Not weird. Some designers have this workflow. It does have its advantages... but I think its still a rare practice and when I get these files to work with it takes me a while to figure out where everything is and how to export files. I've heard rumblings that working in illustrator might be the wave of the future... to facilitate design for retina images, higher resolution screens, etc. But for now, as a designer, I stick to photoshop.    Embed Quote
