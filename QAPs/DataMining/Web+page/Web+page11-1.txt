★Why are Amazon's web pages so cluttered?
UI designers aren't the one's filling the pages up with content. You will find the occasional re-design focused on reducing the clutter that emerges, but the top pages of sites like Yahoo and CNN are driven by different departments competing for space, and trying to justify their claims with user behavior analytics driven by profit. When greed competes, the product is ugly. Zero zen.  When content competes for space, there is conflict between the elements within the page. This results in greater noise and more mixed signals to sort through for any goal a user wishes to accomplish. This is a bad thing. Amazon also fails with layout consistency. Almost every component is a different size, and the spacing is horrible. Amazon also fails with fonts. The fonts used in graphics are all over the board, and in content, they use far too many sizes and colors. Regarding the Greun Transfer: The Greun Transfer is not a graphical solution to an interface problem. Sure maybe they succeed in getting you to stick around. But that has nothing to do with the horrible layout and inconsistencies throughout. Would you rather be lost in a 5 star hotel or in the back alley of WalMart?    Embed Quote
