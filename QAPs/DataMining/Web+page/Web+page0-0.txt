★How important is the fold on a web page?
It used to be thought that users didn't scroll on web pages. That has been disproven in a number of high profile eye-tracking research studies. That said, its really key to communicate the most important information at the top (i.e. what is your site about or what can a user do/achieve on this page), but it is equally important to make sure that elements don't end at the bottom of the page so there is a visual prompt to suggest more content is available. Obviously, you should bear in mind that there are so many new resolutions and browser sizes these days (including mobile devices) - which only emphasises this point further.    Embed Quote
