★What is a good service that provides visual heatmaps of user clicks on a web page?I have already checked out crazyegg and clickdensity and am not impressed by either. Is there a service you would recommend? Is there an open source solution?
Clicktale.com and Crazyegg.com are two big players in the field, but having used both extensively for high-traffic websites, I heartily recommend Clicktale.com, if only for the excellent form analytics module. Being able to aggregate across many visits and see at a glance where do people stumble, where do they make the most mistakes, leave the most, or spend the most time in your “important” forms (such as registration or order) is totally worth the hefty price — and free plan is pretty good for one-page sites or specific landing pages.    Embed Quote
