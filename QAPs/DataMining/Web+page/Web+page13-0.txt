★Why aren't web pages designed to fit the screen resolution?Space wasted on both the sides with centered overlay if used will save so many scrolling efforts and also gives opportunity to broader information poistioning. (More on same page or wider with same content)
For readability, the optimal line lenght is about 50 to 60 caracters, if you have more than that, it can be difficult to go to the next line, if you have less, then you will have to come back to the start too often. If you just expand the page to fit all the screen then you will have extremely long lines in some cases. Sometimes the web sites are designed to guide the user in his eye movement, and make him stare into some areas, if you rearrange the web page to have multiple columns (like pinterest), you can't do this that well, because you always have different views. In some cases you can do this with success, in some others you can't. Also, less information in the visible area could help the user to focus on the content that you want to, and having the same static webpage will save you on develop a more complex design.    Embed Quote
