★How can you make a web page using Python?
If you mean to compose and mark up a page in HTML for use as a webpage, that is something you can do with Python, but it's overkill.

By contrast, you can use CommonMark (CommonMark), the grown-up successor to the Markdown style of formatting a plaintext document for easy conversion to HTML.    Embed Quote
