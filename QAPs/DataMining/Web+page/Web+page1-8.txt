★What is the best website very few people know about?What's great about it?
1.  nick reboot - a 24/7 live stream of classic Nickelodeon shows from the 90s and early 2000 So much nostalgia it hurts.  2.   TagPro Capture the Flag - Online multiplayer capture the flag.  Nothing tricky.  Nothing flashy.  Just an awesome CTF interface. 3.  Adioso - flight search reinvented for humans.    Nearly everyone I know uses Kayak or Skyscanner, which pale in comparison.  Intuitive search terms.  I can type "flight from United States to Kenya in the next two weeks."  And it will find the cheapest ticket in that date range.  Can compare tickets across an entire month for an endless number of airliners.   You can filter by convenience, travel time, price, and so forth.  You can also set alerts to watch for price fluctuations for a particular ticket    Embed Quote
