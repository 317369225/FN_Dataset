★Designers: How do I make better looking web pages?
The look of webpages are subjective.  A flat look or feel might be more appealing towards some people and a skeuomorphic or real look might appeal to others.  You should look into UX.   Users will like webpages more, if they are easier to navigate and read. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
