★What is meant by a generic web page exactly?
I'm not sure there is an exact definition for this. Typically I think one would use the term "generic web page" to describe a no-frills page. By that I mean a page that includes only the minimum content necessary to meet its goals without any special features or functionality. It would probably be built in straight HTML and CSS rather than with a CMS. On the other hand one might also use this to refer to a page that doesn't stand out from the crowd but includes pretty much the same stuff as every other site in a particular market segment.    Embed Quote
