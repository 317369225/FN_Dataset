★How can I quickly design a simple web page?
Hi In short, it really depends on your needs :) If you need a website with e.g. personal blog you can buy shared hosting with wordpress (as it was already suggested), Joomla or some other CMS (content management system). Pros: 1. You fully manage all the web content of the website 2. Popular CMSs (like Wordpress and Joomla) have a huge internet communities, where you can find or ask a lot of info. 3. Really powerfull. A lot of plugins (both free and paid) which allows you to build really functional websites. Cons: 1. You fully manage all the web content of the website 2. You'll have to spent a time on a platform and plugins learning 3. Hosting is paid 4. It could be overkill if you need just a couple of pages Mostly similar option for you is to use some site builder offered by hosting provider, where you buy your shared hosting. Another option is to build a website using online tools like http://yola.com,  http://weebly.com or http://wix.com (in fact there a lot of them) Pros: 1. Mostly free 2. A lot of templates 3. No need to buy hosting account 4. Powerfull - you'll get a fully functional website Cons: 1. Really good if you needn't to add new content really often - each time you add a new content you will have to re-think your layout 2. Less complex than e.g. Wordpress, but still require to spent some time for learning to make a more or less functional website If you are asking about page, but not a website you can try Facebook pages. In my case, when I need to quickly create a website, I use Weebly. When I need just a web page I use http://netboard.me. It allows to add content in Pinterest style, providing URLs, upload PDFs and PPTs (actual for me), and you always have a nice looking simple page with a content you need to share. But it's a page not a website.    Embed Quote
