★Why are Amazon's web pages so cluttered?
Part of it is that everything that goes on there has been A/B tested. Every feature has been statistically proven to increase sales. So even if you wanted to reduce clutter, you'd have a hard time removing any one particular piece of content, because there's a dollar value for every widget. Update: By the way, here's what happened to the largest brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart, when they tried to "de-clutter" their stores: they lost almost $2 billion: http://dailyartifacts.com/walmar.... Too bad they couldn't A/B test their changes as easily as Amazon does.    Embed Quote
