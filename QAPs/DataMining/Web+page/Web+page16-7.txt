★What is a good service that provides visual heatmaps of user clicks on a web page?I have already checked out crazyegg and clickdensity and am not impressed by either. Is there a service you would recommend? Is there an open source solution?
In addition to all of the primary providers mentioned in other answers, HeatData (HeatData: Heatmaps for Mobile Websites) is a product I built originally at the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon that is now used across the web for sites large and small. But HeatData is for mobile heatmapping: where people zoom, tap, swipe, etc. You can imagine how it works for taps (=clicks) as well, but mobile heatmapping is meaningfully different than desktop web heatmapping.    Embed Quote
