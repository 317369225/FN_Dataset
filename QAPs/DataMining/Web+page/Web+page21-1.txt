★Why did Path stop using Twilio's "Mobile App Distribution" on their web page?Original Path: Deliver Your Apps To Any Phone With SMS v/s Actual Path: Path
I think the way Path had implemented was using Twilio for mobile app distribution was the reason it cost them so much.  Let me explain... Path used Twilio as a dumb pipe.  They did no care whether a recipient had a Landline number, or whether they were sending a valid number with the correct country code, etc...   As a result, Path probably paid an arm and a leg to send messages to recipients that would never be receive the message. There are some best practices you should follow if you decide to venture down the road of sms invites.  1) Validate the phone number format prior to sending the invitation.  Here a free tool that will help you do this: libphonenumber - Google's phone number handling library, powering Android and more - Google Project Hosting 2) Send the invitation at a reasonable time of day. 3) Ensure your users are not sending multiple messages to the same recipient. 4) Do not send to landlines.  This cost you additional money 5) Measure measure measure If you'd like to hear more best practices, don't hesitate to reach out to me. best, Chris    Embed Quote
