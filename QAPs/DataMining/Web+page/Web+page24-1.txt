★What are some good tools to analyze web page visitors' behaviors?Not only identify basic events (visited, clicked, etc) but also, for example, cluster users by their behavior?
You should look for tools which are able to display user clusters based on behavior patterns. The features you should look for are: Ability to separate your product into life-cycle (progress) and areas/modules Automatic and manual user clustering and segmentation I would asvise you to take a look at http://www.totango.com - but there are also other tools who address this problem.    Embed Quote
