★Why are Amazon's web pages so cluttered?
I agree.  Their search engine is the worst of all retail sites on the internet too.  For just one example, it's impossible to get good relevance in any search in the first place, but when trying to see items sorted by price, Low to High, many good items totally disappear, and the relevancy is even worse!!  You literally get items in your search results that have absolutely nothing to do with any of the words you typed in the search box!!    Embed Quote
