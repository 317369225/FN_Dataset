★How important is the fold on a web page?
I think it totally depends on the purpose you have for the page. I love Lifehacker.com because I think they have a lot of great content. When I go there, I know that I want to browse all of the headlines of the new articles, so scrolling is in my brain, and I'm happy to do it. On the other hand, if the page is a form asking me to fill out information I prefer a simple, elegant design and would not want to have to do a lot of scrolling to finish the form. Amazon's product pages really annoy me sometimes. It seems like the three sections of the page I use most (general item info, technical specs, and user reviews) are spread all over the place and require me to scroll past stuff I don't care about. I think they could benefit from an above-the-fold mentality. It's all a matter of perspective.    Embed Quote
