★Designers: How do I make better looking web pages?
Content first. A beautiful website is achieved by designing your content first. Figure out who your visitors are and what they want; why they've come to your site. Figure out what you want from your visitors. Do you want them to sign up for a newsletter? Book an appointment?  Read some testimonials? Like you on Facebook? Most of the time, you only get one wish - so make sure you know what you wish for. Figure out how to do both 1 and 2 at the same time. Make content that somehow achieves this. A good idea helps. Rewrite and refine until your content is irresistible. You only have 1.4 seconds to convince your visitors that they should keep reading, or browsing, so make sure you are clear and distinct. A confused visitor = a bounce. Remember that design is content. The placement of photos, your typography, colour scheme, logo and menu structure is not a separate entity from your articles, media and calls to action. It's all content. Now you're ready to make your content pretty. Most of the time, simple and clear = pretty. Fantastic photos help a lot, well-written text get your points across, and great typography does the rest. Don't clutter, don't add stuff just because, and don't loose your focus. Reduce and simplify when you can, add and complicate when you absolutely, positively must. Cool effects are cool and all, but readability, at the end of the day, should be your guiding light. If it does not aid readability,  it is ugly. Lastly, do this for all display sizes at once. Do not neglect mobile devices. Content first, yes, but responsive always.    Embed Quote
