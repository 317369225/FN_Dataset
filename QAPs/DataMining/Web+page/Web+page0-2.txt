★How important is the fold on a web page?
The importance of the fold, particularly on the main page, varies depending on the purpose of the site. For a site that's presenting a product or service, a main page that has all content above the fold presents an image of completeness, clarity, navigational simplicity, and focus. It would be natural and expected for subsequent pages to scroll (those that describe a product or service in detail, for example). If the purpose of a site is to present a wide range of content, and providing a spectrum of deductive choices is critical to the site's value (a news site, a blog, etc.), content below the fold is both expected and implies inherent depth.    Embed Quote
