★Will web applications kill web pages?As a trend, mobile applications are becoming valid replacements for web pages.  Seems like we are moving from a world of unsructured information - pages, links - to a world where applications rule - soon on Web, not just Mobile.  How will pages and applications co-exist?  What are the implications on Search engines, discoverability?
There is a definite shift towards the web of data. Even if it's not the kind of shift Tim Burners Lee and the rest of the SemWeb community would like to see, there are definitely data sources popping up in the form of REST API's and such. One has to be careful though, not to compare apples with oranges. A presentational website for a brand serves it's purpose even without such interfaces. So basically, web pages will still exist in it's form or perhaps evolve into more elaborate application-like experiences. Web applications will in fact "kill" (actually, more likely just put a large dent in) the desktop application market. I feel web apps are the ones to do it, because people are noticing an increasingly closed and narrow focus creeping into the application market for iPhone, Android and now especially the iPad. These kinds of apps serve their purpose for a single user, but in my opinion, the network effects associated with how web applications work will help them prevail.    Embed Quote
