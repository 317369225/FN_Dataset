★What's the best way to implement a Mind Map as a web page?Not just a generated picture, but something more interactive, so you can edit it easily. Maybe some services have widgets or APIs.
Mindjet's MindManager can export interactive PDFs, which could then be viewed  in a browser plugin on a page. http://www.mindjet.com/    Embed Quote
