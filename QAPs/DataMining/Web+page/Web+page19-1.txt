★What is the basic structure of a web page crawler?How do you parse for outgoing links in a web-page? Where do you store such links? (Throwing some light 'how Google does it' will also be good.)
Parsing webpages is only one of many issues that a crawler has to solve. Since all web browsers display malformed webpages, many webpages are malformed, which makes them difficult to parse. Most crawlers have some kind of database in which things like links (and the anchortext that goes with them) are stored. Over at blekko, we wrote our own NoSQL database somewhat like Google's BigTable or Cassandra.    Embed Quote
