★Designers: How do I make better looking web pages?
Ole M. Kristiansen gave the best answer, design is content and you should always design around the content but if you're specifically asking how you can improve your visual design skills, check out Dribbble and Behance and browse designers' portfolios. Dribbble is a very good place to learn how to use colors and craft beautiful pixels. That being said...Dribbble is only good for aesthetics but you won't learn how to become a better designer there because the platform itself is not suitable for giving and receiving feedback. It is more like an art museum rather than a place for designers to exchange ideas so tread carefully.    Embed Quote
