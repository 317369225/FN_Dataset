★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
Having this same question when I first stepped into the tech world, I created a tool for immediate IP documentation.  I was constantly told that the best thing to do would be to just make the idea, but I didn't have the means to get the actual product in development.  I did what I knew to do and started building concept pieces and business plans.  The idea began to flourish, but by the time I had pieces to present to possible investors it felt silly that there was no way to have any legally defensible evidence of the idea conception.  I figured there should be a way to at least register the work I had done with a third party that could present my evidence in court. In response to my own problem, I came up with a now patent pending process which allows you to register your app/website idea on day one of inception along with the ability to easily document your work through the process.  Being a very affordable and always available process, unlike a copyright or patent which is not accessible to a large percentage of app makers, our tool provides iron-clad legally defensible "prior user rights."  Whether you end up in the next Google vs. Samsung or just want to prove that someone stole your idea to scare them from going to court, our tool will give you the documentation you need. We'll be launching our beta version soon, but you can signup now for updates at: http://signup.registeryourapp.com Thanks for reading and best of luck in your app or website venture!!!! -Brad    Embed Quote
