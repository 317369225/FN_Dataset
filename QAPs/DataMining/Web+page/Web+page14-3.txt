★Why is HTML used in web pages?
That's like asking why are books printed on paper. Sure, you can write on wooden sheets, but paper is engineered to be used in books. You can put other things on the web - plain text, PostScript, PDF, SVG - but HTML was created to provide hyperlinks and that's what all web browsers understand natively, so it's the lowest common denominator to make the web from.    Embed Quote
