★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
I use everything. I usually start on paper, then I wireframe in Balsamiq, then I take the wireframes into Illustrator so that I can iterate on design quickly and fluidly. When I'm ready to build the final version, I start a 2x resolution Photoshop file (check the generate image assets box under the file menu) so that I can pass a pixel-perfect design off to the developer. Your process is up to you, but I found Illustrator to be the fastest tool to use to create fifty variations of the same design. Tweaking things in Photoshop takes more time, and you can't make new artboards, you have to make new files. Photoshop is best for finishing touches.    Embed Quote
