★Will web applications kill web pages?As a trend, mobile applications are becoming valid replacements for web pages.  Seems like we are moving from a world of unsructured information - pages, links - to a world where applications rule - soon on Web, not just Mobile.  How will pages and applications co-exist?  What are the implications on Search engines, discoverability?
I believe both will continue to coexist. Content-heavy, "static" sites such as Wikipedia are well served as regular web sites with a page and URL for each resource. There would be no obvious advantage in turning wikipedia into a true single-page app. In fact it makes a lot of sense to have a URL for each real resource — easily indexed, easily searched. Experiential, interactive, and heavily personalized services seem better served by the "app" model. Generally that is done by the service building and exposing an API (i.e. Twitter) that can then be used to build client applications on top of. These can be web applications, mobile optimized web applications, or native clients for Mac, Windows, iOS or Android etc. I believe that the most interesting services that currently exist and *most* that will be built in the near future will tend to fit into the second category or at least be some form of hybrid of the two. With HTML5's history push and the more classic hash tag approaches it's possible to marry the two approaches. These hybrids can have a main, interactive application page (the new Twitter homepage comes to mind) but then also have links to more static pages (like twitter's permalinks for individual tweets) to provide a means of cataloging history and provide search engines a way to access and index the information. Ultimately, the choice will be made based on goals of the service. However, if the new breed of services is any indication, "apps" are here to stay and will become more and more dominant.    Embed Quote
