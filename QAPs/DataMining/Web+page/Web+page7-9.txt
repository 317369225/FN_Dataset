★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
The problem with patents, trademarks and copyrights are the legal fees that most entrepreneurs are faced with to get their intellectual property (IP) buttoned up before launching a Crowdfunding campaign.  KarmaKrowd: Premium Crowdfunding IP Protection Services provides zero upfront costs for these legal services and takes their legal fees out of the back-end platform commission. So unlike most crowdfunding platforms, this one actually provides a value-added service for its fee.    Embed Quote
