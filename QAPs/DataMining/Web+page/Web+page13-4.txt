★Why aren't web pages designed to fit the screen resolution?Space wasted on both the sides with centered overlay if used will save so many scrolling efforts and also gives opportunity to broader information poistioning. (More on same page or wider with same content)
Most websites now-a-days are designed for 1024x768 resolution, as most of the devices(all desktops, tablets/iPad and many smartphones[landscape mode]) support this resolution. This is the resolution where most devices overlaps and hence best specification to build your website on. On desktops the content is centrally aligned, although they have lots of space width-wise. It is done to reduce cost occurring in making a site responsive or developing different stylesheet for higher resolution/dimensions. Companies already paying extra to support mobile phone and low-resolution devices by making the website by responsive or using different stylesheet altogether. It doesn't make sense to invent extra for high end monitors. I also agree with Javier Bórquez that spreading the content on higher resolution(desktops) will make reading difficult. User tend lose line or focus going from one end of the monitor to the other end. Centrally placed contents is less distract-ive and user don't have to scan whole monitor to get to the point. It is a well known practice in web development which is very optimized and recommended. No wonder most of the professional websites follow this. However, there are sites like Pinterest which uses full width to show maximum content possible.    Embed Quote
