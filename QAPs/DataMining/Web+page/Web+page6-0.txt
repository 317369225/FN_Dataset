★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
Weird? Maybe. But bad practice? No. While it seems more commonplace for web/UI designers to use Photoshop, I myself have always used Illustrator. I can't speak for designers who use Photoshop, but Illustrator works for me because of: 1. Intuitive Editing - just click to edit an object, no digging through 300 Photoshop Layers, and no need to name every single layer item. 2. Advanced type tools - you have Character/Paragraph Styles for easy document-wide modifications. 3. Artboards - I can see every single page at once 4. Symbols - It's easy to create modular design components which can all be updated at once, across an entire UI/Site design 5. Graphic Styles - one-click styling for icons and graphic elements 6. Raster elements can still be used - raster patterns & effects as well as photography. 7. Your design is future proof - exporting @2x double resolution images is a piece of cake. 8. You can Slice in Illustrator, too. 9. In-context editing - no mucking around with Smart Objects and guesstimating what will look good. 10. I just know Illustrator better - I have built a workflow which can take me from wireframing to finished files to slicing with a minimum of fuss. 11. Edit: You can export to Photoshop (but support is not great)    Embed Quote
