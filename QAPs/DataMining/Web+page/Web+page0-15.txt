★How important is the fold on a web page?
In these days of short attention span, fast turn-a-round surfing, and multiple inputs of links to follow on, say, facebook and twitter, above the fold is more and more important to me. If I arrive on a page that doesn't get straight to the point, I will often surf away rather than dig for information. I therefore disagree with Stuart Witts post, sorry Stuart :)    Embed Quote
