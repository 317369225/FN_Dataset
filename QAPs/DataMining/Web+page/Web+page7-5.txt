★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
"borrowing" ideas is common place in the fashion industry where there is very little protection. This creates a amazing place for innovation, but a challenge for the individual. Many small designers do execute well, but the ability to SCALE that execution is the key to the success. Thus, if you have a quality product the larger companies will borrow it from you and scale it quickly. That makes the scale above even more interesting and puts the game back in the big companies hands. Idea with no money behind it, is difficult to execute, so how then does a VC determine a good idea based on scale? What is the least amount of $$ and production time that can be spent in order to show the ability to execute?    Embed Quote
