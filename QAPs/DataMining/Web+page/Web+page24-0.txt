★What are some good tools to analyze web page visitors' behaviors?Not only identify basic events (visited, clicked, etc) but also, for example, cluster users by their behavior?
E-Commerce market is booming, recently passing $1T in transactions. Despite that, on average 97.8% of people who enter an online store – leave it without buying. Online retailers are struggling to understand WHY. In parallel, behavioral scientists, such as Prof Robert Cialdini and Prof Dan Ariely, have mapped out dozens of behavioral triggers that significantly influence a shopping decision, yet these aren't being leveraged today in e-commerce. At Commerce Sciences we aim to bridge that gap -- driving the behavioral e-commerce era. By leveraging behavioral studies, collaborations with top behavioral experts,and bigdata analysis -- we decipher the shoppers DNA. Our Behavioral Suite enables online retailers to increase sales by predicting each shopper's buying concerns & psychological motivations and automatically target them with a relevant behavioral experience.  Our algorithms detect clusters of users (and individuals) by behavior - For example, hesitant shoppers before they leave the store and automatically trigger the best relevant experience. This can include addressing their concerns (such as store safety, product question, price, etc) or catalyzing motivation (by highlighting scarcity, authority, social proof, reducing choice to focus attention - i.e. "paradox of choice", emphasizing specific information to create a basis for a decision - i.e. "anchoring", achieving pre-commitment, etc.) Reference: Science Of Persuasion - Prof. Cialdini We're All Predictably Irrational - Dan Ariely Aviv @ Commerce Sciences    Embed Quote
