★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
Most people don't want to put the effort into stealing an idea. However, just in case someone does decide that what they're doing is way less cool than what you're doing and they'd like to copy you - simply copying a product or service won't work to push you out of the market. If you can execute better than anyone else, you stand to gain much more than any copycat business. However, if you don't have any distinct advantage as far as execution or customer acquisition goes, you probably should either find an advantage or know that there is cause to worry about copycats. For example, Google definitely copied Overture's PPC model; they even lost a $300 million suit to Overture on that matter. However, they were still able to make the idea work better than Overture could - as a result, Google won in the long run as far as revenue and clients are concerned. I wrote an article about this on the Fundable blog if you'd like to read it: Why You Shouldn't Worry About Your Idea Being Copied Good luck!    Embed Quote
