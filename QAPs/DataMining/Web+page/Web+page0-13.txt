★How important is the fold on a web page?
As a user, I will generally only scroll if what I am initially presented with interests me, or if I can't find what I'm looking for on the initial view portal. However, calculating what area that initial view portal might be for each user is quite difficult? Tablet devices complicate matters.    Embed Quote
