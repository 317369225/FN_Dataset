★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
I'm a web designer who prefers to use illustrator for several reasons: 1. It's easier to lay things out and organize them 2. I'm not limited to pixels. If I change my mind about how big something should be, I don't have to recreate it. 3. It handles rounded corners way better (I use CS5) 4. It's easier to make selections and alignments of objects 5. The slice tool is actually better than PhotoShop if you know how to use it.    Embed Quote
