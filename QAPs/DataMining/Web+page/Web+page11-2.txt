★Why are Amazon's web pages so cluttered?
I agree with Jason. However, the flaw is the testing only applies to those who visit the site. I don't shop Amazon because it's an experience nightmare. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who casts their vote that way. As someone else mentioned, using Amazon (or any UI for that matter) does get easier over time (read: multiple visits). But if you don't return  then you have no "say" in any adjustments going forward. Consequently,  it gets to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. They've built an experience  that serves returning visitors but "excludes" those who do not fit that  profile. And so on and so on...    Embed Quote
