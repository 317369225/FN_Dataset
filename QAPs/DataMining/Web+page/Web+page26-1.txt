★How do I archive a web page?
Get the HTML, add a <base href="the base URL for the site"> just below the <head> tag and store the HTML someplace. If you choose to go programmatically, you can traverse each IMG link through the DOM, get the image down separately, store it locally and change the Img link (this is what the file/save as etc. do) Can do the same thing to expand <a links to full (that way you don't need to use the "<base href" method above) Finally, if parts of the web page are rendered via javascript, get the page and load it onto a browser plugin - if you're using Windows you can use the IE Webbrowser control, or the mozilla source code has a way to load up a URL into DOM and exec javascript. Once the page is fully loaded, you grab the DOM root and use it's inner HTML and save to disk. Consider also the image and anchor archiving methods above.    Embed Quote
