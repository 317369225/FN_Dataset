★How important is the fold on a web page?
Although the fold is something to keep in mind while developing a website, I think too much emphasis has been put on it in the past. Also, with the immense variation in screen sizes and resolutions it is hard to define where "the" fold is. The idea that visitors will not scroll (and thus see content) below the fold is too simple. Sure, visitors are lazy and if there is no need for lengthy pages, then don't create them. But as anyone can tell by visiting current pages on the web, many sites contain long pages. If you use long pages, just remember: the most important information should always be located near the top of a page, so anything below the fold will likely be less important. The big issue here is, are there enough visible cues for the visitor that there is more (valuable) content below the fold. If this is the case, visitors will usually understand and scroll down. So it is not about whether users will scroll down, but whether it is clear to them there is more to be found below the fold. Headings starting near the bottom of the page and rectangular blocks and images extending past the fold give users clues about this. Many news websites use these clues rather effectively.    Embed Quote
