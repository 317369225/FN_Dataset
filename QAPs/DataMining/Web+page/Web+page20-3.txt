★What is the easiest and the most efficient way to create your own web page?
I would not agree that the easiest and the most efficient way to create your own web page would be to type up some cryptic commands like: mkdir, echo, >>, &&, -m and SimpleHTTPServer 8080, Python (which might require searching for and installing Python).  Where is one supposed to type that arcane code?  A text editor?  A browser?  A terminal?  Is the text supposed to be saved in a file somewhere?  How is it supposed to be run or opened? Obviously, the topic question implies that it is posed by someone who is a novice at web page creation, not someone experienced in computer programming or web development.  Another suggestion that the novice posing the question should install WordPress or some other CMS, along with plugins, is also a long way from the easiest way to create a web page.  I’ve done that.  It’s a lot easier to use WordPress online and similar services such as Weebly, Squarespace, and Blogger. Likewise, using an HTML editor and entering code such as: <!doctype html> <html>     <head>         <title>My first web page</title>     </head>     <body>     <strong>Hello, world!</strong>     </body> </html> is not very easy for a novice if he wants to create a web page beyond "Hello World!".  The implication in the question is that his goal is not to create a minimalistic demonstration web page, but to create his “own web page” which suits his design goals, and which may include photos, graphics, colors, text formatting/styling, etc. It’s much easier to use a WYSIWYG web page application like iWeb (Mac) or WYSIWYG Web Builder (Windows) which have simple drag-and-drop user interfaces and don’t require any coding.  An even easier way is by leveraging the novice’s existing knowledge and experience with a word processor.  It is very likely he already knows how to format a page using either Microsoft Word or a similar program like OpenOffice Writer.  A word processed document which includes a custom layout of images and text formatting can be very simply saved as an HTML document and then opened by a web browser or uploaded to a web server.  Creating a multipage web site is a little more complicated but still relatively easy for some word processing apps, e.g. OpenOffice Writer.  In summary, the easiest way for a novice to create practical web pages is to use a familiar word processor to design a page which is then saved as a .html file.  Up one level in difficulty but also having more available features, is a WYSIWYG web site builder like iWeb—which my 10 year old daughter used unassisted to create her own multipage multimedia web site.  Then up another level of difficulty comes the online web site services like Weebly and Blogger.  Lastly, and even more difficult, but which allows more customization and scalability is to use a hybrid application like Dreamweaver or Kompozer, which allows you to use both WYSIWYG and text based HTML/CSS/Javascript and other languages and frameworks.    Embed Quote
