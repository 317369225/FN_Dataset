★Designers: How do I make better looking web pages?
-Make sure they work on all devices (Responsive or Media Queries and know the difference) -As such ^ don't use flash if you want the site to work on all devices. -Consider complimentary colors: The Color Scheme Designer -Utilize CSS3 animations and transitions for *sex* appeal -Use <figure> to associate captions with images. -Know when to use Local browser storage -Use required attribute on input fields for instant validation. -Only use a div when no better element is available to do the job. <header><footer><article><section> -Use async attribute on JS to prevent page load issues due to slow loading JS -Don't use <center> anymore    Embed Quote
