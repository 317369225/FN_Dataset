★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
I design every website in Illustrator. Some developers complain when I hand them a file that is not Photoshop but most don't. With flat designs as you say this design was, I find Illustrator to be much much better. Photoshop is great for making effects, but Illustrator is better for resizing elements since everything is done in vector. As for cutting images, Illustrator is great for that. Just add slices and you can cut every image in one go. Saves alot of time. But 90-95% of my designs does not need any images, it's just colours and sizes basically.    Embed Quote
