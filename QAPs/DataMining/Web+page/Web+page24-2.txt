★What are some good tools to analyze web page visitors' behaviors?Not only identify basic events (visited, clicked, etc) but also, for example, cluster users by their behavior?
You could try using www.usertesting.com, where they record a video of a typical user trying to complete a task, or series of tasks on your website. I really like www.crazyegg.com for heat mapping because you can group by visitor type, hostname, search terms, etc. Then you have tools like www.kissmetrics.com and www.mixpanel.com to look a funnel analysis, and see how visitors navigate your site. If you don't want to spend any money, you have some built-in tools in Google Analytics, such as the Flow Path tool, where you can map the visitor flow (aggregately), or the Multi-Channel Funnel Analysis, which is their attempt to solve attribution issues.  This shows a Venn Diagram so you can see the multiple channels it took for some visitors to convert. Good luck!  Don't get bogged down with tools....just really define what you're after, and just solve for that.    Embed Quote
