★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
Yes, I do find that a bit odd. For me, Illustrator and vector art in general are both infinitely better for print applications in CMYK. If you're designing anything with  photos, complex gradients, or anything else requiring rasterization, then it makes sense to use Photoshop/RGB. I can't imagine there are too many modern websites that don't use photos these days. Also, like you mentioned, the  slice tool is very useful for exporting projects into a final web product. It's  available in Illustrator, but (in my opinion) feels more intuitive  in Photoshop (and has been a staple for web design for about a decade). There's also the fact that Photoshop is way more ubiquitous than  Illustrator, so handing off a PSD file to someone is a lot safer choice. That said, Illustrator has it's place in the design process. Wireframing for one. The manipulation of shapes is just a ton easier in Illustrator. It'll also be less intensive on your computer since you'll likely be using vector placeholders rather than pixelated images. And of course, Illustrator can't be beat for designing logos or other images that need to be scalable at some point.    Embed Quote
