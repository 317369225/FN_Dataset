★Which are some of the best web data scraping tools?What are the best tools (free/paid) to scrape large amounts of data from webpages and store it in required formats?  The tool preferably should be automated to look for new data at specific intervals.
If you want to actually extract data from a website, you are going to need to do some custom programming for each site.  I have used a Python based library called Beautiful Soup (http://www.crummy.com/software/B... http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ (links to: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) ). It is good for parsing HTML and XML. In particular it can parse HTML and XML that is not well formed.  Its main use case is when you have data locked up in site and you need to extract it.  TheWebMiner (links to: http://thewebminer.com/) has an interesting tool based on samples provided by user ( http://thewebminer.com/demo (links to: http://thewebminer.com/demo)) If all you want is to extract HTML and text, I would recommend Apache Tika (http://tika.apache.org/http://tika.apache.org/ (links to: http://tika.apache.org/)).  This is useful for extracting data from PDF, MS Word, PowerPoint, images, and about any other type of data.  It is used in projects like Solr. It is Java- based, but it also has a command line tool as well.  Next, Universal Feed Parser is great for parsing RSS and Atom feeds (http://code.google.com/p/feedpar...http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/ (links to: http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/)).  Again, these are just tools and not full fledged solutions.
