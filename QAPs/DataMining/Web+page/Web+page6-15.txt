★Is it weird that a web page designer uses Illustrator not Photoshop?
I find it slightly odd personally, but different people prefer different tools. I've found the use of Illustrator for web design more common among folk who have a print design background, but ultimately it's the end result that matters rather than how you get there.    Embed Quote
