★What is a good service that provides visual heatmaps of user clicks on a web page?I have already checked out crazyegg and clickdensity and am not impressed by either. Is there a service you would recommend? Is there an open source solution?
Website heatmaps provide by Sessioncam.com. 4 types: mouse movement, mouse click, scroll and attention. Free plan available.    Embed Quote
