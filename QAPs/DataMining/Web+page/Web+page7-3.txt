★How do you protect the idea (like an app or web page)  if you decide to go crowdfunding?What precautions you must/should take?
Once it is out there, it's out there.  If you do go crowd-funding, the very best precaution you can have is to plan well and be ready to execute on that plan. Vet your team.  Are they ready?  Are they capable?  Are they willing?  Do they believe as you do? If the answer to any of those isn't an emphatic "yes!", reconsider until it is.    Embed Quote
