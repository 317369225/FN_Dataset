★What is the fastest loading web page?As part of my job in a phone store, I often need to load some web page, any web page, on a bunch of phones to test if they are connected to the internet. These phones are on pretty slow data connections, so even Google can take quite a while to load. What is the quickest loading web page to test connectivity? Right now I use Useit.com because it seems pretty simple. It loads quite a bit faster than Google.
If you only want to test the connectivity then http://ip.mwasif.com/ can be quite useful. It shows the current IP address of the user. The total download data is under 1KB, it will work fine for slowest connections as well. I ran a performance test on Website Performance and Optimization Test from San Jose, CA.
