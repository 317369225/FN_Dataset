★What is a good SVM toolbox for Matlab?The built-in SVM functions that comes with the bioinformatics toolbox are pissing me off.
I might also suggest Stanford Professor Dr. Stephen Boyd's suite of tools for functional programming, etc.  http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/so... This software includes MATLAB/Python software for SVM and newer cool variations like consensus SVM.    Embed Quote
