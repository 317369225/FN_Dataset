★Why scaling is important for the linear SVM classification?When performing the linear SVM classification, it is often helpful to  normalize the training data, for example by subtracting the mean and  dividing by the standard deviation, and afterwards scale the test data  with the mean and standard deviation of training data. Why this process  changes dramatically the classification performance?
Remember the kernel trick used in SVMs depends on inner products between training examples. If one component is much larger than the others, then it will affect the inner product more than the others, which means the classifier won't care about most of the other features.    Embed Quote
