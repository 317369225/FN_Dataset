★What is the difference between the perceptron learning algorithm and SVM?Both algorithms deal with trying to find some separating hyperplane. I know that perceptron has some well studied bounds with respect the the largest margin the data is separable by. SVM tries to solve some dual problem that maximizes the margin.
SVM maximizes the margin. Perceptron minimizes the error. (so if it's configured to output just 0/1 it basically minimizes number of misclassified points - and doesn't care about how wide the margin is)    Embed Quote
