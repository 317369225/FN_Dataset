★Support Vector Machines: What SVM package is best for large-scale linear classification?For example, LIBLINEAR, LIBSVM, SVM-Light, GPUSVM . . . If the answer depends on the dimensionality of the data, please say so.
It's completely different if you want to train linear SVM or kernelized SVMs. Linear SVM enjoy good scaling behaviors to large problems in both sample size and feature size (a.k.a width). For instance liblinear, Bottou's sgd and vowpal wabbit can handle millions of training examples and features in reasonable times on a laptop. For RBF kernel models I have heard good things about an approximate online solver named LASVM by Antoine Borders: http://leon.bottou.org/projects/... . Otherwise the regular SMO based exact solvers such as LibSVM don't scale well at all.    Embed Quote
