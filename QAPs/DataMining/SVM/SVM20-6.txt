★What is the best way to train a SVM on a very large dataset?
I would suggest looking into feature selection techniques rather than using 500 features for each image. It is possible that a large number of features will not be necessary for your classifier to differentiate between the categories, but could rather be problematic in terms of memory management and classifier over-fitting. Different techniques include ReliefF,Information Gain and Gain Ratio. Once your chosen technique has selected a number of features that are necessary for your model to work, there are several ways in which you can train and validate your model. The most commonly used techniques includeproportion test, cross validation, and leave one out. I have recently blogged about training and evaluating classifier performance:http://mlcorner.wordpress.com Although the examples are demonstrated in Python and not Matlab.    Embed Quote
