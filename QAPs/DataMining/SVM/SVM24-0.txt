★Support Vector Machines: Variations of SVMWhat are the available slight modifications of SVM ?
Basically the SVMs form a learning algorithm family rather than a single algorithm. The basic concept of the SVM based learning algorithms are pretty simpe: find a good learning boundary while maximizing the margin (i.e. the distance between the closest learning samples that correspond to different classes). This idea is called maximal margin heuristic. Each algorithm that optimizes an objective function in which the maximal margin heuristic is encoded can be considered a variant of  the SVMs. However in the machine learning literature the name SVM (as a named entity) is dedicated to the soft margin, kernel based, maximal margin classification problem.    Embed Quote
