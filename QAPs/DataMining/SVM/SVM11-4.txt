★Support Vector Machines: Why does SVM work well in practice, even if the reproduced space is very high dimensional?
SVMs also work so well because they are solving a convex optimization problem, and it is possible to develop high performance numerical solvers. Compare this to, say, a traditional neural network, which can be quite difficult to get to converge Actually you have to be careful running an SVM for very large, sparse systems (say 1/2 million features) because the solver may converge poorly without some  feature pruning.  Or at least compile the solver in double precision.  Even Vapnik acknowledges this and has suggested some approaches to help convergence.    Embed Quote
