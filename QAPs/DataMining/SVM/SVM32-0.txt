★How can I improve the performance of my SVM?I'm using the PyML implementation of an SVM to classify the MNIST database, but can't achieve the performance touted on Yann Lecun's website as possible for SVM's.  What can I do to improve the performance of my SVM in classifying the data set?
Are you optimizing the algorithm's parameters? For a linear SVM, C must be selected and can greatly impact performance. For a kernel SVM there may be additional parameters (e.g., gamma for RBF). There are different ways to perform this optimization, but I recommend a simple "grid search". Check out the paper: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjli...    Embed Quote
