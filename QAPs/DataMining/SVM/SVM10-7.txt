★Support Vector Machines: What SVM package is best for large-scale linear classification?For example, LIBLINEAR, LIBSVM, SVM-Light, GPUSVM . . . If the answer depends on the dimensionality of the data, please say so.
http://dm.unife.it/gpdt/#parco03 it uses parallel gradient projection-based decomposition  approach for parallel SVM, so suitable for large scale SVM classification. For general purpose I suggest libsvm and svmlight package.    Embed Quote
