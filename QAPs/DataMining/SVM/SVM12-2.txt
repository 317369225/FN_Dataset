★Support Vector Machines: What is the intuition behind Gaussian kernel in SVM?How can I visualize the transformation function that corresponds to the Gaussian kernel? And why is Gaussian kernel popular? This question extends to other popular kernels as well (such as polynomial kernel).
I can't give any help towards visualization, but the gaussian kernel basically assigns a score proportional to the nearness of the query point to the support vector points; This means that highly varying terrains can be represented. It's sort of like the strengths of KNN combined with the strengths of discriminative/large-margin methods.    Embed Quote
