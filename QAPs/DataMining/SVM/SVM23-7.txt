★Is it worth trying PCA on your data before feeding to SVM?
Yes .... and No ;) PCA helps in reducing number of interested dimensions in the data space. But, at the same time, it may affect the performance of your SVM module by changing the data-space drastically. Since, you may be ignoring dimensions with lower variance/ information, PCA is lossy. This may be dangerous if applied blindly without the knowledge of data. I have not come across any theoretical basis/ proof/ theorem/ axiom on which one can decide when to and when not to use PCA. Thumb rule is that use PCA. Run your SVM on both PCA-ed and Non-PCA-ed data. Compare tradeoff between accuracy and performance. Make your call. :) The way in PCA causes data reduction is somewhat different than the way in which usage of non-linear kernel in SVM increases data-space dimension. Trying to find a tradeoff, comparison etc is in itself, I feel, a research topic.    Embed Quote
