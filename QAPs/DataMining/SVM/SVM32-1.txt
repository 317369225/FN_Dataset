★How can I improve the performance of my SVM?I'm using the PyML implementation of an SVM to classify the MNIST database, but can't achieve the performance touted on Yann Lecun's website as possible for SVM's.  What can I do to improve the performance of my SVM in classifying the data set?
Make sure your data is properly scaled. That's usually the best trick. Scale the training set only and then use exactly the same parameters to scale the test set. Don't scale them together. If your data is properly scaled then grid-search the hyper-parameter "C" and if you use a non-linear kernel the kernel-specific parameters too. Binarizing categorical variables sometimes also help SVMs get better results.    Embed Quote
