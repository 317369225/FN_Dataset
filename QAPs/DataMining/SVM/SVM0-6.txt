★What are Kernels in Machine Learning and SVM?I'm trying to get into SVM, but I cannot get the idea of kernels. What are they and why do we need them?
The  intent of the Kernel Trick: to allow us to represent a infinite set of discrete functions with a family of continuous functions.  And in many cases in machine learning, we can express  our dot products with a simple analytic function, with some adjustable parameters.
