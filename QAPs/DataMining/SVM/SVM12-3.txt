★Support Vector Machines: What is the intuition behind Gaussian kernel in SVM?How can I visualize the transformation function that corresponds to the Gaussian kernel? And why is Gaussian kernel popular? This question extends to other popular kernels as well (such as polynomial kernel).
A Gaussian Kernel is just a band pass filter; it selects the most smooth solution This is readily seen by applying the Fourier Transform to the dot products that appear in machine learning equations  Any dot product of features can be written as: where are derivative operators A Gaussian Kernel works best when the infinite sum of high order derivatives converges fastest--and that happens for the smoothest solutions    Embed Quote
