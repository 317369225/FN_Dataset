★Is there a way to get the confidence values in SVM classification?
Yes and no. An SVM is a margin-based classifier, which means it finds the vector w that best separates both classes, by seeking to maximize the margin (i.e., the distance between the closest points to the hyperplane defined by the vector). The class (+ or - 1) is computed as sign(w·x + b), where w and b are parameters and x is the input vector. By the formulation of the svm, the input vectors it classifies well are further from the margin than the dubious ones, so you can get an unnormalized idea of confidence just by looking at |w·x+b|. Any value bigger than 1 means the SVM is reasonably sure about that point, and any value smaller means it isn't (usually, although this can vary depending on the optimization criteria). There is also a way of estimating class membership probabilities based on SVMs. Libsvm supports this, and with a little extra work you can train a SVM that gives you these probabilities.    Embed Quote
