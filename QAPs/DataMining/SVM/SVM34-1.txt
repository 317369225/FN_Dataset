★How can I implement SVM in R using multicores?
Multi-threading makes sense if resampling is performed. Below is a quick sketch. Step 0. Determine a resampling strategy - (repeated) k-fold cross validation, bootstrap ... - let total number of repetition be a multiple of # cores for efficiency (eg 4 cores, 8 fold CV) Step 1. Create a function to do resampling resample <- function(data, ...) { # divide train/test data # # apply model to train data # # obtain error on test data # # keep models and errors in a list and return # } Step 2. Spread the function into clusters and keep outputs - two options (parallel and foreach (with doParallel) package) Step 3. Average models and average (or majority vote) errors For a quick intro to the parallel and foreach packages, you may find the following posts useful. 2015-03-14-Parallel-Processing-on-Single-Machine-Part-I 2015-03-17-Parallel-Processing-on-Single-Machine-Part-II 2015-03-19-Parallel-Processing-on-Single-Machine-Part-III    Embed Quote
