★Support Vector Machines: What SVM package is best for large-scale linear classification?For example, LIBLINEAR, LIBSVM, SVM-Light, GPUSVM . . . If the answer depends on the dimensionality of the data, please say so.
For large scale linear classification the best library you can have is Liblinear http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjli... . Other popular algorithms are Pegasos( http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/...) and  the SVMSGD package by Leon buttou and Antoine bordes. Compared to liblinear  these algorithms are fast  but tuning the meta parameters (regularization parameter, bias, scale of bias, number of iterations) is bit difficult.    Embed Quote
