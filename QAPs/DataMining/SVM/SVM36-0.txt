★When does Naive Bayes perform better than SVM?I am performing a binary classification on a dataset (1800 samples, equal distribution of classes). Naive Bayes performs better than Linear and RBF kernel SVM. What factors are affecting this. Can some one help me with this.
When the  conditional independence assumption is satisfied naive Bayes could perform better than SVMs. There is a mathematical proof that no classification can be better than Bayes classification if some assumptions hold good Page on wisc.edu or you can get lots of other stuffs in google for proving this. Your data could be clean :) so naive Bayes is working well than others    Embed Quote
