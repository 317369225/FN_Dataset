★What is difference between SVM and Neural Networks?
In simplest manner, svm without kernel is a single neural network neuron but with different cost function. If you add a kernel function, then it is comparable with 2 layer neural nets. First layer is able to project data into some other space and next layer classifies the projected data. If you force to have one more layer then you might ensemble multiple kernel svms then you mimics 3 layer nn. In addition some other svm and nn combinations exist. For example you might utilize from many layer nn and have yhe final classification via svm at the output layer. It is likely to have better classification results compared to normal nn    Embed Quote
