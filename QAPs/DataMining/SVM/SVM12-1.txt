★Support Vector Machines: What is the intuition behind Gaussian kernel in SVM?How can I visualize the transformation function that corresponds to the Gaussian kernel? And why is Gaussian kernel popular? This question extends to other popular kernels as well (such as polynomial kernel).
I would say don't visualize the transformation function. That's not where the intuition behind it comes from. The function is just used in the proof and is infinite dimensional. Maybe this is not what you are asking for, but I would say the visual motivation behind Gaussians is that it forms a circular contour around a single point. I think the just came after, to prove that it's actually a kernel. A Gaussian kernel: Since we have 2 variables, let's just fix one of them, say x, without loss of generality. Now consider moving y. Notice that as you get farther and farther away from x, the similarity value goes down exponentially. Two things: The direction doesn't matter, because of the norm, eg. the kernel is circular You can adjust sigma to control how "far" y can be from x for it to be "too far", eg. for the similarity value to be too small to matter. Larger sigma gives a larger "circle" where point y would "contribute" to whatever you are doing with the kernel w.r.t x.    Embed Quote
