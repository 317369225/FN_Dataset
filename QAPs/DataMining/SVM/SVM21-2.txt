★Why scaling is important for the linear SVM classification?When performing the linear SVM classification, it is often helpful to  normalize the training data, for example by subtracting the mean and  dividing by the standard deviation, and afterwards scale the test data  with the mean and standard deviation of training data. Why this process  changes dramatically the classification performance?
Any svm solver runs a numerical optimization and it is necessary to estimate the step size it takes to reach convergence.   If the step size is too small, the solver will take forever to reach the global minimum.  If it is too big, it will get close fast but then oscillate around the global minimum.  The step size needs to be in some unit of measurement, and this unit is  normalized by looking at the volume of the data set, such as a ball  bounding the entire set of points.    Embed Quote
