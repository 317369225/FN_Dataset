★Support Vector Machines: Why does SVM work well in practice, even if the reproduced space is very high dimensional?
Convex optimization objective Good generalization Sparse interest of instances (just the support vectors not all instance vectors in the dataset) Easy to use with different software packages and little effort to optimal parameter settings (dislike neural nets) Stable with the changes on data (not like decision tree classifiers) Generated model fits with the different domain of problems like Computer vision. (Generated model can be viewed as a filter over images). Diversity of the kernel tricks for different problems. It makes possible to get a good result in some way or another. If SVM gives poor results use another kernel, if does again use another until you get satisfying results. Thus SVM is good tool for newbie researchers.    Embed Quote
