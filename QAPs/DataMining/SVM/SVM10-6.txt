★Support Vector Machines: What SVM package is best for large-scale linear classification?For example, LIBLINEAR, LIBSVM, SVM-Light, GPUSVM . . . If the answer depends on the dimensionality of the data, please say so.
I am a fan of Shogun http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/ I also like the kernlab package in R though I don't know how well it scales.    Embed Quote
