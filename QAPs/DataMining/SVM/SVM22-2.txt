★What does support vector machine (SVM) mean in layman's terms?How to calculate the SVM taining accuracy using ROC area
SVMs are linear classifiers which assume that your data are linearly separable[1].  In the simplified two-dimensional case, imagine that your data are plotted along the x- and y-axes.  The algorithm attempts to find an optimal vector (in this case, a line) that separates them.  Indeed, the algorithm would like to separate the instances by a maximum margin.  This is so that unseen examples are more likely to be classified correctly. In higher dimensional spaces, the algorithm searches for a hyperplane, but the principle is the same.  The Wikipedia article on SVMs has some nice pictures: Support vector machine 1. A technique known as the "kernel trick" allows SVMs to be used on non-linearly separable data.    Embed Quote
