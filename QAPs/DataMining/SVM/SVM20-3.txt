★What is the best way to train a SVM on a very large dataset?
Here are some suggestion: 1) Reduce the number of features you use. There are a lot of different feature reduction techniques. 2) Do not use an SVM. I know this doesn't answer your question per say, but there are other algorithms that may be just as effective with the same features and can be trained a lot faster (Naive Bayes comes to mind) 3) Investigate using a distributed version of an SVM like this [1]. Then push it into the cloud. Your problem seems to be more a memory issue than processing issue so this may not be applicable. [1] psvm - Parallel svm    Embed Quote
