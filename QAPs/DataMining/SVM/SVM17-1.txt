★How can I use SVM  to classify documents?As I know Using SVM to classify documents is better than Bayes. Can you get some examples?
In addition the work by Joachims (as mentioned by Nikita Zhiltsov in his reply) I would also recommend checking out kernels that take into account sequence information: String subsequence kernels: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers... Word Sequence kernels: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/vie... Both these kernels have been used for text and help in, in a way, realizing the "SVM equivalents" of n-gram models, word sequence overlap models etc    Embed Quote
