Please be familiar with T. Joachims' works on it e.g. [1] [2]. [1] T. Joachims. Text Categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with Many Relevant Features, 1998. (https://eldorado.uni-dortmund.de...) [2] T. Joachims. Learning to Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines: Methods, Theory and Algorithms, 2002.
