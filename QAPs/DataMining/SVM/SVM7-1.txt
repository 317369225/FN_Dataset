★When should I use Boosting instead of SVM?I do research in Computer Vision and most of the literature when it comes to supervised learning is filled with SVM's. When should I use boosting (Adaboost)? Or has boosting been overthrown by SVM?
Kernel SVM requires too much memory and CPU in the runtime, linear SVM does not have enough representation power. So the rule of thumb: 1) If you have dense feature set, go with boosting. 2) If you have sparse feature set, go with linear svm (or other linear model) 3) If you don't care about speed and memory, try kernel svm.    Embed Quote
