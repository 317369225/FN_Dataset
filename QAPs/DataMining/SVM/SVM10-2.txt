★Support Vector Machines: What SVM package is best for large-scale linear classification?For example, LIBLINEAR, LIBSVM, SVM-Light, GPUSVM . . . If the answer depends on the dimensionality of the data, please say so.
If you have a stochastic update that runs in constant time with a low constant, you are in pretty good shape. If you are using a linear model and want an SVM loss, try SVMSGD by Leon Bottou: http://leon.bottou.org/projects/sgd His benchmarks show orders of magnitude improvements over SVMlight and liblinear among others. However, for linear modelling, you should consider Vowpal Wabbit! by Jon Langford and cohorts: http://hunch.net/~vw/ It's supposedly even faster than SVMSGD, and perhaps higher accuracy.    Embed Quote
