★What is some good advice on the incremental learning of SVM?
I have a blog post on this, which is relevant when not all of the data is labelled (it was unclear if you were asking about on-line learning or the kind of incremental learning I describe in the blog post) Machine Learning with Missing Labels:  Transductive SVMs one suggested improvement is to add a Transductive or Semi-Supervised SVM into the mix.  In my experience, this is pretty tough to get working correctly and requires more than just BOW features you probably also want to add Eigenword features (not discussed in the blog) there are number of ways to do this (LSA, PCA, NMF...)...here is a recent paper on the topic  Two Step CCA: A new spectral method for estimating vector models of words http://arXiv.org e-Print archive/pdf/1206.6403v1 I would be very interested in hearing how this works out    Embed Quote
