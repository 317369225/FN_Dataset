★What is the difference between C-SVM and nu-SVM?I'm using libSVM in MATLAB to classify a dataset that has unbalanced data. (I think the answer to the question doesn't have anything to do with unbalanced data, but I wanted to know the difference anyway.)
The nu-SVM was proposed by Scholkopf et al has the advantage of using a parameter nu for controlling the number of support vectors. The parameter C in the ordinary SVM formulation is replaced by a parameter nu which is bounded by 0 and 1. Earlier the parameter C could have taken any positive value, thus this additional bound is beneficial in implementation. The parameter nu represents the lower and upper bound on the number of examples that are support vectors and that lie on the wrong side of the hyperplane, respectively. Now despite the new bound, the nu-SVM is comparatively difficult to optimize and often the runtime is not scalable as compared to C-SVM.    Embed Quote
