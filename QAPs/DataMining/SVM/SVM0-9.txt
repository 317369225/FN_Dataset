★What are Kernels in Machine Learning and SVM?I'm trying to get into SVM, but I cannot get the idea of kernels. What are they and why do we need them?
To add to the other answers, an RBF kernel, perhaps the mostly commonly used kernel, acts essentially as a low band pass filter that prefers smoother models. For a full mathematical justification of this fact check out Charles Martin's explanation.    Embed Quote
