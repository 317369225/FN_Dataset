★What is the difference between SVM and Ranking SVM?
If you want to use SVM for ranking then your goal is to determine an ordering between your datapoints. Let's say you assign each datapoint a class such that if a point is more relevant than another then its class is higher. We can write this as: If Xi>Xj then Ci>Cj then WXi > WXj then W(Xi-Xj)>0 Then you can use all the pairs Xi-Xj as your datapoints and assign +1 if Xi>Xj or -1 otherwise. You learn a classifier from this training set and then given two points you can determine which one is more relevant than the other one. This allows you to sort any set of datapoints for your final ranking.    Embed Quote
