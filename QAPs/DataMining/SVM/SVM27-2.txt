★What is the difference between the perceptron learning algorithm and SVM?Both algorithms deal with trying to find some separating hyperplane. I know that perceptron has some well studied bounds with respect the the largest margin the data is separable by. SVM tries to solve some dual problem that maximizes the margin.
One:Perceptron finds some separating hyperplane while svm fines the widest margin hyperplane. Two:If the training set is not separable perceptron fails while svm finds the minimum cost separation. This is known as soft margin.    Embed Quote
