★Support Vector Machines: What is the intuition behind Gaussian kernel in SVM?How can I visualize the transformation function that corresponds to the Gaussian kernel? And why is Gaussian kernel popular? This question extends to other popular kernels as well (such as polynomial kernel).
We would like see the gaussian parameter as a distance, at which we observe the data set as a picture. Then what is the proper distance? If it is the distance at which we have a clear mind about what is far and what is near between the data items, it might be the essence of the classification. This idea helps to choose the parameter efficiently, and it works very well on most of the data sets. What confused me is that I cannot see any connection between this explanation and the origninal meaning of gaussian kernel(map the data to infinite-dimensional space ).  there is simple formula for calculating the ,    I am looking forward to discussing with anyone instereted in this topic, thanks for helping and sharing.    Embed Quote
