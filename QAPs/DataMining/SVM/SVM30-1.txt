★What is difference between SVM and Neural Networks?
SVM and NN are both supervised learning methods, but they work a bit differently. As Eren mentioned, in theory they may not be that different from each other. Support Vector Machine SVM fits a hyperplane/function between 2 different classes given a maximum margin parameter. This hyperplane attempts to separate the classes so that each falls on either side of the plane, and by a specified margin. There is a specific cost function for this kind of model which adjusts the plane until error is minimized. From: http://algoholic.eu/faster-dot-product-for-svm/ Neural Network A neural network has several input, hidden, and output nodes. Each node applies a function some data (could be softmax, linear, logistic), and returns an output. Every node in the proceeding layer takes a weighted average of the outputs of the previous layer, until an output is reached. The reasoning is that multiple nodes can collectively gain insight about solving a problem (like classification) that an individual node cannot. The cost function differs for this type of model -- the weights between nodes adjust to minimize error. From: Neural Network Library project in C#    Embed Quote
