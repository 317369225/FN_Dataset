★What does support vector machine (SVM) mean in layman's terms?How to calculate the SVM taining accuracy using ROC area
You want to split your data with hyperplanes. From the picture it should be clear that there isn't "just one" way to "maximally" separate points. Nor will it necessarily be possible to get all your dudes and chicks on opposite sides of the split. But let's say you wanted to minimise the sum of squared perpendicular distances to the hyperplane that cuts your space in half. That's a well-defined goal, although there may not be a unique answer and you may still end up with some points on the other side of the board. Of course if you can squeeze an extra dimension out of your data (like using the angles between them) then you may be able to get all of your points on one side of your hyperplane. That's where the kernel trick comes in. (remember multiplication = inner product = angle = correlation) I like Support Vector Machines Auton lab as a reference for ML. http://www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/ca...    Embed Quote
