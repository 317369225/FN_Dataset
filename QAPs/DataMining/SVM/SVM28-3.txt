★What is some good advice on the incremental learning of SVM?
IMHO, Dimensionality reduction can be applied for sparse support vector machines whether the training is incremental or not. The important area we need to focus while doing incremental/decremental training of SVM is to retain the Kuhn-Tucker (KT) conditions on all previously seen data while adding/forgetting the data.    SVM by Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO) will make the training faster(I hope you are using this). You can incorporate distributed in-memory frameworks (in the language in which your SVM is implemented) to make the computing faster.    Embed Quote
