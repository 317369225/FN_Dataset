★Is it worth trying PCA on your data before feeding to SVM?
Why would you want to reduce your dimensions before feeding it to a nonlinear classifier? Wouldn't you want to retain the nonlinearity in the data so that it helps you capture that nonlinearity? I might be wrong but I personally feel that you could apply SVM (linear kernel) directly without doing PCA if you're having scaling issues. I've read somewhere that when you have exceptionally high dimensional data linear kernels don't perform as badly as you think. Also note: PCA destroys your data (your data loses its meaning)    Embed Quote
