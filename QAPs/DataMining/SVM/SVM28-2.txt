★What is some good advice on the incremental learning of SVM?
First of all I dont know Whether is there any standard incremental learning algorithm. But with your knowledge , defined some steps to achieve incremental learningm, thats fine.  I hope your task is Classification provided you have been given N data points,thats it. There are several machine learning methods(say Bayes classifier, GMM, k-NN, ANN, SVM and etc.) to achieve  this task. As you mentioned  let us discuss w.r.t  SVM (Support vector machine) and your definition of incremental learning. 1) first of dividing N points into D1,D2,D3,....Ds is a big task.(Because you can train  your initial model with any of one of s , corresponding solution will differ. My personal opinion if data is fully labeoled just train SVM with whole dataset and is there theoretical guarantee that Incremental learning will improve performance :) ) 2) As you mentioned in point 2, how do you choose some points after building F1. 3) Overall if you go with incremental learning , you can write some robust algorithms, I can see much randomness in your steps , but still can define steps with solid theoretical reason behind !!.    Embed Quote
