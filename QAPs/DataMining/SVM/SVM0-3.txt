★What are Kernels in Machine Learning and SVM?I'm trying to get into SVM, but I cannot get the idea of kernels. What are they and why do we need them?
Intuitively, a kernel is just a transformation of your input data that allows you (or an algorithm like SVMs) to treat/process it more easily. Imagine that we have the toy problem of separating the red circles from the blue crosses on a plane as shown below. Our separating surface would be the ellipse drawn on the left figure. However, transforming our data into a 3 dimensional space through the mapping shown in the figure would make the problem much easier since, now, our points are separated by a simple plane. This embedding on a higher dimension is called the kernel trick. In conclusion, and very informally, a kernel consists on embedding general points into an inner product space.  PS: I have taken this graph from http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/ch..., which is also shown in Hastie and Tibshirani: Elements of Statistical Learning.    Embed Quote
