★What is uniform probability distribution?
A uniform probability distribution is the one that corresponds to the intuitive idea of all values (of the random variable) being "equally likely". In the case of a one dimensional discrete random variable with finitely many values, this is exactly what it means. If is a random variable that takes values , it follows a uniform distribution if , a fixed constant, for . Obviously, (since the sum of the probabilities should be ). The mean of the distribution is , and the variance is . The outcomes of the roll of a fair die form a uniform distribution. The values are , each with probability . One the other hand, the sum of the two outcomes on rolling two fair dice does not follow a uniform distribution. Now consider a one dimensional continuous random variable. We can no longer say that all values are equally likely, for there is no probability associated with single points — probabilities are associated only with intervals. In terms of the intervals, we can say that all intervals of the same length (within the range of possible values of the random variable) are equally likely. Then, it turns out, the probability density function (pdf) has a constant value (again, over the range of possible values). Thus, if is a continuous random variable over the interval , then the pdf is (some fixed constant). As , we get . The mean is (the midpoint of the interval), and the variance is . We can also define multidimensional uniform distributions. The pair of outcomes on rolling two fair dice is a two dimensional uniform distribution, with , for .    Embed Quote
