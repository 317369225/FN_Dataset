★What is the use of Probability distribution Function and cumulative distribution function in machine learning concepts?
This is a pretty good question and the answer lies in the way these two terms are phrased. Probability distribution function provides what is the probability of x being a certain value. So lets say we have a probability distribution function of age called p(x), then p(27) will tell me the probability that a random person selected from the population is of age 27. Cumulative density function is actually what it says. It is cumulative. So if we define a cumulative density function as P(x) P(27) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3) +.+.+ P(27) i.e. P(27) will tell me that probability that a random person selected from a population is less than or equal to 27 years of age. usually P(x) =   summation of p(x) for  -Infinity to x    Embed Quote
