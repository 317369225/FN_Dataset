★Does all observed data follow some probability distribution?I understand there exists known probability distributions (e.g., normal, exponential distributions, etc.) that "most" data will follow, but for such data that doesn't, I feel it would still follow some equation that describes the likelihood of some event occurring. Is this correct? Thanks for your help in advance!
I see a few problems with the claim that all dataset follows a law that can be described with an equation. First, there's actually not so much data that follows simple probabilistic laws. There's a good deal of ideal data (for instance, the arithmetic means of i.i.d. variables with a second moment, and even that is asymptotical) that are proven to follow nice laws. But in practice, you can't really prove that a dataset follows perfectly some simple law. What you can expect is data that reasonably fit with simple enough laws or models, and where you can quantify probabilistically your error. Second, what if there is such an equation like you're mentioning, but it is just too complicated to be even written? The normal distribution is all nice and its density can be written with a simple formula, but it's pretty easy to come up with random variables, based on other simple random variables, whose density function is a nightmare to write explicitly. Think, for instance, of the composition of a normal random variable with a pretty complicated function (with cubic roots, and [math]log(log(•))[/math]-s, and discontinuous functions). Then what is even the point of such an equation if you can't write it in a computer to get a decent approximation? Moreover, if you're looking at fitting such a complex compound of functions, you might run into overfitting. My point is that statistics are a way to efficiently approximate (model) the reality (data), not to inefficiently describe it perfectly (equations).    Embed Quote
