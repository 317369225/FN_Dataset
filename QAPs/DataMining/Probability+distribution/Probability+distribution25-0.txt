★What is the difference between probability distribution and probability density?
Your question could be posed a bit better, but I think what you're asking is the relationship between the distribution function, or cumulative density function (CDF), and the probability density function (PDF). They related by the CDF being the integral of the PDF, then As long as the conditions involving integration and differentiation hold (true for most probability functions encountered in practical problems) then If the distribution is discrete you'll need to replace the integral by a sum. If it is of mixed type the Stieltjes integral.    Embed Quote
