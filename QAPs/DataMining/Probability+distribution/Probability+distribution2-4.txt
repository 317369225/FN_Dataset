★Does all observed data follow some probability distribution?I understand there exists known probability distributions (e.g., normal, exponential distributions, etc.) that "most" data will follow, but for such data that doesn't, I feel it would still follow some equation that describes the likelihood of some event occurring. Is this correct? Thanks for your help in advance!
It depends on what you are calling as 'data'.  Usually a random variable within a data set might  follow a probability law, whether discrete or continuous, and is associated with a probability distribution. Data collected on something arbitrarily without any specific rule is hard to be called a random variable, unless it's variation can be defined or predicted. Data collected on several variables may be too jumbled up to make any sense, but if isolated individually, might show some rules or patterns. Example: From a group of individuals one can collect data on height, weight, level of education, drink preferences, race and gender etc.. Individually each is a variable whose nature can be studied. But collectively it is just a group of numbers or letters that may not make any sense. It does not follow any probability distribution.    Embed Quote
