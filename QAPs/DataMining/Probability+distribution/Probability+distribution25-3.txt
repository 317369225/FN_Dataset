★What is the difference between probability distribution and probability density?
Probability Distribution Probability distribution is like the origin of the data. Given that the data follows a particular probability distribution. We can generate the data by merely using the hyper parameters of that distribution. For example, A normal distribution is completely specified with just its Mean and Standard Deviation given. The data is assumed to follow any particular probability distribution so that it becomes easy to model the data and make predictions and hypothesis testing. Probability Density Probability density is like the behaviour of the data. It gives the likelihood that the data to have a given value at any given point.    Embed Quote
