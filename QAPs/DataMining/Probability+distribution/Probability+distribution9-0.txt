★What are probability distributions used for?I know what the PMF shows the probability for a given event and that the CDF shows the probability for all subset events of a given events. However what is the use case of such functions behind just being another representation of probability to some experiment? What would be some real-world examples where they are used to solve a problem?
One advantage of probability distributions (which is an alternate term for CDF) is that they are more general, in the sense that there exist random variables which have probability distributions but not probability densities (which is an alternate term for the PMF). As such, they might be more suitable for modeling real-world problems which have sudden changes in adjacent variables. In these cases, trying to approximate a probability density may have issues to noise sensitivity, whereas using assuming only a probability distribution may be more well-behaved. This would tend to happen when you are modeling a real-world process with a continuous random variable, but the actual phenomenon is "almost discrete". The probability density, if it exists, would mostly be zero but have a few sparse jumps which may be easy to miss. The probability distribution, though, would tend to smooth these jumps out and possibly be more well-behaved.    Embed Quote
