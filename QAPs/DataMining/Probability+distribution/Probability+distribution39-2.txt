★Does the probability distribution of electrons inside an atom reflect reality or does it reflect our inability to measure?
Reality ! ( according to Quantum Mechanics) To put it simply, if you consider the dual nature of matter, tiny particles like electrons do show a wave like behavior along with a particle like behavior. That means, they are present in space as a probability wave and if you try to see their position, they will collapse to a specific point in space as if they do not want you to know their nature :) How can a particle be present at multiple positions at the same time ? This makes Quantum Mechanics so counter intuitive and puzzling to many ! But the undeterministic nature of Quantum Mechanics is not unquestioned !
