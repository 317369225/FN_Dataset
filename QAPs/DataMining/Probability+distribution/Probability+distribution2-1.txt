★Does all observed data follow some probability distribution?I understand there exists known probability distributions (e.g., normal, exponential distributions, etc.) that "most" data will follow, but for such data that doesn't, I feel it would still follow some equation that describes the likelihood of some event occurring. Is this correct? Thanks for your help in advance!
Given any data you can construct a distribution that models it. This can be done trivially, via the Empirical distribution function But remember, probability distributions are tools we use to model the real world. They describe the real world but don't define it. It is entirely possible there are some natural phenomena for which there is no good enough model. For example, current weather models are only accurate over a short time horizon. We could try to build a better model via more inputs and more complicated relationships between parameters. However it's possible at some point we'd hit a wall -- the act of observing the system modifies its behavior -- and thus no model may ever be complete (for some fuzzy definition of complete).    Embed Quote
