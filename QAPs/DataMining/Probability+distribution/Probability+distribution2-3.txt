★Does all observed data follow some probability distribution?I understand there exists known probability distributions (e.g., normal, exponential distributions, etc.) that "most" data will follow, but for such data that doesn't, I feel it would still follow some equation that describes the likelihood of some event occurring. Is this correct? Thanks for your help in advance!
In applied work, we don't really believe that the underlying data generating mechanism has an elegant functional form. But we don't need to. Usually, we just try to fit a model to the data as it is, and if the fit is good (different metrics can judge this), then we say this functional form is a reasonable approximation for the observed data. Maybe it's the true data generating mechanism. Maybe it's just pure coincidence. But as long as it can predict, that's all we need most of the time. Maybe annual wages are really generated by a log normal distribution, maybe not, but if I can choose mean and variance parameters and draw a log normal distribution such that it "looks" like the data in all relevant scenarios, that might be good enough for my purposes. If you believe in a deterministic universe, then yes, all data can be described exactly with math, and all data points perfectly predicted. But in practice, this is pretty much never the case in any complex system, so all that we really care is that the chosen function is a good fit for the observed data.    Embed Quote
