★What's the best way to ask Wolfram Alpha to derive a probability distribution?For example, how can I ask it to answer this: what is the distribution of y = log(x/(1-x)) where x follows a beta(2,2) distribution.
You can use the Jacobian to get the PDF of . Use this relation: To change this into a function of y, simply plug in The derivative of the inverse transformation (or more generally, the determinant of the matrix of partial derivatives) is referred to as the Jacobian, denoted J. In this univariate case: Wolfram Alpha is not necessary with this approach, although can definitely help with quick computation and differentiation.    Embed Quote
