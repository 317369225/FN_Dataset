★What type of probability distribution is followed by particles in Brownian Motion?Suppose if i need to find the probability of any particle amidst brownian motion , How will i do that?
A Brownian motion particle with diffusion coefficient and initial position has a time dependent Gaussian probability distribution. So if you start with a concentration at , the distribution will be Note the variance grows linearly in . If you have a different initial condition, this function will serve as the Green's function for the general solution. For more information see Brownian motion.    Embed Quote
