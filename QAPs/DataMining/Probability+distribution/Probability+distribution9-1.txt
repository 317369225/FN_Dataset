★What are probability distributions used for?I know what the PMF shows the probability for a given event and that the CDF shows the probability for all subset events of a given events. However what is the use case of such functions behind just being another representation of probability to some experiment? What would be some real-world examples where they are used to solve a problem?
You can use p.b  to model and predict the outcomes of your system. The most popular p.d and specific view of each : 1- Uniform distr.: Used to distribute probability equally over all possible outcomes (discrete) or equal ranges of outcomes (continuous), this distribution is especially useful in virtual experiments or simulations to explore real‐world phenomena. 2- Binomial distr: Model the number of successes that can occur in a certain number of attempts when only two outcomes are possible ( heads‐or‐tails coin‐flip, for example). 3-Poisson distr. The Poisson (discrete) and exponential (continuous) distributions complement one another. Say that there is a cross road in your area that has a lot of accidents. A Poisson distribution answers the question, “What is the probability that such‐and‐such number of accidents will occur there within a month?” And an exponential distribution answers the question, “What is the probability that the time until the next accident is such‐and‐such length of time?” 4-Normal distr . The bell curve . These distributions model phenomena that tend toward some most likely value (the top of the bell in the bell curve) with values at the two extremes becoming less likely.    Embed Quote
