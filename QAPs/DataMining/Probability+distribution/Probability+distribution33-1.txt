★What are the necessary and sufficient parameters that fully describe an arbitrary probability distribution?For instance a normal distribution can be fully described by its first and second moments. What about an arbitrary distribution? Does such description exist? if so, what are the conditions and limitations?
Essentially all distributions have a Characteristic function and distribution. These can be very complicated and in general have many or even infinite parameters. One way to think about the importance of the Gaussian is this: The "magic" of the Gaussian is that is exactly quadratic in the log-density. We typically use second order Taylor series of log-likelihoods for regular problems (i.e., where the conditions for a second order Taylor series approximation is valid). Thus the Gaussian is a good stunt double for more complicated distributions, such as the sampling distribution of maximum likelihood estimates of many parameters. The exact sampling distribution is some essentially unknown function, but the Gaussian is "close enough" and as you say it only needs the first and second moments to be fully characterized. The Gaussian would not be nearly so remarkable if the central limit theorem weren't true as it is frequently false as an empirical law.    Embed Quote
