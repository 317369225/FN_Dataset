★Give some real world examples where the following probability distributions show themselves?laplace, rayleigh, exponential, poisson, chi square, gamma, log normal, weibull.  we usually model random processes as gaussian, which is the next most popular option?
log normal distribution is used to model returns from stock market. Poisson distribution is used for modelling queuing system. e.g. people arriving at railway ticket counter. We can say that expo distr gets implicitly used in this modelling i.e. the time between arrivals of people at a ticket counter are exponentially distributed. Further if we consider or note down the exact arrival times of these peoples then we will find that they have gamma distribution. Poisson process is also widely used. In finance and risk management fat-tailed distributions like t distributions are used. Skewed distributions also find there applications in finance/risk management. Other stochastic processes are weiner process/brownian motion(used in stocks/equity modelling) and markov process    Embed Quote
