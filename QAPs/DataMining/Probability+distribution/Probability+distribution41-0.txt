★How can you test what continuous probability distribution fits a given set of data best?
Graph it! If the data is roughly normal and "bell-curve" shaped, try a Normal Distribution. If the data is only positive and has a tremendous amount of right skew (e.g. a long right tail), try fitting a Gamma or Weibull distribution. If the data is only between 0 and 1, try a Beta distribution. You can estimate the parameters of your distribution by using a simple method-of-moments estimator. Equate the mean/variance of your data with the mean/variance of the distribution. Then solve. Aleks Jakulin's answer will let you evaluate the fit numerically. A distribution with a higher log-likelihood will be a better fit, but it's very important to rely on your eye! Graph your estimated distribution and see how well it conforms with your data.    Embed Quote
