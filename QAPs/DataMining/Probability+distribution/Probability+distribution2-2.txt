★Does all observed data follow some probability distribution?I understand there exists known probability distributions (e.g., normal, exponential distributions, etc.) that "most" data will follow, but for such data that doesn't, I feel it would still follow some equation that describes the likelihood of some event occurring. Is this correct? Thanks for your help in advance!
Unless you are talking about something related to particle physics, then you can pretty safely assume that the process you are discussing is completely deterministic.  So, if you had enough information about the process, there'd be no chance and you'd know exactly what was going to happen every time and why.   The probability distribution is our way of describing a lack of knowledge when dealing with a deterministic system.  You should always be able to express your lack of knowledge about a system in terms of a probability distribution.  The shape of the distribution depends on how the deterministic system you are studying works, and what little you do know about the system.   Generally the distribution should be a maximum entropy distribution.  This essentially assumes you know as little as possible about the part of the system you don't know about.    Embed Quote
