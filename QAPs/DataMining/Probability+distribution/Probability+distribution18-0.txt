★What are some measures of the distance between two probability distributions?
A class of distance measures can be derived from the Bregman divergence [4], including the Kullback–Leibler divergence [5]. Another approach is to use the earth mover's distance (EMD) [1]. This metric goes by many names, including the Wasserstein distance [2] and the Mallow's distance. A common application of this distance measure is to compare the color histograms of two images. Other approaches include the Bhattacharyya distance [3] and the Hellinger distance [6]. Here's a nice blog post on using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare two distributions [7].
