★What is the least predictable probability distribution?I assume "predictability" is based on some measure of dispersion, such as the variance or perhaps better yet the coefficient of variation. However it is based, the deterministic distribution is clearly the most predictable. The least predictable distribution seems to me to depend on your definition of "predictable" so include that in your answer.
We can say that the "least predictable" probability densities have maximum Entropy (information theory). The "most predictable" distributions (deterministic ones) have the minimum entropy of 0. Entropy matches with our intuition about the predictability of a distribution, and is a measure of how "unpredictable" a distribution is. If Alice is always in her room and Bob is always out and about, Alice's location distribution has low entropy and Bob's location distribution has high entropy. Alice is predictable and Bob is not. The continuous bounded distribution with the most entropy is the Uniform Distribution. The distribution over a finite state space with the most entropy is the Discrete Uniform Distribution. (e.g. Bob is most unpredictable when he's equally likely to be anywhere). For a positive-valued continuous distribution with a given mean, the Exponential Distribution has the most entropy. For a real-valued continuous distribution with a given mean and variance, the Normal Distribution has the most entropy.
