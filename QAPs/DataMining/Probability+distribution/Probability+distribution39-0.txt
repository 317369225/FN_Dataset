★Does the probability distribution of electrons inside an atom reflect reality or does it reflect our inability to measure?
This distribution, like all quantum-mechanical wave functions, seems to actually reflect reality.  We can experimentally show that an electron in an orbital doesn't have a definite position, but it instead spread out through the entire orbital.  The same holds true for any other quantum system where some observable value is not defined by the wave function--it's not just that WE don't know what that value is yet, the universe doesn't know what that value is.    Embed Quote
