★What is the difference between objective and subjective probability distributions?
I understand the question as related to prior distribution. if so, I'll give an example to make easier to see the difference: Assum that you want to compare two drugs A and B; you want to analysis the difference of the effect between them .... If you want to do a subjective analysis, you'll give a prior like this : Diff ~ norm ( -1, 1) -- that mean you give an informative information ( informative prior or subjective prior ) However, if you want do to an objective analysis, you'll do like this: Diff ~ norm ( 0, 1000) --that mean you give no informative information ( will not impact the analysis) for that we called it objective prior distribution. Hope that will help :)    Embed Quote
