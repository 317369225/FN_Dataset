★What are probability distributions used for?I know what the PMF shows the probability for a given event and that the CDF shows the probability for all subset events of a given events. However what is the use case of such functions behind just being another representation of probability to some experiment? What would be some real-world examples where they are used to solve a problem?
Probability distributions are used to determine how frequently the event of interest will occur... Example 1. To determine the probability of number of bank transactions on a given day... 2. To determine the probability of number customers visiting supermarket 3. To determine the probability of demand for a given product... So on    Embed Quote
