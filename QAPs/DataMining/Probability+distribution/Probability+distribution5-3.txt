★When is it philosophically legitimate to regard parameters of probability distributions as random variables?That is, when using probability distributions to model processes in the real world, rather than purely mathematically.
A fundamental result known as de Finetti's theorem gives a very compelling philosophical motivation for probability models and in some cases parametric models. First, you must accept a subjective interpretation of probability: probabilities represent a state of knowledge. That statement is up for debate, but there are compelling reasons for it, including more or less successful axiomatic derivations. Then, suppose you have a sequence of observations X_1,X_2,..., and suppose they are exchangeable to you. A priori, you wouldn't bet on the first n observations X_1,...,X_n coming in any particular order over any other. This is weaker mathematically than independence. The theorem by de Finetti states that your prior distribution on the observables X_1,X_2,... can also be arrived at by assuming there is a probability model (the observations are independent and identically distributed) and putting a prior distribution on the model. If the observation is discrete, the probability model is a parametric family. So this argument goes from an agnosticism toward the order of the observations, to the existence of "random" parameters.    Embed Quote
