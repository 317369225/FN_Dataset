★Does a random variable need to follow a probability distribution in order for its standard deviation to be computable?
Technically, a random variable is defined to be a measurable function on a probability space. Thus by definition, a random variable follows a probability distribution. So yes, while a random variable - by tautology - needs to follow a probability distribution, not all distributions have finite standard deviations (or variable).  For instance, the random variables distributed Cauchy or Levy do not have finite variance. Things get even tricker when we're talking about stochastic processes :)    Embed Quote
