★Can a Bayesian posterior probability distribution collapse in the same way as a quantum wavefunction?Say, you have new information N*, where P(X|N*) = 1. Does that effectively collapse the Bayesian posterior probability function?
I think that the best way to teach quantum mechanics is to forgo the wave function all together and work exclusively with the density matrix (I'll get to you specific question in a sec).  The density matrix makes it easy to connect quantum mechanics to probability and from there using Bayesian or any other interpretation of probability theory you want.  A quick and dirty (but correct) way to understand the density matrix is to take a probability vector and put the vector along the diagonal of the density matrix.  To get some quantum effects, we include off-diagonal elements called coherences. If we have a quantum system that we want to "collapse," the best way to do this is to first consider the decoherence (i.e. the loss of coherences). Then once there are no more coherences, you have a probability distribution which you can collapse using your favorite interpretation.  Like Stephan Hoyer said there are researchers who are developing a school of thought around Quantum Bayesianism but if you don't like the Bayesian interpretation, once decoherence has occurred, you may switch to whatever interpretation of probability that you like.    Embed Quote
