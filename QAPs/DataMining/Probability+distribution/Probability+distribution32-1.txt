★Why is a probability distribution in statistics important? How can I use a probability distribution to understand a dataset?
Statistics don't just look at the data and calculate the average, what statistics try to do is to find the original probability distribution from which the collected data originated. Pdf's are central to most statistics. Since we can't have the full dataset (we just have a sample) probability distributions, help us calculate the probability of error in our estimators. As such, we can say that the mean (average) of the original distribution (not our sample) is between such and such values with a 95% probability. We can calculate the lifetime of a light bulb, or how many yogurts are still fresh two days after the expiration date (fun fact, most manufacturers calculate expiration date as the day before about 99.99% of all product is still good to eat, as such they only have to deal with about 1 in 10,000 products gone bad, they vary the percentage for products where freshness is vital)    Embed Quote
