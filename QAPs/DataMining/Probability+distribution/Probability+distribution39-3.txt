★Does the probability distribution of electrons inside an atom reflect reality or does it reflect our inability to measure?
In earlier days of Uncertainty Principle, it was taken as our inability to measure with current technology, both the position and the momentum of electrons, simultaneously. Then, further refinements showed that this was a Law, or a reflection of reality. Similarly, in earlier days of Quantum Mechanics, measurements on electrons were very difficult, and only vague measurements or Probability Distributions were known, and this was attributed to our inability to measure with current technology. Then further experiments (eg in Radioactive Decay and Interference Patterns) showed that the probabilities did combine as the Mathematical theories predicted, which means that Probability Distributions are a reflection of reality.    Embed Quote
