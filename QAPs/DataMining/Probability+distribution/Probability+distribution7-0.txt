★What are some of the most interesting probability distributions?
This is obviously pretty subjective, but I think the Cauchy distribution is interesting because it has no mean or variance but it has a mode and a median: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cau... I remember the first time I "discovered" this (I had some problem where the random variable I was looking at was the ratio of two random variables). To see it in R: > mean(rnorm(1000,0,1)/rnorm(1000,0,1)) [1] 0.2251264 > mean(rnorm(1000,0,1)/rnorm(1000,0,1)) [1] 3.298194 > mean(rnorm(1000,0,1)/rnorm(1000,0,1)) [1] 3.621623 > mean(rnorm(1000,0,1)/rnorm(1000,0,1)) [1] -0.05835699 >    Embed Quote
