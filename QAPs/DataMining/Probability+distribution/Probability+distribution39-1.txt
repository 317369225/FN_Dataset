★Does the probability distribution of electrons inside an atom reflect reality or does it reflect our inability to measure?
It is a model totally built by us and we believe it's correct because currently it seems to explain most phenomena which we perceive or observe for electrons in an atom. As long as it fits with reality, it is fine.    Embed Quote
