★Random variable x has the probability distribution with density . What is the probability distribution of the random variable?
Let with a standard normal. Let   be the cumulative distribution for the standard normal.  Also, for , let be the cumulative distribution for the transformed random variable.  Let be the density of the standard normal and  be the density of the transformed random variable.  Then   . We can now differentiate to get the density of . . Since is an even function (i.e. the standard normal density is symmetric about the origin), we get: Now using the well-know representation of the standard normal density we have (for ): . The density is zero for . This resulting distribution likely has a name, but I don't know what it is.    Embed Quote
