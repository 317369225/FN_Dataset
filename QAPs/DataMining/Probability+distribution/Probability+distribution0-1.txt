★What is the least predictable probability distribution?I assume "predictability" is based on some measure of dispersion, such as the variance or perhaps better yet the coefficient of variation. However it is based, the deterministic distribution is clearly the most predictable. The least predictable distribution seems to me to depend on your definition of "predictable" so include that in your answer.
William Chen has the entropy angle covered. Here's another one. We can ask: what distribution on a closed interval has the greatest variance? This is an alternative notion of "least predictable." The answer is the one which puts half the total mass at each endpoint. This might seem kind of obvious, but proving it might be a little bit non-obvious (at least it was for me). Here's a stab. Say the interval is . Let and let . Now let be a random variable with some distribution on this interval, and let . We have The first inequality holds because minimizes the mean squared error. The second inequality holds since is the largest possible difference from . The distribution which places half the mass at each endpoint achieves this, so it is maximum. We can also see that this is essentially the only distribution achieving the maximum. For a random variable which puts mass somewhere other than the endpoints, the second inequality will be strict. So any solution must put all mass at the endpoints. For any distribution with all the mass at the endpoints but split unevenly, the first inequality will be strict (since in this case). So the distribution with half the mass at each endpoint is the only one which can achieve the maximum variance.    Embed Quote
