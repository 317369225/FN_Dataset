★What type of probability distribution is followed by particles in Brownian Motion?Suppose if i need to find the probability of any particle amidst brownian motion , How will i do that?
Brownian motion is an example of what we call a Gaussian process, which is the infinite dimensional analogue of a multivariate Gaussian distribution.  As a result, we can specify the joint distribution of a particle's position at different times.  Let be the times of interest.  Then are jointly normally distributed with and . (We usually assume that because it simplifies calculations, but there's no real advantage to doing so here.)    Embed Quote
