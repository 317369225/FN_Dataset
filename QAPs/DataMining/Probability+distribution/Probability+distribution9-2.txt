★What are probability distributions used for?I know what the PMF shows the probability for a given event and that the CDF shows the probability for all subset events of a given events. However what is the use case of such functions behind just being another representation of probability to some experiment? What would be some real-world examples where they are used to solve a problem?
Well, probability is the basis for most of statistics, and statistics is mostly a real-world pursuit so there you go. Pdf's are quite important and widely used in actuarial science (insurance), engineering, physics, evolutionary biology, computer science and even social sciences such as psychiatry, economics and even medical trials. Part of statistics is to fit these probability functions to real-world data. So for example, you can calculate the probability an event might happen in a given timeframe. That is the basis for insurance, at it's core, a premium is the expected value of the probability distribution of losses pertaining to certain events. You could also use them to calculate the probability that x treatment is better than placebo, or the expected number of people who get infected in an outbreak. All in all, pdf's are essential in many applied fields and also a fun pursuit on it's own right, don't put them down!    Embed Quote
