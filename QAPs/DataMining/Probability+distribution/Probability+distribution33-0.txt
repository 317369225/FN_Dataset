★What are the necessary and sufficient parameters that fully describe an arbitrary probability distribution?For instance a normal distribution can be fully described by its first and second moments. What about an arbitrary distribution? Does such description exist? if so, what are the conditions and limitations?
Every probability distribution on the real line is characterized by either its distribution function or its characteristic function, so there's a trivial upper bound on how much information you need. To see that there's no finite upper bound on the number of parameters, consider a family of distributions on the real line whose densities are given by for some polynomial and normalizing constant .  It should be clear that every polynomial gives you a valid density.  You can use parameters to describe the polynomials whose degree is no larger than , but if you want to describe polynomials of degree or higher, you'll need at least parameters.    Embed Quote
