★How did people invent probability distributions?Yes, the histogram of the data might be following a repetitive common pattern, but how to find a generic closed (complex) form function (the probability density function) and the parameters that describe all the cases?
Most of probability distributions appear naturally when we try to solve problems or model situations. For example, we have the binomial distribution that arises when we consider what would the outcome of tossing n coins turns out to be like. We also have Normal distribution that somehow turns out to be the consequences of the central limit theorem(which I am not really sure if that is actually the origin). My point is there is no famous distribution that came out of nothing. There has to be some interesting theories or models that motivate it. I can just take any sufficiently bounded function, normalise it and name it as my own distribution. But no one would recognise it as there is nothing interesting about it. I hope this answer your question. edit: After a clarification from Ahmed, I decided that  I don't really have enough experience regarding practical stuffs involving the real question. However, I do think that it is possible to test the proposed function with the emperical distribution via Kolmogorov–Smirnov test just to verify it.    Embed Quote
