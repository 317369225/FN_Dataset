★Probability (statistics): What are beautiful examples/applications of complex probability distributions in real life?ex. Gamma, chi, inverse-chi distribution e.t.c
Probability and statistics are used extensively in modern world to analyse large collection of data and draw inferences and thus make important decisions. Some applications/examples of probability and statistics are: One of major modern day miracle is the rise of Japan's industrial strength after World War 2. Statistics played a major role in rise in this. American statistician W.Edward  Deming not only helped Japanese implement method of statistical process control but also developed his system of total quality management(TQM). William S Gosset discovered student-t distribution to give his employer(Guinness brewing company) an edge over their competitor. The Human resource departments use statistical distributions to make important decisions. Also these are used for testing a hypothesis. These Distributions are used in modern portfolio theory to  assess performance of stocks and to minimize risk. Gauss and Laplace described behaviour  of errors  in astronomical measurements using Normal distribution. Normal distribution is many times also used to describe random data such as random error in an scientific experiment.    Embed Quote
