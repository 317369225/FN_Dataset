★What is the joint probability distribution?Let  X = f(t) and Y = g(t) where t is a random variable whose pdf is known. How does one find the joint pdf for X and Y?
You won't get an ordinary joint probability density function for (x,y).  The density would be 0 almost everywhere.  It could only be nonzero on the path (f(t),g(t)).  You could still work with cumulative distribution functions, or you could extend your concept of density functions to accommodate Dirac delta functions.  It may be best just to keep everything in terms of t since you know all about it and it's got a pdf.    Embed Quote
