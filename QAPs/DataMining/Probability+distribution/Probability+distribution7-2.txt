★What are some of the most interesting probability distributions?
A very counter intuitive probability distribution is the first digit distribution as mentioned by the Benford's law Benford's law, also called the first-digit law, refers to the frequency distribution of digits in many (but not all) real-life sources of data.  In this distribution, the number 1 occurs as the first digit about 30%  of the time, while larger numbers occur in that position less  frequently, with larger numbers occurring less often: 9 as the first  digit less than 5% of the time. The most surprising aspect of this is that it holds irrespective of the unit of measurement !! Source: Benford's law    Embed Quote
