★Can a Bayesian posterior probability distribution collapse in the same way as a quantum wavefunction?Say, you have new information N*, where P(X|N*) = 1. Does that effectively collapse the Bayesian posterior probability function?
Perhaps yes, although it may not yet be broadly accepted science. There is branch of inquiry known as "Quantum Bayesianism" which is focused on the "problem of finding a good representation of quantum mechanics purely in terms of probabilities, without amplitudes or Hilbert-space operators." Here's a review by Christopher Fuchs of the Perimeter Institute, who has been pursuing these ideas for the past decade or so: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.5209v1    Embed Quote
