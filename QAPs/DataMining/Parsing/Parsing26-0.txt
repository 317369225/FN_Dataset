★What else is a finite state machine used for except language parsing?
Most interesting systems software projects involve state machines.  Replicated state machines are used heavily in strongly consistent distributed systems. I've used state machines for synchronizing file systems, replication protocols, a distributed lease manager, transactional storage, zero copy video ingest / streaming, and other things I've forgotten over the years. In my current product (zetta.net enterprise grade online backup) each sync task has an FSM, each file system object has an FSM governing its synchronization, and each object has master and slave state objects with FSMs for self and descendent processing where state changes in the lower level abstractions can generate events that trigger changes in higher level ones.    Embed Quote
