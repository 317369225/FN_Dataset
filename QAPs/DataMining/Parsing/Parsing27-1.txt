★What is a good library to parse invalid JSON?I am working with legislative data, which sometimes is produced without valid keys or with other problems.  I need a library that has an option not to use "strict" parsing. Like BeautifulSoup for X/HTML.
https://github.com/garycourt/JSV This is a decently active project. It uses the JSON Schema specification http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft... which I believe Gary Court himself wrote. This library is really awesome. You provide schemas that explain the format of a JSON document, check your data against the corresponding schema, and it provides a really detailed array of errors for the passed in data. The only bad thing is the current JSON specification does not contain support for Date data types. But you can very easily specify that the field is a string that will only validate when it passes a regular expression test that only accepts strings that can be parsed into a Date object. A better but slightly more complicated solution is to create your own schema environment. JSV allows you to create environments to work in. The default environment is the latest JSON specification. But you can just copy that and implement your own Date data type. [Edit] I've since come to find that JSV is super slow. I've found that the best balance of speed and features is amanda https://github.com/Baggz/Amanda which you can install with jam install amanda But there are other options: JSON Schema https://github.com/kriszyp/json-...
