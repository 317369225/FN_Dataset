★What is Parse Core?
Parse Core is everything your app needs to save data, be social, and more. Storage: Parse handles everything you need to store data securely and efficiently in the cloud. Store basic data types, including locations and photos, and query across them without spinning up a single server. Social: Connect your users via traditional logins or third party social networks with just a few lines of code. We take care of linking accounts across networks, resetting passwords, and keeping everything safe and secure so you don’t have to. Local Datastore: this lets your app use all the querying and security features of Parse, even when you don't have a network connection. Available now for Android. Coming soon on iOS. Cloud code: Say goodbye to servers and hello to rich, custom server-side logic. Use the Parse JavaScript SDK to add custom validations and endpoints to make your app more powerful than ever. Background jobs: Easily schedule recurring tasks like sending engagement emails, updating data, and long running computation at any time interval via the dashboard. more info on Docs Overview | Parse    Embed Quote
