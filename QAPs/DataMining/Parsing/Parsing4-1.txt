★Are there limitations for Cloud Code by Parse?
The main limitations to cloud code that I've encountered are the resource limits. From the Parse Docs: Timeouts  Cloud functions will be killed after 15 seconds of wall clock time.   beforeSave functions and afterSave functions will be killed after 3  seconds of run time.  If a Cloud function or a beforeSave/afterSave  function is called from another Cloud Code call, it will be further  limited by the time left in the calling function. For example, if a  beforeSave function is triggered by a cloud function after it has run  for 13 seconds, the beforeSave function will only have 2 seconds to run,  rather than the normal 3 seconds.   Network requests  Network requests that are still in progress after success or error are called will be canceled.  In general, you should wait for all network requests to finish before calling success.  For afterSave functions, which don't call success/error, Cloud Code will wait for all network requests to finish. The timeouts can be an issue for long running computations that you want to run on Cloud Code. So for example, if you want do face detection on an image you've sent to the parse cloud, you're going to have to make sure that it happens within the time limits. Also, the time limits make it hard to implement some real-time features that require a persistent connection... i.e. real-time chat or something that requires WebSocket like functionality. You can get around these issues by having polyglot setup or using additional Infrastructure as a Service products. For real-time chat for example, you can use PubNub or Pusher to get most of the functionality or you can go for a polyglot setup where you have a nodejs server on the side that you connect to parse using IronMQ or something. You can similarly get around the network requests issue too. It really depends on what your products needs are. Parse does cover a lot of the functionality you need in some product categories. I'd recommed trying to hack up a prototype to see if it covers your needs. There are other BAAS services out there too which might give you more flexibility like StackMob or Kinvey.    Embed Quote
