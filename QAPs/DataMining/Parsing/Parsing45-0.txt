★Parsers: What is parsing? How do you parse json or xml files?
Parsing usually applies to text - the act of reading text and converting it into a more useful in-memory format, "understanding" is what it means to some extent.. Within computer science, the term is used in the analysis of computer languages, referring to the syntactic analysis of the input code into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of compilers and interpreters. For example, HTML parser analyses HTML Pages and extracts information from that page based on the various methods used on the HTML parser (which may be DOM methods like getElementById(), getElementByTagName etc). The extracted information can be used for various purposes. Now to parse a JSON file, usually most browsers support JSON.parse() (defined on the JavaScript specification). But, if you're already using jQuery, there is a $.parseJSON function that maps to JSON.parse if available or a form of eval() in older browsers. However, this performs additional, unnecessary checks that are also performed by JSON.parse. Its usage is simple in JS : var json = '{    "fruit" : apple,    "color" : red }', obj = eval('('+json+')') OR var json = '{    "fruit" : apple,    "color" : red }',     obj = JSON.parse(json);    Embed Quote
