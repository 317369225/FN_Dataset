★What does Quip use Parse for?source: Facebook + Parse celebrate one year anniversary - Inside Facebook
Quip uses Parse for notifications on non-Google ("non-GMS") Android devices, e.g., for Android phones running Quip in China. Google services, including Google Play,  Google Maps, Google Accounts, Google Payments, and push notifications, are an "all-or-nothing" package because of the way Google licenses Android. Vendors that choose to distribute an alternative to one of those Google services have to find replacements for all of them because of Google's rules. That is why Google is not on many Android phones in China and the Kindle Fire has its own App Store. When we decided we wanted Quip to be available on all these devices, we loosened Quip's Google account requirements and started using Parse to deliver notifications to devices that were not GMS-enabled. Then we listed our app on the hundreds of Android app stores around the world, including the Amazon App Store, Yandex in Russia, and in 360 Mobile Assistant, the largest app store in China.    Embed Quote
