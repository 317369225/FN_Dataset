★Can C++ be parsed correctly?I remember reading somewhere that no current parser is able to correctly parse all 100% of the C++ spec. Is this accurate? Is this still the case?
Edison Design Group claims to correctly parse C++ as described by the ISO standard: http://www.edg.com/index.php?loc... It's worth highlighting that EDG's front end supports the complete C++ 2003 standard. The C++ language is so complex that most compilers omit some part of it; the few that do support the full language are based on our front end. We have complete support now, and as the C++ and C standards are updated we will continue to enhance our front end to fully support the new language features. (We've already added quite a few features from the forthcoming C++0x standard.) My understanding is that it's a very good, very comprehensive C++ frontend, and not inexpensive.    Embed Quote
