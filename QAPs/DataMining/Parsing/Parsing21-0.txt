★Is CloudKit a direct competitor to Parse?
From what I've been reading today: yes, certainly. For iOS apps, anyway. People needing a cross-platform solution will still not see it as much use. It appears to provide many but not all of the functions of Parse, including public databases/stores and push notifications. Unlike Parse (I think, I haven't used Parse but I have just read the iOS documentation for it), CloudKit also provides private data stores that even the developer cannot access, so it seems a bit more secure. I can certainly see benefits to using the public database in CloudKit that iCloud can't provide but Parse would have (e.g. sharing data between users on different iCloud accounts). As an iOS-only developer I think CloudKit will be the way to go for me, not Parse.    Embed Quote
