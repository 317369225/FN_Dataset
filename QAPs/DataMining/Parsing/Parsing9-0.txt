★Are there existing algorithms for Resume Parsing?I want to build a resume parser. Is there any algorithm which helps me to extract contents of resume?.
There are many algorithms for resume parsing. Most big corporations have their own algorithms for data extraction from the semi-structured text found in a standard resume. This allows fast filtering of applicants (and an IT company will deal mostly programming-related resumes). I developed a scalable algorithm for this in my second year of college, so it shouldn't be that tough. Look into semantic analysis and data extraction techniques, that should make life a lot easier    Embed Quote
