★What else is a finite state machine used for except language parsing?
Wow. Everything! One of the most important uses of a finite state machine is to convert an asynchronous system (such as might be built in a functional language, or in an API that relies heavily on callbacks) to a system that is synchronous. You'd do this because synchronous systems are much easier to debug and to maintain, than are asynchronous systems. Another important use of finite state machines is to control the overall user interface flow of an application. For example, a simple video game might have these user interface states: Splash Screen Main Menu Play Game Game Over Options High Scores CreditsA finite state machine is an efficient, coherent way to structure the code for such a video game. In an embedded system, you might use a finite state machine to implement a combination lock. In a game, you might use a finite state machine to keep track of entry of "combo codes" like BACK, BACK, DOWN+HIGHKICK. There are many other applications.    Embed Quote
