★Why use a backend like Parse?
For us the question is all about time and scarce resource. My techs would love to loose themselves in a project to build the sexiest backed platform imaginable. Build the Lamborghini of Backend....but thats not our business. And I know what will happen, they will get bored, or move on somewhere else and the backend will become a huge drag on my techs. What I want is for them to focus on the high value work (building awesome apps and keeping them up to date with OS upgrades) not patching my mongo/aws stack. I also want predictable resources and costs. So 3 years ago we outsourced this to a SaaS provider Kumulos. Cloud Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) to be honest its worked great... just dont know why anyone would DIY when there are turnkey systems out there that take the headaches away.    Embed Quote
