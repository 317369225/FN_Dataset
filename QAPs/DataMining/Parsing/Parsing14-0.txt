★How does CloudKit compare to Parse?
Do you think Cloudkit could be used instead of Parse? I think Parse is like the best thing ever. But I'd rather keep everything using Apple's kits. The only thing is that, I dunno if/how we'll be able to look at our databases with CloudKit. The parse dashboard is pretty cool. Especially with the push services and everything. If they upgrade iTunes Connect to have something similar I'd probably switch. More importantly, future iPhone and iPad applications that leverage CloudKit will allow users to anonymously sign in to apps using their Apple IDs, but without sharing their personal information.    Embed Quote
