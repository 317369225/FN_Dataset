★What's a good way to parse XML in C#?
.NET provides rich API when it comes to XML   First and foremost you have the XmlDocument. As the names says, you can open a physical XML file or load up an string. This provides rich sets of method to work with on the xml. Slightly heavy on the performance side.   Second you have XmlReaders available. As the name suggests, this is a reader and will allow forward only reading. Perfect for reading and performing some custom things based on what is being read.   Lastly with the introduction of LINQ, we have what is known as LINQ2XML or XLINQ for short. This allows you more flexibility in working with the XML.I would suggest you to look at using the LINQ 2 XML way.    Embed Quote
