★Why use a backend like Parse?
My recommendation use Core Data Basics its simple and once you get hold of it you will know the its true power If you want data to be in sync across a user's devices (ex: iPhone <-> iPad) use apple's own CloudKit Storage - iCloud - Apple Developer Lastly, if you want some advanced user management and complete back end as a service go for Parse    Embed Quote
