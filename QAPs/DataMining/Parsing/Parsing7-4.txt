★Could there be an open source equivalent to Parse (the cloud backend)?
NO and YES. The reason that Parse and other similar BaaS companies exist is that they run all the servers. You can't open source a server farm -- someone has to pay for it. So, NO, you can't open source Parse. But, if you already have servers, there is no feature that Parse provides that you couldn't deploy on your own. Since there are very few companies that would use every feature of a BaaS, you might be better off deploying exactly those features you need. For example, my company does run our own servers and, for most of the features that Parse offers, their functionality is either something we don't need or what they provide doesn't meet our needs, so we've built our own infrastructure. On the other hand, features like iOS notifications are a royal pain to support on any server, so that's an area where we'd be more likely to use Parse or Urban Airship, etc. And, YES, every one of those features that could be built and run on an independent server could be open sourced. That said, I don't think it makes sense for anyone to open source a single piece of software that happens to match the Parse offering, or any other particular BaaS offering. And if you look at the various links people have provided, I'll bet none of them match Parse exactly.    Embed Quote
