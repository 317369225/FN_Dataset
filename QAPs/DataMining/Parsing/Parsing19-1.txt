★Can C++ be parsed correctly?I remember reading somewhere that no current parser is able to correctly parse all 100% of the C++ spec. Is this accurate? Is this still the case?
We think our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit's C++ front end does all of C++11 and most of C++14, in terms of grammar.   What is much harder to decide is if it interprets the semantics correctly.  In both cases, even the C++ committee can't always agree, so the definition of "100%" is little fuzzy. We use lots of tests, and especially parsing of real software from both the GCC and the MS world to decide is we are *compatible* with what those compilers accept.  I doubt they they are 100% spec-compatible (MS in fact is not), and we're pretty compatible with them, so we're likely not :-{    Embed Quote
