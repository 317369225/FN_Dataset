★Why did Parse sell?$85 million seems like a small fraction of the opportunity they had. Why not take some money off the table and keep growing? Were they not getting the traction they hoped?
Simply put, we felt like the folks at Facebook were presenting us with a tremendously exciting opportunity that we couldn't pass up. We get to "pour fuel on the fire" with Facebook's talent, resources, distribution reach, etc. The fire in question is our original vision: building a cloud platform for developers in this age of mobile apps. In addition, there are very clear integrations to undertake at some point that will hugely expand our impact on the mobile ecosystem. We were already comfortable with all the principals involved and the stars aligned at the right time on both ends. Traction wasn't a problem. Raising another round wasn't a problem. We had a bunch of term sheets on the table.    Embed Quote
