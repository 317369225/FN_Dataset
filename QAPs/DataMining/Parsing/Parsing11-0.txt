★What is it like to be part of the NLP Parsing team at Google?What does the work involve?
I'm the PM for the parsing team, so I guess I can answer this. We do a few different things. Research. We look to improve our systems as well as advance the state-of-the-art for the NLP community. This can mean publishing (see Natural Language Processing from Google Research), investigating new techniques, trying to solve problems that aren't covered by academic research (e.g. parsing for queries isn't very well-studied due to the lack of freely available datasets), and so on. This also includes typical research-y things like conferences, teaching classes, and so on. Solve real problems. Even though we're a research group, we look for places to have real product impact. This means doing more traditional software engineering tasks like integrations with other systems and products, responding to feature requests and bugs from internal clients, and the like. Generally, as soon as a research system shows promising results, we try to find a product to help. Sometimes it goes the other way -- there's a need for a new system requiring new techniques, and teams come to us for help. Either way the goal is to end up with end-user impact, not just some nice results. Think across languages. Google products are used across the globe in many different languages. In many of them, there aren't good training sets equivalent to the Penn Treebank. How do we create systems of high quality? Do we need to create training data ourselves, or can we use information from one language to help inform the analysis of another? And how do we scale to n languages? Build or improve cool toys like the Google Ngram Viewer. We're mostly based in New York (though I personally am in Mountain View). Like any team we hang out together to some extent, and have separate lives to some extent as well. It's a fun, tight team of really impressive people. I'm lucky to be a part of it.    Embed Quote
