â˜…Natural Language Processing: How would you programmatically parse a sentence and decide whether to answer "that's what she said"?Outline an algorithm that, given a sentence, returns true or false for whether a "that's what she said" is appropriate.
You should take a look at "That's what she said: Double entendre identification," at the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (ACL-HLT 2011). http://www.cs.washington.edu/hom...http://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/pubs/pubs/Kiddon11.pdf (links to: http://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/pubs/pubs/Kiddon11.pdf) In particular, the authors develop a system with 12% higher precision than n-gram models like those Christopher Lin describes, by extracting features specific to double entendres and indecent metaphors.
