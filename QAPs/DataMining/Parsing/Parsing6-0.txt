★How scalable is Parse?
PARSE IS NOT FOR ANYTHING REAL-WORLDYou can look at Parse as a testing/dev/limited use platform. Here are some tips if you want to stretch it to a large extent. 1. Do your homework on the number of users, number of simultaneous users, your ROI and scaling requirements which you continue to work with Parse. Do not rely on any PARSE specific coding style or processes. Always keep the methods easier to port to a much STABLE platform when your budget/requirements grow. 2. As much as possible move stuff that can be done in the background.    You can reduce your time-outs by doing this. 3. Use your own crontab mechanism. It's more reliable.    You cannot rely on parse's cloud functions. 4. Use query caching. Use memcache to cache your queries. 5. Use the REST API.    Embed Quote
