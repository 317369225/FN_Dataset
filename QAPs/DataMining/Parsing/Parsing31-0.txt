★Why use a backend like Parse?
Parse would be cool if you want your data accessible outside of a single device.  Ideas might include: A little web app to do high score boards. Sharing data between a user's different devices.  Maybe you want to let them use your app on an iPhone and an Android tablet with a single login and data viewable in both places. Parse also lets you do push notifications easily.  If either of those are important to your app, using Parse will likely save you time.. If you're just trying to build a standalone app with no push notifications and local data, I'm not sure what Parse would buy you.    Embed Quote
