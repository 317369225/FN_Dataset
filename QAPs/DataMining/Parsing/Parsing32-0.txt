★What is the best natural language parsing technology available?I am looking for a comparison of parsing technologies for dependency or constituency structures in terms of speed, accuracy, worst case algorithmic complexity, etc. Is it wise to favor parsers that take into account non-projective vs projective parses? What about other relevant features? Ideally the parser should be usable in the context of a real world, real-time application.
