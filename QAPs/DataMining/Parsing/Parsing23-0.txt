â˜…What's the best way to parse a resume into database fields?What do you do if you have lots of resumes and need the data to be extracted (e.g. get their university) into individual items that can be placed into a Database?
Good question. Some ideas: The Apache Tika [1] project aims to build a library of document format parsers. If the resumes are coming at you in PDF, .doc, or other common formats, Tika can extract plain text from these documents. Next, some of the resumes will likely have a common structure. The process of discovering this common structure goes by the name of wrapper induction [2] in web crawling circles. Finally, you'll probably want a standard vocabulary of universities and other entities for each field. The process of mapping the user's entered university to a canonical entity is known as named entity recognition [3]. Once you've got the above pipeline working manually, you'll probably want to automate the process. You'll find tools for message queuing, workflow and scheduling useful at this stage. Of course, all of that stuff is hard. If you have a budget, you can use CrowdFlower [4] to get human beings to extract the structured information for you.
