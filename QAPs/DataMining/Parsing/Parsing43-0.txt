★How do I do parsing in C?
Unless what you're parsing is really trivial, the easiest answer is to use a parser generator. The two pieces that you need are lexical analysis and something that takes a grammar and generators a parser. The lexical analyzer takes the file you'd like to parse and turns it into "tokens". The parser itself uses the tokens to figure out what expression of the grammar the file contains. UNIX (upon which Linux was based) came with a tokenizer called lex and a parser generator called yacc. In the Linux world, lex has been replaced by flex, and yacc by bison (geddit?). O'Reilly has a good book on flex & bison that should get you going. There are also more tutorials on the interwebs than you can shake a syntax error at. There is a bounty of special purpose parsers as well, for things like yaml, xml in all of its variety and JSON. If you can take advantage of an existing format. If what you're parsing is really trivial (like a date, for example), then the best approach is to use regular expressions. See the C regex library.    Embed Quote
