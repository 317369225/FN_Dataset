★Is Facebook acquiring Parse a good thing?How will this affect developers and the service itself. Source: The Future of Parse
The question people keep asking: What does this acquisition change about whether or not developers will use Parse? Before being acquired by Facebook, there was a non-trivial probability that Parse would not be around for the long run; that's not something against Parse, it's just the nature of startups. Being backed by a large, public company that isn't going away anytime soon makes Parse a viable option for larger businesses that are more risk averse than smaller startups/developer shops. Early adopters are great for shaping a product, but the majority of the money is in those risk averse enterprises. In other words, being acquired by Facebook hops Parse to the other side of the chasm [1]. There was a similar effect with Heroku being acquired by Salesforce. I'm not sure what the long term effects of being associated with Facebook's brand are going to be, but there generally is a lot of short term vitriol associated with anything Facebook does that eventually ends up being inconsequential; if I were Parse, I wouldn't be too concerned, especially when their actual numbers indicate that developers haven't lost faith in them [2].
