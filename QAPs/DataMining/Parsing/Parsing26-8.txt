★What else is a finite state machine used for except language parsing?
Finite State Machines are very commonly used for implementing Game AI routines. For example, a game agent might have a state Patrol wherein it wanders the map looking for enemies. Once it detects an enemy, it transitions into the Attack state. If the target starts taking shots at our agent, it might momentarily transition into the TakeCover state (a "blip") before transitioning back to Attack. And so on. As you can see, FSMs are very simplistic for this purpose, but they're very computationally efficient and easy to implement, which is why they're still used heavily today.    Embed Quote
