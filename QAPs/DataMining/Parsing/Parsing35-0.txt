★Cloud Services: How does Firebase differ from Parse?
Many differences exist. Parse has a native iOS and Android SDK, in addition to a REST API (with wrappers for ActionScript, Clojure, Corona, Java, Javascript, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, Unity and WebOS. [1]  Firebase has a REST API with Backbone.js, AngularJS and Node.js integrations [2]. The object model that they both seem to support is data (just data records). However, Parse has additional native object models such as push messages, users, social auths, geo points (locations) and files (including binaries) So Firebase seems more like a raw database in the cloud (realtime, and really easy to interface with) with some swell logical functions, and Parse appears to be a bit more mature and application specific objects.
