★What is a good library to parse invalid JSON?I am working with legislative data, which sometimes is produced without valid keys or with other problems.  I need a library that has an option not to use "strict" parsing. Like BeautifulSoup for X/HTML.
I'm not aware of anything that can parse invalid structured data such as JSON. And that's for a good reason. Parsing invalid data can be a mess. XHTML kind of gets away with it because it's only (or at least, it started as) a presentation technology. As soon as you try to extract meaning out of it, it opens up a big can of worms that nobody quite figured out yet. I mean - Google had to hire thousands of PhDs and run hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of computers to do it and get something meaningful out of it. There are some exceptions that may work in your favor. If the JSON file is correctly structured but the data has invalid references, then you may try to develop your own heuristics to figure out the correct references. You just parse the JSON structures as you need, and tidy up all the data later with correct references. If the JSON file itself has invalid structures (missing quotes, missing brackets, something like this) then your luck may vary. If the records are relatively regular you can also develop your own heuristics, making reasonable assumptions to recover data (by the way, that's similar to the rendering of buggy HTML data in today's browsers).    Embed Quote
