★NLP: What are the applications of parsing in natural language processing?I'm particularly interested in its usage in supervised algorithms. Where can sentences parsed using a context free grammar be used as features in an NLP task? Any links to papers would be great.
Strictly speaking, a normal CFG can't parse natural language sentences (that can only work on Formal Languages such as Programming Languages), you'll be working with a PCFG (Probabilistic CFG) which tries to guess which is the most probable parse for the sentence. Now, why is Parsing of importance? Language is just a way of expressing the facts which have been stated. What is it which differentiates, a bag-of-bean version of a sentence (i.e. you just shuffle the words in a sentence) from the original sentence itself- the fact that the original sentence has structure which establishes the relationship(s) between different entities and properties. This structure is captured in the parse tree of the sentence. 1) Parse trees help in Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction Chunk Extraction with NLTK 2) Translation From each sentence, we extract a kind of a knowledge graph which is kind of language agnostic. This is built by inspecting the parse tree, and determining connections/relations between the various nodes in the graph. A UNL Interlingua representation is constructed for the sentence. You might get an idea of the knowledge graph/tree structures from here : Introduction to UNL http://cerc.wvu.edu/download/WOR... Then, you pick up the UNL representation and translate it to the target language. So if you have say 20 languages, you don't need 20x19 = 380 translators; you just need 20 * 2 = 40 translators to be able to handle conversions. (20 languages to UNL) and (UNL to 20 languages). Take a look at the output of the Stanford NLP Parser. It might give you a few ideas about how parsing output is useful: The Stanford NLP (Natural Language Processing) Group    Embed Quote
