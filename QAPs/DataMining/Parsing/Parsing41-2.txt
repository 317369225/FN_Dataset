★NLP: What are the applications of parsing in natural language processing?I'm particularly interested in its usage in supervised algorithms. Where can sentences parsed using a context free grammar be used as features in an NLP task? Any links to papers would be great.
Off the top of my head :- Semantic Role Labelling, among other things, can make use of the dependency graph of the sentences. Collective semantic role labelling with Markov logic might give you some insight into the task of Semantic Role Labelling. Semantic Role Labelling can be useful in more complicated tasks such as relationship extraction and question answering. However, I don't think that most Natural Language Parsers make use of "Context Free Grammar". The fact that natural languages aren't context free is the cause of a lot of ambiguity. (In a rush right now, shall get back with more use cases and examples later)    Embed Quote
