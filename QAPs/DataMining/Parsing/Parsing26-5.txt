★What else is a finite state machine used for except language parsing?
If you are implementing the logic for mouse input into a GUI application or a game  at the level at which what you receive are mouse button down, mouse button up, and mouse move events then to convert this sort of input into the slightly higher level of single click, double click, and drag events basically comes down to implementing a finite state machine. Any kind of code like this is suitable for modeling via FSMs -- situations in which a higher level of abstraction regarding states important to humans butts heads with lower level  states and events that the computer knows about: simple games, basic GUI widget behaviors, and so forth.    Embed Quote
