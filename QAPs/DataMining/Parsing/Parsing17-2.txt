★What does parsing mean in Java?
Parsing means reading soemthing to extract information out of it. Generically speaking, in computing, Parsing/marshalling is basically reading information from an external source and converting it into an internal format that is easier to use Specifically in Java this means that you read data from some source, and convert it into a POJO. You then pass this POJO to your service layer,which then processing it. How you parse it depends on what the format of the source data is. If it's a CSV file, you read the CSV file and perform text parsing. If it's a Web service, you read the XML, and parse the XML, or read the JSON and parse the JSON into a POJO. It entirely depends on what you are reading.    Embed Quote
