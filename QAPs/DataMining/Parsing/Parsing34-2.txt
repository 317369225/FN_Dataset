★Is Facebook acquiring Parse a good thing?How will this affect developers and the service itself. Source: The Future of Parse
Facebook has had a long history of buying startups and shutting them  down. The only significant startup they have kept running, Instagram,  has a key difference from the rest because it is a part of Facebook's  core mission : social networking. Parse's business model and product  offering are fundamentally different from Facebook's . Statements made by the CEO of Parse , although they appear to be encouraging, avoid making any long term commitment to the platform. Parse's future  is unclear, but I predict that significant changes are coming to the  platform. Whether this is a good thing depends on your perspective.    Embed Quote
