★Cloud Services: How does Firebase differ from Parse?
Both Parse and Firebase allow for building server-less apps. Firebase is a real-time cloud data service. It is designed for building real-time, collaborative applications. Data in Firebase is standard JSON, and developers can access it using a client library or the REST API. When accessed through a client library, changes to data are synchronized in real-time to clients within milliseconds. Firebase provides a highly flexible expression-based security API that allows fine-grained control over data access by clients. Parse is a complete technology stack for building mobile apps. It provides a REST data api, push notifications, a Cloud Code JavaScript runtime environment, and social services. Parse has a variety of SDKs for all major mobile platforms as well as a Javascript SDK. Parse provides an access-control-list based security API, which it augments with its Cloud Code service to control data access by clients. [1] Parse [2] How It Works | Firebase    Embed Quote
