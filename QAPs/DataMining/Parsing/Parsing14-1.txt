★How does CloudKit compare to Parse?
We compared CloudKit with Parse and check following points: dashboard, server-side logic, import/export of data, analytics, local storage, cross-platform, support for social networks, web hosting, and REST API.  So, here are 10 reasons why Parse is better than CloudKit. 1. Dashboard Everything that you can do in CloudKit Dashboard is create and edit data. Actually CloudKit Dashboard doesn’t look like a usual table view, which is a characteristic of Parse. The structure of models is represented in the section Record Types, and the data itself is stored in Default Zones (one Default Zone for Public database, and one for Private database). CloudKit Dashboard also allows you to see what’s included in your Team and with what privileges, as well as setup a data storage for working in the development and production mode. 2. Server-side logic There is no CloudCode to implement tasks directly on the server in CloudKit. 3. Background Task CloudKit does not have Background Task which could be implemented whenever you need it. Thus, we lose the flexibility of data processing on the server. 4. Import / Export of data Parse lets you backup your data in JSON. This way you can be sure that it’ll be securely stored on your local server. Unfortunately, CloudKit doesn’t let you do that. 5. Analytics Parse supports data-based analytics. You can monitor traffic, frequency of requests, push-notification activities, track crashes complete with stack trackes and metadata. Besides, Parse lets you view your data on a graphic dashboard. CloudKit framework doesn’t provide the same feature. 6. Local storage support If you use Parse, you can store your data locally, right on your device (iOS or Android) In CloudKit, there is no mechanism which lets you choose how you’d like to store your data. But you’re welcome to use CoreData, or a third party service like Realm database for this purpose. 7. Cross-platform CloudKit only works with iOS and OSX devices. Parse supports a whole bunch of devices and OS, such as iOS, OSX, Android, Windows, Windows Phone. 8. Web-hosting Parse lets you create your own website and take a domain name on their platform. You get a Project Directory with website content, settings, and support requests. There is nothing like that in CloudKit. 9. REST API Parse lets you use REST API. There are a lot of third party libraries for receiving and transferring data which work with Parse. CloudKit doesn’t support REST API. 10. Support for social networks If your users log in through Facebook, Twitter, or another social network, their data is stored in Parse’s Users table. CloudKit also has a Users table, but I haven’t found a built-in mechanism for logging in through Facebook/Twitter accounts. However, you can use the information of the users who logged in through iCloud. There are, though, some advantages of CloudKit, which you’re welcome to read about in our blog 10 Reasons Why CloudKit Is Worse Than Parse    Embed Quote
