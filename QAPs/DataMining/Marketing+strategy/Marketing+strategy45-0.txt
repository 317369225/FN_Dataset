★What is Google TV's marketing strategy?
Google TV's marketing strategy is messaging entertainment (primary) and technological features (secondary) to urban adults and leveraging partnerships to coincide with those messages The first round of TV spots tries to introduce consumers to the new features of owning a connected TV. We have all seen the Kevin Bacon commercials in which the TV viewer is able to get anything Kevin Bacon on his television - movie information, movie rentals, google search results, video clips, etc. Their marketing strategy was clearly to run an overload of TV Spots with humor as the backbone and showcase technological advantages alongside that. Notice how the "technological advantage" such as searching the net on your TV, were in the message but entertainment was the primary. They hired an entertainer to promulgate the message and highlighted entertainment within the technological features (movies, internet media) The message is reinforced by humor as the commercial itself attempts to entertain you. I noticed that none of my friends from rural areas of the US ever heard of Google TV or saw the Kevin Bacon commercials that ran every 2 spots in my native Chicago.This leads me to believe that Google was targeting urban areas with their TV spots. Outside of a messaging itself - Google has pumped a lot of energy and time into partnerships to coincide with the ad campaign. Sony and Best Buy are just two of the partnerships that were formed to help market Google TV. Because Best Buy and Sony are considered "cutting edge" when it comes to entertainment and technology, these partnerships fit Google's message like a glove. Has it been successful? - Not quite sure yet I predicted it would succeed but can't say my prediction has come to fruition http://digitalfewsure.com/2010/1...    Embed Quote
