★What is the most effective online marketing strategy?Between SEO, PPC, affiliate marketing, media buying or social media  optimization (SMO)
In my own point of view "all of the above”. It depends on your industry and niche. You missed out on video marketing. This strategy is what many businesses are now using for branding purposes. You could even use video marketing for Press Release distributions. I just want to mention that one video distribution system that also has a Press release capability is Brainboxvideo. When you see Brainboxvideo's prices, they will absolutely impress you because it's very affordable. How about that?    Embed Quote
