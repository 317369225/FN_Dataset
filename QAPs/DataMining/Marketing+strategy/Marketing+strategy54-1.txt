★How important is content in online marketing strategy?
Content is absolutely crucial in online marketing. Let's discuss as an analogy. Look at online marketing like a well-stacked burger. I'm talking a tall, interesting sandwich. Content (i.e. material that's interesting, engaging and not a direct sales pitch) is the meat (burger patty and any add-ons) and your attempts to push the sale are the fixins and condiments. You make a sandwich by first putting on the burger patty/the content, to interest your audience. Give them something they crave, talk about, and want to eat. Make sure it's well done and seasoned properly. Once you have them there, you can add pitches (or disguised pitches)/a bit of lettuce and tomato, maybe a dash of mustard and even mayo. Then throw in more meat, maybe some bacon or pulled pork/something else they really want to talk about. Something to really wow them, something they haven't seen or tasted previously. Be sure to stack the burger so the eater/audience gets to taste everything and the tasty parts are a welcome surprise that they will not forget. They enjoyed it so much they want to share it with their friends Content holds your entire marketing plan together. Without it, you'd just be disinterested and hungry.    Embed Quote
