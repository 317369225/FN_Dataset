★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
Maybe it's because folks just want to use their coins. Without fractional pricing then why produce a lot of low denomination coins and just round everything up? But on a serious note, it make the customer believe that pricing wasn't simply created as a nice round figure even if it really is and just cut down.    Embed Quote
