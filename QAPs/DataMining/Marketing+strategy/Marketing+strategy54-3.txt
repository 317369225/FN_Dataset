★How important is content in online marketing strategy?
Content is crucial to an effective marketing strategy.  While it is possible to get by on little or poorly-constructed content for a while, soon enough the curtain will come up and your audience will realize they've been bamboozled.  Without quality content, a strategy has nothing to stand on -- though that's not to say that your content has to emulate William Shakespeare.  The beauty of online marketing is that content comes in many forms, including text, pictures, video, and countless mixtures of the three.  A little time and effort goes a long way.    Embed Quote
