★What's the best way to develop and execute an online marketing strategy?A small local business wants to take its marketing efforts digital. They want a three-pronged attack: Blog, Bi-weekly email, Facebook. How do you sell your advertising space and at what price ?
I would recommend that you take a step back to look at the goals of the digital campaign.  Are you selling a product or service?  What are you measuring?  Who is your audience?   Based on the answers to these questions, are blogs, emails and Facebook the best vehicles to achieve the objectives set forth in your strategy?  Going through this exercise may point to some different approaches so I would take the time to think about these things before you jump into the tactics.    Embed Quote
