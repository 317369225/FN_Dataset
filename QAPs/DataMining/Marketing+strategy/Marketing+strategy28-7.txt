★How should I begin research on a content marketing strategy?
Step 1 - Create an editorial calendar Create an excel doc or table that plans out the next 3, 6 and/or 12 months of marketing activity for your business or client. Firstly, include seasonal events such as Christmas, bank holidays, the start of summer, etc. Research your client’s industry. What important events are taking place that you should know about? Major conferences? Report release dates? Government rulings? Special awareness days? Confer with your client. Get as much information from them as possible with regards to important business days, company milestones in the upcoming year, product launch dates, scheduled sales, new service offerings, and any of their own marketing plans. Sometimes the client will think certain bits of information are irrelevant, when they could actually be something to centre a piece of content around, so make sure to press them for all possible angles From this information, try to extract themes or campaign ideas. Check with the client to see if there’s something in particular they want to focus on, e.g. push their new kiteboard range in August. These themes or campaign ideas will help inform the plans for your content marketing pieces, as well as the other digital channels. A Guide to Implementing a Content Marketing Strategy    Embed Quote
