★Marketing strategies for restaurants?
This depends a little on what you mean by 'marketing strategies', however here are some ideas/tools below: -Create a website! (use something like SquareSpace which is awesome and soooooo cheap!) -List in all Popular Directories: Google Places & Maps, FourSqaure, Yelp, Bing Places -Use social media to promote your restaurant; have a Facebook page and share updates and create an instagram account where you post pictures of your food, the staff doing interesting things, guests enjoying your restaurant etc. -Be part of Niche restaurant recommendation Apps like Zomato, OpenTable etc -Join delivery apps such as JustEat, GrubHub, DeliveryHero (there are lots more) -Feature on Deals sites: Groupon, Living Social etc -Twitter & Facebook ads. You can highly target users based on their specific location and data, such as neighbourhood, sex, age, interests etc, and you can do this at a specific time of day. This can be an extremely effective source of marketing if you get it right. For example, if one of your customer demographics is checking their phone on their way home from work and your advert comes up for a restaurant in their local area then you can have a pretty successful conversion rate.   -Google Adwords (bid for '[your restaurant food type] in [your neighbourhood] -Old fashioned direct marketing: flyers in doors of your local area. -Host Cooking classes (ideally for free or cheap to attract lots of interest) -Then other things like giving away free food samples, dress up in funny costumes to drive traffic to the restaurant. Thats all I got - good luck!    Embed Quote
