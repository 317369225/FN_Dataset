★What are the highest-impact inbound marketing strategies for SaaS companies?A lot of time can be spent on inbound marketing (e.g., writing blog posts, conducting webinars, building a Twitter following, etc.). What are the highest ROI activities for an early-stage SaaS company to be involved in?
Your existing customers are your best referral source. The first thing any SaaS should do is setup a referral marketing program. Here is a great Quora question where someone links to a talk by Drew at Dropbox about how integral their referral program was to their initial success: What are the do's and don't's of referral/invite programs? Ambassador is great for setting up and managing such a referral program. Guest blog posts used to be great, but if we listen to Matt Cutts, they will not be as effective as they once were. It shouldn't hurt you to still do them... just do not expect as much juice (I have not tested myself since the announcement). Social media can be a great source for new customers. Expect to be drowned out unless your product is so unique and awesome that people cannot help but to talk about it. The only real way around this is to be the conversation starter whenever you can. Networking with other founders can drive a lot of business. Just remember that that it is a two-way street and you should be generating leads for their company if you expect them to generate them for yours. Some of the cheapest methods (customer referrals, networking, etc.) can drive the biggest ROI.    Embed Quote
