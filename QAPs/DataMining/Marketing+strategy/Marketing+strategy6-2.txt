★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
I'm going to assume this is for B2C product based startups... If we're thinking of this as getting people through the marketing funnel, from awareness to purchase and subsequent advocacy, start by nailing the product experience. Product Experience is the "New" Marketing Focusing on this will save you from having to spend more marketing dollars. Provide the levers for engagement and organic sharing of the product. Begin with a differentiated offering, which has a phenomenal user interface and experience. Make sure this phenomenal UI includes levers that integrate with the marketing channels, such as social media (Facebook Connect) and email address collection. Also make sure it Incentivize users to share with friends by offering special features/content in exchange for referrals (think Dropbox, but don't assume that exact strategy works across all business types). Guide users through the desired actions of your website or product by providing visual cues (think LinkedIn profile progress bars). Then, Pull Marketing Build up a solid foundation of genuinely helpful/interesting content for your audience. Give them a reason to visit your website, that is distinct and valuable enough to cut through all the noise out there on the web. Be honest with yourself when developing said content - is it really interesting/share-worthy? Great content is the foundation for SEO and social media as well. And Otherwise... Cover off SEO, Email and Social Marketing. These are foundational. Move on to paid advertising (Display/PPC/etc) when you need a reliable lever for driving revenue/conversions quickly.    Embed Quote
