★What are the marketing strategies for EMR companies?There are lots of EMR companies. How are they doing their marketing?
I believe the successful ones know their customers very well and are building their EMR solution in an intuitive, useful, and forward-looking way. Wrapped around this is superior customer service and support. What the above provides is a solid platform to build their brand. With the changes in healthcare, EMRs need to be adopted in a least-resistant way and a way that delivers value today and meets all regulatory requirements. This relates to user-friendliness and compliant solutions. The other marketing strategy is to engage the physician community through social media channels, engaged conversations, and meaningful content. Through these initiatives, the right community will get to know the EMR solutions provider, and it will facilitate better sales engagement. A successful marketing strategy needs to be built on sound company and product principles with a keen understanding of a customer's experiences and a desire to listen, discuss, and grow a community.    Embed Quote
