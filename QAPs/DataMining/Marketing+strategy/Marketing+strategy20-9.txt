★What are good marketing strategies for a small business?
Though plenty of the previous answers share wonderful insight, I'd say it greatly depends on the business. If you're looking for a very quick spike in growth (i.e., you're a startup), I'd highly recommend reading Traction: A Startup Guide to Getting Customers. The book will walk you through all 19(!) channels of marketing, then teach you the strategies needed to get the most out of the channels that suit your business' model and needs. It'll also walk you through what to do once a particular channel has been saturated and it's time to move on to the next one. REALLY valuable stuff. Best of luck!    Embed Quote
