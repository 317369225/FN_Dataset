★What is the best marketing strategy?
There is nothing as "BEST" marketing strategy ! ... and here is why: Before you strategize your marketing (deliver the right message to the right people via the right media) you must understand -FIRST AND FORMEMOST- your market... and then, find the right media that will deliver your message in the most effective way to that market ! So, if we talk about the "best marketing" and throw any answer, it just means we are IGNORING and not taking into consideration the market... which for sure will be very damaging to your business. Think about your market as a battlefield, and the "medias" as the different ways you can use to infiltrate and cause the most impact on that battlefiled. When you find "those different ways" you have then found the best marketing strategy (customized for your business).    Embed Quote
