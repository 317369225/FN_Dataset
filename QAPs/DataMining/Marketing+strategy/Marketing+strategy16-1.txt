★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
Whilst nowadays a price of $9.99 is intended to lull the consumer into thinking of the item as a nine dollar item not a ten dollar one, it did not originate that way. The original reason was to force the the shop assistant to open the till to make change, activating the till bell. Too many assistants, when paid the exact amount (e.g. a $1 bill for a $1 item) were just pocketing the bill.  (This is before the days tills printed receipts, and it would be laborious to do hand written receipts for low value items).
