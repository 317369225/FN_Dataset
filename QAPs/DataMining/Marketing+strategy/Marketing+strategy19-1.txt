★Why is SEO Important in a Digital Marketing Strategy?Are marketing strategists aware on the importance of SEO? Why should someone without any knowledge of IT be in touch with SEO?
Imagine building a shop but putting no signage on it - just plain bricks, no windows, nothing. You have to hope that people just walk in off the street our of curiosity. They're looking for X but you sell Y. Now imagine that not only do you sign your store (big signs with your products on it) which attract people off the street who are looking for what you sell, but you also get the customers who visit your store to tell other people about your products and where to get them. This is what it would be like to build a website but not optimize it. I think Marketing Strategists are aware of SEO in my jobs I'm certainly doing less education than I did when I started. I don't think non-techy people need to study SEO from an IT perspective, but you should know the principles of SEO and some understanding of the basic strategies. Especially if you need to hire an SEO you'll need to know if they're selling you snake oil. :)    Embed Quote
