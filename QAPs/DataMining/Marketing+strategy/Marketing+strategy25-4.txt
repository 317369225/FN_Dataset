★Why are printed brochures considered an effective marketing strategy?What's the reason why you can consider printing brochures as effective marketing strategy?
Brochures provide a consumer with your business information without forcing it onto them and it allows them to read about you at their own pace and in their own time. Different to the personal selling approach to marketing where they may have to listen to you right there and then. It also acts as a teaser for your targeted consumers and allows you to create interest without telling them about the whole product/service. However, they can be used to contain more information than you may choose to put anywhere else. This gives a customer a chance to learn more about your company and what you do before they make an informed choice. Also, contrary to popular belief, brochures are one of the cheapest forms of marketing. Buying many brochures in bulk may reduce costs with economies of scale and distribution costs aren’t that high, with lot of brochures being sent out all at the same time.    Embed Quote
