★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
In what way is it "deceptive"? Do you think your average consumer is so monumentally stupid that he or she doesn't know that $9.99 is just one cent less than $10?    Embed Quote
