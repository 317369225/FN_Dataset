★Marketing strategies for restaurants?
I my opinion, the most effective strategy is investing in food and drink quality. This may not yield results as fast as other strategies, but the result will be the most sustainable. Customers return usually when food is better than average and they start bringing people they know. I am not a catering expert though, I speak from customer's point of view.    Embed Quote
