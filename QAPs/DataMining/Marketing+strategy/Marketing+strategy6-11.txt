★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
As is the case with most things it depends. Will the start up be an online store, brick and mortar, or mobile? With the former a static webpage and a little social media is a great place to start. For instance sites like Wordpress.com make it incredibly easy for a start up to create a professional static site and you can enhance your online presence by being active in a social media sites. But the catch here is to think quality not quantity; it looks better to be active in one of the sites if that's what you can dedicate time to post regular updates than to sign up for every social media site you find and your updates and posts are sparse if updated at all. While with the latter two types of businesses you can use the same suggestions for an online store and go a step further by actually going out and meeting your potential customers or companies that provide services that compliment your startup. One option that I have seen work well in service businesses is "Cookie Runs" here businesses like restaurants, hotels, even handy men, etc visit local companies or potential companies with printed materials on their services and a free treat! You could also look for local networking opportunities to meet with these groups try Meetup.com, which allows you to search for these opportunities by zip code. But whatever option you chose be sure to make it the best it can possibly be; as the saying goes "you only have one chance to make a first impression."    Embed Quote
