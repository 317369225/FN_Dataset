★What are some effective B2B Marketing strategies to target SMBs?My objective is to sell them software products. I have only small budgets allocated for marketing. Most of my clients are based in my city.
Here's something we did at LawTrades: When we were bootstrapping, we created a Meetup group that attracted our target customers for a happy hours/networking events. Our target customers are startups and small businesses so we host happy hours with them monthly and it pays off. Developing relationships is key to targeting SMB's. Targeting SMB's shouldn't be looked at as a quick overnight process. It takes time to build relationships, trust etc. but if its done the right way, it could definitely work. If most of your clients are in the same city, try to get them all together and bring value to them by hosting an event, bringing people together etc. We never paid anything to host an event. Hope this helps, you can reach me anytime to hear more of my tips.    Embed Quote
