★What are good marketing strategies for a small business?
Depending on what your product is, get onto college campuses. Create a hyped up event and let word spread. Give away some free stuff. Have relevant music playing. Have younger people in your company run the promo booths. Reasons to like college campus promos: it's face to face, there are tons of potential customers, these kids are about to be making good money, their parents still send them spending money, they are always looking to do cool/fresh things, word will spread like wildfire via social media and campus chatter.    Embed Quote
