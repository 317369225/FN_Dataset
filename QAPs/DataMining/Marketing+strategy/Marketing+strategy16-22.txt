★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
We don't need to speculate too much, because this has been studied quite a bit by academic researchers, using field data and experiments, along with good statistical practice. For example: Stiving, M., & Winer, R. S. (1997). An empirical analysis of price endings with scanner data. Journal of Consumer Research, 24(1), 57-67. Anderson, E. T., & Simester, D. I. (2003). Effects of $9 price endings on retail sales: Evidence from field experiments. Quantitative marketing and Economics, 1(1), 93-110. Gedenk, K., & Sattler, H. (1999). The impact of price thresholds on profit contribution—should retailers set 9-ending prices?. Journal of Retailing, 75(1), 33-57. There are lots more available using Google Scholar.    Embed Quote
