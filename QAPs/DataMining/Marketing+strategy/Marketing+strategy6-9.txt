★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
The first step to a strong marketing strategy is to ask yourself why you are doing what you are doing. This allows you to focus on what you want to say to your customers and why they should care about what you are doing. Next, you need to create content that is reflective of your "why?" This ensures that your content is relevant and informative to your readers. Then use social media to your advantage! Share this content on platforms that work well for your brand. It takes time to catch on but stick with it!    Embed Quote
