★What are some recommended content marketing strategies for beginners?
Great question. A few things I would suggest are: 1. Know your audience and the type of content they want. That's the first step.  2. Check out other blogs and websites in your niche to see what sort of content they are posting. 3. Add social media into your marketing strategy. It gives you a great platform for facilitating discussion with your audience. 3. Offer to guest post on relevant blogs in order to advertise and network.
