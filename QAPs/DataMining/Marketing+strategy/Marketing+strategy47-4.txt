★What are some effective B2B Marketing strategies to target SMBs?My objective is to sell them software products. I have only small budgets allocated for marketing. Most of my clients are based in my city.
There many different ways, I would use: -Social Media for initial buzz. -Media buying on blogs that address your audience, in your specific city. -In case you have your own B2B product you can always sign up to a B2B marketplace (Chekkt, G2Crowd etc.)    Embed Quote
