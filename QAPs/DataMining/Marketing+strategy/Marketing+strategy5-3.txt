★What are the most important marketing strategies for a web startup?We're an engineering focused team and need some advice on how to market our startup thinkpanda.com
I am always amazed at the amount of people in technology startup land who have never read Crossing the Chasm by Geoffery Moore.  If you are a tech startup and want to talk marketing strategy use that as your starting point.  (and I think there are some brilliantly useful things for non tech start ups too) Some other notes: 1.  FOCUS - remember that Facebook didn't start being a social network for everyone - (see the Bowling Alley part of Moore's book) 2.  BUILD MARKETING INTO YOUR PRODUCT - large companies have a helluva time doing this and you can do this right from the start.  It's not about 'tellafriend' its about NETWORK EFFECTS - leverage them for your business - give 'em a reason to care and a reason to share (i think that is a quote stolen from a P&G SM co somehow but i can't remember exectly) 3.  SEO SEO SEO - your a startup  has few dollars and SEO is amazingly efficient and effective 4.  MAKE YOUR CUSTOMERS PART OF YOUR CREATIVE TEAM - get people invested in your success by soliciting feedback early and often.  That also includes media and influencer types 5. KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS A BRAND FROM DAY 1:  again big companies have trouble defining their DNA and building their entire product and customer experience around it.  Brand should not be a logo, tagline or an afterthought. (no matter what VC's will tell you). You need to make everything count - know your brand and build it right from the start and embed it in all your decisions    Embed Quote
