★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
There are so many answers here I'm not sure if this one was covered.  If someone knows the details of this story please chime in! I heard a story that several years ago JCPenny tried to do "truth in pricing" and it backfired.  They set their prices to whole dollar amounts with no discounts, coupons, or sales.  Their sales plummeted and they went back to fractional penny pricing, discounts, coupons, etc. in short order.  Apparently they tried to do the "honest" thing and people became suspicious to the point of being put off to not purchase their products. Urban legend?  Can someone corroborate this?    Embed Quote
