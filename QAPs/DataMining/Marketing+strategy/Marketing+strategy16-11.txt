★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
I get upset. Many others do too. If you noticed almost ALL of SaaS vendors online have changed their pricing to remove the "trailing 9s". There's still a tendency to go by $29 instead of $30 but in recent times marketers are trying to get away from that too    Embed Quote
