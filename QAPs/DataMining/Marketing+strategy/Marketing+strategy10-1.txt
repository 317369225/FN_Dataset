★What is WhatsApp's marketing strategy?
Zero-to-hero. The first few years they focused on accumulating a huge user-base that led them to have 500M users today who rely on the on a daily-basis for message-based communications.  They then decided to charge as little as $0.89/year per user. They developed such a great product that their users today find the app indispensable for their message-based communication. Their marketing strategy is quite simple but effective: developing a kick-ass product that, when launched, people won't be able to live without anymore. P.s. on a side note, they did some light marketing: conference speaking, blog commenting, interacting with influential bloggers or create some video/one-pagers.    Embed Quote
