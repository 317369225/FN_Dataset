★Why is SEO Important in a Digital Marketing Strategy?Are marketing strategists aware on the importance of SEO? Why should someone without any knowledge of IT be in touch with SEO?
SEO is nothing but helping your users discover about your business. A search query in Google is nothing but a question, if not explicit. Google wants to deliver results that answer those questions. Let’s not consider SEO to be daunting, instead let’s consider it as something that will act as a gateway to deliver these answers to your users before your competitors do.   You need to have a strategy that will be in cognizant with that of Google’s algorithm. Blogging, paid ads, posting relevant answers are not enough, users must be able to trust you and it should be integrated into a user experience that makes it easy for the users to get their answer and contact you back. Always have a cogent strategy that will mirror your sales process and have a long lasting success for your business.    Embed Quote
