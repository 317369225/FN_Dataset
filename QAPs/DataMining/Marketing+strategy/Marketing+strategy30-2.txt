★What is a good content marketing strategy for a digital agency?
It starts with one word. "HELP" How can you help? Who can you help? Where can you find the people to help? I used to own a digital agency for 12 years until I sold it and our moto was HELP. We had so much business coming to us but it wasn't because we were just doing content marketing. Content marketing is great but most people do it wrong. You need a system for gathering leads outside of content marketing and then after they go through your warmup funnel, then send them your weekly content. Do not wait for your content to be picked up in Google or you will be dead. Here is the exact system that works for me and 100 other agency owners like you. http://jasonswenk.com/generateleads    Embed Quote
