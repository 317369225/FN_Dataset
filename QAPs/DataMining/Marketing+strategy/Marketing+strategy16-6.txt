★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
It's almost as if we've all accepted the fact that advertising and marketing involves lying. I'm always amused by how the photos on packaged food look so unlike the actual product, yet no one complains. If you buy a frozen cherry pie, the photo shows a slice that's thick and packed with cherries. In reality the pie is shallow and mostly filled with red goo. On the photo there's a tiny disclaimer, "Serving Suggestion." Which is ridiculous. What's the suggestion? Buy and cook extra cherries and stuff them into the pie? But this is so common it escapes our notice.    Embed Quote
