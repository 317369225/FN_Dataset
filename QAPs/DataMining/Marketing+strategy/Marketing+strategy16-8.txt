★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
In the United States, people are so used to this that it's not an issue, and in any case, it doesn't matter once you add in sales tax. In some places in East Asia, doing something like this *will* get you in trouble.  People aren't used to this sort of pricing, and doing a "99" price will cause problems.    Embed Quote
