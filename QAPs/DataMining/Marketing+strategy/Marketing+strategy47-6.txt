★What are some effective B2B Marketing strategies to target SMBs?My objective is to sell them software products. I have only small budgets allocated for marketing. Most of my clients are based in my city.
Since your market is local, try to have your business listed on search engines specially with Google. Take advantage of inbound marketing through search. Have a relevant content that targets your market and distribute all over the Internet and make sure that your content reaches your target audience. You may also utilize email marketing, however you needed to have a contact list. Since you will be selling software products most likely search marketing / inbound marketing will be effective for you.    Embed Quote
