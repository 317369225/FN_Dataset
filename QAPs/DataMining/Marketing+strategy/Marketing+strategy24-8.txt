★What is the best marketing strategy for a new Internet startup?Building and launching a new Internet startup is not a big deal, but making it a hit is really a big deal. The whole success lies on your marketing strategy and how successfully you devise and execute that strategy.
For a startup, you need to cover your basics and create content your customers will find interesting. But if you want to find success, you need to do a heck of a lot of PR work in your chosen fields. Plan to put enough hours in to build relationships with journalists that cover your industry. (For tech startups, think Mashable and TechCrunch) Doing the grunt work and getting coverage is the best bet to getting a good momentum built around your startup's marketing.    Embed Quote
