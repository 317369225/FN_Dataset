★How important is content in a digital marketing strategy?
McDonalds is a fast food KING because of their ad content, not because of their product. Just a good example. People don't go to McDonalds because they have the best, or even top 50, hamburger in the region. They buy it because in the 3 minutes of driving they've seen 3 McD's, heard 3 McD commercials, and saw 3 McD billboards that all marketed a different reason why McD's is a viable option. They could do all of this without even mentioning a hamburger and get people to buy. That's an example of content being the #1 thing to work on for Digital Marketing Strategies, an adverse example of why content makes your product look good would be Chipotle. What's better than a great product or a great ad message? BOTH. Chipotle brands themselves as being the fast food chain that provides you with the best quality burrito right down the the freshly sliced cheeses. Therefore, their ad content revolves around the product, which in a lot of cases is your best bet for both success and widespread respect.    Embed Quote
