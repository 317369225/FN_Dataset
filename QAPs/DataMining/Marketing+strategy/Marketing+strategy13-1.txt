★What are some great LinkedIn content marketing strategies?
LinkedIn is one of my favorite social networks for content marketing because there are so many opportunities. First off, it's now a publishing platform so you can create content specifically for LinkedIn, or re-publish your old content. Groups are also great for content marketing: you can use them to brainstorm new content ideas (based on what people are talking about), you can promote your content, and you can build relationships with influencers who can help you promote your content. Your personal profile can also help you connect with influencers - you can comment on their published posts, interact with them in groups, add them as connections, message them, and more. LinkedIn has done a lot of work to make content really stand out on the site, and I think they will focus on this more and more in the coming years.    Embed Quote
