★What is the best marketing strategy for a new Internet startup?Building and launching a new Internet startup is not a big deal, but making it a hit is really a big deal. The whole success lies on your marketing strategy and how successfully you devise and execute that strategy.
There is no "best". Even the most well run fortune 500 companies will only get it right 3 times out of 10. Take a cue from good investors, hedge your bets. Never go all in on any strategy. Diversify your advertising spend, test, test and test again. You will always be course correcting as the market changes so should your strategy. My best advice is to study companies similar to yours that have succeeded, you don't necessarily want to copy them, but why not learn from their mistakes and wins. Hey if it's good enough for Harvard (case studies are the core of an MBA program) it should be good enough for you. Here's to your success!    Embed Quote
