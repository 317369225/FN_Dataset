★What is a go-to-market strategy?What does it mean when someone asks for your go-to-market strategy? What are some good examples of this?
Well a go to market strategy is basically what you do to reach your target demographic after your product is made. Every product needs this to reach the folks it is designed for. Probably one of the most famous examples is how Facebook was launched by Mark Zuckerberg. He recognised his product was built keeping college students in mind as its core users. His go to market strategy was creating a buzz amongst college students about Facebook(emailing the famous kids and getting them to use it). He slowly opened it up, few universities at a time and then of course making it completely open for everyone.    Embed Quote
