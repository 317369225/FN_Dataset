★What is a good content marketing strategy for a digital agency?
Show off your expertise. Content marketing is your chance to show that you know what you're talking about. Talk to your desired audience. Are you trying to attract CMOs from large corporations? B2B companies? Small businesses? Know who your audience is and provide content that is helpful and relevant to them. Deliver your content where your target audience lives in a helpful, non-spammy way. Make sure you have a calendar and stick to it! The only way to drive leads in a complex sales cycle is to consistently produce excellent content. Best of luck. Katherine Leonard www.lonelybrand.com    Embed Quote
