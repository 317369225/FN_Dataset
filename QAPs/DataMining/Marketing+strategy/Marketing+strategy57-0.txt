★What is the marketing strategy of OLA cabs?
Marketing strategies are always interesting to learn but the fact that the actually strategies of any company are never revealed out. Here is my intuition of the their strategy ... Unlike Uber Ola Cabs is customized to the local Indian only market. customizing its operations to suit the needs of the local market. This focused approach has immensely helped Ola Cabs in driving its growth. Ola cabs is now on a investment phase. With loads of coupons , referral programs out the company aims at capturing the Indian web app based taxi market which is on a rise in India. Once a customer gets used to rides and finds them comforting and only a little more costly than the auto rickshaw , he/she eventually gets used to it following the age old adage Today its a luxury , tomorrow we will make it a necessity This is the pure marketing strategy . Coming to the dark side of it ... Loads of black money are being invested and given out in the form of coupons , ola cash , free rides etc and it comes out as revenues in white.    Embed Quote
