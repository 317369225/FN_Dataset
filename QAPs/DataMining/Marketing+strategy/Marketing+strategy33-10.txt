★What are the highest-impact inbound marketing strategies for SaaS companies?A lot of time can be spent on inbound marketing (e.g., writing blog posts, conducting webinars, building a Twitter following, etc.). What are the highest ROI activities for an early-stage SaaS company to be involved in?
One piece of the puzzle... I would like to share two case studies of edocr with you, well before we had lead capture capability, and all the cool apps. Let me introduce Mr. Bollywood himself GoSecure.com | edocr. Billa was working on creating a new techstartup called GoSecure. They used this simple document to create brand awareness and drive traffic, way before the product was ready.  When US based Crains decided to launch the first European Weekly business newspaper in Manchester, they choose us to publish their magazine in addition to the print version. Here is the account steve | edocr Both were startups and had the same challenge, i.e. how to build brand awareness.  Many startups do not believe in creating pdfs, instead they prefer text on web pages. Pdfs such as these can produce results not just during a campaign. Unlike web pages which change constantly, documents capture information at a particular time and continue to produce results. They never go to sleep.. We thrive on the long tail.. Unfortunately both of these startups are no longer in business. There is almost no real evidence they ever existed (except a holding page for Crains Manchester Business). edocr continue to provide historical information. It even got me captured in here Crain's Manchester Business 30th June 2008 So if you are a startup, please don't give up on boring documents. Take time to create a brochure, a white paper, a case study. These can help you not just create brand awareness, but also capture leads which could turn out to be your first revenue paying customers    Embed Quote
