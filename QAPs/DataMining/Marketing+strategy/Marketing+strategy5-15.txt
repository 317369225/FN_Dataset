WOW...wow...wow it looks like a huge messy job. It does not need to be that confusing. First thing you need to do as a start up is to know your target market ( primary and secondary ). When you know who u targeting, you can create a great product that resolves their problems and needs.( same as offline marketing ) Second thing that you need to do is to create a website that works. Which means having the right seo friendly layout and great copywriting. Third thing that you need to do is search for advertising options, that can work for you.( pay per click advertising or pay per impression, banner ads, video marketing etc...) Is also important to create social media profiles in the main social networking sites. You should keep in mind that many start ups fail the first 6 months because they focus more in secondary things like article writing, social media and branding. Don't focus too much on them ,because you will have time to build them later.    Embed Quote
