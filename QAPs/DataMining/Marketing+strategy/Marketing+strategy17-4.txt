★What's the best way to develop and execute an online marketing strategy?A small local business wants to take its marketing efforts digital. They want a three-pronged attack: Blog, Bi-weekly email, Facebook. How do you sell your advertising space and at what price ?
Right now, the best way to do it would be though an integrated digital marketing approach. It all starts with content marketing. I created the following system to make use of all the models which compliment each other instead of acting in silos. Integrated Digital Marketing is like a team with content as the leader and the various other digital marketing methods are like its team members. Instead of asking each member to achieve the goal of increasing the company’s customer base onit’s own, Integrated Digital Marketing will make use of each member’s strengths and produce a result which are more than the sum of the individual achievements of each member. (The above excerpt is from my blog.) I do not see the need to sell advertising space unless you are a publisher who depends on the revenue from display advertising. Instead use different methods to convert blog visitors into leads and then convert them into customers. Hope you got some new ideas. Let me know if you have any questions.    Embed Quote
