★What is the most underutilized marketing strategy for consumer internet startup companies?
My biased answer is retargeting. To say SEO is underutilized is a bit crazy.  Every internet company that I've ever known is focused on SEO to some degree.  Everyone is very well aware of it and knows they need to "do SEO."  There was a recent survey of marketing professionals that said the same answer. From: http://www.marketingcharts.com/i... Nearly half (46.3%) of specialized marketers in a recent survey think that ad remarketing - also known as ad retargeting - is currently the the most under-used online marketing technology, according to research conducted by Advertise.com and the Search Engine Marketing Professional Organization (SEMPO).    Embed Quote
