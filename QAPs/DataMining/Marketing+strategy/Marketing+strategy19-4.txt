★Why is SEO Important in a Digital Marketing Strategy?Are marketing strategists aware on the importance of SEO? Why should someone without any knowledge of IT be in touch with SEO?
As part of a digital marketing campaign, SEO gets people to a website that aren't searching for the brand name. Using the right keywords can mean attracting traffic from people that are actively searching for your products and may be ready to buy. While PPC can often offer similar traffic, SEO will generally refer this traffic at a much lower cost when done correctly. This isn't the only benefit, from my personal experience I find that traffic from SEO when compared with traffic from PPC is better quality, measured by lower bounce rates and longer times on the website. However the main benefit that I see from SEO and other search engine marketing is that a website doesn't have to rely on its brand name to receive visitors.    Embed Quote
