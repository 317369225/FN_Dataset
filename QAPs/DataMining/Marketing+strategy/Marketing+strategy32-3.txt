★Web Marketing: How do I create a digital marketing strategy?What do you suggest as a process?
Overview In digital marketing, like all forms of business, it is best to have your strategy defined before you dig in to implementation. So before you create your first Youtube video or Facebook group, lets begin by discussing what you need to think through: 1.Your target customer & the problems you are solving 2.Differentiation and branding plan 3.Customer assessment (where they are and where they will be) 4.Competitive analysis & timeline 5.Your tactical plan 6.Results and feedback Targeting your customers The first step in most marketing strategies is to figure out who your target customers are.  It allows you to focus your message, differentiate your product and  figure out how you will reach people who might buy your product.  Unfortunately, many companies approach this step incorrectly.  In an attempt not to exclude any potential revenue, a common mistake many companies make is to describe their targets by a range of values and characteristics.  For example, any company with over $5 million in revenue in the business of selling blue widgets. This doesn’t allow you to focus at all.@undefined@Peter Jonathan Wilcheck    Embed Quote
