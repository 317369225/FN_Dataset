★What is the best marketing strategy for a new Internet startup?Building and launching a new Internet startup is not a big deal, but making it a hit is really a big deal. The whole success lies on your marketing strategy and how successfully you devise and execute that strategy.
I'm sure that when you think of marketing, you are expecting conventional answers ie - Adwords, PR, Social media, Onboarding,etc,etc - But my  best advice would be to try and view your product through the eyes of your end user, and not through the eyes of you or your team.  Build an experience that they will be passionate about, and make your users your biggest marketing funnel.  Zappos did this exceptionally well.  Trader Joe's also does this well.    Embed Quote
