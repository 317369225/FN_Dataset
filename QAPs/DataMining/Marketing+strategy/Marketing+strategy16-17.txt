★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
Just like a person growing up in a jungle would learn survival skills such as knowing which plants are poisonous, a person growing up with advertising develops a survival mechanism known by the technical term, "bullshit filter". They learn to see "$9.99" as "$10 + tax".    Embed Quote
