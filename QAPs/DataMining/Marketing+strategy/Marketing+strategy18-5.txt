★What are the best inbound marketing strategies?
Educate your customer. Ruben Gamez at BidSketch does a great job of this. I get an email every couple of days and it is always something I want to read. It is geared towards freelancers, but has enough common sense business advice to be worthy of just about anybody's inbox. I am pretty sure he is using Drip for this as he has one of their lead collection forms on his site. You can have all of the inbound marketing tools in the world but they mean nothing if your site is a barren wasteland. Existing customers are the best source of new business there is, so setup a referral marketing program using something like Ambassador. I am a fan of hacking together the solution that works best for you. There seems to be a price multiplier applied to all of the "all-in-one" platforms that may or may not do what you want it to. A great example of this is people that pay hundreds a month for split testing when Analytics does the same exact thing and is probably already used by your company.    Embed Quote
