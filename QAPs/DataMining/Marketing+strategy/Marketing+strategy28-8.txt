★How should I begin research on a content marketing strategy?
My advice with all of my consulting clients is to start with creating buyer personas. These are based on detailed, analytical research, but represent "real" people. Instead of just giving characteristics for a buyer group like "middle age, $100,000 household income, middle-management, lives in medium-sized city, works for company of 200+ employees", do something like this: "Barbara Smith, age 55, sales manager of 12-person team, married, husband also works in middle management, college-aged children, drives a mid-sized SUV, lives in Chicago suburbs, likes to watch travel shows, and rides bicycles for exercise, at work her biggest challenge is getting everyone to think on the same page" Of course, this was a quick example off the top of my head, but the point is to remember that you're marketing to actual people and to create content for them. Doing this also keeps the focus on the reader as a person, not just another number in a statistical group. Even if your business has a heavy B2B focus, at the end of the day, you're still selling to people, and writing content to accommodate for this will really increase the efficiency of your results.
