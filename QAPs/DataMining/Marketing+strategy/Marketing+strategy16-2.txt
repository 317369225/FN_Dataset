★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
There is no deception here.  Deception would be to offer one price but then to charge another.  But to charge the advertised price, that is exactly what we require of sellers. In this case I'd invoke the "moron in a hurry" concept from trademark law.   If no one but a moron in a hurry can think that $9.99 actually means $9.00, then you don't have much of  an argument http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_m...    Embed Quote
