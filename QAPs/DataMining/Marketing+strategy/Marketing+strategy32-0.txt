★Web Marketing: How do I create a digital marketing strategy?What do you suggest as a process?
I'm in the midst of defining our own marketing strategy for ReTargeter.com on paper, and most of it will be digital. 1. Create a set of goals that align with the overall business objective. I think that you should probably start by defining your goals for marketing. Do you want to drive leads? qualified leads? sales? partnerships? get acquired? hire great people? Figure out a few of your main goals. 2. Create a roadmap for your marketing team. Next, I'd consider figuring out how you'd want your marketing team to be built out. You may not be able to figure this out right away, but having a general understanding of your own competencies could help. Marketing generally starts with one or a few people, and as you start marketing your business, you'll be able to figure out where you need to focus more people on, and what tasks you think you can outsource. You may want to separate each marketing position by the channel that they'll own, but there could be better ways to do it. For example, you may want to outsource your PR efforts because the relationships that professional PR people have are hard to build, while you may want to hire your own front-end designer, since their projects can be more agile and can better align with your brand and team culture. Depending on your resources, you may want to figure out a way to work with some great talent before bringing them on full-time. Remember your marketing goals and how they align with your overall business objective. 3. Figure out how each marketing channel that you're focusing on will help you reach your goals. 4. Set a timeline for specific accomplishments marketing as a whole, or each channel individually, will bring. Have some short-term and long-term accomplishments set. 5. Understand that this is a plan, and you can change,add, or take away stuff from it at any time. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
