★What is the marketing strategy of OLA cabs?
It is certainly surprising that they are giving so many free rides and other coupons and that too for free. I'm a customer of ola cabs and have been using it for past few months. I have talked to many drivers about their income from ola and have been told that they make good money (some even told me that they make 4-5k every day just by taking 5 rides a day). What I feel about their marketing strategy is that they are in the phase of creating need for the people. There are only two ways of making money, one is fulfilling needs and the other is creating needs. People who used to travel by auto rickshaw will also get used to taxis. Once they have good customer base and get people used to using taxis they will increase the fare and also cut the drivers pay.    Embed Quote
