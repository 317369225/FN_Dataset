★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
As others have said it's not deceptive at all, but is an attempt at a psychological trick. However, even the idea that it helps encourage purchases might not be entirely true. Recent studies suggest that round numbers without any cents (i.e. $10 not $10.00 or $9.99) are even better received. Most middle to higher end restaurants have caught on to this and list their prices accordingly. This could be because it's simply less digits and looks like a smaller number or it may be that it requires less mental work from the customer, but the dropping the fractional amount does seem to work best. We may see a trend in the future of prices moving towards a whole-dollar only price much more frequently.    Embed Quote
