★What is the best marketing strategy?
Before you choose a marketing strategy, you need to be crystal clear as to who your ideal customer is, what they need, and how you, your products or services deliver the solution they have been searching for. If you don't have a clear marketing message, the method you use to deliver your message won't matter much. Also, using a strategy simply because others in your profession are using it doesn't mean it will be an effective strategy for you. Many online marketers are using video to attract new business.  Video is great for helping you move closer to that 'know-like-trust' relationship.  However, video won't be a good fit if you are camera shy. Bottom line, before you launch into implementing any strategy, make sure you have a strong, compelling message that will speak to the prospective customers you wish to work with and in a way they clearly see the benefit of what you have to offer.    Embed Quote
