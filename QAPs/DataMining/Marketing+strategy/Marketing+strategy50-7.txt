★What are some recommended content marketing strategies for beginners?
I agree with Rachel, it is imperative to understand the target audience before putting together any content marketing pieces. This can be as simple as polling your current client base or researching what successful competitors or peers are doing in the space. When you understand the thought process, behaviors and preferences of your audience, you will be able to write to them more effectively. It is also important to not just identify the personas initially but continually review your target audience research and see how the demographics have evolved. Often a company may start out targeting SMBs and eventually seek out larger enterprises. This would require a review of the content marketing targeting strategy. Likewise, as more solutions enter the marketplace, the concerns, behaviors and preferences of the target audience may change in response to new opportunities or capabilities. This requires marketing teams to stay abreast of what is happening in the market and how it is impacting the target audience. Just like every other aspect of marketing, content creation must be tested, retested and tested yet again. How does your company measure it's marketing activities?
