★What are some recommended content marketing strategies for beginners?
Analytics. For beginners and non-writers, developing an intuition about what will work and what won't work with your target audience can be especially difficult.

The easiest and cheapest place to start is with Google Analytics, but I'd suggest experiment with the free trials of tools like Raven, Hubspot, Moz, etc. to help you see your results in an easy-to-digest dashboard to know how to continually modify your content marketing strategy for success.
