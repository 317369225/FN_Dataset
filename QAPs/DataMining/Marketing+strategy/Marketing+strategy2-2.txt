★Effective marketing strategy?To market my site (a social network for stock market investors) , I was thinking of putting a flier on the bulletin board of my college's business school, and getting these fliers onto other college boards.
Devising an effective marketing strategy requires a number of things.  You must identify your target audience, define your goals, and think about the nature of the service or product that you are trying to market.  Try to think about the motivations and interests of your audience -- keep them in mind while you devise your strategy.  Consider all the ways in which you can make your product appealing to your particular audience.  If you create or write content in order to help advertise, make sure it is well-written, well-researched and engaging.  Best of luck!    Embed Quote
