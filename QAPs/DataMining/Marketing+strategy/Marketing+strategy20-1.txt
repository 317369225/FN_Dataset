★What are good marketing strategies for a small business?
As a small business, one of the key areas to focus on is getting attention. You’re starting from zero brand recognition so you’ll need to focus on getting known first. Here are a few ideas: Partner Up – Consider getting in touch with businesses that would complement yours or share similar customers. Consider a joint promotion or guest blog. Think Local – Before you explore other cities, states or countries, start within your community to build a base. Charitable organizations are a great way to go, too. Go traditional – Your marketing bag is full of options—press releases, newspaper advertising, email, flyers, blogging, networking, social media, the Yellow Pages—the list is just about endless these days.   It’s all about testing. Plan a few activities where you believe you’ll get the most for your dollar. If you’re looking for more small business advice, visit The Payroll Blog.    Embed Quote
