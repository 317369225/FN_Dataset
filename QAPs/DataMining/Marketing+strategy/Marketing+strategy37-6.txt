In terms of social media, you should invest in monitoring so you know how many people are talking about your brand and what they are saying. It can help a lot, and its a good way to respond to what your consumers are thinking. Its not just about what you put out there, its about what they put out there about you also. There are some really good data monitoring sites out there like Socialbakers, but Fashionbi particularly specializes in fashion brands which should be perfect if thats the industry you work in.
