★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
Ever be to Wal-Mart? They have all sorts of strange prices, $2.37; $8.46...they test like mad. It's not just about $x.x9 anymore. In any case, pricing strategy is no more deceptive than using colors, images, branding, or even the location on the shelf to move more product.    Embed Quote
