★What is the difference between Japanese marketing strategies and Indian marketing strategies?
I'm not very sure about 'digital' marketing, but in general I think Japanese believe in 'good service, more customers' approach, while Indians try to create fads like let's sell however much possible as soon as possible. It is not true always though. I am sure there are good and bad practices everywhere.    Embed Quote
