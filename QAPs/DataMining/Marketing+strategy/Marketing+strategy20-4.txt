★What are good marketing strategies for a small business?
This is a quick answer, however I believe some of the key things for a small business marketing strategy now are mainly based around digital marketing; -Content Strategy. Write about your subject area to build engagement and to be an authority to google and your target market. (articles/blogs) -Web Presence. Create profiles in trusted directories/review sites like Google places, Yelp, Supplibase, FourSquare. -Leverage social media. -Use some paid media. Talk to your customers and use geo-targeted Twitter/Facebook ads to reach your audience and use google adwords to target your potential customers. -Plus you can still try local marketing tactics such as direct mail, field marketing, experiential marketing.    Embed Quote
