★What is the best marketing strategy for a new Internet startup?Building and launching a new Internet startup is not a big deal, but making it a hit is really a big deal. The whole success lies on your marketing strategy and how successfully you devise and execute that strategy.
Start small, take baby steps, focus on your customer, focus on creating value for your customer. Think on these lines: How large is your market size? What exact number of customers do you want to target within the first 6 months? What is the cost of reaching out to those many customers? What is your gross profit per transaction? What is the exact RoI goal for each completed sale? How much money and time do you have on hand to reach your target customer base? How much is your completition able to ape you, beating you down in your competitive advantage, thereby increasing your cost of impacting customer opinion?You can start with a target sale of 100 units and reaching out to 50,000 prospects to begin with. You should segment your exact TG (target group) on age, gender, location, interest, time-slot, time-zone, etc. AND measure your every single move for RoI. Most important: if you can sell your product or service to first 100 customers WITHOUT spending on advertising, DO IT.  For this will give you important feedback on product improvement, customer intent and critically improve your own selling skills.  Finally, try to build your product ambassadors from your first 10-15 customers and achieve your first 100 sales via referrals from your early adopters.  Chances are, when you actually start spending on marketing, your product would already be rock solid and word of mouth will get you ahead faster, sooner, better.    Embed Quote
