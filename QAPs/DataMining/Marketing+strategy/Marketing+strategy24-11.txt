★What is the best marketing strategy for a new Internet startup?Building and launching a new Internet startup is not a big deal, but making it a hit is really a big deal. The whole success lies on your marketing strategy and how successfully you devise and execute that strategy.
I'm having trouble with this as well-- I'm a marketing intern at a startup called "Goldenslate, ," which is a website & mobile app where people can refer their friends & family to service professionals (dentists, vets, hair stylists, etc.) they trust. If anyone could please take a look at the website (linked above) & offer me advice on how to target audiences best, I'd really appreciate it!    Embed Quote
