★What are the highest-impact inbound marketing strategies for SaaS companies?A lot of time can be spent on inbound marketing (e.g., writing blog posts, conducting webinars, building a Twitter following, etc.). What are the highest ROI activities for an early-stage SaaS company to be involved in?
Sometimes the best online marketing starts offline.  Speak at events.  Get together with the people at your company who are interested in speaking, and put in proposals to every relevant conference you can.  Look for conferences that have substantial online echoes, such as active livebloggers last year. Your conference talk is not a sales pitch, but should be on message and relevant to potential buyers.  Talks about the guts of the product are also good but would fall under recruiting. Your conference experience should be good for a bunch of blog posts, too.  Post notes on other talks, and read and respond to the blogs of other speakers and attendees.    Embed Quote
