★What is the marketing strategy of Xiaomi?
Xiaomi for one has a very well defined target audience. They target the fast growing but nascent middle class in emerging economies. So as the financial situation of the middle class grows, they aspire to live a better life resulting in buying products which are next to top brands. Xiaomi's products rank top notch in the industry despite having 60% less prices then premium brands. It doesn't target premium customers, rather it targets teens who are willing to buy a premium device at much lower cost. On average, a new version of a phone is launched every 265 days in the industry – down from 345 days in 2009. But Xiaomi doesn’t renew its product for two years. Then, rather than charge high prices to cover the high cost of state-of-the-art components, Xiaomi prices the phone just a little higher than the total cost of all its components. As component costs drop over the two-year period by more than 90%, Xiaomi maintains its original price, and pockets the difference. So essentially its profit formula is the opposite of Apple’s, which collects its highest profits with the introduction of each model and needs to come up with new model after new model to keep those margins up. Through an online retailer called Flipkart, potential buyers preregister for a short sales window. They’re required to stay online for at least two hours before the sale starts, and then only the first 20,000 lucky buyers get the opportunity to purchase. Human nature being what it is, after this awful experience, buyers end up wanting the phone even more. Xiaomi is close to meeting its target of selling 60 million phones in 2014 with a business model well suited to expansion into other developing economies.
