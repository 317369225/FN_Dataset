★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
It is not deceptive, but rather a transparent form of manipulation. Consumers understand that $9.99 is equivalent to $10. Most of us realise that this increases sales. We are voluntarily purchasing the product in either case so no harm is being done. if there is any damage to reputation, it is irrelevant if every store experiences the same damage Businesses are driven by profit and a colossal percentage of sales can be directly attributed to pricing techniques, dwarfing any adverse affect to reputation    Embed Quote
