★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
Before SEO, social media sense, quality content, etc you need a strong sense of brand. In my experience consulting for startups, the #1 stumbling block I've encountered is trying to develop a solid product/service offering and marketing strategy without a solid brand and identity. As a startup, it's extremely helpful to figure out who and what you are before writing any content for your website - because your brand impacts your design, your language, your approach, etc. Come up with a 5- and 15-second pitch for your company. Stick to them, and if they need tweaking, tweak them and stick to them again. People relate to brands in the same way they relate to people. If someone's not sure of who they are, I'll notice it in what they say and reveal to me. It's the same with an inconsistent brand.    Embed Quote
