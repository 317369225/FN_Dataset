★What are the highest-impact inbound marketing strategies for SaaS companies?A lot of time can be spent on inbound marketing (e.g., writing blog posts, conducting webinars, building a Twitter following, etc.). What are the highest ROI activities for an early-stage SaaS company to be involved in?
A lot of talk revolves around content marketing, social, etc.   While these are definitely key components , we often see companies weak in the area of basic SEO.    Today SEO is still the #1 way to drive highly targeted and qualified traffic to your SAAS business.   It can be extended even beyond your main site to additional micro-sites.   If you are not getting at least several thousand targeted visitors to your site (per month) via SEO then I would not spread your resources too broad until you achieve this primary objective.    Ofcourse content plays a role in generating high quality traffic....but there is much more to it.   Happy to provide more details if it's of interest.    Embed Quote
