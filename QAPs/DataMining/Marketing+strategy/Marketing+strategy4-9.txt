★How important is content in a digital marketing strategy?
I definitely agree that the content you publish and share on different online channels is of vital importance as this is what is going to 'define' your brand's relationship with the audience. Content is what will help create brand awareness and credibility, drive engagement and place your brand in the customer's consideration set (or not). You need to be very strategic about the content you serve on the different platforms - make sure it's aligned with your brand's *purpose* and *objectives*. And that it 'makes sense', meaning that it is consistent with your brand's character. Finally, it is also essential to create content tailored not only to different audience segments in terms of demographics and lifestyles, but also in terms of the different stages of the customer journey. Users that are not familiar with your brand should not be targeted with the same content as users who are moments away from actually making a purchase.
