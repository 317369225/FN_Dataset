★How should I begin research on a content marketing strategy?
Anne Handley of Marketing Profs just release a book called Content Rules. I recommend not only the book but also Marketing Profs in general as a resource. Othe resource sites that have a lot of info on content marketing techniques are Marketing Sherpa and eConsultancy.    Embed Quote
