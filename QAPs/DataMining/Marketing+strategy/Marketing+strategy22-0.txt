★What is the most underutilized marketing strategy for consumer internet startup companies?
In my biased opinion, SEO: The inputs are skill and time, and you can often buy a little bit of skill (i.e. an SEO consultant who spends ~40 hours on research in order to tell you what you can do full-time to drive traffic). Cheaper than other user-acquisition methods; SEO seems to get traffic for 40% to 80% less than pay-per-click, with a slightly lower conversion rate. You can learn more about what your customers want from interacting with them when you ask them for links. An even reasonably good programmer can get a lot of SEO value out of a game, survey, sidebar widget, etc. The customers you get are, almost by definition, searching for a solution to whatever problem you solve. (If you rank for "create invoices for freelancers," or "file us taxes overseas," or "create a budget," you are virtually certain to get mostly traffic from people who want to do exactly that.) The benefits continue after the work stops (or slows down). Unlike other ad campaigns, the 'ad' sticks around for a while even if you're not paying.However, SEO is not the right choice for a startup doing something entirely novel. If you're creating a new online game, or inventing the Wakemate, or running SpaceX, you may have trouble finding targeted queries.    Embed Quote
