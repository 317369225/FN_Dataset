★What are the highest-impact inbound marketing strategies for SaaS companies?A lot of time can be spent on inbound marketing (e.g., writing blog posts, conducting webinars, building a Twitter following, etc.). What are the highest ROI activities for an early-stage SaaS company to be involved in?
I personally think that there is no cookie cutter approach that works and as Rachel Honoway rightly explained the product and market definition could guide you in terms of the best inbound marketing strategy out there. Irrespective of the approach or the platform used, the first step should be a clearly defined content strategy based on the product/market. Once that happens, various platforms can be considered and the content packaged to meet that need. For e.g. you might realize that an infographic converts better than a blog post. It is always a good idea to look at what other SaaS companies have been doing with respect to Inbound Marketing and what works for them. I recently wrote about the inbound marketing strategies of three startups (Hubspot, Kissmetrics and Buffer) 3 Startups that rock Inbound Marketing . You will notice that all three startups have developed great related content but have packaged it differently and used slightly different channels to market the content depending on what works for them best    Embed Quote
