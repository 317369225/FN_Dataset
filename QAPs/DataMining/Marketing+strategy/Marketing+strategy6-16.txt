★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
Focus.  50% of strategy is knowing when to say no. Know who your customers are (and aren't), and what specifically what value you provide to them - not just on the surface (e.g. what the app does, etc) but what it elicits a few layers beneath that.  Jim Stengel's book "GROW" has many useful case studies in it that talk about this.    Embed Quote
