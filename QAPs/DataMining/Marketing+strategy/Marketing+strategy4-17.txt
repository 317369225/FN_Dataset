★How important is content in a digital marketing strategy?
Content pretty much is the central part of every single online marketing campaign these days. Search relies heavily on unique and meaningful content, social is driven by your content strategy and everything inbetween should be integrated with your content strategy. Your content and more specifically your blogging and social strategy allow you to differentiate you from your competitors and to add personality to what would otherwise be a boring experience for your users. I generally let the content strategy drive the other core elements of our clients digital lives. It's much easier to execute things when they are genuine, unique and useful than just trying to get links, likes etc :)    Embed Quote
