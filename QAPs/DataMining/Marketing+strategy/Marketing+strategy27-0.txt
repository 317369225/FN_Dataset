★What is the most effective online marketing strategy?Between SEO, PPC, affiliate marketing, media buying or social media  optimization (SMO)
None - you've asked about strategy then written a list of tactics. This really matters if you're to succeed.  Please don't take this as an attack on your question, I'm genuinely trying to help. "What's the best strategy to create a comfortable home  - Is it a shovel, a digger, a bricklayer or doors?". There is no real difference between my question and yours.  Everyone can have a favourite tool, process, outcome they could recommend but creating a comfortable home is not actually a strategic aim for anyone without reason or context and a list of activities isn't the right place to start. One of the greatest scams of 21st century that has been sold to us is that participating in digital activity and tactics is in fact strategic marketing.  It's not, it leads to incoherent activity that wastes time, distracts from the real challenge and allows competitors that 'get it' to outpace us. The solution is to start with a clear statement of your ambition and challenge. "I want to create an online flower shop that can take on [insert competitor(s) in geography] and win [x%] of customer demand.  I've got [y amount] of resources and my starting position is from [define starting position]. Is my ambition realistic and if so what strategies should I consider to undertake this challenge and what tactical action would that lead to?" Start to ask questions about defined challenges that impede growth and you'll really improve both your understanding and get closer to business success.    Embed Quote
