★What is the best marketing strategy?
As a consumer, this I personally studied. The products we are comparing are Perk and Munch which both are a hit in Indian Market as wafer chocolates 1. Initially perk and munch had an equal market share in the Indian market. Both placed at just Rs.5. Note that they were almost equal in size. 2. Now, Perk launched another product UltaPerk at Rs.5, which was not a big hit. So, perk suffered loses and had to finally cut the production of UltaPerk. Now, Munch has a better position and Perk has suffered losses. 3. Perk comes up with a bigger version Glucose-Perk at the same price, which in a way doesn't taste much different but being more in quantity is more appealing to customer as a cost-effective buy. Although it costed more in manufacturing, but still their net profit increased due to increase in sales. Munch has a dip in their sales due to that. 4. Munch launches another product with the same size as perk. Perk already has a dominance in the market. Munch doesn't make a huge impact with the launch, as consumers already had the same product. 5. With the increase in prices, companies need to increase their prices. For example, prices of 600 ml bottle CocaCola went from Rs.20 to Rs.30 in 2 years. So that was the case with these 2 products also. Perk launches another product doublePerk, not that big, but still have a dominance due to the pool they gained earlier. 6. Now Perk has better profits than Munch, increased their prices with time with increase of their sales. For once they gained less, but it led to a better future for their brand. They took their chances of launching another product( glucose Perk ) after the failure of ulta Perk. It paid off, and they WON.    Embed Quote
