★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
As always, "it depends". It depends on your product, your market and your business model.  But at the end of the day, in my opinion, it always boils down to money. I'm one of those people who firmly believes that "economics dictate strategy".  Here's what I mean... Scenario #1 You're creating a content site that makes money through advertising revenue. Scenario #2 You're creating a SaaS product that you're planning to sell for $2,000 per year. Question: Would both start-ups need to - or even want to - learn and execute the same marketing strategies? Answer: I think not. The ad-based business needs to generate traffic extremely cheaply.  They need to use tactics like SEO, PR, social and viral marketing. If they're not attracting users for less money than they generate off of them, they'll be out of business soon enough. However, the SaaS company could go out there and rent e-mail lists, send direct marketing mailers out to potential customers, employ a telesales staff and buy media at scale across the web. Totally different strategies to learn and execute. So my advice would be to first understand the economic drivers of your business.  Specifically, your Customer Lifetime Value. This will then inform your Allowable Customer Acquisition Cost which will then inform marketing channels, strategies and tactics you could afford to employ.    Embed Quote
