★What's the best way to develop and execute an online marketing strategy?A small local business wants to take its marketing efforts digital. They want a three-pronged attack: Blog, Bi-weekly email, Facebook. How do you sell your advertising space and at what price ?
There is a lot of great detail in these answers, so I am going to offer a higher level response to help frame earlier answers. First: Media selections, such as social media, are tactics, not strategy. Strategy is a plan. Start the plan by defining precisely what the quantifiable business objective is. Using metrics such as Customer Lifetime Value or Average Revenue Per Customer can clarify this step. Then, ask questions to help design your strategy, which could include, but are not limited to: *What budget restrictions exist? *What are competitors doing? *What are short and long term goals? *What resources are available? *What tests are important for growing business? From this point, tactical priorities will become clearer. For instance: unpaid media channels are a priority due to small budget, or competition on Facebook will require more aggressive promotions, and so forth. At this point in the planning process, the previous answers may provide ideas for tactical elements helpful for executing your strategy.    Embed Quote
