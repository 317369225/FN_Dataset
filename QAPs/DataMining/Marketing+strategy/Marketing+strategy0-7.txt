★What is Uber's marketing strategy?How are they gaining most of their customers? Is there anything else than relying on word-of-mouth marketing?
Uber is your ‘on-demad private driver.’ Which states that its a very expensive, but a very cool and convenient cab. The way it works is simple: you use an iPhone or Android App to register, and order a Uber car. You are kept informed by your app/text messages on the status of your cab. After you are done with your ride, the cost of the ride is automatically deducted from your credit card. Uber’s marketing tactics have always been unique - from delivering to pickups.
