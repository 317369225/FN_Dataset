★How important is content in a digital marketing strategy?
Digital marketing is content. You can't market something online without content, regardless of the channels you use. Even if you don't have a business blog, you're still dealing with content. Your website is made up of content. You use words and videos to describe your product or service. Your ads are content. You use words to capture people's attention and bring them to your site. Your emails are content. You use words to get people to open them and click through. Everything you do in digital marketing is content, from expensive ads during the Super Bowl to the short thank you email you send after someone buys from you.    Embed Quote
