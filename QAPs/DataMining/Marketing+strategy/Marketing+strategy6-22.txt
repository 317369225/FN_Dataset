★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
Surely the very best thing to do - and the first thing you should do - is to go and find out what people want - then give it to them. Why spend millions/thousands/fivebucks developing a product no-one wants and then trying to come up with a plan to monetize it. This is far too common. Companies create a product based on what they think customers want and the market place says 'No thank you.' Think New Coke. I think there's a lot of good answers in this list and I would implement many of them in my own start-up, but first, I would find that 'starving crowd' and feed 'em what they want.    Embed Quote
