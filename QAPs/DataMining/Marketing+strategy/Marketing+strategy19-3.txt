★Why is SEO Important in a Digital Marketing Strategy?Are marketing strategists aware on the importance of SEO? Why should someone without any knowledge of IT be in touch with SEO?
I cannot think of a single person I know that does not start their research using a search engine. Search is so popular that the largest (Google) has a market cap of over $350 billion dollars. AdWords is the biggest contributor to Google’s bottom line. Billions are spent on search advertising every year. Google knows what their golden egg is and is trying to make it harder for digital marketers to optimize their sites for search. In fact, they would prefer if you did not optimize your site(s) at all. If nobody optimized, they would become even more reliant on AdWords. I have seen some insane AdWords budgets. Even for smaller companies. I’ve also seen many that invest so much in AdWords that there is little to nothing left over to tackle other strategies. I’m not even sure some of the owners of these smaller companies could tell me the definition of “organic search.” I’d say organic search is more important than paid search. A lot of people skip over the ads and click on the organic results. You should try to optimize for these as much as possible. Don’t forget to pay attention to long tail keywords; they drive up to 80% of global search traffic. I use lots of tools in my day-to-day SEO.
