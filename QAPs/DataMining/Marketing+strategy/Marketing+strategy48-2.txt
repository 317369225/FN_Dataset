★What marketing strategies power the most viral Facebook apps?How has the news feed algorithm evolved to minimize "spam," e.g. 10/day limit? What tactics are having the most success, e.g. share v. invite, fan pages, user award competition?
We recommend people make interesting content. Make a coupon or giveaway worth while. Beyond that, just encourage sharing. Post about it frequently... usually a few times a week throughout the course of the promotion. Remember that people don't typically goto a business' Facebook Page and poke around the way they do its website. Most traffic is driven in through the news feed.
