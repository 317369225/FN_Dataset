★What are some effective B2B Marketing strategies to target SMBs?My objective is to sell them software products. I have only small budgets allocated for marketing. Most of my clients are based in my city.
Although content marketing is a very popular method for driving B2B marketing leads, it is not always the right solution. Content marketing does not necessarily cost you anything on a per lead basis, but it does take a lot of time and effort. It also does not drive the most qualified leads. Over half of your leads driven from content marketing will be unqualified and sit in your pipeline for months. With the emergence of new technologies, we have seen a resurgence in outbound marketing to SMBs. Software companies are now able to aggregate real-time data on small businesses and compile it into one central location. Radius (company) is an example of a company focused on marketing/selling directly to small businesses. It is a subscription based service in which you can build very targeted lead lists based on new and innovative filters. Some examples of these filters are location, industry, social and web presence, and online reviews. These web and social filters are starting to serve as the new standard for what determines a good lead. This is a pretty affordable product as well, starting at as low as $50 a month annually.    Embed Quote
