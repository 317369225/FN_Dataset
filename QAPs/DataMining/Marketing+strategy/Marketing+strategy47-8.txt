★What are some effective B2B Marketing strategies to target SMBs?My objective is to sell them software products. I have only small budgets allocated for marketing. Most of my clients are based in my city.
Via blogging, trade fairs, print media, online ads, SEO, e-mail, social media, etc. Essentially the same tools as with any B2B firm, however what I will advise is that you outline a profile of the type of firm you want to target.  This is based on their spending power, industry, consumer needs, etc.  Once you do this, you'd have a basic idea on how to market to them, and tailor your marketing communications to meet them.    Embed Quote
