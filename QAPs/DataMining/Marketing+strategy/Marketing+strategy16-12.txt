★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
Oh my gosh that's the least of it.  Marketing and public relations are all about manipulating you subconsciously to achieve whatever objective the advertiser has in mind.  You have no idea how much the public is manipulated by advertising and public relations unless you've been in the field.    Embed Quote
