★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
That's interesting. I was told by a UK bookseller that charging £9.99 means that the salesperson receiving the payment is forced to open the till/cash register and give the customer their 1p change. The salesperson is therefore stopped from pocketing the proffered £10! (Unless, of course, they have a pocket full of 1p pieces primed and ready to give as change to customers.)    Embed Quote
