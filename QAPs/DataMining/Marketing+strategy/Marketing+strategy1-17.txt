★What are the best iPhone app marketing strategies?Besides of P.R. (Mashable, RRW, etc.), review sites, and fortuitously getting featured in iTunes.
Beyond the basic marketing strategies to get initial downloads, you should focus on keeping your users engaged.  This can mean keeping the app regularly updated (at least once per month) with new features, making sure it has constantly updating free content, or adding additional in-app purchase content (especially if the app is a game for instance). Another thing to do is to include Push Notifications in the app itself.  I'm biased here because I'm the founder of a company that provides push-based engagement tools for app marketers ( http://pushspring.com ) but we're seeing shockingly high engagement and retention rates with the first few customers we've been working with.    Embed Quote
