★What are the most important marketing strategies for a web startup?We're an engineering focused team and need some advice on how to market our startup thinkpanda.com
Most opportunities are 99% scams. However the biggest money is on the  internet guys – look at the most popular companies in the world…(Apple,  Amazon, Etc.) All these strategies are focused around “internet marketing” – which is  CLEARLY the most profitable way to make a full-time income online. You  just have to no where to start. When I first started (less than a year ago) there was so much  information out there – that I literally could NOT decide where to  start. It was so overwhelming, but luckily I signed up for PJ Gahagan’s  coaching program, and needless to say my momentum is ridiculous right  now – and I’m no longer working a day-job. (So long students! Sorry not  sorry!) Internet Marketing is “business of a new generation” and that’s why I  like PJ so much. He’s only 21 years old and this kid is a MASTER at  attraction, and he’s making big money do it. (although he’s a little  crazy, lol) You can check him out here: AP Plan Launch - AFFILIO LABS    Embed Quote
