★What is a good content marketing strategy for a digital agency?
Write different types of Content to show your expertise. Tips and Advice, Industry News (which can go either the Content Marketing route or the general Marketing route) and blog style articles should help. Use every medium available to get in front of your target audience too. Social Media and your site is great but "some" article marketing sites are useful as are News Aggregators and RSS Aggregators.    Embed Quote
