★What is a good content marketing strategy for a digital agency?
I like Gabriel's advice about writing different types of content. Reaching out and getting the attention of your audience at all stages of the sales funnel is important, and creating and tailoring different types of content to meet their needs is important. But in the end, the most important thing is to deeply study your target audience, work hand-in-hand with your sales team, and track absolutely everything you do with analytics.
