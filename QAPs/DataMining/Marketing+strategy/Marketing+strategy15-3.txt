★Marketing strategies for restaurants?
Focus on doing the small things very well. Spelling, for example, is immensely important. But in all seriousness, put the focus on the food, the story, the people you serve. We're living in an increasingly image-centric society. And people love seeing pictures of food (especially during the three main times of day when they get hungry!) Use that to your advantage. Create some social media accounts and post photos of your cuisine, the cooking process, and even some special moments in your restaurant. If you want to take this to the next level, start thinking about contests, giveaways, and the like that happen exclusively through social media (ex. "Like this photo and be entered for a chance at $25 this weekend / then choose one of those accounts who liked it.) There's so many possibilities with social media and it makes the most sense since social sharing is becoming a central component of the food industry. So is being found online, so an SEO strategy should be something to keep on your radar as well. That, and staying attune to the reviews people write online. Honestly if you made a point to address every complaint on review sites with a sincere social media post showing you acknowledge the complaint (provided it is valid of course) and aim to overdeliver to patrons, surprising them when possible, that will go a long way towards building your organization a solid reputation online. Then from there, leveraging that awesome reputation to take on new cities and culinary opportunities. Best, Vincent Ferrer    Embed Quote
