★What is the abc of Android app marketing strategy?What are the basic things about android apps marketing that every developer should know. What are the bare basic things that a developer can do to promote his apps...
I worked with a mobile developer who specialised with paid mobile apps on Google Play. That experience taught me a lot, even the duration of working with him was just a few weeks. He would design the app, market it, and make sure it was awesome. Here are the things he used to do: Create Pages on Google+, Fb, Twitter: Creating a page on these three social media sites 3 weeks before app launch. Send emails to people who might be interested from his email list to take a look at pages. Create a Blogspot Blog:  At the same time, create a .blogspot blog and set it up completely. Set up a signup form for interested users to subscribe to. Send out frequent posts about the app. This is useful if you are creating a series of apps like "The Awesome Series", "Smart Games", etc. This blogspot blog will be your homepage. Spend $15-20 on targeted AdWords Try getting the app reviewed on Review sites. Create a promotional video. If you don't have time/skill required to create videos on your own try Wideo - Make animated online videos free. Their costs are okay. Consider buying adspots on Mobile sites at Buy Ads | BuySellAds Try including your app in Quora answers. Consider LinkedIn ads. I love the ads because they send interested users, who convert very well. They, however, cost a LOT! Try small blog owners, they might do your review for free in exchange for a premium app given to them for free...    Embed Quote
