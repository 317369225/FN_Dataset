★What are the steps to building content marketing strategy?
Take a step back. Ask the right question about your audience: what are they looking for? How do they like to consume content? what information interests them? Then start to make content (aim to be valuable to your audience, not to sell) and MEASURE what works and what doesn't. Rinse and repeat. We recently interviewed content marketing experts who told us across the board that the ability to measure and adapt was the most important piece of effective content marketing.
