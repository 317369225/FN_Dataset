★What are the highest-impact inbound marketing strategies for SaaS companies?A lot of time can be spent on inbound marketing (e.g., writing blog posts, conducting webinars, building a Twitter following, etc.). What are the highest ROI activities for an early-stage SaaS company to be involved in?
You need to think laterally. Start by creating persona for the people involved in selection your SaaS offering. From there, try to think about the decision making proces for each of those persona, constructing a user journey that maps along the purchase funnel. At awareness stages, try to think of the questions that each of your persona would have, then do this throughout the purchase funnel toward purchase. This is creating a user journey. Try not to do too much to soon. Build up your journeys incrementally, but do make sure that your content answers user questions. Avoid product pushes. People are lookiing for solutions to their issues. Build this up incrementally overtime, evaluating how peope respond to the content you produce, building up more of what people like, and steering clear of content that gets little engagement. Measure and mesure some more. Use Agile Marketing to do this in short iterations. Ideation, develop content, measure performance. Learn from this and onto next iteration. Build this up over time. Try to speak to users and get their insights - even get your friend to try out your content and see how much they get to understand about your SaaS solution from your website. Build over time. Inbound is a long term strategy and investment, not a quick win.    Embed Quote
