★What are good websites about marketing strategy?
It will very heavily depend on what you're marketing, at what level and what your marketing mix is. For instance, www.smartpassiveincome.com might be a good place to start if you're doing Internet marketing only, for your own business, but it will be less relevant for larger corporations. Another helpful one for Internet marketing is www.gainhigherground.com Again, it will very much depend on your market/product and your needs.    Embed Quote
