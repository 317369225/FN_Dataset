★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
Because people are falliable and irrational. Their rational mind equates the two prices as one which is correct. The irrational (subjective non analytic) mind determines that 9.99 is less expensive and materially less expensive. The purchasing decision involves both the these components hence 9.99 selld better. Only people that irrationally delude themselves believe they are completely rational. Most if not all decisions are not completely rational. This practice is widespread so their is emperical data supporting the efficacy of this pricing mechanism.    Embed Quote
