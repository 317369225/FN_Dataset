★What are the KPIs to evaluate a successful marketing strategy?we are prepairing to deploy a marketing strategy and need KPIs to evaluate it?
For any web marketing strategy, the following is the basis of measurement metrics (KPIs): Lead Generating Source: No. of Ad displays, organic search results, etc. Landing page metrics: Unique visitors, Page views, Time on Site, Bounce Rate, etc. Behavior Metric: Trial offer, PDF Download, 'Like/Comment', etc. Engagement Metric: Retweet, mention, share (everything social) Converison Metric: % of conversions (ROI based). Then there is the trend line for the same over the execution period of the activity, its various versions (A/B testings, etc.) These will vary slightly depending on the components of your strategy. The whole game is continuous optimization at each stage. This is all purely web based. In case of offline interaction there can be an offline metric too to top it off with objective orientation. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
