★What is the most underutilized marketing strategy for consumer internet startup companies?
There are a lot of answers to this question. What I see most often is probably a failure to get the company's positioning and messaging clearly developed & defined. Without that it's nearly impossible to effectively implement most marketing strategies that would garner attention for your newco. There's so much noise out there that you need to be truly clear on your message, your offer, and your value to your consumer.    Embed Quote
