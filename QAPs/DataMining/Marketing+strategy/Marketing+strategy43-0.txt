★What is Zappos' marketing strategy?They focus on SEM, I'd like to know their detail marketing strategy.
Zappos marketing strategy is customer experience and Word of Mouth.   Like most success stories, their marketing strategy is their business strategy. Zappos was successful because it redefined online shoe buying to make it a better experience: - Free shipping and free returns, overnight - Exemplary customer service that starts with a fun employee culture and empowering phone reps to do whatever it takes to make customers happy - Very broad selection of shoes - More pictures and videos for every shoe   The result is that customers have a shopping experience beyond their expectations, a few amazing stories of customer service (like spending 10 hours with a customer on the phone) that become legends and are picked up by the press, shared in social media and told from customers to customer.   The result is customer loyalty and an army of customer evangelists.   For more check the founder's book: Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose: Tony Hsieh: 9780446576222: Amazon.com: Books   Example of story: Company Keeps Customer On Call For Over 10 Hours    Embed Quote
