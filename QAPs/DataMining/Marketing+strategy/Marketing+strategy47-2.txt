★What are some effective B2B Marketing strategies to target SMBs?My objective is to sell them software products. I have only small budgets allocated for marketing. Most of my clients are based in my city.
Inbound marketing - thought leadership, content marketing, content distribution - is by far the most effective marketing method in the medium to long term but as I assume it is necessary to pay the bills in the short term then a more aggressive technique to get your business known and build credibility is required in which case Email marketing and a limited PPC campaign can be highly effective. When marketing to a local customer base a effective Google+ Local listing and a locally optimised website are a must. Local link building and networking are also important.
