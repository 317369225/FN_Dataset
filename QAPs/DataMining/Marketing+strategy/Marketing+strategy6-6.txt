★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
One of the most fundamentally misunderstood marketing axioms is: Ask your customers what they want. Henry Ford famously quipped that if he had asked customers what they wanted, they would have said, “a faster horse.” Steve Jobs is quoted “You can't just ask customers what  they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it  built, they'll want something new.” What these famous quotes belie is that by asking your customers what they want you should be getting a deep understanding of WHY they want it. Addressing the reasons why people want what they want is a playing field where you can be truly be unique, creative and disruptive as both Ford and Jobs did.    Embed Quote
