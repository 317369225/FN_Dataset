★What are some great LinkedIn content marketing strategies?
It is worth revisiting this question now in the early part of a new year, since content marketing on LinkedIn has only become more common and more necessary. So here are some stats and tips: 91% of LinkedIn content consumers are professionals looking for professionally relevant information and industry insights that:  1. Enhances knowledge 2. Facilitates networking (is valuable enough to share with colleagues and thought-provoking enough to spark conversation) 3. Boosts their reputation in the industry (improves their job skills or creates interest). It is probably pretty clear at this point that you really need to know who your target audience is. I cannot stress enough how important that is. How can you provide relevant, valuable information is you don't know who you're talking to? So, once you hammer out your "Buyer Persona" or "ideal customer" (some guidelines in my article here: Critical Questions to Ask in Building Your Buyer Persona), you can create a content strategy that meets the 3 criteria for LinkedIn content above as relevant to your target audience. Reaching your target audience with your content is another task: think about what LinkedIn groups your target audience is likely to be a part of. Possibly industry related groups, educational/alumni groups, etc. and post your content in these groups. When you post content, garner feedback and interaction by asking your audience to share their thoughts, experiences, etc. and be responsive. Finally, put the finishing touches on your LinkedIn company profile or personal profile if you're a sole practitioner/small business owner.
