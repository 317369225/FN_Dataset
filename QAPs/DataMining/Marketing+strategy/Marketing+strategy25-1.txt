★Why are printed brochures considered an effective marketing strategy?What's the reason why you can consider printing brochures as effective marketing strategy?
It is because some members of your target audience like the printed form. It depends on what message you are promoting, positioning, building awareness around and what kind of response you are expecting.  Printed brochures are just one more touch point in a long list of options you can use to get your message across. Some members of the target audience prefer print to 'soft' media.  They see it as implying substance (i.e. higher value).  They don't like to read off the screen.  They won't bother to print themselves.  It allows you to control the form of the message presentation very precisely. If you are including a 'call to action' like a coupon or a voucher, printed brochures can be an effective vehicle to fit into the right kind of social engineering it takes to get the audience to react the way you want. In some markets they are just expected - so you do it because it is easier than trying to change the communication paradigm.    Embed Quote
