★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
Don't exist arbitrarily. Attempt to reach the crucial stats, such as conversion rate, as quickly as possible. This allows you to calculate how much proverbial runway you have, and approximately, what your CPA is, and see further down the tunnel. Once you have this established with delta change under 12% or so, you can then start throwing traffic at your sales funnel. If you start with adcenter for example, and are seeing ROI, do remember you can always port a campaign over to other similar channels, in this case - Google Adwords, with relatively the same conversion rate. Your costs will be higher, but this also gives you a fall back. At this point, this is when many changes can simultaneously be made to product, always attempting to make conversion rate higher. Worst case scenario is you still have version A to fall back on. Other crucial KPI's such as CLTV will come later, but you need to establish important metrics lower down the funnel first. This is also known as a bottom-up approach, and works great in finding product/market fit before investing much more resources.    Embed Quote
