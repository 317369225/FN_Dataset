★How should I begin research on a content marketing strategy?
The most important step in a content marketing strategy is choosing who you want to be reading your content and defining the content's purpose around that. Once you have identified your target audience and content purpose, researching content ideas, keywords, promotion channels all becomes much easier and straightforward. Ask yourself why you are using content marketing. Determine the end goal for your content and your business: Do you want to attract new visitors, leads and sales? Do you want to build brand awareness and trust? Do you want to increase customer loyalty and grow advocacy?These are all good reasons for why you are investing in content marketing. But I challenge you to think one level deeper and go beyond the outcome. Define your content purpose by answering these three questions: Why are you investing in content marketing? Why does your audience want to read your content? What value does your audience get out of your content? The point here is that you need a clear content purpose or you risk  writing about content that attracts the wrong audience. If you want to  use content to grow your business, you need to write content your ideal  customers will love.
