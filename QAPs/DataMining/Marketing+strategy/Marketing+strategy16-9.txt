★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
Why should they have reputational damage? Have you ever purchased an item priced at $9.99 and been charged anything but precisely $9.99 plus sales tax? If not, then where is the deception? In order for there to be deception someone must be lying to you. But they are, in fact, charging you exactly $9.99 just as they advertise on the price sticker.    Embed Quote
