★What is the most underutilized marketing strategy for consumer internet startup companies?
1) SEO - Totally worth the investment, because free traffic rocks. The longer you can hold off on having to pay for advertising, the better. 2) Conversion Optimization - Once you actually have enough traffic to play with, start testing and making your site better.  Test creating a landing page for your advertising or copy/messaging in emails.  Everybody loves testing buttons - color, size, copy, etc.  I've always found testing layout and pared-down design/page size to be highly impactful. 3) Email - If you've got a mailing list, do something with it.  That does not mean you should spam the shit out of it. But creating meaningful segments and targeting them differently is a great way to progress people through the funnel. For example, users who signed up and never logged onto the site again are very different from your power users who average 3 visits a month.  Why not show them different offers?  Brand/positioning is important, but it's a hard place to start if people have never heard of you and don't know how to find you yet.  If you've got a compelling story with a unique angle, I've seen PR work wonders. It basically feeds back into the SEO strategy by getting your name and links to you out there.    Embed Quote
