A lot of people on this thread have already covered acquisition strategies and you can pick and choose what's going to work for you and what's not. I won't bother with those. I will point out, however that marketing doesn't end when people show up at the front door. Things to think about.... Conversion: How well are you converting visitors to your site? Make sure that you dedicate the engineering resources to be able to test different registration flows. A-B testing at an absolute minimum, multivariate would be even better. Test messaging, look and feel.... hell, even your value proposition. You are startup, so you need to be able to adapt to what the market wants even if you haven't built that yet. Upsell: This dovetails nicely with what I was saying about you value proposition. Make sure you have on and it's compelling. Make sure your deliver it over an over and over to your users until they get it and become customers. Make sure that you provide on your promise to your users. Retention: You have customers, don't forget to market to them! E-mail newsletter, blog posts, loyalty programs... these are the tactics that you might employ to keep your customers happy. You will be constantly competing with other sites and other activities for your customers time and attention. Don't forget them once they hop onboard. Happy customers who spread the word virally are a great acquisition tool... just make sure you still market to them.    Embed Quote
