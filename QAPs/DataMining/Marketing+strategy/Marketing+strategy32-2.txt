★Web Marketing: How do I create a digital marketing strategy?What do you suggest as a process?
I'm working on a digital strategy at the moment and I agree with much of what Samir and Tim both say.   But I'd add 1 step before starting to put together the strategy and right after understanding your business and overall marketing goals is an analysis of the competition and what's going on around your brand.   Today the marketing competition is very high and the bars in digital are starting to grow so I'd look at what's going on outside your brand and find where you want to position your brand and what channels work best with your target.   The other thing I find very important when creating a digital strategy is keeping in mind the ecosystem. Each channel has a purpose but in the end, they're all interconnected and influence each other. So there should be 1 big idea that is communicated across all platforms.   hope that helps!    Embed Quote
