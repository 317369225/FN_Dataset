★What are some recommended content marketing strategies for beginners?
I think the best thing to remember is that content isn't king: CONVERSATION is. Content is meant to either: STIMULATE conversation (either to get a person to contact a salesperson or get someone to share it because THEY want to talk about it with others) OR SIMULATE conversation. If someone has a question that they type into search (questions are how many people start convos, after all) then make sure your content provides those answers so that it can be found by that curious (potential) buyer. Thinking of all those questions that people may ask along their path to purchase is a great way to do this. If you don't know what they ask, involve your salespeople and get them to tell you the typical questions they hear. If more than one person wonders something about your industry or company, broadcast it!    Embed Quote
