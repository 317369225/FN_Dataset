★How important is content in a digital marketing strategy?
Content is an absolutely critical part of any digital marketing strategy. As others have stated, content is an essential driver across marketing channels and can support many different goals, from establishing thought leadership, to building brand awareness, to boosting SEO, and others. A lot of comments here focused on the importance of relevancy when delivering content, and I could not agree more. I would also prioritize timeliness. What good is a company’s content to an audience—or to the company itself—if it’s unrelatable and out-of-date? One of the best ways to incorporate relevant, timely content into a digital marketing strategy is through the growing practice of content curation—which means finding, organizing and sharing online content.   To see content curation in action, or to learn more about how it helps marketers, best practices and adoption rates, check out my company’s blog, www.contentcurationmarketing.com and the resources page of our website, http://www.getcurata.com/resourc.... I especially recommend the 5 Simple Steps to Becoming a Content Curation Rockstar ebook for anyone getting up to speed on curation.    Embed Quote
