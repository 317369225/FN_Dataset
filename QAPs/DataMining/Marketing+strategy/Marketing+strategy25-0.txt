I believe that it's because of what brochures can contain. Brochures give a good avenue for businesses to fully showcase what their business can do. It gives enough space for information dissemination and as well as promotion. That's basically the reason why we should be very careful when it comes to designing our marketing brochures. It can either generate sales or turn down our business.
