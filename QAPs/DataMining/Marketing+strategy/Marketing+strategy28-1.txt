★How should I begin research on a content marketing strategy?
The first thing to keep in mind is that you want a diversified content strategy: a mix of SEO content linkable assets (whitepapers, infographics) [stuff you can get links from] product/service pages PRFor your content strategy, the first thing you want to do is identify your top pages, this can be done in two ways  a) a strongest subpages tool  b) top trafficked landing pages in organic search after you've written content for your most powerful pages make sure you have catagory, subcatagory, and product pages covered. These are the basics. Beyond that you want to start thinking about linkable assets. Find research in your space and create some infographic link bait and promote it. Write a whitepaper yourself and promote it. Create a blog in conjunction with a social media strategy and become a thought leader in your space. In conclusion, there are two basic steps to this: basic content [catagory/subcatagory/product] and linkable assets + social. Don't put the carriage before the cart - make sure the first foundational one is done before the second.    Embed Quote
