★What is a good content marketing strategy for a digital agency?
Be totally (dangerously) transparent. We ran a 100% transparent study revealing all of the tidbits and success or failure of one of our own campaigns. As we can seldom share this level of detail from our clients' own campaigns, we thought we would apply that logic to one of our own. The idea was to roll out the campaign, with a set of very tough goals (opens, form-fills, comments, etc.) and then run a parallel campaign documenting our performance to those goals, and related observations. The campaign to be studied was an eBook we call "The B2B Marketing Manifesto", which is here: The B2B Marketing Manifesto The campaign that revealed the performance of the Manifesto campaign was appropriately titled "Project Open Kimono", which is here: Project Open Kimono I'm not saying that this is THE way to do it. It's one way to do it, but it was highly successful. Marketers absolutely loved it, and it led to a pile of leads (which keep flowing in).    Embed Quote
