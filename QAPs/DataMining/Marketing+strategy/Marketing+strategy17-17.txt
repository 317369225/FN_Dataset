★What's the best way to develop and execute an online marketing strategy?A small local business wants to take its marketing efforts digital. They want a three-pronged attack: Blog, Bi-weekly email, Facebook. How do you sell your advertising space and at what price ?
Before you jump into the tone of your social media presence, you must first decide on the company's holistic message they want to convey. Are they trying to be a thought leader in their industry? Are they trying to be a hub for consumers to connect with professionals? Are they trying to simply keep their audience updated on their latest products? The tonality of your social media presence should reflect your responses to questions like those. As far as your "multi-pronged" approach, I would recommend using any medium that adequately expresses the overall message of your marketing. In an ever-growing digital marketing ecosystem, you might find yourself using more platforms than just 3. A balance has to be made between sharing relevant content and sharing a volume of content. Something that can help your approach to this dilemma is content curation. Content curation software can help you find, organize, and share the most relevant content online regarding your industry. Not only will your message be stronger and more direct, but it will be quicker to get it out to more social media channels.  If you want to know more about how you can become a content curation rock star, download our eBook: http://www.curata.com/resources/...    Embed Quote
