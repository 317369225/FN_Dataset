★Marketing strategies for restaurants?
A few things can help - including 1) Google AdWords - using a local 5 mile radius from your restaurant, 2) Local Zip Code Postcard Mailers are cost effective for getting the word out to the neighborhood and 3) MoneyMailers or ValPak with a good coupon - they're always local Zip focused and low-cost.  But be sure to have a GOOD coupon to really reel 'em in.  Entrepreneur Consultant.    Embed Quote
