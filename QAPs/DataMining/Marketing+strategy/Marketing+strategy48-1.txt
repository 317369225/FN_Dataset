★What marketing strategies power the most viral Facebook apps?How has the news feed algorithm evolved to minimize "spam," e.g. 10/day limit? What tactics are having the most success, e.g. share v. invite, fan pages, user award competition?
Some points are very important and must be at the heart of your app idea : - Daily activity (e.g. Daily sweepstakes ...) in order to engage people everyday if your app is set up for a limited time (new question everyday for a contest ...) - Notifications : your app must use Facebook notifications to remind people if they are inactive, if a new "action" is possible (e.g. A new question...) - Open Graph : if you want to have good results, you have to use the open graph in order to engage new audience. The OG must be at the heart of your strategy as it can double your audience. - Share, invite, direct message ... Your app must be viral and make people willing to share it. For example, in a sweepstake, don't hesitate to create something like "invite your friends in order to have more chances" - Cross platform in a smart way : you have to allow multiple access to your app, promo ... but in a consistent way (add some differences, new contents etc) and by choosing coherent networks    Embed Quote
