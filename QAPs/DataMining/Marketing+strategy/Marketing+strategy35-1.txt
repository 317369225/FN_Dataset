★What is the difference between Japanese marketing strategies and Indian marketing strategies?
Yes it depends on what kind of product you are putting in the market i.e. 1. "NewsPapers" you can take "Dainik Baskar" as an example because before entering in the market they had done 3-4 month of market analysis by approaching the user directly and then after analysis of the data, they launched the product and they got huge response. 2. "Kolaveri Di" song is a very good example of digital viral marketing. 3. "Gramin Bank " kind of a concept was never used before so initially response was low but once the officials started promoting the benifits of it to the farmers on a large scale, thinks started getting better and better. In comparison with Japanese market strategies and Indian Marketing Strategies , I think it mainly depends on the customers take examples of online shopping sites "Ali Baba" and "Amazon" in Japan. "AliBaba" is a local shopping site in Japan so understand the requirement of the people but "Amazon" failed to understand the requirement because of this received a very bad response. It can be the case "FlipKart" and "Amazon" in India !!! well it depends on the next move by these two firms. :-D    Embed Quote
