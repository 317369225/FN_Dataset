★How should I begin research on a content marketing strategy?
Content marketing is an essential part of SEO today as well as a great way to create engagement and generate leads. Before you lay down a strategy you should first do some research into your target audience, which may not be who you think it is. Understand your customers and potential customers and then think about which types of customers you're trying to reach with your content. Also make sure you carefully measure your investment (time, resource, etc.) so that you can better measure ROI when you get under-way.
