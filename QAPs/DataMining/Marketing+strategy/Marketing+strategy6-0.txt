★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
Don't be afraid to scare away what are perceived as 'potential' users. If you try to make something for everyone, you'll end up appealing to no one. Or, as Sally Hogshead puts it in her book Fascinate: "if you're not generating a negative reaction from someone, you're not fascinating anyone." You don't have to be for everyone immediately. Start with focus, and then broaden later. (Facebook once was for students at specific universities, but now even moms, dads and grandparents are on it)    Embed Quote
