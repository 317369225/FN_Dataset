★What are the steps to building content marketing strategy?
Here's how I do content marketing: 1. Start from what I need to sell Let's say I want to sell my plugin - http://www.tweetdis.com/ I need to think of what my potential customers are interested in. That plugin creates "tweetable quotes" within articles, so my potential customers should be interested in: "Blogging"; "Social Media Marketing"; and specifically in "Twitter Marketing". 2. Do keyword research Once I have decided with the broad topics that I need to target, I will do content research to come up with a few dozen highly targeted keywords, that my potential customers might search in Google. In the case of my TweetDis plugin, the keywords would be something like this: "how to get traffic from Twitter"; "how to create tweetable quotes"; "how to make visitors tweet". 3. Plan my articles So now I have topics and exact keywords that I need to cover. I plan my writing based on which articles I'd like to publish first and which ones I'll save for later. Depending on the topic, I may write short simple articles or huge ones. I usually make a decision after reading a few articles that are already out there on this topic. My job is to write something better. Be it a 500-word post, or a 7000-word monstrous guide. Want to learn how to write killer articles?
