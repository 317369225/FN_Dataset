★What are the best inbound marketing strategies?
I would disagree with comments made about focussing on your sales process. Way too many business take an internal "sales centric" approach to their marketing. You are NOT trying to mirror your sales process, you are trying to mirror your purchaser's Buying Process. Once you understand how people buy goods or services you can map marketing tactics and content based on the phase that they are at. Your whole marketing strategy should be based around helping them to make the decisions they need to make at key points in that process. To pick up on an earlier answer, if you know your audience and you know their buying process then you will know which content you can gate and which you shouldn't.    Embed Quote
