★Why don't people get upset by clearly deceptive marketing strategies like set a price $9.99 instead of $10?Shouldn't companies have a reputational damage by using these techniques?
Because it's not deceptive, it's transparently manipulative, and it's transparently manipulative in a way that boosts our positive feelings.  If we should get mad about that, we should get mad at each other for saying Please and May I.    Embed Quote
