★What's the best way to develop and execute an online marketing strategy?A small local business wants to take its marketing efforts digital. They want a three-pronged attack: Blog, Bi-weekly email, Facebook. How do you sell your advertising space and at what price ?
There could be a number of ways to go about it, and I'm sure this thread will soon be full of them.  As a starting point, a friendly conversational tone is usually the best for social media and online tactics. People are in those outlets to be social, hence the name. If they can sense that you're selling to them, it'll immediately come off as spam. Instead, try posting a few blog posts related to their interests. Maybe a weekly email highlighting some of the cool stuff the small business is doing, and not necessarily pounding with deals. That way you're rapidly increasing brand awareness in a non intrusive way, which in turn, will cause an embrace when you do send out an awesome rare deal the small business may want to start promoting. Always remember to keep it visual, too. The internet is about engaging visual content now such as infographics. Make sure the weekly emails have a nice design to them. Include pictures and videos in your blog. Customers love seeing the video my company produces for my small business clients because of the face and level of personality it gives to the business. As a final point, I'd say prioritize the blog. Each post will take time to write, and its pretty much a mini look into the ideas and thoughts of the company. When people visit your site, they want to see you know what you're talking about. And, ultimately, the blog is going to increase your ranking in the Google searches. So, make sure its good.
