★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
If you think of "strategy" as meaning "how you are going to achieve an objective" it makes it a bit clearer.  For startups I have found the biggest challenge often comes from not having identified a 1. target customer and 2. a product/technology/service benefit that the Company is providing in a 3. target customer meaningfully differentiated manner that solves 4. real painpoint in suffient to cause same customer to part with cash.  Usually there is a product, that may solve a problem, that has potential customers and know one has spoken to customer yet and asked "would you buy this?"    Start with the customers, find out what they need, find out what they would pay for and then do it.    Embed Quote
