★What are the best marketing strategies that start ups could learn and execute?
My favorite answer so far is one from Mrs. Krumb above in explaining the virtues of good content: I believe content is very important especially when it comes to SEO and gaining good ranking on search engines.  However you can provide content in other ways once you've gained a following such as in a Twitter feed, Facebook posts or one of the most effective: an Email list. Enter AWeber Email Marketing. Open up an account with AWeber and you have the ability to automate your content sharing ability by programming a series of emails to be sent to your subscribers in a predetermined schedule. This is the type of leverage and freedom which many successful online businesses are built upon. To learn more about this important application, visit http://yourfuture.aweber.com    Embed Quote
