As for some resources, there are several books here: Competitive Intelligence Reference Books │ Fuld + Company Amazon.com: competitive intelligence: Books competitive intelligence - Google Search Several competitive intelligence (CI) web-based tools today are free to use. I work with a company, Follow.net Competitive Intelligence Software, and that is a perfect example of a free-to-use tool (limited account) that allows you to do competitive intelligence. You can open an account for free, even though you have the choice to more advanced paid plans, as well. The web-based tool provides data in regards to: Amount of traffic Affiliate network SEO and SEM information Display advertising Contextual advertising Demographics statistics Social media mentions: Twitter Mentions from other websites WhoIs information Reverse lookup And also competitors’ website names Closely monitoring several sites takes a lot of work, but Follow can be set up in a way you’ll be notified when the sites you want to monitor do anything new online. As I said, there is a free version you can download and install immediately.
