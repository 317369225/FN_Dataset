What are some sources of competitive intelligence?
If you're looking for CI tools, I recently joined a startup called Owler that's building a great solution for this. It's also free, so it's perfect to start experimenting with. It tracks the majority of things Kalie Moore mentioned including competitor news, social media, funding, acquisitions, PR and more. The site is http://www.owler.com Full disclosure: I work for Owler and I'd be happy to answer any other questions you have.    Embed Quote
