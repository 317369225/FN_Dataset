When and how to implement competitive intelligence in a startup?
Implementing and tracking CI can be a full time job, but luckily with there are a couple of SaaS tools on the market that can really help you out. I've been working with Rivalfox.com, a competitive intelligence, a CI startup in Berlin. Basically, all you have to do is enter in your competitors' domain names and Rivalfox notifies you about every change on your competitors’ websites including changes in pricing or terms of service. It also tracks where and when you competitors are mentioned in the press, and monitors critical traffic statistics like Country Rank, Global Rank, Traffic Trends, Page Views per user, Backlinks, Website Reputation, and Google Performance in addition to social media. The dashboard is user-friendly and help you pay attention to trends. While I agree with Arthur that most startups should have been handling CI before launch, CI becomes especially critical when expanding internationally.
