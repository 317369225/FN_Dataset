When and how to implement competitive intelligence in a startup?
If we are talking about an e-commerce startup, you should start collecting information about your environment from day one to keep up with the competition. One of the most important element you should track is your competitor's pricing. Particularly in price elastic markets lack of competitive intelligence could finish your business before it is even started.
