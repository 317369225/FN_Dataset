What is the difference between "industrial espionage" and "competitive intelligence"?
While I agree with Simon and Brandon who've already posted, I've always felt that the difference is much more cloudy and not as cut and dry. Having worked in Competitive Intelligence for several years, I have been faced with this question several times, with no direct answer. To me, Competitive Intelligence is the function/field of study where a company researches its market and competition, however, it can also include specific instances of Industrial Espionage. Case in point, at one of my jobs, I was researching my competition online, and just happened across a presentation deck (uploaded publicly to slideshare/scribd don't remember which) in which the marketing manager at my main competitor firm outlined a comprehensive plan for a highly sensitive product just about to launch. Since it was public, most people wouldn't hesitate to access and use this information and wouldn't call it industrial espionage, rather they would call it good fortune and stupidity on the part of the competitor. However, after several emails and phone calls, it became known to me that the particular marketing manager at my competitor's firm who had done this, had done it out of spite right after being fired from his job. Now does this change the situation? Is it now morally wrong for me to use that presentation to our advantage? Where do you draw the line in this case. This is just but one small example of where the situation within corporate competitive intelligence where it is hard to differentiate between legit and dodgy means to access information on competitors. It's a moral dilemma rather than being an ethical or generally accepted decision. Each person must draw their own line.    Embed Quote
