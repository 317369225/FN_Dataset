What are the best books (in English) on competitive intelligence analysis?
There's no point in listing Michael Porter since almost all intelligence work stems from his original insights. In the past 20 years, I have a few favorites: Competitors by Liam Fahey - His is the best analytical summary of competitor behavior since Porter, a complete treatment of corporate behavior with a broader view of what competition means. This work may not survive the post-modern era of competition when countries own companies and business models crumbles, but you cannot ignore this work. Analysis without Paralysis by Babette Benssoussan and Craig Fleisher - A terrific master class on analysis instead of mere data collection, nobody is more knowledgeable or more readable than Bensoussan and Fleisher. The Secret Language of Competitive Intelligence by Leonard Fuld - He's written a bunch of books, but Fuld's last major publication really summed up what the field has become in two decades, largely due to Fuld's own innovations. Colloquial, expert, and relevant, if you want to know how and why to use CI in an organization context, you must read this book.    Embed Quote
