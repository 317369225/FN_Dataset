Most online tools are as well. Since you're starting a new job I'm guessing you want a tool that you'll need budget approval for. I recently joined a startup called Owler that's building a solution for this exact problem. It's also free, so it's perfect to start experimenting with. It tracks competitor news, social media, funding, acquisitions, PR and more.
