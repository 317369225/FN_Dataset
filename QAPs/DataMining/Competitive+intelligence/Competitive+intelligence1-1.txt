We right a ton about competitive intelligence and best practices at Competitor Analysis for better Market Intelligence. For a good start I'd check out Competitive Intelligence and the Importance of Benchmarking, Competitive Intelligence: Five Strategies You Must Monitor and Why They Matter To Your Bottom Line, Top Five Ways Competitive Intelligence Can Rock Your Business Development Strategy - The Rivalfox Competitor Intelligence Blog.
