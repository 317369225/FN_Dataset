Competitive Intelligence: How do you keep track of market news and competitors?
A lot of the tools are good. Your choice should depend on your budget and specific services are looking for. Below are few that I have experimented with: 1- Google Alerts (or Google Trends): Free but basic. 2- Factiva (DowJones product): Gathering information from more than 370 continuously updating newswires, more than 1500 newspapers and more than 3200 trade journals and industry publications. 3- Compete (online competitor tracker, limited but good fit for online small businesses) 4- RivalFox (SaaS tracking software, popular in Europe) 5- HitWise (Experian product) This is one of the best enterprise tools, it provides deep analytical dashboards not only about competition but about online consumer behavior. Retailers love this tool. 6- Networking, networking, networking. The most valuable information is obtained when it is not easily available. The more you expose an information, the more it loses its value. Almost all existing softwares are great secondary intelligence tools better used for market news, any real-time tool will do the job here. For customized information about competition, only real people & human networks can get you the information advantage and market trends. Expert networks partially solve this problem but they are usually expensive and limited to consulting. Well, I gotta do a soft sell here ;) There is is something new that we are building >>  http://www.zcompetitiveintellige... Private beta users welcome!    Embed Quote
