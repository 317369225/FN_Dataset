What are the best books (in English) on competitive intelligence analysis?
In addition to Arthur Weiss' suggestion: Strategic and Competitive Analysis: Methods and Techniques for Analyzing Business by Craig S. Fleisher & Babette Bensoussan, I would also include their later book on analysis tools entitled Business and Competitive Analysis. For an easier read on competitive analysis tools, I recommend The Analyst's Cookbook by Kristan J. Wheaton and students at Mercyhurst College.    Embed Quote
