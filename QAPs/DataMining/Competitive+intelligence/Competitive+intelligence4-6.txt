What is the difference between "industrial espionage" and "competitive intelligence"?
Industrial espionage is a very narrow activity, specifically using illegal means to acquire information. CI is a much broader activity, that goes beyond data collection to analysis and communication. CI professionals (nearly) universally reject espionage as a legitimate tool (see: http://bit.ly/a8OH60). They generally assert that there's more than enough information legally and readily available to answer your intelligence question, quite often within your organisation.    Embed Quote
