When and how to implement competitive intelligence in a startup?
Competitive intelligence is important in all areas of your startup. Marketing needs to track competitor blogs, social media and press. Sales needs to monitor funding announcements, acquisitions, leadership changes and even product announcements. Typically CI is a costly endeavor if you hire consultants. I've bootstrapped a company before and I know that every penny counts. Even CI software is pretty expensive. I recently joined a startup called Owler that's building a solution for this exact problem. It's also free, so it's perfect for startups. It tracks all of the CI information I listed above and a lot more. The site is http://www.owler.com Hope that helps!    Embed Quote
