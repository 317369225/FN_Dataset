What are the best books (in English) on competitive intelligence analysis?
Competitive Intelligence analysis is really about bridging the gap between the intelligence gathered and its meaning to the business. In that regard I find that the generic business strategy books, and their frameworks (SWOT, 5 forces, BCG and GE matrix, etc.) do a good job of helping analyze the information. The Michael Porter books hence are your best bet in my opinion. Competitive Strategy, Michael Porter If you're lucky enough to be analyzing competitors in an industry where quantitative data is abundant, or look at a particulat topic for which it is (e.g. financial information on public companies) then you may want to look at industry-specific reference materials in analytical tools (for instance I use Gitman's Principles of Managerial Finance to come up with analysis ideas/angles on competitors' financials)    Embed Quote
