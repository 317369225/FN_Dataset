When and how to implement competitive intelligence in a startup?
I am not an expert on startups but would suggest that competitive intelligence will be useful for positioning your product e.g. pricing, at what customer segments others are pitching, etc. You don't want to be influenced by competitors to the extent that your product becomes a bit samey. Re: the second part of your question, you could outsource it to a member of the Association of Independent Information Professionals - their website lists members who specialize in competitive intelligence. Although you could do much of it yourself via Google, LinkedIn and other tools, many startup founders have a distorted view of the uniqueness of their offering, so you may benefit from an independent point of view. Particularly since you cite time constraints.    Embed Quote
