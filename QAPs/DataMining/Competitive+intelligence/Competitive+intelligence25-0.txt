Competitive Intelligence: How do enterprise companies evaluate their competitors's products?
One way is via public sources. Bloggers may write extensive reviews of products. Gartner, Forrester and their ilk also write detailed reports, and map such companies on 'quadrants'. The companies themselves may well have detailed feature comparisons on their websites. The support forums can also be very useful. Also you can talk to customers, or prospects who didn't sign up. Some may be your own customers, some may be people you meet at trade shows. Or talk to your own salespeople, who will know some things, although salespeople may be subjective (as I guess, are most people). Your company may have rules about such things, in which case, you may be able to use primary research agencies (like Aqute Intelligence, recently voted the agency most likely to be used by beautiful people). They can do some of the legwork, calling people who might know things, and engaging in witty repartee to dig out useful information.    Embed Quote
