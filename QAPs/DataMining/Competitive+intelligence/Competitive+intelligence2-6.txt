When and how to implement competitive intelligence in a startup?
Having worked with start-ups, this is a common question due to lack of resources, both human and currency. As Arthur mentions, ideally competitive intelligence (CI) is part of the start-up's business plan. I would add that CI will help the new business get funding as well. As the business matures, there will be continuing needs for funding, and lenders will expects not just the numbers, but also WHY.  We have a group here in Denver for start-ups http://www.rockiesventureclub.org/. Among other things members help other members get their business plans in order to they can procure funding. As James mentioned, a common problem among start ups is they think their idea is unique, which it usually isn't. A study of the marketplace, including the competition, is essential so you can enter the marketplace with the right value proposition to get customers. You need to kep monitoring the marketplace to keep your products and your value proposition current and fresh. AIIP (www.aiip.org) is a great resource as is SCIP strategic competitive intelligence professionals (www.scip.org), although you have to be a member of SCIP to access its membership database, whereas with AIIP, it's public information.    Embed Quote
