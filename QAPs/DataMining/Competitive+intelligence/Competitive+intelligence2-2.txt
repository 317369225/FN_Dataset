When and how to implement competitive intelligence in a startup?
For Start-ups, competitive intelligence is very important. Conducting competitor analysis can help you get better understanding on how to position your product but even more important, if you use a tool like http://simiarlweb.com you can see where your competitor's traffic is coming from - meaning you can focus your marketing efforts and get more users faster with possibly lower budgets.
