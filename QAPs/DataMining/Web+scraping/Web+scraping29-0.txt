★Is there a good web scraping framework in Clojure or Erlang?I.e. something like scrapy, but in Clojure instead of Python. I may end up using Scrapy, but because I will be processing results in Clojure, I'd like scrapping scripts to be in the same programming language.
There is enlive [1], it works as both a web templating library, and a screen scraping library. It basically lets you pull in HTML, and then match and extract content using CSS-style rules. But it's the easy part, what I looking for is a scheduler for those scrapping scripts, i.e. run scrapper A hourly, and scrapper B - daily.
