★What are the best web scraping open source tools?
You should check out Kimono for web scraping (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds). While it’s not open source, it is completely free. Kimono makes a bookmarklet or a Chrome extension that lets you scrape almost any page. It’s really easy to use, and you can update your data whenever you tell it to. You can get your output in JSON, CSV, and RSS formats, and Kimono will even host your data for you. We also just released a new modify results feature (Write JavaScript functions to transform your API results) which will let you operate on your data with javascript! This is great if you need to clean or modify your data before it comes back to you. I should admit that I work for Kimono, but the product is really awesome.    Embed Quote
