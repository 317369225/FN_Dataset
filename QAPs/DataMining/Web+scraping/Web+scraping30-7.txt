★What are the easiest and best web scraping tool for non-technical people?I want to collect data from a few sites and have it dumped into Excel in a semi-organized way. What tools exists for me to do this easily?
Hey. We built http://www.parsehub.com with ease of use and power in mind. It's a fantastic visual tool for all those crappy websites that it usually takes months for a technical person to build web scrapers for. It works great on dynamic, poorly designed websites - so if you have data stuck on a map, within tables or on a page that scrolls infinitely, you can use the ParseHub browser extension to click on the text/links/images you want on a page, run your project and download the data in excel format within minutes. Give us a shout and I'll show you how to use ParseHub on any website.    Embed Quote
