★What is Web Scraping?Today I was reading a random post and I found people are discussing about #WebScrapingtool, My question is: Can I use extracted data into my website? Will Google accept this ?
Yes you can use it to extract data from your website. If you're looking for a place to start, look into Python and Scrapy. You can use data for your own site, but be careful of duplicate content. Google doesn't like that. If you're listing product specs, or insurance prices, you're ok, but chunks of content will be seen as duplicate content and you'll get no SEO benefits from it.    Embed Quote
