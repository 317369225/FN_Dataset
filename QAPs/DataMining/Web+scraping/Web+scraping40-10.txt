★How can we as a poor startup follow competitor's e-commerce prices with web scraping/data mining technology?And implement them too ..
Depends on how poor you are. If you are selling shoes to run business, you probably shouldnt go there. But however, you may get a good amount of data mining done with $1000. Try building on open source like scrapy.    Embed Quote
