★How can we as a poor startup follow competitor's e-commerce prices with web scraping/data mining technology?And implement them too ..
All these fancy price intelligence tools like Wiser do is scrape fixed number of websites like Amazon, Ebay etc and charge a huge monthly fee behind it that generates a pretty report. If you are tight on budget then it's really not an option for you. It's nice if Amazon is your main competitor but chances are you are in some niche where you are competing against other competitor's websites and getting the data behind search forms, thousands of dropdown options, date selection, is a pain in the butt. Consider a tool like https://scrape.it which makes data scraping from websites easy so you can grab things like product information and prices from any website at an affordable price. If you don't want to deal with the tool then we can certainly perform the full analysis for you with our Competitive Pricing Analysis    Embed Quote
