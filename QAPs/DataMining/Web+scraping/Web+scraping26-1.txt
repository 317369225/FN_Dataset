★Is there a list of current companies that perform data aggregration via web scraping?
There are three main routes. Spend time or money to write a script and maintain it when it breaks or it gets blocked. Get someone to scrape it for you and pay a fee each time you want another website scraped. Master an easy to use tool to grab data from any e-commerce store and have someone maintain it for you. This is the model we offer at https://scrape.it by combining software and service. If you still don't want to deal with the software you can leave that part to us as well.    Embed Quote
