★How do I build a simple web scraping application using Python?
If you need a quick scraper and do not need to process js(javascript), or jquery aspects of the pages or use click functions - use lxml library with requests library - urllib2 works fine.  You can also use beautifulsoup4 "bs4" to help parse and use the main 4 objects to parse the pages. If you need dynamic actions on the pages, use selenium or a variant as a helper library. Scrapy works fine, but I have found it is "overkill" for almost all of my scraping projects.  I do not need 4 folders with class and module calls inside of my scraper when I can write a decent scraper in less than 50 lines of code using python and firefox developer edition to quickly reference the loops of the pages that I am prototyping for scraping.  Also, make sure to read the Terms and Conditions or that variant of the website you are scraping - you may want to rotate proxies and throttle your requests appropriately or risk getting your ip blocked and blacklisted. If you have any questions - let me know, I write scrapers every week and run them at intervals using a script to call the scraper to run/parse/save the data to a database that I reference at a later time. Also, I do not know which Google API you are referencing, if you are referencing the web scraping api - I would stay away from that and use python, it gives you much more control and once you lear it - is much quicker to write and run.
