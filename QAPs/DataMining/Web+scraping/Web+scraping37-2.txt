★How does Google do web scraping for collecting data for its indexes? How does it work?I am more interested in how Google filters the valuable data inside a webpage from lot of other recurring data in the HTML <body> tag like navigation bars, banners etc.
Look at how SEO people optimize, and you can find hints at what google considers valuable. They look at <title> tag and <h1>. They also promote the first <p> element and then us it. The do this to give some keywords extra weight and to build a nicer auto description. Look at some Google results and then cross compare how the description and valuable data gets pulled out. You'll find Google benefits greatly by top ranking sites having staff to make its SEO more relevant to the consumer. For its indexing, it pulls out all the text and then builds a full text index. If you play with Lucene via Solr, then you can get a good idea about how a low level full text engine works and how to build a more expressive engine on top of that.    Embed Quote
