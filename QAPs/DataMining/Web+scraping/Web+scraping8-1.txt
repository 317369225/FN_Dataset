★How can I start learning to write web scraping scripts?
You might not need to :) Check out kimono : Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds , we can help you build an API that will pull data in on regular intervals. fo' free! Edit-  I realize that's not the most helpful answer to the gist of this question. If you're looking to actually dig into the mechanisms behind scraping, I would elaborate as such- 1. Realize that web scraping can be pretty frustrating. You're dealing with all sorts of weirdness on the web, some intentionally set up to stop the very thing you're trying to do! 1a. Some sites are much, much harder to scrape than others. 1b. The easiest sites are often the ugliest. More javascript makes your job harder. No javascript = ideal. 2. As far as approach, I started with python's beautiful soup library, and then dabbled in things like mechanize. Phantomjs is much more powerful in what it let's you do (IMO), but I think there's a much steeper learning curve. I'd start by getting an entire page to print, and then refining that to certain elements you want. 3. Once you can grab certain elements, you can get certain a links, and then feed those into certain functions that extract more data. For example, you crawl an index page and grab all of its links, then you point to those links and get the data you want. That's a sort of high level example, hope it helps!    Embed Quote
