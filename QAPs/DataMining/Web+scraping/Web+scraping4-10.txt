★What is the legality of web scraping?
It is a very interesting question because it obviously poses the question of whether display of the scrapped data is breaching the copyright of the original owner, as Google does routinely.  The only case I know of which addressed this issue was a Canadian case called Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership v. Rogers Communications Inc., 2011 BCSC 1196.  In that case, a company had been scraping Century 21's site and re-displaying the data.  The court held that this constituted a breach of copyright.
