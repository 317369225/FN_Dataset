★How can we as a poor startup follow competitor's e-commerce prices with web scraping/data mining technology?And implement them too ..
Depends on how many competitors you want to follow and how complicated their websites are.   For relatively few and simple websites, OutWit - Harvest The Web appears to be a great option. There is a free version, and a pro version that costs around $60. You need to do a one-time manual identification of where the product description/price/etc. occur in the HTML, and then crawl the sites periodically.   For relatively more and complicated sites, Crawl Anywhere would be more appropriate. But you'll need to write the code for extratcing product details. The product is open source.   If you need to do heavy-duty automated crawling/scraping, the open source Welcome to Apache Nutch is the best choice. But, if you do happen to need something that muscular, then you are probably not a 'poor startup' anyway.   Promptcloud (Web Crawling Service and Extraction of Structured Data) also appear to provide you with scraped data for a price. No idea what their costs are.    Embed Quote
