★How can I start learning to write web scraping scripts?
I'd never discourage anyone from learning something new, but as Ben points out there are tools out there that mean you don't have to write scripts anymore, so you can focus your programming skills on what you do with the data, rather than collecting it. My solution for you: just paste the URL into https://magic.import.io and  get the data in a free to use API in about 8 seconds flat. - hell you can even do it on a mobile on the go. As for HTML / CSS - using code academy and just having a go is my advice, I learned by doing, and a lot of googling.    Embed Quote
