★Does Wikipedia allow web scraping of its contents by bots?Is it legal to scrape the content of Wikipedia and use it for gathering additional data about a specific term.
There are lots of cases where you need to scrape the actual wikipedia article pages, for example, when you want the most up-to-date information, or when you want to know more about a particular place you are planning to visit or a food dish you are planning to eat or cook, maybe just a book worth reading, or a topic worth exploring from multiple dimensions/angles. [Knowledge Graph]. I can imagine infinite ways such scrapers can make life easier while browsing the web or using a certain targeted service like weather forecast or travel trip planner, meal recommender, even in research work where people navigate from one page to another in search of more detail. I am myself need one now. :-)    Embed Quote
