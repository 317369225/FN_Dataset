★How advanced can web scraping or data mining be?I am new to this web screen capture. I did some challenging scraping job in PDFs and capturing information behind layers of form. I wonder how tough a web scraping can be. Also what are the challenges situation in obtaining data.
I think the most complicated aspect of obtaining data from the web, is that websites are not consistent.  So, if you wanted to get all prices for a particular good, it would be difficult to build one crawler to go to all online market places to obtain the data for that good.  Instead, most will create one scraper for each individual online marketplace.  In short, the difficult part is creating a single set of code that can obtain the information you want, and parse it, from various inconsistent sources.    Embed Quote
