★How can I start learning to write web scraping scripts?
Fortunately, there are solutions that allow you to do so without the need to program a line of code. Look at Colabo, for instance. With its browser extension you can create complex scenarios that go through authentication process right to the needed course, then extract the number you wish. The tool also allows setting up an event that will be sent to your e-mail address based on the extracted number. The last thing, which is more important is that you get a space on cloud where your scenario will run periodically, for free.    Embed Quote
