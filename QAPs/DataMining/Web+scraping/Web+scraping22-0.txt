★Web Scraping: How can one web-scrape a list of jobs/occupations/careers for further processing (preferably with metadata if possible)?For what country?
You should try using Kimono for this (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds). It’s really easy to scrape data with Kimono from almost any website and update the data when you tell it to. A lot of recruiters use Kimono to scrape job listing details from career sites. You can create a Kimono API out of a list of job posting links and then feed that list into your API with the posting details to crawl. You can even write javascript functions on your data to do modify your output or prepare it for further processing. It seems like this could be very helpful for what you’re trying to do. Kimono has been used to scrape data for a variety of sites and can easily be paired with other tools for data processing. Check out this blog post to see how Kimono was used to scrape hotel reviews and perform sentiment analysis on the data: http://blog.kimonolabs.com/2014/... For the sake of transparency, I do work for Kimono, but our product is really awesome and completely free!    Embed Quote
