★What are the most common web scraping/mining tools used currently?
There's a lot depending on what you are looking for. Different tools do different things better but I worked on https://Scrape.it for 6 years, I hope that I know a lot better when it comes to making web scraping tools. One of the main motivation was to make programming web scrapers a thing of the past and you can extract dozens of different websites in the same time you would spend on writing or paying someone to create one for you. The other thing was to make it a set & forget system so that once you create a job with us, you wouldn't need to maintain it. We do that work for you. For example, when a website changes layout or throttles your scraper, normally you would have to keep spending time and money to make it work. My solution is able to adapt to such disruptions, and the best part is that there is no per page billing nonsense. You pay a flat fee and you can scrape as much as you want.    Embed Quote
