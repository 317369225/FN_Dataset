★Is there any restriction on web scraping Google movies?
No, there is no any restriction on web scraping for Google movies. You can scrape movies if any download link is available on the web page. For this type of service, I have one best tool. It is free to download, and It is only one that works well. It’s main feature is that it is kept always updated! I’ve been using it for three years now, and I can’t believe that it is not as popular as it should be considering, anyone can download it. It is called as Easy Data Feed - Web Data Extraction Scraping Software                                                     Some features of scraping are listed out below: • Run Daily Schedules • Set Scrape Limits • Set Thread and Speed • Password Protected Scrape You can read about how to use it here: OPEN SOURCE They also have developers you can hire to do the job for you; their Skype is “easydatafeed”    Embed Quote
