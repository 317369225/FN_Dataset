★How can I start learning to write web scraping scripts?
For your immediate need, just write an email to the course website admin telling him/her your plan to scrap data say every other minute, and perhaps once you write up your app you would let all your friends use it. For any sane system admin, he/she would probably implement some notification services for you. But seriously, I am all for your picking up some programming skills. Your starting point is probably curl and regular expressions. Also read up on how to do login coz your course page probably requires some kind of login.    Embed Quote
