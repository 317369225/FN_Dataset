★What are the easiest and best web scraping tool for non-technical people?I want to collect data from a few sites and have it dumped into Excel in a semi-organized way. What tools exists for me to do this easily?
Diffbot (http://www.diffbot.com) offers a number of Automatic APIs that allow you to extract data from web sites without any rules or setup. Currently these APIs are available for articles/blog posts, product pages, images, discussion threads, and videos. While the above APIs are geared toward developers, our crawling product (Crawlbot) and our Bulk URL service can be used fully within our web dashboard by non-developers. Crawlbot will automatically crawl and process entire sites -- say, to extract all of the product data from sampleshoppingsite.com or all of the discussion threads from sampleforumsite.org -- and return the data in a CSV. The Bulk service will do the same for any number of submitted pages (from tens to millions) from which a user needs to extract data, for example a list of product URLs or news articles.    Embed Quote
