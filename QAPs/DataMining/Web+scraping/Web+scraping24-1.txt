★What is a good programming language to use for web scraping?
It really depends on what kind of webs scraping you're trying to do. Python can have trouble with javascript heavy pages, and for that matter, many scraping solutions will struggle there. Python libraries like beautiful soup, mechanize, etc... are good without that though. I'd also have to recommend checking out Kimono (kimono : Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds). Kimono let's you turn almost any website into a json/rss/csv API in a few seconds. Also, it will host that data for you, and update whenever you tell it to. It's pretty freaking awesome. (full disclosure- I work for Kimono, but we're awesome :)    Embed Quote
