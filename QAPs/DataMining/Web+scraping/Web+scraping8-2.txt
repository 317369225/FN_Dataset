★How can I start learning to write web scraping scripts?
For HTML/CSS you could try some tutorial sites like http://codeacademy.com and similar, but really, if you approach learning to code with the goal of learning to code, you won't make it. Approach it with a problem you need to solve, and use the tutorial to help you along - only by applying the practical can you learn it properly, tutorials will leave you like a steroid riddled body builder - a bunch of badges and awards, an inflated sense of self worth, and nothing on the inside. Pick a purpose and work towards it. As for scraping, it basically works like this: download a page by URL (with something like CURL), parse the result just like regular text (or with some DOM traversal libraries) to identify the elements you need, extract the values, apply them to next URL with which you download the next page, and so on. For example: 1) Download course list page 2) Search for course on course list 3) Parse and extract link to course to get course URL 4) Download course page by obtained URL 5) Parse and extract number of enrolled students. 6) Send email if positive change is detected. For this, however, you need to have a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS in order to properly identify the elements you need to extract from the markup you download. For example, the link for the course might be: <a class="courseLink" title="My awesome course" href="mycollege.com/courses?id=45">My awesome course</a> You would then have to extract the part between in the "href" attribute as the course link, and download that next. In the content that then gets downloaded, you would see the enrolled students number in an element such as this one: <span class="enrolled">Currently enrolled: <b>23</b></span> Using regex or a DOM traversal library, you would then extract this element and parse it for the numeric value, and so on.    Embed Quote
