★What is the legality of web scraping?
First things first: I am not a lawyer and these comments are solely based on my experience working at Scrapinghub, please seek legal assistance accordingly. Here are a few things to consider when scraping public data from websites (note that the following addresses only US law): As long as they don't crawl at a disruptive rate, scrapers do not breach any contract (in the form of terms of use) or commit a crime (as defined in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act). Website's user agreement is not enforceable as a browsewrap agreement because companies do not provide sufficient notice of the terms to site visitors. Scrapers accesses website data as a visitor, and by following paths similar to a search engine. This can be done without registering as a user (and explicitly accepting any terms). In Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, Inc. the courts ruled that simply placing a link to a terms of use at the bottom of webpage is not sufficient to "give rise to constructive notice." In other words, there is nothing on a public page that would imply that merely accessing the information is subject to any contractual terms. Scrapers gives neither explicit nor implicit assent to any agreement, therefore breaches no contract. Social networks, for example, assign the value of becoming a user (based on call-to-action on public page), as the ability to: i) Gain access to full profiles, ii) Identify common friends/connections, iii) Get introduced to others, and iv) Contact members directly. As long as scrapers makes no attempt to perform any of these actions they do not gain "unauthorized access" to their services and thus does not violate CFAA.
