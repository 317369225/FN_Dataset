★Web Scraping: How can marketers use import.io ethically?We like the product a lot, but don't want to use it to collect emails or contacts. We want to know some healthy ways to use such a smart product.
Thanks for the A2A. Import.io is a great tool and there are a few different ways to use it. As you mention scraping emails I think you are mostly interested in sources of info you can crawl rather than what you can do with the info. Content marketing- using the tool to track topics, stories or trends. This can be done very effectively by scraping data from social media sites. You can also analyse existing data to help you find a story e.g. Authors who get the most views on hacker news (see import.io blog) Competitor monitoring - keeping an eye on the competitions website and activities  e.g. monitor prices on websites and see updates in real time. The exact data scraped will always depend on the marketers industry but these are two strong use cases for modern marketers. Overall,  as I have my industry i know were relevant large data sets exist. Therefore the best use is the link to visualisation tools.    Embed Quote
