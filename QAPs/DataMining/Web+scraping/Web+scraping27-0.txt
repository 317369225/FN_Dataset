★What is German equivalent for "web scraping"?
Here's how I approached this problem: I went to http://www.leo.org, the translator's greatest friend. I typed in the phrase and noted that while web can be translated as Netz or Web and scrape can be translated in a number of ways, including kratzen (to scratch), there was no phrase definition. I checked below for a Forum and there was none so, as a registered user of LEO, I began a Forum. This allows anybody who does technical translation of any kind to contribute a definition. If, as Bernhard Støcker suggests, the English term is all there is, that will also likely be confirmed via the Forum. As Germans are wont to add: "Fragen kostet nichts." It costs nothing to ask. Especially on LEO.    Embed Quote
