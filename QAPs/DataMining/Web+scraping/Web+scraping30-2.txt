★What are the easiest and best web scraping tool for non-technical people?I want to collect data from a few sites and have it dumped into Excel in a semi-organized way. What tools exists for me to do this easily?
i happened to wrote a python package (pydepta) to scrape the content from HTML page by leveraging on tree matches. It can output the content into the HTML tables,  change to spreadsheet won't be difficult though.    Embed Quote
