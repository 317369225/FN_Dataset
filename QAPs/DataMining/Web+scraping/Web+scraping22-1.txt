★Web Scraping: How can one web-scrape a list of jobs/occupations/careers for further processing (preferably with metadata if possible)?For what country?
Using https://scrape.it you can do this by first, identifying the pages with lot of job or occupational results. You could extract all the data on such websites and proceed to scrape the rest of the remaining pages. OR you could visit each career profile, and scrape the relevant data fields. You can see how this is done in the tutorial https://scrape.it/tutorial#8 for extracting data behind links. It will differ drastically from website to website but assuming that most job sites list their jobs/occupations/careers publicly, you should be able to scrape it after you read the quick tutorial here https://scrape.it/tutorial Again, if you need help with a particular website by messaging me or using the contact form https://scrape.it/contact    Embed Quote
