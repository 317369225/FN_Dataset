★How does Google do web scraping for collecting data for its indexes? How does it work?I am more interested in how Google filters the valuable data inside a webpage from lot of other recurring data in the HTML <body> tag like navigation bars, banners etc.
For what i've seen and heard, they ofcourse index tons of source code, but most likely, the do comparisons, based on simillarities they know how to separate a menubare from the actual content.    Embed Quote
