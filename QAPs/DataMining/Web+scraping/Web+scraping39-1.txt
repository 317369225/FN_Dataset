★Is it legal to page/web scrape the content of an another site?I'm wondering if it is legal to page scrape to get the content of an another website. In my case it is a TV listing site like TV.com. where I get the time of some shows and title but also synopsis
In general, scaping is a copyright infringement that puts you are risk of a lawsuit. There are instances in which you capture only factual data (which cannot be copyrighted) and are in the clear, but since you are using data taken from someone else's website without permission, you can STILL expect to be sued in court, you're chances of winning are better, but the expense is still as high. If you just want the data from another website, intending to put it to use for some purpose, why not work out a deal with that website to get data formatted to your specifications sent to you daily? This would be cheaper than fighting a lawsuit and adds utility to the data that you don't have to add yourself.    Embed Quote
