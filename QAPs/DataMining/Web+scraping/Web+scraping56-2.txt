★Web Scraping: When doing a mashup when should you write the crawler yourself, and when should you use an external service/program?
It depends on how the website is built and how much data you need. You can easily build a web scraper yourself in just a few hours if you need data from a static webpage or one or two pages. Also, if the website is nicely designed and doesn't have any JavaScript or AJAX it is fairly easy for you to do the work yourself. Most people prefer to use a web scraping tool: If the website they want data from is poorly designed. If it takes several weeks if not months to build a web scraper. If the webpage loads data when you scroll, has pagination or loads more data with AJAX If you need data from a map, dropdowns, forms, tables or any other interactive features If you need IP rotation to get data from the website If you need to update your data and schedule the crawler to run every minute, hour, month, etc. If you want to avoid the headache of hosting and maintaing your own scraper, especially if the structure of the website changes I'm one of the founders of ParseHub - Extract data from dynamic websites in minutes, without writing code. We started out writing web scraping scrips for clients that wanted data from various websites. After a while custom scrips became a pain to maintain, so we moved forward to make a visual tool that anyone can use to scrape the web.    Embed Quote
