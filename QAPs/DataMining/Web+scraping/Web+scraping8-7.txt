★How can I start learning to write web scraping scripts?
If you know python, you are more than half way there.  And since you only need to do one site, this should be pretty easy.  Like others have said, knowledge of regex and html are a must, but you dont have to be amazing with those, just basic knowledge will do.  There is a lesson in Udacity's Web Development class that deals with html, and a class in Udacity's Programming Languages class which should give you enough background on regex to get moving.  Regex can be tricky, but for the stuff you need to do, I would guess that the following regex will work pretty well: <start tag>(.+?)<end tag> where the start and end tags are the tags that surround the text you want.  There are many reasons why that regex would not work, though.  To make a better one, you will have to know substantially more about regex than the class I mentioned above teaches. If you need to do a lot of login stuff, I would suggest Selenium.  Its easy to use, and can deal with dynamic content as well, which I would assume you have a lot of.  The commands you will probably use a lot of in Selenium are: 1)driver = webdriver.Firefox() 2)driver.get(...) 3)driver.find_element_by_link_text(...)/driver.find_element_by_xpath(...)/driver.find_element_by_partial_link_text(...) 4) element.click() 5) element.send_keys(.....) 6) driver.page_source If you dont have a lot of deep web stuff on your site, urllib2 is a much faster alternative. Once you have the html/text, you can parse using regex.  You will probably want to save your data to a db or text file.  but I guess you could just keep the same program running all the time, and just compare the new text to the old each time instead. If you already know Python, but all of the above is new to you, I think 2-3 days is a decent estimate of how long this will take to get off the ground.  If you are not that great at Python, maybe a week or two.    Embed Quote
