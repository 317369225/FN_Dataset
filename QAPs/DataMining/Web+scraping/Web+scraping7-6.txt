★What are examples of how real businesses use web scraping?Are there any types of businesses which uses this more than others?
Hey, There are plenty of use cases for web scraping. The longer that we run our web scraping business (at http://www.parsehub.com) the more interesting and unique examples we find. Customers use web scraping to: - Scrape leads from directories such as Yelp and then contact them to make a sales introduction. - Scrape leads from real estate websites to contact retailers - Scrape events from thousands of event websites in the US to create an application that consolidates all of the events together - Scrape pricing of cars at various dealerships to run an advertising agency that helps other businesses properly target car ads - Scrape dealerships in South America to create a website that consolidates all of the car types and prices and makes it super easy for someone to find and purchase a car - Scrape fashion eCommerce websites to price clothing on a retail website accurately - Scrape job boards to create a central job board website and have a list of companies that are currently hiring to contact Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
