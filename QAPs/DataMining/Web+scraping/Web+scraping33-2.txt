★What are the best resources to learn web scraping via PHP?Also suppose I have written a web scraper code but it is executing very slow how to improve its performance? Are there some general rules...
Some of the basic fundamentals for an efficient web scraper (in any language) is to minimize the RTT time for the links. I assume that you have taken care not to crawl the same link twice or fall into a spider trap. The improvements depend upon the kind of scraping you want to do and some tweaks for that particular implementation are always helpful. Although for a general crawler, you can think of maintaining a priority queue for visiting the links in a more efficient fashion. Try to use the cashing benefits of the routers i.e. the DNS cache of the intermediate routers while trying to make sure that you are not blocked by the web server for strong breach of crawling policy (else it may look like a DoS attack). Also, try to parallelize the code for better performance (6 threads per 4 cores should be good for better throughput).    Embed Quote
