★What is a good programming language to use for web scraping?
The most flexible is the one that you're most familiar with. Personally, I use Python for almost all of my utilities. For  scraping, I find that its functionality specific to parsing and string  manipulation requires little code, is fast and there are a ton  of examples out there (strong community). Chances are that someone's  already written whatever you're trying to do already, or there's at  least something along the same lines that needs very little refactoring.     Free Source Code for Computer Programmers    Embed Quote
