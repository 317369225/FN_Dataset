★What is the best language for HTML parsing and web scraping?Would it be Jsoup on Java or Beautifulsoup on Python ?
There are several languages for extracting data and parsing HTML from the websites. The one I like is .Net. One more thing I want to share with you is that I am using a software tool too for this purpose for last three years. This tool is awesome. It is free, Open-Source, anyone can download it and use it at no cost. It supports Visual Studio. It is named as Easy Data Feed - Web Data Extraction Scraping Software. You can read about how to use it here: OPEN SOURCE They also have developers you can hire to do the job for you; their Skype is “easydatafeed”.    Embed Quote
