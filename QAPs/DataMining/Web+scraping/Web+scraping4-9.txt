★What is the legality of web scraping?
Just wanted to make a distinction between scraping and crawling.  Google crawls websites to provide search.  Scraping implies that you are then re-leveraging the content for your own purposes (e.g. I could scrape Quora to seed my own Q&A site).  I'm not a lawyer, but obviously this type of use would be somewhat malevolent.  Also, with web crawling, sites have complete control over this via robots.txt and sitemaps. They can specify to not be crawled at all, or even recommend the frequency to be crawled (so as not to over-burden their servers). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob...    Embed Quote
