★What is web scraping and is Python the best language to use for this?If so why is python the best?
Language is not important. There are plenty of good scripting languages and accompanying libraries that will do it efficiently - Python, Ruby. You should ask yourself whether building and maintaining this system is really necessary for the project or business you're in. If it's a one-time thing or if you don't want to be bogged down with sinking resources (your own time, machine time, network bandwidth) into it, consider using a web service that offers web scraping on subscription basis. I recommend Bobik (usebobik.com) for my clients - simple, fast and cheap (free, unless you're a heavy user, in fact)    Embed Quote
