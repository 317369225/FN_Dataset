★How can I start learning to write web scraping scripts?
To scrap any website first of all you need to apply an XPath to that page in your programming language to grab various parts of it, as you want to scrap locations so apply Xpath to locations of cities. This is a convenient method, as your data will be in a format that is easily downloadable in excel.  I have one tool for web scraping which is totally free to download .
