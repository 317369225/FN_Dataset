★What are examples of how real businesses use web scraping?Are there any types of businesses which uses this more than others?
Depends completely on your line of service. From our experience, most of the use cases lie in the E-commerce, Market Research (this will include all sorts and types- brand monitoring, sentiment analysis or whatever there is) and Travel areas. Since we're in the big data business where most of our solutions revolve around web crawling and extraction, we've had multiple use cases come in from these domains and few other niches which even we hadn't thought of! To mention a few obvious ones, there are some big market research houses that directly deal with the manufacturer brands and would like to closely monitor user sentiments for specific high-value products. For this, they would like to crawl product reviews from multiple sources and be able to analyze it. Then there are other price comparison engines who would like to aggregate product prices from around the web and run some analytics on top of it. There are  others who'd like to build vertical specific search engines and hence need as much public data as possible. So essentially, there's no limit to how you can use the freely available public data from the web because there's so much that can be done with it depending on your set of offerings. Some businesses use it to improve their user experiences whereas some use it for research and other studies that leads to newer business innovations.    Embed Quote
