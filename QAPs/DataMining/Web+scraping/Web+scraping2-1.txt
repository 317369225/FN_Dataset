★What are the commercial web-scraping businesses?
Scrapinghub [1] was founded by the creators of Scrapy [2], the most popular Python web scraping framework. Our Scrapy cloud platform allows you to deploy and run Scrapy spiders, and it provides an API [3] for scheduling spiders, retrieving job information and scraped data. You can visually create spiders with our Autoscraping service [4] or Portia [5], both of which are integrated into the Scrapinghub dashboard, meaning you can create your spider and deploy it straight to Scrapy cloud all within your browser. Crawlera [6] is another service we provide to prevent being banned from the sites you're crawling. Crawlera routes your requests through a pool of IP addresses, discarding the IPs if they are blacklisted by the target domain. All of this logic is contained within Crawlera so you don't have to worry about it, however it's possible to tune settings if you wish improve performance.
