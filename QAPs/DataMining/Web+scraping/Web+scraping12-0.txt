★How advanced can web scraping or data mining be?I am new to this web screen capture. I did some challenging scraping job in PDFs and capturing information behind layers of form. I wonder how tough a web scraping can be. Also what are the challenges situation in obtaining data.
As Arpan and Neil have already mentioned, web scraping can get pretty complicated when you have many sites with different structures and when you need your output in a certain format. Luckily Kimono (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds) makes a bookmarklet/chrome extension that you can use for scraping almost any site. You can get your output in JSON, CSV, and RSS, and Kimono will host your data for you. Your API will even update when you tell it to. Full disclosure, I work for Kimono, but if you’ve ever struggled with creating a bunch of hand-made scrapers, try it out. It’s really easy to use and it can save you a ton of work. I’d recommend giving it a try before putting in the work to write your own scraper. Plus, it’s free!    Embed Quote
