★What is web scraping and is Python the best language to use for this?If so why is python the best?
Python doesn't have any particular language features that make it better for web scraping. It does have some interesting libraries, but equivalents for these libraries are usually available for other languages as well (eg. Python has BeautifulSoup, Ruby has Nokogiri). However, there are a few standouts you should check out: Pattern - http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/... Scrapy - http://scrapy.org/ Looks like there are a couple of very cool additions to the Scrapy family: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapely and https://github.com/scrapy/slybot Scraperwiki.com source code - https://bitbucket.org/ScraperWik...    Embed Quote
