★Is there any open-source web scraping tool such as Scrapinghub or DiffBot?
I am not aware of any open-source tool that fits the requirements. The scrapers defined in the Scrapinghub Autoscraping (http://scrapinghub.com/autoscrap...) service can be exported and run using slybot (https://github.com/scrapy/slybot/) which is open source and built with the scrapy platform and scrapely library. Scrapely does include a command-line tool, but nothing visual and it's very slow compared to using Scrapinghub. If there is enough interest we may consider open-sourcing a future version of the annotation UI that could be used with slybot .    Embed Quote
