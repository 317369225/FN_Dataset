★What are the reliable web scraping services?
We use ScrapeHero for getting reviews from many websites including Yelp etc. it has been working flawlessly for a year now. The service handles changes in website structure and all the infrastructure. We don't have to worry about servers, proxies or bandwidth. We went down the "build and host your own" method in the beginning but the SaaS model for getting Data is better and cheaper. We are anyway relying on the cloud for almost everything anyway and getting data isn't our forte anyway - why bother with the grunt work !    Embed Quote
