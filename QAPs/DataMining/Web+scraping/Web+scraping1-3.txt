★What is Web Scraping?Today I was reading a random post and I found people are discussing about #WebScrapingtool, My question is: Can I use extracted data into my website? Will Google accept this ?
Web Scraping is the process of information extraction from resources that are located on the World Wide Web and the classification of scraped and unstructured data (usually found in HTML pages) in a structured form like Spreadsheets or database tables. Web Scraping techniques can be broken down to : Human Copy and Paste, HTTP interface commands that interact with the web server, providing us with the required resources, HTML& DOM parsers: Software that will break down the structural elements of either the front-end HTML language of a website or the underlying DOM model so that the required information can be acquired via means of locating these elements and obtaining their contents. Custom Web-scraping software: There are also software tools that can go beyond the above methods and will recognize the data structure of a page (with or without user intervention) or will provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write code and that can store the scraped data in local databases. This software may incorporate a built-in browser or will capture your input on any browser you may have installed. Such is the case with the Web Recorder in WinAutomation | http://www.winautomation.com/web... that can piggyback on the default install of Internet Explorer or will work through built-in browser. So, why would you need Web scraping? It can be a very valuable asset to anyone packaging and re-selling information. You can put it to use when monitoring retail prices, stock markets, real estate, weather data and there are numerous other uses. Heck, even the almighty giant of the Internets, Google, web scrapes content off of Wikipedia now and then...!  | The Google Content Scraping Controversy - SiteProNew    Embed Quote
