★What is the legality of web scraping?
The use described in the question, using data to make graphics for example, puts forth the assumption that the web scraping doesn't involve unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted content - just the use of the data itself, in some transformative manner. Perhaps the biggest IP issue you would face in this scenario is that you will frequently be in violation of the Terms of Service of the web site supplying the data - most major sites will have TOS clauses that limit the way you can use the data found on the site. You can be subjected to the terms of a Click Wrap/Web Wrap license even if you don't voluntarily click on an Agree button or otherwise consent to the terms. So if the owner of the web site objects to the way you are using the data, they have a reasonably good way of forcing you to stop. It may not be likely that you would be subject to any sort of harsh penalties if you were doing this and got caught. But if you were told to stop and continued, you could be in jeopardy. If you were to build a business around this type of data collection, you would be living in a very fragile glass house. I have no standing of any type to be giving legal advice.    Embed Quote
