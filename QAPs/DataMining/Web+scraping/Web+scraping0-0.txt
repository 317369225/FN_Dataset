★Could web scraping be legal?
There is no general answer to this question. As with many answers to legal questions -- "it depends." There is a chance that web scraping can result in copyright infringement. It is a question of what is taken and how it is used. Reproducing copyrighted content is clearly problematic. That said, facts themselves are not protected by copyright. A narrative work that includes or explains facts can be protected by copyright. There may also be contractual problems with respect to terms of use violations. Recently Craigslist has sued or threatened to sue third parties that scrape its data and republish the ads from Craigslist.

This is one of those situations where an hour or two of attorney time may save you large headaches later.    Embed Quote
