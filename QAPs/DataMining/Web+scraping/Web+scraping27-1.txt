★What is German equivalent for "web scraping"?
Thanks for A2A In programming many English terms are used as well in German. So using the term 'web scraping' should be valid while talking to software developers. I don't know a real German Term for it but one would descripe it with "Automatisiertes Daten sammeln von web-sides" (automated collection of data from web-sides). Maybe "Daten abschöpfen" could also match.    Embed Quote
