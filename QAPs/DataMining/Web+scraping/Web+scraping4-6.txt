★What is the legality of web scraping?
The key part is what you want to do with the scraped data. If you use it for your own, personal use, then it is legal as it falls under fair use doctrine. There is nothing special in accessing data for yourself with a browser, you can use other means i.e. scraping. The complications start if you want to use scraped data for other, especially commercial, purposes. However  even then you may be able to do a lot. A good example is deep linking, a practice where links to pages within a site are placed on another site, bypassing target site home page. There have been several legal precedents for such cases and in several of them courts have ruled that deep linking is legal, even including short descriptions and meta data from target pages, as long as it is clear that the site where deep links are placed is not claiming ownership of  the data.    Embed Quote
