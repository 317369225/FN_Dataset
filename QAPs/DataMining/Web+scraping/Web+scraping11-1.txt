★What is web scraping and is Python the best language to use for this?If so why is python the best?
Web scraping or screen scraping is when you use a script or a program to fetch a web-page from a site and parse it's content to extract something meaningful. For example scraping the IMDB page to get movie info (offtopic: This is actually forbidden by IMDB and you might want to look at themoviedb API instead)   You'd need some kind of a parser like Beautiful Soup (http://www.crummy.com/software/B...) to extract data from it. If you're using Java you might want to check out JSoup(http://jsoup.org/)  I don't see why Python may/should be the best language for scraping a page. You can do it pretty much in any language, scraping is often a smaller part of a bigger system. More importantly, you should check if this is ok with the site you're scraping.    Embed Quote
