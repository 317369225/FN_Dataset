★What is the legality of web scraping?
Web scraping may be against the terms of use of some websites. The enforceability of these terms is unclear. While outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the US the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service  that duplication of facts is allowable. Also, in a February, 2006  ruling, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court (Copenhagen) found  systematic crawling, indexing and deep linking  by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk not to conflict with  Danish law or the database directive of the European Union. U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of "scrapers" or "robots" may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,  which involves a computer system itself being considered personal  property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. However, to  succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must  demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization  interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer  system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the  plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have  been considered trespass to chattels. In Australia, the Spam Act 2003 outlaws some forms of web harvesting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web...    Embed Quote
