★What is the future of web scraping?
Advances in machine intelligence--automated understanding of scenes based on exposure to training data--will revolutionize many activities which humans today manually engineer. In the same way that machine intelligence via self-driving cars will automate getting from point A to point B in our future physical world, machine intelligence will also allow us to automate the parsing, and eventually the understanding, of web documents to enable our transactions in the online world. If you accept that premise, then there's nothing to stop a smart algorithm, with sufficient computation capacity, from analyzing all of the web documents published online, and indexing in a more flexible semantic format. (Some have estimated the total number of webpages indexed by Google at 50 billion today--another order of magnitude is locked in the deep/dark web).  At that point, we could safely discard the notion of a "webpage", since the webpage could be trivially regenerated from the structured information at will (and other formats to boot).  So, it follows that the future of web scraping is that there will be no webpages to scrape.    Embed Quote
