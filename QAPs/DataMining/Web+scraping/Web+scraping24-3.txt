★What is a good programming language to use for web scraping?
I'll add another vote to python though I at a previous job we used some software along with c#.  Visual Web Ripper was the name of it. I never find myself promoting .NET focused software but this was easy to use and there are many tutorials created by the company themselves. Only problem is that you gotta pay for it. I don't know how well you are with regular expressions/parsing strings and your overall scripting knowledge, but the cheapest way is to use straight python. Perhaps the easiest way, visual web ripper. I created a contact list of over 1.5 million with their software...and yes I know I'm probably going to hell. It entirely depends on how much data you want and your time at hand.    Embed Quote
