★Is there any open-source web scraping tool such as Scrapinghub or DiffBot?
I’ve gotta recommend Kimono here (Turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds). While it’s not open source, it is a free web scraping tool where you can click on the data properties you want rather than having to define the selectors in the code. It’s very easy to use (one of our founders’ mom can make an api in about 60 seconds!) and lets you scrape almost any site. Kimono even hosts your data for you and lets you update whenever you tell it to. This is perfect if you have one site with a list of hundreds of links to blog articles, and you want the content inside each article. Kimono lets you scrape the list and use it as a source of links for another API to crawl. You just have to make one API out of the detail and set the list of links from the index API, and then you’re done! (Fox vs. CNN: Who's got Obama on the mind?) I should tell you that I work for Kimono, but I truly think the product is awesome. It’s really easy to use and it can save you a ton of work.    Embed Quote
