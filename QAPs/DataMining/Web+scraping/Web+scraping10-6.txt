★What are some good tools for interactive web scraping and automation?Tools for automating or scripting web app access, including rich JavaScript apps. Commercial or open source. Clarification Looks like the answers tools are for classic "scraping" or parsing websites read-only. I'm looking for a solution for those cases where the user needs to load forms or even run JavaScript client-side functions.
Check out ParseHub - www.parsehub.com. It's a visual web scraper built to handle rich Javascript apps and to get data from forms, search, drop downs and even maps. I'm one of the founders of ParseHub and would love to get feedback from anyone that tries our tool!    Embed Quote
