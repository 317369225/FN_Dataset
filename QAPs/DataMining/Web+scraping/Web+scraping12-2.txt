★How advanced can web scraping or data mining be?I am new to this web screen capture. I did some challenging scraping job in PDFs and capturing information behind layers of form. I wonder how tough a web scraping can be. Also what are the challenges situation in obtaining data.
The real challenge is with the scale. When you have to mine data from a few web pages, you could just do a wget and fetch what you need. When its about a thousand websites, that's a different problem altogether. Consequently, that brings in various other challenges of setting up a big data infrastructure, smart distributed computing, adaptive crawling and monitoring all the things. That's a real headache that one can't get rid of unless you decide to give the headache away. A lot has been achieved in this field via a good mix of technologies that you are free to pick and choose but needless to say the technology barrier is pretty high. This problem gets amplified when the output needs to be structured data (like the formatted XML's or CSV's that's ready to be loaded into your DB). And it brings an obvious concern with inconsistencies in data formats and dynamism within the web. And because of this, only approximate solutions can be formulated if there's just one extractor doing all the job. I wrote a short post here sometime back- Standard Data Formats- Our Right to Data. Another interesting challenge is to acquire datasets in real-time. We have achieved near real-time success but achieving a real-time latency would be a big step forward. Apart from these, complexities within the websites, like AJAX components say, have paved way for advancements.    Embed Quote
