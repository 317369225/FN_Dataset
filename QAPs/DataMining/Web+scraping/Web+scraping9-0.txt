★What are some good Python web scraping tutorials?EDIT: I'm not looking for tutorials on Python, just webscraping/data munging with Python.
There are alot of things, around, to do web scraping using Python. I'll vote for Beautiful Soup and Scrapy (An open source web scraping framework for Python). Their docs are sufficient to get started. Follow the steps and you can learn web scraping using Python very easily. I did that. Search web when you get stuck somewhere in the process, and you will get a lot of useful blog posts. Here is a list of some useful links : Scrapy Tutorial - Scrapy 0.24.4 documentation. BeautifulSoup - Python for Beginners I also wrote a three part series about scraping with Scrapy. Scraping With Scrapy : Part 1, Scraping With Scrapy : Part 2, Scrapping with Scrapy : Part 3. Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
