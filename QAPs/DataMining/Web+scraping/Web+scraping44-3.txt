★I need to extract data from FT, mainly stock prices. What web scraping tool is the best?
Data As A Service is the best option if you plan to make some real money from this website and if the data is critical for it.  You can find some good providers here What are the best web crawling services? Why DaaS ? They'd already have  solved the problems you have - Most of these providers have very sophisticated infrastructure designed only for web crawling. IP Blocking & Proxies- They'd have a fleet of IP Address and servers to tackle all the Blocking & Blacklisting. Most of them have great IP Rotating Solutions as part of their infrastructure. Maintenance - They'd detect the changes to the website through their quality control systems and notify you if there is a change in the website and adjust the scrapers before you even know it. You can get data with just an API Call.. Most of these providers have a data download API, which you can call periodically based on your scraping schedule to collect your data and store it in your database. More time to focus on improving your website Once you put your scraping related problems on the DaaS Provider, you get more time to work on your website and make more money out of it. You'll have to spend some money for the monthly subscription to the DaaS Provider, but this would be cheaper at the long run, due to the above reasons. DISCLAIMER: I co-founded ScrapeHero , a Data As A Service startup which was built to solve all the in house problems above. :)    Embed Quote
