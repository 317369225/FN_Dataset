★What is web scraping and is Python the best language to use for this?If so why is python the best?
Web Scraping is a derivation of Screen Scraping of old which is simulating a user programatically and interpreting the result usually at a application network protocol layer as opposed to mechanical with vision recognition which has been done before. In the case of Web Scraping, it is making a HTTP web request and parsing the return HTML and response codes. I don't think there is anything that makes Python an easier language for this, as any language providing a HTTP API and HTML parser should be roughly equally easy. If scraping a narrow body of web pages similarly structured, you might even use regular expressions instead of HTML parsing to simplify and speed up the process. Doing this in high volume or performance might make you look at better parallel support. As for legality, much if not most web content is subject to normal copyright restrictions if you are planning on republishing the data you scrape.    Embed Quote
