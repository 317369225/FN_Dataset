★What is the legality of web scraping?
None from just copyright. Data itself cannot be copyrighted, although the form in which a presentation of data (such as a database) can be subject to copyright. But when the data is used to create a new representation, such as an infographic, there is probably no copyright infringement. Now then, the collection and dissemination of personal data might have some legal issues, especially depending on which country you are in (e.g. EU countries and their constitutional statements about privacy, which inform the laws they have there). But if the data scrapped is not personal, this is no issue. And it would unclear if the scrapper or the person who left the personal data accessible would be liable (probably both). In general, a datum is considered a fact. Facts cannot be subject to copyright because that is just crazy. The way in which you state or list facts might be copyrightable (e.g. an encyclopedia is copyrightable), but rephrasing or reorganizing the data gets you around that.    Embed Quote
