★Could web scraping be legal?
It really depends on what specific content you're scraping. You might want to consider asking your sources directly if they allow scraping. An alternative to scraping is to use an API which already does what you need to do. One API that comes to mind is Google's Freebase API. There's also Wolfram|Alpha API. The benefit of using an API is that you don't have to worry about whether its legal or not, because its on the company that's owns the API. Using an API is also faster compared to scraping as you are already given the data that you need without having to traverse to the DOM.    Embed Quote
