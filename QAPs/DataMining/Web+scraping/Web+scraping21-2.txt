★What's the best resource to learn about web scraping from scratch?Any books or resources?  If one needed to acquire a basic learning of a programming language, which would it be?
I have used Python & Javascript (independently) for scraping,both require minimal code, and require very less reading to master. Scrapy + scrapely combined make a full fledged webscraping platform. Other useful libraries are PyQuery / webscraping / XPCOM. Also you might like PhantomJS/casperJS if you want to write even lesser code. All the above resources I mentioned require a few hours to get started, all you need to do is go through their "hello world" programs on respective websites.    Embed Quote
