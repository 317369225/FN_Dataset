★I need to extract data from FT, mainly stock prices. What web scraping tool is the best?
There are three main routes. Spend time or money to write a script and maintain it when it breaks or it gets blocked. Get someone to scrape it for you and pay a fee each time you want another website scraped. The so called "Data as a Service" (DAAS) model that gets expensive fast. Master an easy to use tool to grab data from any website and have someone maintain it for you when it breaks. This is the model we offer at https://scrape.it by combining software and service. If you still don't want to deal with the software you can leave that part to us as well effectively becoming DAAS for a flat fee.    Embed Quote
