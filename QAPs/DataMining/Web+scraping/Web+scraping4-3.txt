★What is the legality of web scraping?
I totaly agree with Sam Ho. There is a huge diference between scraping and crawling and he has explained it well. About the content scraping issue, I would like to add that websites that scrap content from third party content generators should always have a "demand" button by which the content can be marked as being used in a non correct way or even be aware of notifications from sites who would not like to be scrapped. This shows the good will and responsability of the content scraping site and should be enough to avoid most of the legal issues in a small scale (I'm not a lawyer so don't take this as a veredict). For scraping content from big repositories, content scraping sites should always check TOS or simply get in contact with the site to check permissions.    Embed Quote
