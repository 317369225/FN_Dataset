★Is there a list of current companies that perform data aggregration via web scraping?
I'm not sure why this is, but there doesn't seem to be a replete list of web data aggregation companies.  I work for screen-scraper.com and we attempted to make a comparison list of web scraping software on Wikipedia.com but the page was shut down because it was considered advertising.  This was the result despite our best efforts to include all of our competitors software. Instead of trashing the list I decided to republish it as a Google Doc.  I have tried to keep it up-to-date but I seem to be finding new software on a regular basis and have fallen somewhat behind on updating the list. I have changed it to be editable by all, so feel free to add any companies you are aware of to the list. Comparison of Web Scraping Software https://docs.google.com/spreadsh...    Embed Quote
