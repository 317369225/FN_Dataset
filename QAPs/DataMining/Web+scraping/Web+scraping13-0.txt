★Web Scraping: How can marketers use import.io ethically?We like the product a lot, but don't want to use it to collect emails or contacts. We want to know some healthy ways to use such a smart product.
Thanks for the a2a.   I am always glad to come across someone concerned about ethics when dealing with online data. The only advice that comes to my mind would be to carefully go through the Terms and Conditions on every sites you want to target.   They are usually pretty clear on what you can or cannot do with their data.  When in doubt, or if you want more flexibility, do not hesitate to contact site owners.   Some may even have partner programs granting enhanced access or similar. I had to go through that exercise myself a few times for several sites, and I can say it varies greatly.  Several sites will allow you to use their data with no or little restrictions as long as you link the data back to them in your presentation.  Others require you get into a business agreement with them for re-using their data.  Of course some will simply forbid it.  I'd say as a golden rule: just don't presume anything. import.io makes is very clear themselves in their FAQ: "As such, we make it very clear to anyone who uses our tool that it is  their sole responsibility to ensure that they abide by the Terms and  Conditions of the sites they are pulling data from." Good luck with that.    Embed Quote
