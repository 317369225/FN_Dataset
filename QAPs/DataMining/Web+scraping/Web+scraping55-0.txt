★What data have you scraped using web scraping?
I have scraped whole details/data for example, Product Title, Prices, SKUs, Manufacturer, Meta Contents, Descriptions and so many details from several websites by using a single Web Scraping tool which is the one of the best Web/Data Scraping Tool called Easy Data Feed - Web Data Extraction Scraping Software. It works well, free, Open Source, always kept updated and interesting thing is that anybody can download it and use it. Easy Data Feed can develop Sample projects, it supports Visual Studio for development, doing Native API Development, runs daily schedules, Set limits to scrape how much data, sets threads and speed, password protected scrape, use proxies, downloading images too and convert them to jpg if they are in gif format, downloads PDFs, converts PDFs to JPG etc. For more: OPEN SOURCE They also have developers. You can hire them, Skype is "easydatafeed".    Embed Quote
