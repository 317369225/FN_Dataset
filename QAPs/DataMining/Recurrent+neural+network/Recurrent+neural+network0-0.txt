★Is there a recurrent neural networks toolkit?Is there a toolkit for recurrent neural networks? I'm interested in using them for time series classification. The idea of a recurrent neural network is that sensor values are fed to the network one by one, so there is no embedding. I.e. the network has an internal state to represent past events. So far I have found: http://jsalatas.ictpro.gr/weka/
The Echo state networks [1], or more broadly 'reservoir networks' are a class of interesting recurrent neural networks. Several toolboxes are available [2]. I've used the matlab toolbox by Jaeger & Co but the Ghent matlab and python toolbox seems a good choice too [3]. [1] http://www.scholarpedia.org/arti... [2] http://www.reservoir-computing.o...
