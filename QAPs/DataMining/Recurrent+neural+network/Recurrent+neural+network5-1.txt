★What are resources for learning about recurrent neural networks?
I just figure out a tutorial about LSTM RNN: Long Short-Term Memory: Tutorial on LSTM Recurrent Networks written by Mr J. Schmidhuber. It is very detail and able to understand :-). And a Phd thesis of Mr Alex, a student of Mr Hinton, also about RNN Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~grave... Hope this help.    Embed Quote
