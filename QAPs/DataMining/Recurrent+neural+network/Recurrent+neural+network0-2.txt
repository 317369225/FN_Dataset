★Is there a recurrent neural networks toolkit?Is there a toolkit for recurrent neural networks? I'm interested in using them for time series classification. The idea of a recurrent neural network is that sensor values are fed to the network one by one, so there is no embedding. I.e. the network has an internal state to represent past events. So far I have found: http://jsalatas.ictpro.gr/weka/
indico has put together an abstraction layer for building RNNs using Theano https://github.com/IndicoDataSol... be sure to reference our examples page to get up and running here's a simple binary classification example:    Embed Quote
