★Is there any other problem with recurrent neural networks besides complexity?My understanding is that the reason people can't use RNN's too much is because if you have too many neurons, you run into a very large and intractable combinatorial problem with obnoxious complexity. Is my understanding correct? Are there other reasons as well?
Although RNNs may take quite some time to train properly, it's not like it's practically intractable. You can surely train them on non-neglible amounts of data in a couple of days/few weeks and often achieve highly competetive results. Perhaps you are thinking of some papers, which state that NN training in general is an NP-hard problem, which is of course true with respect to the optimal solution. But in practice you only try to find a solution close enough to the optimal one with an iterative approach like gradient descent. This makes the training problem computationally tractable, but comes at the cost that it may get stuck in a local minimum.    Embed Quote
