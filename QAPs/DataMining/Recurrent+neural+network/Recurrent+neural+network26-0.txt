★What is the T matrix in the LSTM equation in the paper, 'Recurrent Neural Network Regularization'?
T is a matrix of dimension (4n, 2n). It takes as input 2 vector of size n: the output of the previous layer h(t, l-1) and the hidden state of previous time step h(t - 1, l). Combined with the 4 activation functions, it outputs 4 vector of size n: f, i, g, o. f gates the input c (shall we use the input ? ), i and g are multiplicated element wise. i is an input computed from the previous state. g controls if we listen to this input. So c and i are mixed through f and g to compute the new state of the memory. Then o control what we output from the memory. I haven't read the paper, so I can't answer to the second part of your question.    Embed Quote
