★Is there any other problem with recurrent neural networks besides complexity?My understanding is that the reason people can't use RNN's too much is because if you have too many neurons, you run into a very large and intractable combinatorial problem with obnoxious complexity. Is my understanding correct? Are there other reasons as well?
The main problem with recurrent networks is instability. Feedforward networks behave deterministically and can be designed to converge. Because the inputs drive the outputs, one can start with an output goal and work backwards to the inputs and the learning rules. With recurrent networks, the outputs are the inputs. These leads to self-reinforcing feedback cycles and noise amplification which get in the way of the design goal of the network. And because there is no clean division between dependent and independent variables, they are unwieldy to analyze and very sensitive to initial conditions.    Embed Quote
