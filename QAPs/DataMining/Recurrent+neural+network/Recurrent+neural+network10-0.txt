★Neuroscience: Does the brain use recurrent neural networks?
That's the entire -purpose- of the brain, the establishment of 'working survival model' thoughts and patterns... neural networks. If you want to 'change your mind' or 'break a habit', you have to build a new network (and avoid 'falling back' to the old). Edit: Do you mean this? Recurrent neural network If so, it would be better that someone from that field answers... sorry if I misunderstood.    Embed Quote
