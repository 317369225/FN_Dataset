★What is the difference between recurrent neural networks and recursive neural networks?
Recurrent neural networks are in fact recursive neural networks with a particular structure: that of a linear chain. Whereas recursive neural networks operate on any hierarchical structure, combining child representations into parent representations, recurrent neural networks operate on the linear progression of time, combining the previous time step and a hidden representation into the representation for the current time step. I don't know what all that really means, but I copied and pasted it from wikipedia. Here's the link: Recurrent neural network    Embed Quote
