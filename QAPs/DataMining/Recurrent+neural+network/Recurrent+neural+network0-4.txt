★Is there a recurrent neural networks toolkit?Is there a toolkit for recurrent neural networks? I'm interested in using them for time series classification. The idea of a recurrent neural network is that sensor values are fed to the network one by one, so there is no embedding. I.e. the network has an internal state to represent past events.
