★What are the differences between auto-regressive networks and recurrent neural networks?
Autoregressive neural networks were introduced I believe in the '80 or '90 and are similar to what are now called autoencoders. The main difference in that the original autoregressive NN had 5 layers (input, mapping, bottleneck, demapping, and output) while the autoencoder has normally only 3 (input, hidden, and output). though the idea is that you can stack autoencoders. Recurrent neural networks are networks where connections don't only go "forward" but can connect back to previous layers. In this sense then you cannot really compare auto-regressive with recurrent.    Embed Quote
