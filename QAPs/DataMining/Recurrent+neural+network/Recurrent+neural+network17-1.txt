★Artificial Neural Networks: How are recurrent neural networks different from convolutional neural networks?
Convolutional neural networks - a type of feed-forward artificial neural network - are variations of multilayer perceptrons which are designed to use minimal amounts of preprocessing. Recurrent neural networks - unlike feedforward neural networks - can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.
