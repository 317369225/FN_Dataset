★Does it make sense to perform Principal Components Analysis (PCA) before clustering, if the original data has too many dimensions?Is it theoretically unsound to try to cluster data with no correlation?
Yes, it makes sense to try out PCA before clustering. It would help with reducing computations. But whether it affects the performance or not, it depends on distribution of data and correlation among various dimension. In fact its possible that it even worsen the performance for a particular data distribution, e.g. look at the image given below. using PCA for such distribution is a bad idea.                      Since, PCA is just going to select the direction of maximum variance, which may not be the best choice always. For the above given example, Fisher projection direction would be more discriminative. In short, try out PCA (and other dimensionality reduction techniques) since it may help, and finally choose the one which works best for you.    Embed Quote
