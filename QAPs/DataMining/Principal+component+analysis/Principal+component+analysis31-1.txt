★Why is it beneficial to center and normalize the data before running Principal Component Analysis on it?
Imagine you have a set of data X1, X2, X3, X4, ....  Imagine you do you a PCA, you get an answer. Now imagine I take those data and add some (different) constant number to each, so I get the X1+N1, X2+N2, X3+N3, X4+N4, ....   All I've done is shift where the data lie in space, but I have done nothing to change the relative configuration of the data.  I would expect the PCA would give the same answer as it did before.  Now, adding all those numbers does nothing but change the means.  So, I would expect that, to get the same answer from the PCA, I ought to remove the means.    Embed Quote
