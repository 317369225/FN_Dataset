★Is there any difference between PCA (Principal component analysis) and random projection when preprocessing data?I do not understand why random projection, if it is random get subset of features, the possible subsets are a huge amount(lets we have 1000 features, the possible subsets will be much huge pospocinal to 1000) so I think random projection is impossible.
Both are defining a projection from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space -- picking a small set of basis vectors in the high-dimensional space that can be used as a basis (to "explain") the data in the low-dimensional space of these few new basis vectors. The major difference is that PCA is trying hard to pick the "best" basis vectors by looking for directions in which the original data varies most. Random projection is picking the directions randomly! The point is that random projects may be 'worse' because they're blindly picked, but may not be much worse at all, and of course picking them randomly is much faster than running PCA. You seem to be talking about something else, which is feature selection. This is something you might do on the reduced set of features, but is not what random projection or PCA do per se. You can work backwards from the feature selection in the reduced space to figure out which original features seemed most predictive.    Embed Quote
