★In which situations one can apply multidimensional scaling but cannot apply principal component analysis (PCA)?Could you give an example of a particular dataset?
It's not so much of "can apply" vs. "cannot apply" it's more a question of what you are trying to find out. MDS tries to find out what traits people are using to judge similarity.  PCA tries to create a small number of variables that capture most of the variance in a large number of variables. But, as to your exact question: Suppose you have data from N people on how similar they think Q objects are. If that is all the data you have, you can apply MDS but not PCA.    Embed Quote
