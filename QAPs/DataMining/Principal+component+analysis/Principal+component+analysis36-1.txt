★What are some cases where principal component analysis fails to find good projection directions?
One example would be when there are commingled samples that differ substantially by means. PCA often fails to uncover this issue. This is a link to an article in JRSS-C on the topic, alas paywalled: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2347949 Other nonlinear situations can be problematic, which is why methods such as independent components analysis can be important. Also, you can have problems if you apply PCA to skewed data, such as binary data. It is also not good at discrimination. If you have a discrimination problem you should use a method that's targeted at that, such as PLS-DA.    Embed Quote
