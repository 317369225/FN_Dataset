★Quantitative Finance: Are there any analogies between portfolio optimization and principal component analysis?
While there has been a lot of research done on this field, from my limited experience, PCA does not lend itself very well to portfolio optimization because the principle components tend to be vague; they're neither tradable securities nor qualitative factors. The two most common approaches are factor models (which break down the risk of a security into [not necessarily orthogonal] qualitative factors, and optimize over that), and security models (where each security is its own risk factor). One notable exception to this is in rates: the principle components of rates instruments are somewhat intuitive, like parallel-shift, twist e.t.c. Secondly, your components are only as good as the historical data you have, and markets change all the time (for what it's worth, this is an issue that plagues most approaches, not just PCA).    Embed Quote
