★How can I decide which type of data—mean corrected data or standardized data—is to be used in principal component analysis?
You're almost certainly going to center the data as it is unlikely that the overall level of the variables is of substantive importance, although there are some cases in which it might be. Standardization by normalizing all variances to 1 is a more difficult choice. There are reasons why you want to, but if the original scale of the variables means something it might be better to leave them in a more meaningful metric. Gross differences in scale are highly problematic, though.    Embed Quote
