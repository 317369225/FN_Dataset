★What are some uses of principal component analysis besides reducing the number of features (a.k.a dimensionality reduction)?I've only seen it being used as a step to reduce the number of features before applying another algorithm.
PCA is an exact solution to the Total Least Squares problem and this can be proven provided you weight the covariance matrix with measurement errors. If we don't have the weighting matrix upfront, we can use Prof. Shankar Narasimhan's iterative PCA to estimate both a row space for the constraint matrix (ie. the relationship between the different variables) as well as the weighting matrix. This particular application is very useful for Control Engineering. ref: Narasimhan, Shankar, and Sirish L. Shah.
