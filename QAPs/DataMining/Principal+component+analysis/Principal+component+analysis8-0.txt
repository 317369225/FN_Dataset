★How does canonical correlation analysis (CCA) compare to principal component analysis (PCA)?Looking for any answers, but preferably less technical ones as I am asking as a biologist that understands PCA, but is interested to know more about how it compares to CCA, and vice versa.
Principal component analysis is a dimensionality reduction method.  You might start with samples from a 100-dimensional distribution, and throw away all but the first five principal components, and then you're working with a five-dimensional dataset. Canonical correlation analysis, on the other hand, is a method for comparing draws from two different multivariate distributions.  The trick is that you come up with a single quantity for each distribution, and you pick them in such a way that they're as correlated as possible.  If that's not very correlated, then you know that there's no really strong linear relationship between the two datasets. Both methods are a little bit more complicated than that, but I think this gets across the gist of it.    Embed Quote
