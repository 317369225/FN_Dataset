★Is there any difference between PCA (Principal component analysis) and random projection when preprocessing data?I do not understand why random projection, if it is random get subset of features, the possible subsets are a huge amount(lets we have 1000 features, the possible subsets will be much huge pospocinal to 1000) so I think random projection is impossible.
Sometimes the data is simply too huge for PCA. Also, PCA makes a lot of assumptions about the data (normal distribution), which may not be true. I'm not an expert, but I think the idea is to do multiple random projections to narrow down on useful features. I myself work on smaller datasets, so PCA is usually fine.    Embed Quote
