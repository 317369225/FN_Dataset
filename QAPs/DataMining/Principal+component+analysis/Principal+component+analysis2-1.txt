★What is principal component analysis?in super layman terms.
Just a few things to add to Peter's answer. PCA (usually) refers to a specific form of dimension reduction where the principle components are drawn on the sequentially orthogonal axes of the largest variance. In mathematical terms, it is a transformation of your X variables into the PC space, while keeping all the information as a whole. When I first learned principal components analysis I was taught that it was an observational/descriptive technique. I like the view of "observational," because it provides some practical lessons: 1. There are specifically designed methods for doing modeling/inferences which are based on principle components, and shouldn't be confused with PCA 2. PCA is commonly misapplied and misinterpreted, and treating it as an observational method helps take a step back from reading too much into its results.  Most importantly, the PCs are drawn based on the largest variances and nothing else.  Large variances are usually meaningful (e.g. they commonly provide excellent separation of two clusters), but not necessarily.    Embed Quote
