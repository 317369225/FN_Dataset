★Digital Signal Processing: Are there any resources for Principal Component Analysis on images in frequency domain?I am thinking of compact representation images consisting of repetitive structurues. So I was wondering if people have already considered the utility of PCA and image 2D fourier transform for such a task. Any comments/suggestions welcome
It seems like a great idea. First of all, transform domain compacts energy of the image, making it possible to reconstruct the image with a few coefficients. Now, you want to couple this with PCA. One thing you need to make sure when you apply PCA is that, images needs to be aligned. The problem is hard as the repetitive structure you are talking about may not be aligned in the same way in all images. Consider a table, now the table has to be perfectly at same angle for PCA to work. This is the reason when eigen faces is done for facial images, the images are cropped out to remove background information.    Embed Quote
