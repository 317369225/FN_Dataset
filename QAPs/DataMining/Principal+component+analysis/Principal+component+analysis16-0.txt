★For which cases is it not preferable to use principal component analysis (PCA)?
PCA is an unsupervised technique which can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. PCA finds the representation of the data such that it is most uncorrelated in that representation. PCA is not suitable in many cases: For example, if all the components of PCA have quite a high variance, there is no 'good' universal stopping rule that allows you to discard some exact 'k' Principal Components, with a guarantee that there will be no 'significant' ( for your application) loss of data in the compression. Secondly, it is not suitable for some classification problem. Suppose there are 2 classes of your data, but the within class variance is very high as compared to between class variance, PCA might result in you discarding the very information that separates your two classes. In other words, if your data is noisy, and the noise variance is more than the variance between means of the two classes, then PCA will keep the noise components, and let you discard the distinguishing component( This is expected, since PCA is unsupervised). This makes data in the lower space to be indistinguishable. So, domain knowledge is very important while choosing whether to go forward with PCA or not. There are always some other techniques which can be used instead.    Embed Quote
