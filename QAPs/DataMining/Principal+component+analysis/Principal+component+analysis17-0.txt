★What is the difference between principal component analysis (PCA) and feature selection in machine learning? Is PCA a means of feature selection?
Both methods reduce dimensionality (# of predictors). PCA combines similar (correlated) attributes and creates new ones. Superior to original attributes. Feature selection doesn't combine attributes. Just evaluates their quality, predictive power and select the best set. Benefit in PCA is that combination of N attributes is better than any individual attribute. Disadvantage is in harder explanation what exactly that PCA component means. You can combine both methods: Create PCA components and then run feature selection. In business consulting I'm not using PCA at all, just FS. Sacrificing a bit of predictive power to get more understandable model is my proven strategy.    Embed Quote
