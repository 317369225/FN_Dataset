★How can I decide which type of data—mean corrected data or standardized data—is to be used in principal component analysis?
The idea behind normalizing is that it is a variance maximizing exercise. You could do either, or try both, as Peter mentioned. If it is computationally not feasible for you to try both, then I'd say you randomly subsample your data and try it out on that. What ever works better on the subsample should, ideally work on the overall sample. To be on the safer side you could repeat this subsampling experiment a couple of times to be sure. That being said, historically standardization has been more frequently used.    Embed Quote
