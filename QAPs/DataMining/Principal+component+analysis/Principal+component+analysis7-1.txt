★Are there implicit Gaussian assumptions in the use of PCA (principal components analysis) ?
The mean vector and covariance matrices are sufficient statistics for the multivariate Gaussian. So in the sense that PCA usually annihilates the mean vector and only considers the covariance matrix, there is a hidden assumption of the data being multivariate Gaussian. How important this is depends on one's desired application. For instance, various hypothesis tests or confidence intervals that are sometimes used in PCA depend on multivariate normality. The main thing is that PCA is a least squares procedure, so if you have data that are really not well-modeled by least squares as-is, the PCA solution can be quite strongly pulled by it and you'll need to take steps to fix that issue. For instance, categorical PCA methods like correspondence analysis use a weighted least squares and maximum likelihood methods such as RC models make use of an iteratively updated least squares in the form of Poisson loglinear models.    Embed Quote
