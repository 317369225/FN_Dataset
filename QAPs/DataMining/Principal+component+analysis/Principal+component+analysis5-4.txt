★Principal Component Analysis: What is the intuitive meaning of a covariance matrix?If a matrix is a linear operator that transform space in a certain way, what transformation does a covariance matrix produce?
A covariance matrix does not define any transformation. It is a  statistic that we can calculate from our data such as mean vector.  consider as a vector of random variables.  each element of a covariance matrix is the covariance between ith &  jth random variables. so the main diagonal entries are variances. But  you can use the covariance matrix to obtain some transform on the data.  for example in PCA you can compute eigen-decomposition of the  covariance matrix and use the matrix of eigenvectors to transform the  data. In this way the transformation decorrelates the data and you can  project the data onto the directions with maximum variance. (eigen  values correspond to variances) After the transformation of the data with PCA, If you compute the covariance matrix of the transformed data you can see easily it is a diagonal matrix. (the transofrmation decorrelates the data).    Embed Quote
