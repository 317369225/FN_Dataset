★Is it appropriate to apply principal components analysis on data that follows a discrete distribution?Or for that matter, a panel of data with discrete and continuously distributed variables?
Re: discrete data, I sure hope so.  It's standard practice in survey research to do PCA (usually with a varimax rotation) on discretely-scaled blocks of questions. Specifically, many surveys will include sections where respondents indicate agreement or disagreement with statements along a discretely-scaled spectrum (so-called Likert scales).  There might be 10, 15, or even 25 statements that respondents are reacting to along the same scale.  PCA can help detect relationships among the statements, which can be useful for summarizing the data, segmenting the respondents, or for identifying redundant statements that can be collapsed or eliminated from the next iteration of the survey. As far as mixing discrete and continuous variables, it's best to do PCA on variables that are scaled similarly.  So it's not only best to avoid mixing continuous and discrete, but also to avoid mixing discrete on a 5-point scale with discrete on a 7-point scale.  Depending on the data, it may be more appropriate to perform some transformations to get everything on a similar scale before putting it into a PCA.    Embed Quote
