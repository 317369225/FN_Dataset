★Why is it beneficial to center and normalize the data before running Principal Component Analysis on it?
Technically PCA includes centering (mean subtraction) of the data. This is done in order to calculate the covariance matrix. Eigendecomposition is then applied to the covariance matrix,  with the eigenvalues corresponding to the variance of the data along the eigenvectors. An alternative, but equivalent approach, is to use a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix. Mean subtraction must be done prior to the SVD in order for this to be equivalent. Normalization (dividing by the variance) is not necessary.    Embed Quote
