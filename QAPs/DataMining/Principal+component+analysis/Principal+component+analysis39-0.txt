★What aspects of principal component analysis are subjective, and why is this not necessarily a bad thing?
Nothing about PCA is entirely subjective. But there are many options and choosing among them is partly subjective. How many components to retain? Which extraction method to use? Which rotation method to use? Is this a bad thing? I don't know. But it's a necessary thing. There are also subjective aspects of other statistical methods such as regression. Indeed, there are subjective aspects of every phase of research, starting with "what should I study?" and ending with "Where should I submit my article?"    Embed Quote
