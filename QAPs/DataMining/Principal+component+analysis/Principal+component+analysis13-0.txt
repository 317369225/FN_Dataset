★How does independent component analysis differ from principal component analysis?
ICA basically looks for statistical independence whereas PCA looks for orthogonal components which are uncorrelated. ICA maximizes non-gaussianity whereas PCA maximizes variance in the components. ICA is actually a generalization of PCA because the constraint of orthogonality is not present in ICA. PCA is a preprocessing step in many ICA algorithms. PCA only looks at second order statistics (variance) but ICA usually looks at higher order statistics (e.g. kurtosis) Hope that is useful!    Embed Quote
