★How does principal component analysis work?
Here is a quick overview from Wikipedia. "...a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components." Orthogonal means 90 degrees apart and the transformation makes the variables uncorrelated.  The biggest principal component has the largest variance.  The process is used to take many possibly correlated input variables and reduce the data set to those you most care about and study those or spend your time investigating in more detail.
