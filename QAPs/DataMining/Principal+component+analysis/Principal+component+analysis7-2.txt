★Are there implicit Gaussian assumptions in the use of PCA (principal components analysis) ?
PCA is that it is simply a rigid rotation of your original data matrix.  In other words, you have a cloud of points in multiple dimensions.  All that is meant by 'rigid rotation' is that your eyeball changes its location in viewing this cloud.  So there are no assumptions in PCA.  However, the underlying distribution of the raw data will influence the arrangement of points, and may sometimes confound interpretation.   In ecology, the 'Horseshoe' or Guttman effect is an example how an underlying model (in this case, the unimodal distributions of species along gradients) can affect the arrangement of points in a PCA, in a way that can result in misinterpretation.  But it has little to do with the underlying statistical distributions of the data.    Embed Quote
