★In factor analysis or principal component analysis, how can I calculate the variance explained by each factor after using an oblique rotation?
I would argue that the notion of "variance explained by a factor" is not very meaningful after oblique rotation, since the factors are inter-correlated and thus explain some of the same variance. If you sum the squared structure coefficients you get an overly large number. If you do a promax rotation you might consider reporting the variance explained by factors after the initial orthogonal rotation (Promax begins with a Varimax rotation and then applies a procrustean rotation to force the factors to fit their loadings raised to a power). However, that's just getting around my anti-answer that variance explained has less meaning following oblique rotation.    Embed Quote
