★Are principal component analysis and linear regression interchangeable? If not, why? When is it recommended to use each one?I'm getting into Machine Learning and this question popped up into my mind.
They are not interchangeable. Linear regression fits a model where f(x) is a linear function, like a + bx. We can use it for inference and prediction. Principal component analysis is a method (not sure if I can call it method) to extract principal components which are linear and orthogonal representations of the data. You can represent very wide datasets with 2 or 3 components which is very useful for ML. I've stumbled on pages with code to run regressions from PCA but I've never done it myself so I'm not really sure how it behaves. On the other hand, linear models cannot be used for feature extraction which is a common use of PCA, hence, they are not interchangeable.    Embed Quote
