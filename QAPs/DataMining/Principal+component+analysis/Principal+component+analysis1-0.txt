★Quantitative Finance: Are there any analogies between portfolio optimization and principal component analysis?
Mathematically, portfolio optimization involves inverting a matrix, while PCA involves finding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  Clearly, if you perform PCA, finding the inverse is easy, but it would be using a more powerful than necessary tool to solve a problem.  There are probably ways in which PCA can help portfolio optimization in some cases.  For example, keeping only the first components can possibly reduce noise.  However, that is problem specific and may or may not actually add value.  There are other ways to manipulate the covariance matrix, too, and PCA is just one of many approaches. As far as the broader question of combining bad strategies to produce a good one, you can improve risk-adjusted returns by combining strategies, but if none of your strategies has positive returns to begin with, there is not much you can do.    Embed Quote
