★Quantitative Finance: Are there any analogies between portfolio optimization and principal component analysis?
Perhaps amusingly, several commercial equity risk model vendors, most notably APT (now owned by SunGard)  use PCA (plus other methods) to construct risk models from historical returns. This is in contrast to risk models, such as Barra's, which use fundamental factors, such as market cap. By looking only at the largest eigenvalued components of the returns covariance matrix, they make the optimization problem more tractable and reduce the noise as Vladimir Novakovski mentioned. As is well-known, estimating and using full returns covariance matrices for portfolio construction suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and is just generally unwieldy.  These risk models are then used inside a mean-variance portfolio optimization problem to construct optimal portfolios. PCA risk models are sometimes claimed to be more sensitive to emergent sources of risk, since the factors are not determined a priori. On the other hand, their detractors cite the difficulty in aligning PCA risk factors with tangible economic quantities.    Embed Quote
