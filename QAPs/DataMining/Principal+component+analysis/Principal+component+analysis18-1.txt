★What are the motivations for the use of "Principal Components Analysis" besides the computational ease of finding them?
There are three basic reasons why someone might want to perform a principal component analysis: To find attributes inherent to the data, rather than using the ones defined by (possibly arbitrarily selected) features. I think the image in Daniel McLaury's answer explains this pretty well. This, arguably, is only a superficial benefit. Often, after transforming data, not all components are retained. This is a good way for reducing dimensionality of the data, while retaining the "most important" attributes. A number of mathematical technique require that all dimensions be orthogonal. Principal components also ensure this, while keeping most of the other relevant properties intact.    Embed Quote
