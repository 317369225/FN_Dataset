★What are the main differences between a principal component analysis and a factor analysis?
Mathematically, PCA is just the simplest type of factor analysis - eigenvector extraction, no rotations, no transformations.  However, from a practical standpoint, PCA is observational, and FA is a modeling approach. From a practical standpoint, PCA, by itself, is observational.  While there is an underlying model implicit in PCA, there isn't really one explicitly. It just simply looks for each subsequent principal component that accounts for the greatest variance.  Factor analysis, in contrast, explicitly attempts to model underlying "latent variables."  While it also (usually) starts off with principal components, they are rotated in order to improve interpretability.  The typical goal in factor analysis is to identify variables that are related to one another, and separate them from others (a form of variable clustering); rotations help improve this interpretation. Note: A really annoying reality is that "principal component analysis" means several different things in the context of factor analysis.  I've seen simple forms of factor analysis called "principal component analysis," but then differentiated from "factor analysis."  And I've seen some people differentiate "principal co-ordinate analysis."  Be wary of this, especially if you read any literature.    Embed Quote
