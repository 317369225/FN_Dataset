★Does it make sense to perform Principal Components Analysis (PCA) before clustering, if the original data has too many dimensions?Is it theoretically unsound to try to cluster data with no correlation?
Actually, you are doing two different things.  When you perform PCA you collapse the variables (first normalize). when you perform cluster analysis you collapse the rows.  It has nothing to do with clustering data with no correlation.  The real problem with doing this is that it becomes more difficult to interpret since you are looking at clusters in terms of transformed and factorized, as opposed to the original variables themselves    Embed Quote
