★How does principal component analysis work in image processing?
PCA is basically used to project your signals to a lower dimensional subspace with the constraint of preserving the maximum amount of variance. What this means is that if you have a set of vectorized images, PCA allows you to find a common structure among them while conserving the differences as much as possible. One of the most popular uses of PCA is Eigenfaces used for Face Recognition. Another application of PCA is dimensionality reduction of Feature descriptors. Feature descriptors are generally very high dimensional as they encode the local or global data of an image. In such a case, in order to brign the problem to a more manageable level as well as to reduce the bias of your dataset, you would use PCA to generate lower dimensional feature descriptors.    Embed Quote
