★Is it appropriate to apply principal components analysis on data that follows a discrete distribution?Or for that matter, a panel of data with discrete and continuously distributed variables?
You can always calculate it, of course. It is often misleading, though. What tends to happen if you have skewed variables with PCA is that the correlations will be limited by the margins. With discrete responses like Likert type responses this is pretty common. Discretization in general tends to inflate the dimensionality of PCA, which can't gracefully cope with the nonlinear relationships among the variables and ends up making spurious dimensions to cope with the nonlinearity. In the old days of factor analysis these were called "difficulty factors." One simple adaptation is to use multiple or joint correspondence analysis. This is a generalization of PCA that uses Pearson chi square to weight category scores. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C... Other methods such as log-multiplicative analysis have some notable advantages, such as a proper framework for ilikelihood inference, but are more difficult to fit.
