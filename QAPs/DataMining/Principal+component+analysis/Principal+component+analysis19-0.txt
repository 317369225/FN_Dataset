★Does it make sense to perform Principal Components Analysis (PCA) before clustering, if the original data has too many dimensions?Is it theoretically unsound to try to cluster data with no correlation?
Two parts to this answer: Infact, PCA can be seen as a way to do k-means clustering itself (equivalently NNMF a way to do Spectral Clustering). This connection is posited as an additional explanation of the success of PCA beyond the idea that it helps eliminate noise. For more details look at this paper by Chris Ding et al. http://ranger.uta.edu/~chqding/p... The principal components can be thought of as continuous solutions to the cluster membership problem (see the figure on page 3 of the above and it would be immediately clear). [Edit: I just saw another answer saying the same thing, but I will still keep this part here] Second: It might be useful to do PCA before you want to run clustering. I know you are talking of running PCA on the data. But in Spectral Clustering running k-means clustering on the principal components of a representation of the data (specifically the Graph Laplacian of the data matrix) is a standard methodology  (see for example the algorithms on page 7 here http://www.kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/... ). However note that doing PCA on the data will not always help. It might help if the data can be thought to be generated by a linear combination of some factors of variation whose number is lesser than the dimensionality of the data.    Embed Quote
