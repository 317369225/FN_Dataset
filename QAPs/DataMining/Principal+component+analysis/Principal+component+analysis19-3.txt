★Does it make sense to perform Principal Components Analysis (PCA) before clustering, if the original data has too many dimensions?Is it theoretically unsound to try to cluster data with no correlation?
PCA is clustering.  PCA is equivalent to a variant of Kmeans I think what  you are looking for is  spectral clustering.  I wrote up some notes on my blog: http://charlesmartin14.wordpress... Its a work in progress but I tried to lay out the basic ideas. You would run Kmeans in a subspace of the Generalized / Normalized Laplacian (not necessarily the covariance matrix, as in PCA)    Embed Quote
