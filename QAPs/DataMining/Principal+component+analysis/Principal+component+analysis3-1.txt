★How is principal component analysis used in machine learning?
If you have an N-dimensional data vector, you can find the "manifold" that represents the N-dimensional vector in K-dimensions where K << N. These K-dimensions capture the variation in the N-dimensional data vector. You can accomplish the transformation from N to K using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a standard technique for learning any form of data including time-series, images (eigenfaces), etc. It provides an "explanation" of an input-data based on its principal components and based on that you can do classification.    Embed Quote
