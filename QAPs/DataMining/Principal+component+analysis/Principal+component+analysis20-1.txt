★In which situations one can apply multidimensional scaling but cannot apply principal component analysis (PCA)?Could you give an example of a particular dataset?
MDS is applied to a distance matrix (n x n). PCA is applied to a variance-covariance matrix (p x p). If you only have a distance matrix, you're stuck with MDS.  MDS may be easier to do in some cases when all you have is a distance matrix and n <<< p (but if you have all the data, you still can do PCA).  Finally, I'll re-emphasize Peter Flom's point that they were originally designed for different purposes. All that said, PCA is regularly applied for separating out observations, usually because people don't know how do use MDS.  PCA usually does a pretty good job of it too, but it has a lot of pitfalls - measuring things by the highest variance is often sample biased or meaningless.  But MDS also has its problems - it's much more subjective.  Choosing how to draw the distance matrix and deciding how many dimensions to use can greatly change the results.    Embed Quote
