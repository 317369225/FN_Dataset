★How can I decide which type of data—mean corrected data or standardized data—is to be used in principal component analysis?
Depends on how your data looks like and what you wish to achieve (does it make sense?). I don't think standardization is really necessary (most of the time). I would rather mean-correct first. If you go to full standardization, you basically end up with a Factor Analysis (your covariates would be correlations as well if I'm not mistaken)    Embed Quote
