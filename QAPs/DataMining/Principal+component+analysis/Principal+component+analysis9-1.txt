★Is there any difference between PCA (Principal component analysis) and random projection when preprocessing data?I do not understand why random projection, if it is random get subset of features, the possible subsets are a huge amount(lets we have 1000 features, the possible subsets will be much huge pospocinal to 1000) so I think random projection is impossible.
I am not sure here, but I think I have read a paper, where they used random projections and grew trees for each of these. It is on the lines of boosting, or random forest, but the features are first randomly projected on the reduced subspace. As others mentioned, this can give you a fast way to process the input feature, and also can avoid over fitting.    Embed Quote
