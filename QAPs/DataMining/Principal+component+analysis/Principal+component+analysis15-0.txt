★Is it necessary to normalize eigenvectors when doing Principal Component Analysis?
The PCA solutions are the eigenvectors of the symmetric covariance matrix, which have an orthonormal form (and hence normalized) by the spectral decomposition theorem. This form is not unique though and you can scale each eigenvector. For optimal reconstruction you multiply by the inverse of the eigenmatrix, which is simply its transpose when it's orthonormal. If you scaled the columns of the matrix (and made them non-normalized) then you need to multiply the rows of the transpose by the inverse of that scaling to obtain the inverse. This is completely equivalent in terms of reconstruction.    Embed Quote
