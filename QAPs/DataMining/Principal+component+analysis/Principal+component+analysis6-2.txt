★What is an intuitive explanation of principal component analysis for the mathematically immature?
Let's say you have a huge data set and you have to play Twenty Questions to find the "right item." You wouldn't want to ask a question where the answer would almost always be "yes," because that hardly narrows things down most of the time.  You *really* don't want to ask a series of questions where if one answer is "yes" the other answers will also be "yes," because that's practically like asking just one question.  So what you want to do is come up with a technique that lets you ask a series of questions where you have practically no idea what the answer to the each question will be.  Most data sets will have variables that aren't binary, but the same idea applies: a series of maximally "uninformative" ways of looking at the data tells you what the interesting differences are in this set, gives you the most information in the technical sense.   If you want to summarize your data in as few dimensions as possible and maybe fit it all on one graph, this will tell you which dimensions to focus on. If this helps:  Imagine all your data points floating in space.  PCA tells you how to rotate the data set to look at it from the most informative angle.    Embed Quote
