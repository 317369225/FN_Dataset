★What are the motivations for the use of "Principal Components Analysis" besides the computational ease of finding them?
PCA was famously used by the geneticist Lucas Cavalli-Sforza to study the flow of genetic material across populations. I'm not familiar with the technique myself, but maybe Cavalli-Sforza has written up a summary of why he used it. In short, though, he took a bunch of genes (N = a lot) and measured the distribution of these genes geographically. He hypothesized that population migrations led to dispersal of certain combinations of genes across a geographic area. So, the principal bases in his data (the ones with the most variation) might correspond to population movements.    Embed Quote
