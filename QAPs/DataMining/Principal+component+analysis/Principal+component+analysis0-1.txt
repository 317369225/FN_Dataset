â˜…How does one implement Principal Component Analysis?I am doing a minor project which involves reducing the dimensions of images using PCA.Therefore I need to know the algorithm used to implement PCA.
This is probably the best explanation of PCA I have found - www.ce.yildiz.edu.tr/personal/.../principal_componentsprincipal_components.pdf. It not only provides a solid foundation on the mathematical concepts one needs to master to understand PCA, but also goes ahead and gives you an explanation of how it can be applied to the computer vision domain. It has the complete MATLAB code in the same document that you can use.
