★How does canonical correlation analysis (CCA) compare to principal component analysis (PCA)?Looking for any answers, but preferably less technical ones as I am asking as a biologist that understands PCA, but is interested to know more about how it compares to CCA, and vice versa.
In PCA we learn a single subspace where we project all the datapoints. The basis vectors for the subspace is learned so as to maximize the variance of the data. Here all the datapoints must have the same dimension. In CCA however, the datapoints may have two different dimensions. For example, consider SIFT representation  "x_i" and HOG representation "z_i " of an image "i". Aim of CCA is to project all "x_i" 's to one subspace and all "z_i" 's to another subspace so that the projected "x_i" 's and corresponding projected "z_i" 's have maximum correlation.    Embed Quote
