★What are some cases where principal component analysis fails to find good projection directions?
Depending on your definition of "good projections", this can be one case where PCA does not perform well. In classification problem, when the differentiating characteristics of the classes are not reflected in variance of the variables, PCA may not be a good choice of data processing. This is because PCA does not take into account class information when calculating the principal components. See the image below, where we have two original dimensions (variables) x and y and two classes red and green. The dimension with the highest variance is the blue axis e, which PCA will pick as the first principal component. However, you may see that if you use only this principal component, it will make classification more difficult as the data points from red and green classes are dispersed quite evenly along this principal component. @Source and image credit: Victor Lavrenko    Embed Quote
