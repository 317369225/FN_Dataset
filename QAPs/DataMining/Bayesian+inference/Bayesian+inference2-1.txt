Bayesian Inference: In what way is Bayes' law unscientific?
Well, mathematicians aren't scientists, so our opinions on what is and isn't scientific aren't really that relevant. That said, Bayesian methods are about how you should change your current beliefs given new information.  Of course, this means that they'll give different answers to different people based on their personal biases.  That's a bit unsettling if you're at least nominally trying to arrive at the truth. More technically, to use Bayesian methods you need to choose priors, and there does not seem to be any way of doing this "scientifically;" you just make them up.  Of course, there are arbitrary choices in traditional frequentist statistics, notably the choice of a cutoff for what represents statistical significance.    Embed Quote
