Is there any example in Bayesian inference that even with infinitely many data points the effect of the prior cannot be "washed out"?
If is your prior and is the observed data, then according to the product rule . This is standard Bayesian inference on the unknown random variable . It follows that if is zero in some places, then no matter how ''strong'' the data () are, will still be zero at those same places. This is what another answerer called a "dogmatic prior". Yet another answerer gave the Dirac delta function as a special example of this. The moral of the story is to make sure there is non-zero probability mass for all possible/reasonable so that, at least in the limit, the data can determine the estimate .    Embed Quote
