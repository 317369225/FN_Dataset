Bayesian Inference: In what way is Bayes' law unscientific?
There are two big problem that statisticians had with Bayes theorem.  The first is that it allows you to believe in a theory more after you've seen an experiment.  Contrast that with Popper's approach, in which data can only disprove or fail to disprove a theory, and you see why there's a problem. The second is that prior selection seems arbitrary, and in some cases actually is.  That's still a hot topic today, and not everyone is entirely comfortable with some of the arbitrary choices involved. That said, it was really only the academic statistical community that had an issue with Bayesian methods.  Pretty much everybody else was using it and very happy with the results.  See The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy for a detailed history.    Embed Quote
