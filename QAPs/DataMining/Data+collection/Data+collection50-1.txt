How do you analyze web survey data (collected from online survey tools such as surveymonkey.com) to create clusters that help shape design personas?
The first step would be to clean the data, removing junk or incomplete responses. Secondly, perform factorial or determinant analysis to weed out the questions that aren't significantly differentiating the respondents. This will leave you with just those questions that account for the major variation between your respondents. The third step would then be, as Lisa states, to perform one of several varieties of cluster analysis, which groups your respondents into collections of people with similar responses - on aggregate. The issue you'll have to keep an eye on is that your determinant analysis doesn't leave you with a set of questions that aren't useful in predicting or distinguishing behaviour, since this is a key objective of personas. If that happens it suggests either you have a single group of users as far as behaviour is concerned, or you were asking the wrong questions. Steve    Embed Quote
