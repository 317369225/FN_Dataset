What is wrong in the data collection programs by the NSA and United States?
I like Cory Doctorow's explanation / answer to your question. In "Little Brother" he discusses the concept that many have of "if you're not doing anything wrong, what do you have to hide...?" His explanation, paraphrased - you crap, like everyone, right? And you, like everyone, spend time naked, right? So, if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't have a problem with a law that requires you to walk around naked and, when you need to defecate, do so on a pedestal in the center of your town. Right? Privacy is something required to preserve dignity. The US government has determined that your dignity and privacy are not important. I believe it is. So I won't be crapping in the town center anytime soon. And I imagine the President, nor the Congress or Supreme Court, will be doing so either. And the crap that comes out of their mouths to justify their lack of ideals / ethics doesn't count.    Embed Quote
