What is a good method for mobile data collection?
Choosing a method for data collection depends on your aims. Here are a couple questions to ask: What type of data are you collecting? Market research, patient information, customer feedback, inspection, process checklist, etc. Will there be respondents? Where are you going to be collecting data? In-person or online? Do you need an Internet connection to collect data? If so, make sure that the platform you choose has the ability to store data you have collected If you are collecting data online, consider you should use a web-based data collection tool, such as SurveyMonkey, TypeForm, Wufoo, SurveyGizmo, etc. QuickTapSurvey is the best method for offline mobile data collection and face-to-face data collection, using an iPad and Android tablet.
