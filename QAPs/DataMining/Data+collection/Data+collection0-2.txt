What is wrong in the data collection programs by the NSA and United States?
My biggest problem with what we know about the program today is that every part of it is a secret.  There is a secret court who issues a "warrant" (and they've apparently never denied a request), that is then executed upon by a known but secretive organization, using secret programs, making secret requests for data to private organizations.  Even assuming that the NSA is as effective at protecting our privacy (apparently 51% of the time is their goal) as they claim, the program could very easily and unknowingly to the rest of us be turned into exactly what most of us fear it has the potential to be.  And lets be clear, government organizations are very often used for personal gain or malice.  Just look at any small town politics.  There is no public oversight of the program that is accountable for protecting the liberties of individuals.  That is supposed to be the role of congress, but they enacted all the laws that make this arrangement possible. And while we're told that PRISM is an effective tool in stopping "terrorism", I have no way of knowing how they measure success of the program.  For all I know, the only thing that PRISM may have done is find a guy selling illegal fireworks on the 4th of July, and they consider that success. Jon Stewart said it best when responding to president Obama's assertion that the NSA is breaking no laws.  To paraphrase, "We're not upset that you're breaking laws, we're upset that you didn't have to."    Embed Quote Updated 15 Jul, 2013. 231 views.
