What is wrong in the data collection programs by the NSA and United States?
In mainstream music, all the audio that is recorded is manipulated and formed into a cohesive pattern that allows for an enjoyable experience.  This can also be applied to recordings of interviews and the like.  If an expert audio engineer can get a sample of your voice saying a few choice words, even from different conversations, he would be very capable of manipulating a statement, in your own voice, to paint you in whatever picture he/she cared to portray. The PRISM program, in conjunction with the fact that most of the Constitutionally PROTECTED (not granted) rights are being stripped away from Americans, would allow these governmental programs to target any person whom they deemed to be a threat.  This could, and in the history of most governments, will become an abused power.  "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." - John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, first Baron Acton (1834–1902)    Embed Quote
