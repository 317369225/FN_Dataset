There are enormous risks to individual freedom where the rules are unclear. Today, many new tools are marketed to us as consumers: FB, FaceTime, google plus, google chat, blogs, etc. Essentially, these tools conviently connect us with people in this thread (Quora), they connect use with our family, friends, and colleagues.
