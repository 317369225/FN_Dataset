What is a good method for mobile data collection?
I think mobile surveys are a great way to collect real-time super targeted data form customers and consumers. They can be used in a myriad of ways (e.g.during or post webinars to gather customer requested topics for future topics, for any product looking for further insights into the minds of their customers - what do they like about your product or dislike?), add a little freebie or discount announcement into before the actual survey and you might even end up with some unexpected brand ambassadors who are pleased with how important their opinions are and appreciated being rewarded. I came across Survey Anyplaces's tool, the have a great case study for an on pack promo using a mobile survey that yielded excellent results. http://surveyanyplace.com/on-pac...    Embed Quote Updated 23 May, 2014. 41 views.
