How do you analyze web survey data (collected from online survey tools such as surveymonkey.com) to create clusters that help shape design personas?
Steve Mulder's, The User Is Always Right (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obido...) is a great resource on this topic, with several chapters dedicated to it. As Steve points out, however, you probably can't create useful personas from survey data alone. Survey data is self reported and doesn't represent accurate behavioral data. You'll really want to conduct observational studies to guide your persona development. I recommend doing the observational studies first, since that will help you generate the questions you can use for your survey (and guide you to other quantitative analytics that will be useful). The survey then becomes a way of quantifying the qualitative attributes that you uncovered in your observational studies.    Embed Quote Updated 14 Jan, 2011. 602 views.
