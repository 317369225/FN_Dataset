★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
I don't know much about sub atomic particles, but isn't there something about Muons being able to catalize neucular fusion? Could this have some sort of a bearing on the problem?    Embed Quote
