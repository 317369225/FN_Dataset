★Why do we square when we can use fourth, sixth...powers  when calculating variance and standard deviation?Is there any particular reason/advantage to use RMS for standard deviation? Why can't we use nth root mean of nth powers? like n= 4 ,6,8....(even)
It might help if you think of variance as just a technique for accounting for distance.  But, the number itself is inflated, as a bi-product of accounting for the negative number, and the n-root is a correction factor.  Therefore any positive n power corrected by using the n-root will do.  And when you do the math, you find that the SD, which is meaningful for analysis, doesn't change with any other positive, even n...it just creates a whole lot more math to do.    Embed Quote
