★What is the difference between Relative Error and Standard Deviation?
Relative error Relative error is an Approximation error and is defined as: | ( (True value) - (Approximate value) ) / (True value) | It is defined whenever we approximate a true value with an approximate one. For example, if we approximate pi (3.14159...) by 3.14, our relative error would be: | (3.14159... - 3.14) / (3.14159...) |  = 0.0005... = 0.05% (approx.) Relative error is a measure for how good our approximation/observation is, relative to some underlying true value of a quantity we are measuring/approximating/observing. Standard Deviation Standard deviation is a measure of variation/dispersion from the average for a random variable, probability distribution, data set or statistical population. For a constant like pi, the standard deviation is zero! The difference Relative error is for an approximation, a measurement or an observation (observed value), while standard deviation is for a random variable, a probability distribution, a data set or a statistical population. Relative error is due to the shortcomings of the person or his equipment (approximator, observor), whereas standard deviation is an intrinsic property of the data (random variable/probability distribution/data set/population).    Embed Quote
