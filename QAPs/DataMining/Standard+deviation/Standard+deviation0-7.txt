★Is there an intuitive explanation for the difference between standard deviation and sample standard deviation?
I've explained this many times in class in various ways. None of them are really easy to get for students without a decent amount of mathematical sophistication, but most students seem to manage if you tell them:  "Variance is a little too small because we're using the data twice to estimate it. This matters in small samples but not so much in big ones. Dividing by N-1 fixes this up and makes it more accurate." Illustrate it a few times with concrete numbers using a small dataset and then with a larger one (this makes a great homework or class exercise). If any of them want to go farther in statistics they'll learn things like expected value or derivations and their understanding will become more precise. I would recommend getting a copy of Freedman, Pisani, and Purves, which probably has a good explanation, though not necessarily a simple one. (Statistics, 4th Edition: David Freedman, Robert Pisani, Roger Purves: 9788130915876: Amazon.com: Books) I've very much found that students' satisfaction with answers goes up when I tell them explicitly: "This is a simplified version. If you take more advanced courses you'll get the more complicated version that gives you  the details. If you really want to know now, take a look at these sources." That validates the point that their question is a meaningful one but that it's not the time to answer it in full detail. Most students seem to be OK with that. They don't get what they want exactly but they get something and aren't made to feel stupid for asking.    Embed Quote
