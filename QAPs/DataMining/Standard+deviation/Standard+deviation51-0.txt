★Why do we square when we can use fourth, sixth...powers  when calculating variance and standard deviation?Is there any particular reason/advantage to use RMS for standard deviation? Why can't we use nth root mean of nth powers? like n= 4 ,6,8....(even)
It's because the square root of the sum of squared differences of coordinates gives us the "distance" between two points, where by "distance" I mean the regular kind of distance (Euclidean) you measure with a ruler. Of course, we can define distance in many ways, but this one is particularly convenient. Using sums of squares to measure spread lets us carry over many geometric intuitions into data analysis; for example, partitioning "total variance" into "within group" and "between group" variance (this comes from the Pythagorean theorem). There is some more discussion at the end of Michael Hochster's answer to Why do we square instead of using the absolute value when calculating variance and standard deviation?    Embed Quote
