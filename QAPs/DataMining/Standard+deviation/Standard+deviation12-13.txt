★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
In short, the answer is toward the bottom of the article cited: "The other ... possibility is that muons  interact with protons in a fundamentally different way than electron ... Fundamental entities, such as the proton, should not be thought of as fixed and static 'particles'; but are, perhaps, better modelled as interacting antenna. Any transaction between two entities is a dynamic conversation; the properties of each individually, dependent upon the propagation properties of both (all) antenna involved in the transaction. Measurable physical properties, such as the magnetic and charge radius of one of the entities, are not fixed constants, but depend upon the properties of the entire arrangement. As an analogy, think of a wireless link; the properties of the link depend upon the properties of both transmitter and receiver. Likewise the gain pattern of each antenna is dependent upon the arrangement of all elements in the array. This can recognized in the similarity between the shape and form of electron orbitals, and antenna gain plots. A few nice examples here: Amos antennas (This is my personal perspective; and is not compatible in a strictly technical sense with currently recognised doctrine.)    Embed Quote
