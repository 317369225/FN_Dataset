★Why we should use standard deviation over mean? What type of problems can we solve with standard deviation?Please give some practical example .Thanks
Both, the estimates of the Mean and the Standard Deviation are important in a sample. A  Mean gives you an Arithmetic Average of a set of data points , estimating the actual average of the population from which the data came.  It is a single value which gives an idea of what the actual average might be in that population. It may or may not be exactly the same, since it is only an estimate. So, we want to know how much error does it have or how far away is it from the actual value? So we compute the Standard Deviation, which gives a measure of that error. It gives an estimate of the measure of the variation or the scatterness of the Data in the population around its Average value. Some values may be larger and some values may be smaller than the average value. So we measure those distances ( xbar-x) and square it to eliminate the positive or negative signs. Then we take the average of that quantity to get the Variance. The Square Root of that quantity gives the standard deviation, which is a good measure of how much The estimate of the Mean from that sample is.    Embed Quote
