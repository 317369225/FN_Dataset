★Can I find the standard deviation over a day from monthly data?I have monthly data and would like to calculate some statistics for a day. Is there any way to do this from monthly data? Specifically I'd like to find a daily standard deviation.
Hmm. I'm not sure that you can. I think you're asking more from the data than it can give. It's like zooming in on a bitmapped image and wanting it to be crystal clear. Now it is true that the variance of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of the variances, provided the variables are independent. If your situation is like that, then you can simply take your monthly variance and divide it by however many days you have in your months. But the variance of a sum of dependent random variables is not so simple and I'm not sure how you'd unpick it to get an individual variance. My guess is that your days are dependent on each other. Not wholly helpful, I'm afraid.    Embed Quote
