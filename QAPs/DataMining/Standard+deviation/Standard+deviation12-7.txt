★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
As others have pointed out, the proton is not solid. The proton is actually composed of quarks and gluons, as well as a whole lot of virtual particles (which you can think of as ripples caused by the presence of the quarks and gluons, kind of like the wake from a ship). In fact, we don't know what shape the proton is - we don't know the distribution of the quarks, gluons and virtual particles within the proton, and so we don't know the shape or, really, the size. Speculating wildly, I suspect the answer to your question is that the extra mass and close orbit of the muon affects the distribution of virtual particles in the proton, specifically, the close proximity of the muon causes the proton to flatten out a little on the muon side. If you average this effect over all orientations, you will end up with a proton that appears to have shrunk by a few percent.    Embed Quote
