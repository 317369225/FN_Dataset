★What does it mean when standard deviation is higher than the mean?In stats, if the standard deviation is higher then the average, what does that tell you about your data?
The standard deviation is a unit of measurement on the normal distribution. One standard deviation to the right from the mean, for example, contains about 34% of of the values within the distribution. The mean, on the other hand, is a measure of the average value in your distribution. Comparing the standard deviation to the mean is not a particularly meaningful comparison, I'm afraid.    Embed Quote
