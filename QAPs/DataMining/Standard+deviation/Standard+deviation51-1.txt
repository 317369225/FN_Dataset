★Why do we square when we can use fourth, sixth...powers  when calculating variance and standard deviation?Is there any particular reason/advantage to use RMS for standard deviation? Why can't we use nth root mean of nth powers? like n= 4 ,6,8....(even)
Because there is an implicit Gaussian error model--- in a Gaussian error model the probability of being a distance delta away from a mean value goes as the exponential of minus delta squared. Probabilities multiply, so the log-probability adds, and the log probability of a given error is the sum of the squares of the distances. This is why "sum-squares" is a good quantity to minimize in a fit. It's also mathematically convenient, because when you minimize, you take a derivative, and the derivative of squares is linear, and linear equations are easy to solve.    Embed Quote
