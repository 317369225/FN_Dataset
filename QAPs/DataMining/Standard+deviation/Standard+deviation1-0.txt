★Is there a term for the standard deviation of the standard deviation?Saying standard deviation of the standard deviation sounds a bit awkward. Is there a better way of saying this?
I prefer standard error of the standard deviation.  (Or usually, standard error of the variance.) Using the term "standard error" helps.  Standard error implies a standard deviation of a sampling distribution (i.e. a statistic).  The other nice thing is this automatically indicates you're talking about a statistic and not a parameter.  After all, a parameter itself (e.g. the population standard deviation) has no variance.    Embed Quote
