★Statistics (academic discipline): What is a standard deviation?
When you have a group of data, we all know what the average is.  Conceptually, it's the middle number.  Now, if we want to measure how far apart all the data is compared to the average, we could add up all ( x - average(x) ).  But that would give us zero, based on how we calculated the average! So, in order to measure variability, we instead add up all ( x - average(x) )^2 and divide by the number of x's added up.  Squaring the distance makes it positive, and it also exaggerates the importance of data members far away. Example, same average, different variability: s = {1, 11, 21} average = 11 variance = 67 s = {9, 10, 11} average = 11 variance = 0.67 Average - measures the center Variance - measures the variation between the numbers, or the spread of the data. Standard Deviation is the square root of Variance.  So it also measures variability, it is just more commonly reported.    Embed Quote
