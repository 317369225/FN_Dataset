★What other interesting properties would a probability distribution whose mean is equal to its standard deviation have?
None of what I am about to say is exactly true in general, but it should serve as a good guide for your intuition. The mean of a distribution is a central value.  What you learn from the mean is that you can expect values both larger and smaller than that value.  What you cannot learn is HOW MUCH larger and smaller those values will commonly be.  That's what the standard deviation tells you.  The more standard deviations you are away from the mean, the less likely the values of the random variable become.  (Chebyshev's Theorem actually gives a bound to this effect.) So what does it mean for the mean and standard deviation to agree?  It generally means that you'll see values around zero pretty often because zero is just one standard deviation away from the mean.  It doesn't really mean anything else at all.    Embed Quote
