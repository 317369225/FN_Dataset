★What does it mean when standard deviation is higher than the mean?In stats, if the standard deviation is higher then the average, what does that tell you about your data?
With respect, I disagree with Robert. Although the standard deviation is used as a unit of measurement on the normal distribution, that is not its sole function. It is more generally a measure of spread. The mean is a measure of location. The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean is called the coefficient of variation. This can be helpful in distinguishing two data sets that are given in different units. For example if we are comparing economic data from two different countries, the data might be quoted in different currencies. The coefficient of variation has no units and so a direct comparison is possible in circumstances where the mean and standard deviation cannot be directly compared. A similar ratio is the index of dispersion, which is the square of the standard deviation divided by the mean. In biology, for example, we might look at the locations of trees within a wood. An index of dispersion equal to 1 would indicate a dispersal consistent with a Poisson process, i.e. uniformly at random. A value greater than 1 would indicate greater variability than would be expected with a Poisson process; a value less than 1 would indicate less variation. In image processing, the signal-to-noise ratio can be calculated as the mean divided by the standard deviation (i.e. the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation). It can be used to determine the reliability of apparent image details. So there is a variety of circumstances under which we might compare the size of the mean and the standard deviation and derive useful results.    Embed Quote
