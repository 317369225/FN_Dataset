★Is variance another word for standard deviation?
Although the answer to this question seems straightforward, each of absolute standard deviation, variance and standard deviation (root of variance) are tools to describe how values and spread about a mean, which is often described in daily discourse as 'variance' . You can use any of these tools to gain knowledge about how much of a population varies about its mean (using the corresponding mappings between percentiles and whatever statistic we are using). But of course the mathematical definitions of these statistics are not equivalent.    Embed Quote
