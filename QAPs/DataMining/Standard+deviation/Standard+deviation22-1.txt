★Why are both standard deviation and variance taught and used if they are so similar?Are there uses so different to justify teaching kids two different concepts? Is there a simple way or concept to memorize which is the root of which? Are there different applications to both?
Variance is a primitive concept mathematically which has been devised to know the variation of each sample from its mean. Since the variation can be in both the directions with respect to mean, it makes mathematical sense to square the variations of each sample from its mean before finding the variance of a distribution. Since, we have squared the variations, the unit of variance is square of the unit of the actual data. So to express the deviation of a distribution from its mean in the same units as the data itself, standard deviation is defined as the square root of variance.      While teaching these concepts, similar emphasis should be put on both by pointing out the motivation behind these concepts and their respective properties. The difference between these two concepts is similar but the way of looking at them is subtly different.    Embed Quote
