★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
I was asked to answer this; it is pretty far out of my field of expertise but I'll give it a shot. First, the fact that the electron wave function is non-zero inside the proton is neither surprising nor important. The electron and the quarks that make up the proton only interact through the electromagnetic and weak forces. The weak interaction is negligible for all but the heavy nuclei and the electromagnetic is long range so the electron doesn't feel anything different from being inside the proton vs. outside, meaning it doesn't have a force to 'keep it out' like we have with classical objects. Neither the electron or the proton are solid like classical objects. As for the result itself, most likely it is due to some systematic error. I know that's the most boring answer there is; but, as the other answers have indicated, there isn't an easy way for the muon to make the proton smaller without having an effect elsewhere that we would have seen by now. We would need a lot more experimental evidence to even have a guess at what was happening if this result was correct..    Embed Quote
