★When building a portfolio, is it better to use an asset's past data to find its standard deviation, or to use its projected standard deviation?
Well that depends on what you mean by "projected." Using historical vol is basically a projection if you are using it to construct a portfolio. Are you using a GARCH estimation? Are you using implied vol? In general, each method will have advantages and disadvantages. However, if you believe that your projected distribution of returns variance will more accurately model the realized future variance than some alternative, then by all means you should use this projection. When trying to utilize mean-variance portfolio construction in practice, you will find that estimating volatility is one of your smaller problems.    Embed Quote
