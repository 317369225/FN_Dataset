★Given cumulative distributions, how do I find the mean and standard deviation (normal curve)?
Take the integral definitions of mean and variance, and perform a change of variables , :   ,       . This doesn’t require you to assume a normal distribution.  You can use these formulas as long as you have enough data points to approximate the inverse function to the desired accuracy.  Just the three data points you gave won’t be good enough (for example, they only bound when ), but if you have more information about the bottom half of the curve, this should be fine.    Embed Quote
