â˜…How do you calculate the standard deviation and what can it tell us?
Standard deviation is a measure of spread in a distribution and tells us how disperse the data is in your sample (and correspondingly, your population). This helps to describe whether most of your data is close to the average or far away, something that the mean alone can't tell you. To calculate standard deviation, take the square root of the average of the square difference from the mean across all points. To make it unbiased (well, corresponding to an unbiased variance, but that's for a different thread), instead of averaging by dividing by n, divide by n-1 if you're looking for an estimator of the population deviation from a sample.
