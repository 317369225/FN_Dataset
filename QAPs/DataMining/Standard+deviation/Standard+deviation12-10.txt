★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
My best thought would be that since the muon has a much higher probability of being located in or extremely close to the proton perhaps this effect is due to our incomplete understanding of the strong force. Perhaps the muon interacts with the quarks in some unknown/uncalculated way which changes its behavior either directly via E&M or more intriguingly but far far far less likely through the strong force itself.    Embed Quote
