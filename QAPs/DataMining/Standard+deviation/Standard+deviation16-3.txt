★Why do we square instead of using the absolute value when calculating variance and standard deviation?
We use the standard deviation because it's one useful way of describing the properties of the normal distribution.  We choose the normal distribution because of the Central Limit Theorem: a large number of independent choices approximates the normal distribution. The formula for the normal distribution involves a square: and ultimately, the standard deviation comes back to that same .  The derivation of that formula is more math than I'm even faintly comfortable typing here.  Ultimately, it derives from an integration over a circle whose area represents 100% probability and each point on the circle represents a pairing of possible outcomes.  A pretty good description of the math is at: http://ricardo.ifas.ufl.edu/aeb6...    Embed Quote
