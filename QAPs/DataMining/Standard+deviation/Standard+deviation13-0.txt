★Where can I find the volatility/Standard deviation of a stock?
I think you are better off looking at the Beta of a stock, which is the standard deviation of the stock times its correlation with the market divided by the standard deviation of the market. where is the return of the stock and is the return of the market portfolio. This is because generally you should hold diversified portfolios, in which case it's not the individual standard deviations that matter, but that of the entire portfolio. (So the SD doesn't matter given the beta if you diversify) You can get that information on websites like Google Finance. See "Beta: 1.19" on http://www.google.com/finance?q=....    Embed Quote
