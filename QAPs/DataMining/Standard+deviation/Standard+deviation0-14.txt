★Is there an intuitive explanation for the difference between standard deviation and sample standard deviation?
Assume for now that , where . It's important to note that the sample mean and the sample variance are random variables. From homework problem 2 [ http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/... ], one can show that , where the 's are independent of one another, and are independent of . Furthermore, and is the chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom. My point is that the degrees of freedom in the original problem are all accounted for.  The sample variance has degrees of freedom:    .    Embed Quote
