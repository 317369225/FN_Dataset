★How do you derive the Quantile equation for a Normal Variable X with mean = μ and standard deviation σ?
Do you mean Quantile function? If so, there is discussion in the link. The normal distribution The normal distribution is perhaps the most important case. Because the normal distribution is a location-scale family, its quantile function for arbitrary parameters can be derived from a simple transformation of the quantile function of the standard normal distribution, known as the probit function. Unfortunately, this function has no closed-form representation using basic algebraic functions; as a result, approximate representations are usually used. Thorough composite rational and polynomial approximations have been given by Wichura[4] and Acklam (see his web site in External Links). Non-composite rational approximations have been developed by Shaw (see Monte Carlo recycling in External Links). The easiest way to get a very good approximation is to use monte carlo methods.  There are many add-ins to excel that can help in this regard.  Sample, the generated random distribution for the quantiles in question. Another way to do this is to generate a random variable in a cell with the specified mean and standard variation for the NORM function. Then copy that down for 5,000 or 10,000 or more cells. Then use the quantile function to interrogate the data array in excel.    Embed Quote
