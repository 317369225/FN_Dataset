★What is the intuition behind standard deviation in statistics?
Better than explaining intuitive sense behind std deviation, I'll explain the sense behing variance. Since std deviation is just under root of variance, it follows. Now we have to distribution of say return on a stock. Both have an average return of 6%. How do you say which stock is better to buy ? Suppose another criteria for you is being risk averse you would like that your stock is less fluctuating. Now comes in variance. It is nothing but the sum of squared deviations from the mean. So if both stocks give 6% return but stock A has more variance than stock B it means that the observations(return on different data points for say every month ending) are close to mean for stock A than B. It basically gives us the spread of distribution around the mean value. More is the variance, more widely spread is the data. Less is the variance more tightly packed is the data around its mean. Standard deviation follows the same intuition because it is just the under root of variance. Hope it helps!    Embed Quote
