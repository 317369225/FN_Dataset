★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
To add to Jerzy's excellent answer, I just want to add a coupled points. Its a difficult problem to solve analytically. Even with as many simplifications as possible, the equations that modelize it have no known analytical solution. The reason is that since muons are way heavier than electrons, the usual approximation we make (that consists of saying the proton doesn't move compared to the electron) doesn't work. So now that you take the proton's movement into account, things get dirty very fast. Assuming that the experiment is correct, there is something going on that we don't expect. Said in the most vague  terms, what's going on is that some force carriers are exchanged that we haven't thought of. My favorite explanation (I am no specialist though) is that a virtual photon can be exchanged with the proton that polarizes it. The one I don't think most people would put a coin on is that there might be a new force carrier at play here. PS1: I was reading this paper (1) and I like how they say one of their hypothesis (that the Lamb shift might have a term missing) is not probable because of how many physicists have studied the problem and then go on to say that it's more likely the standard model might be missing something :) (1) http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.0905v1...    Embed Quote
