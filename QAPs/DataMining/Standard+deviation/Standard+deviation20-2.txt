★How do you calculate the standard deviation and what can it tell us?
You can get the formula from many sources. In lay man's terms - what it tells you is the nature of the population that you are observing with respect to the specific characteristic under consideration. For example -  your population is boys in middle school, and the characteristic could be their heights, say. The standard deviation gives you a sense of the distribution i.e. how close together (small std. dev) or spread apart (larger std. dev) the heights are relative to the mean height for that group.  Question is how do you use this information - as Brian explained - if the distribution is expected to be a "normal" distribution, then you may estimate that a majority of the population (99.7%) would be within +/- 3 std. deviations of the mean. Thus if you were using this data to say order t-shirts (an oversimplified example here of course), you would have a sense of how 1 single size would fit all the boys from the shortest to the tallest. In more realistic examples, it affects how you would prepare for some level of expected "variations" around the "mean" from manufacturing processes (eg: part sizes -- and #of acceptable parts to #defects from that process), to say services management (eg: no. of customers expected on a certain day of week -- and therefore amount of pizza dough needed for that day - range of low to high), and so on.    Embed Quote
