★What is the distribution and standard deviation of predictions of childbirth (due dates?)I take it the average length of a pregnancy is 40 weeks and 3 days (or something) and that the most children statistically would be born on this day.  But what is the standard deviation?  Does anyone have a nice plot with enough datapoints on early and late births?  I would be very interested in seeing the distribution.
The average length of a first-time pregnancy is 40 weeks and 10 days. For second and subsequent births it is 40 weeks and 3 days. The standard deviation for gestational length depends on the framing of a study, but is around 10 days. For further information on gestational length for spontaneous labors, read: The length of human pregnancy as calculated by ultrasonographic measurement of the fetal biparietal diameter In practice, the variability of gestational length is strongly impacted by health care practitioners' approach and birth facility policies. It's a great idea to ask questions up-front about how your practitioner handles certain scenarios. For example, you might ask questions about how he/she approaches induction, slow labors, pushing, etc.    Embed Quote
