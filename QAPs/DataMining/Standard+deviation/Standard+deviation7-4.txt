★Why we should use standard deviation over mean? What type of problems can we solve with standard deviation?Please give some practical example .Thanks
They are two different things that describe a distribution. One is not better than another. It's like the height and weight of a person. One doesn't describe a person better than the other. We should use both when describing a distribution. By knowing both, we can answer questions related to probability with the distribution. For example, the mean and standard deviation of IQ scores is 100 and 15 respectively. The Empirical Rule states that about 68% of scores lie within one standard deviation of the mean. So, about 68% of IQ scores lie within 15 points of 100. This means 68% of all IQ scores are in the interval [85, 115]. If we select a person at random from the population, there is a 68% chance that their IQ is between 85 and 100. There is a 16% chance their IQ is above 115, and a 16% chance their IQ is below 85. Without knowing both of these numbers, the mean and standard deviation, we cannot make statements such as these.    Embed Quote
