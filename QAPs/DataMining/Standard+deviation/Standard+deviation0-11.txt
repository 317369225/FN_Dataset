★Is there an intuitive explanation for the difference between standard deviation and sample standard deviation?
Intuitively without math? Population mean and standard deviation is what we are interested in. Why? Because there is no use of saying that mean and standard deviation of our sample is something as if we calculated it from different samples from same population we would get different sample mean and standard deviation, to avoid this we need all observations from population and calculate population standard deviation and population mean. If we do then we don’t need to worry about sample standard deviation. But if we don't, we try to estimate population standard deviation from the sample we have. But as I said before for different samples the sample mean and standard deviation would be different. We want to find the estimate of population mean and population standard deviation (given the same sample size) such that these differences are small. It turns out that on average sample mean is the best estimate of population mean, best estimate as in if we would have a different sample we would get different mean and if we measured the distance of differences and summed them up sample mean would have the least distance among all other estimates. Same goes for sample standard deviation we would divide by n intuitively but it turns out there is another estimator that has smaller summed distances than the one divided by n. Think of it as some math loving person tried for all values of different denominator n, n+1, n-2, n+40 and so on but n-1 had the smallest sum of differences than any other. Hence we divide by n-1 for sample standard deviation and n for standard deviation.   Note though if you are worried about n-1 or n then you are up to no good anyway.    Embed Quote
