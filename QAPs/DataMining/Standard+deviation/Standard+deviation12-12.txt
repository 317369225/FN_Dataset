★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
It's likely that it's an error with the experiment, since a strong interaction such as a proton-size changing one would have been noticed earlier. However, it could also be some property of the muon, for example its larger mass, which is throwing off the size measurements. The real answer is that more experimentation is needed.    Embed Quote
