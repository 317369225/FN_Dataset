★Is there an intuitive explanation for the difference between standard deviation and sample standard deviation?
I learned this a slightly different way that I think is more intuitive than some of the other explanations here. If you had some random population of numbers, you'd start to notice a pattern if you started to sample from it over and over again and run descriptive statistics on those samples. You'd see that the biased sample variance (when you divide by n, not n-1) follows a certain pattern over enough iterations: When n=2, biased sample variance approaches 1/2 the population variance. When n=3, biased sample variance approaches 2/3 the population variance. when n=4, biased sample variance approaches 3/4 the population variance. In other words, the biased sample variance approaches (n-1)/n times the population variance. To correct for this and get an unbiased sample variance, you would therefore just multiply by the reciprocal. ...I don't know Latex, but since paint is the next best thing: purple is what we're trying to predict (population variance); pink is the bias we get when we sample; blue is how to correct for it. Dividing by (n-1) just gives you a better estimate. That's all.    Embed Quote
