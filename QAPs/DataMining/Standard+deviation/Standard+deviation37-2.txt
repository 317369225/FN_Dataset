★Why is standard deviation the standard measure of uncertainty in quantum mechanics?Isn't there no better measure that is more appropriate for nature (i.e. one that fits nature better)? If not, is it just a coincidence that such a simple measure also makes the expressions of the laws of physics simplest, or is there something more to it (e.g. something to do with the mathematics of waves)?
As far as I know, this is just a useful way to sum up the spread of possible values. It has no physical significance. There isn't really a simpler measure to use, which is why the mathematics is simplest using SD. Edit: well OK, it does have physical significance, but I think that's only because we're dealing with squares anyway. As the commenter on my answer points out, the laws of QM could have been more complicated, and then SD wouldn't be so much use. Or else we'd just need a more complex expression for the uncertainty principle    Embed Quote
