★Why is there a degree of freedom of n-1 for sample standard deviation?
Consider a sample set of numbers taken from a larger population: {5, 8, 2, 7, 10, 4} The mean for this sample is (5+8+2+7+10+4)/6 = 6 To calculate the standard deviation, you want to think about how far away each number is from the sample mean: 5-6 = -1 (e.g. one unit away, left of the mean) 8-6 = 2 (i.e. two units away, right of the mean) 2-6 = -4 7-6 = 1 10-6 = 4 4-6 = -2 These differences also gives you an idea (an estimate) of how far away each number is from the population mean (provided the sample is large enough).  You then "average" out these differences to get the sample standard deviation, which involves a procedure of adding up the squares of the differences, dividing by n-1, and then taking the square root of the result. Now, to answer your question: Notice how all the differences must add up to 0: -1+2+(-4)+1+4+(-2) = 0. In symbols, it might look like: d1+d2+d3+d4+d5+d6=0 Where di stands for the i-th difference. So imagine if there is another sample set of 6 numbers, but this time, I only tell you the differences (not the actual numbers).  How many of these differences would I need to give you in order for you to be able to calculate the standard deviation for this new sample?  The answer is 5 out of a possible 6.  It is enough to know 5 of the differences, because then you can plug them into the equation d1+d2+d3+d4+d5+d6=0 and you can calculate the sixth one by yourself!  5 of these differences can have the freedom to vary, while the 6th one can always be calculated by the equation.  So for this example, 5 is the degrees of freedom. To generalize to a sample set of n numbers, the differences still add up to 0: d1+d2+d3+...+dn-1+dn=0 So the degrees of freedom would be n-1.    Embed Quote
