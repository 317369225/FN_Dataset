★What is the standard deviation of the total weight of five watermelons?The weight of watermelons is selected at random, with a mean (=15kg) and standard deviation (=2.1kg). Suppose we pick 5 watermelons.
I'm sure you figured that mean is a linear operator, i.e. (the tilde marks a random variable): There is no such "law" for the standard deviation of random variables. Standard deviation will correspond to multiplying by a constant, i.e.: What does correspond nicely is the square of standard deviation, i.e. the variance. Here's what we have there: I know what you're thinking. "What is that covar thing and how do I get it?" It is called covariance. If X and Y are independent of one another, their covariance is 0. Meaning, if the weight of each of the watermelons is independent of the others, if one watermelon being bigger won't affect the probability any of the others will be bigger, your covariance is zero. If that is the case, your situation is easy - the variance of the total weight is the sum of the variances of the individual watermelons. In this case:    Embed Quote
