★What's the best period to use for standard deviation when calculating Sharpe Ratio?
It is industry practice to speak in annualized returns over annualized standard deviations. The annualization bizniz morningstar mentions stems from the assumptions that your returns are independent and normally distributed. If that holds it should not make any difference what frequency you sample at as long as you have enough data. When using daily data to annualize you run into the practical problem of the number of settlement days per year that might vary from market to market and year to year so this might be a reason for Morningstar to recommend lower frequency sampling. But if you have your data and know it I don't really see why you wouldn't take the descriptive statistics of the random variable you are looking at from the finest resolution available consistently.    Embed Quote
