★What is an intuitive explanation for the ratio of standard deviation and mean?
Adding to Joe Blitzstein's excellent answer (+1), there are also cases where CV does not make sense. Among them are any time that adding a constant to the data would make no substantive difference; that is, where the data are only interval and not ratio. e.g. the CV of temperature data, even where it is never cold (thus below 0) makes no sense, either in degrees F or C; indeed, the CV of the same temperatures in F and C will be different: F : 50  68 86  104  #CV =  .31 C: 10  20 30  40    #CV =  .52    Embed Quote
