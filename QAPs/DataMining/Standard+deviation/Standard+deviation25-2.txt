★When building a portfolio, is it better to use an asset's past data to find its standard deviation, or to use its projected standard deviation?
The answer to your question is banal - of course you want to use forward looking volatility for portfolio construction.  Who cares about the historical/realized volatility, right? To quote Rafiki from the Lion King - "it doesn't  matter it's in the past."   The key is, of course, how you arrive with your vol prediction. Most Capital Market Assumption providers rely heavily on past vol when estimating forward looking vol.  Some research papers combine implied vol with realized vol - but you cant assess implied vol for every asset (i.e. option market must exist for the given asset class).   Also, I agree with Anthony, when running any quantitative portfolio construction process, the forward looking vols and the correlation matrix are not your worry; the expected returns are.    Embed Quote
