★Can i predict the mean and standard deviation of a skewed population using random sample?Does the population has to be normal for me to predict the mean and Standard deviation of the population?
A simple task can be to start calculating the sample skewness and estimate the global skewness [1], this is fairly straightforward from the formula in the article. You'll see this also involves the mean which is defined for skewed distributions in the same way as for any other distribution, it just doesn't coincide with the peak like it does in the normal distribution. The same goes for the standard deviation. We can also look at 'the skew normal distribution' which is a function of three parameters: mean, standard deviation and skew. If we assume that it represents the population you want to look at then you can indeed fit this function to the random sample and thereby estimate the three parameters. This is true for any function. It is however something to be computed numerically, there's no 'closed-form solution' according to wikipedia, so I can't state a simple formula for calculating the mean, skew and standard deviation in this case. (This seems to contradict the first paragraph where we estimated all three, but perhaps someone else can clarify this :-) [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ske...
