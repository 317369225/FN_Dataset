★How do you draw a distribution curve of a data set if only the median, mean and standard deviation are provided?Assume the following values Mean: 60 Median: 50 Standard deviation: 20 Range of data: 0-100
If the data were normally distributed, you'd expect most of your data to be between 40 and 80 with pretty much all of the remaining data to be between 20 and 100. But you know it's not because the mean is higher than the median. This implies it might be skewed to the high numbers. I would suspect most of the lower half of the data to be between 30 and 50, while the top half of the data is spread between 50 and 100. Can we know any of this for sure? Not really. There's a large chance your data is skewed high, but even that's not a certainty.    Embed Quote
