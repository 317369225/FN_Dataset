★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
For the moment, nobody knows. You have to understand, that the "size of proton" is not really well defined: proton is not a hard ball with a definite surface. What the experiments determine is really the radius of the electric charge distribution, and it is somehow "fuzzy" because it is determined by the movement of quarks within the proton. Muon orbitals are much smaller than electron orbitals, because of higher muon mass, thus the muonic measurement may be more sensitive to the details how the charge distribution "falls off" with the distance from the proton centre. That would be my first guess. But really, we have to wait and see how the situation develops.    Embed Quote
