★What does the standard deviation metric tell us for a non-normal distribution?What does the standard deviation tell us, if anything?  I know the standard deviation metric is relevant for normally distributed data (68, 95, 99 rule), but can we infer any such information or rule for non-normally distributed data?  If not, what's the point of examining the metric for non-normal distributions?
It depends on the particular distribution and the particular variable. The standard deviation is a measure of spread for continuous (or near continuous) variables, just as the mean is a measure of central tendency for such variables. But, just as the mean is not always the most appropriate measure of central tendency, the sd is not always the best measure of spread; in fact, a good general rule is that, if the mean is not appropriate, neither is the sd. Example 1. Highly skewed distributions. A common example is income, which is very right skew. That's why people use the median income rather than the mean. But you also rarely hear about the standard deviation of income. A better choice is the interquartile range or the median absolute deviation. Example 2: Multimodal distributions.  Here, it may be that no single measure of central tendency or spread is appropriate.
