★Why do we square instead of using the absolute value when calculating variance and standard deviation?
One answer is grounded in history. Least squares regression goes back to the famous mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in the eighteenth century. Back in the eighteenth century, computers were not available. So, in order to compute a regression line, one would have to do the calculations by hand. We can determine the minimum of the sum of the squared residuals manually because it only involves minimizing a quadratic function, which can be done by taking the first derivative.
