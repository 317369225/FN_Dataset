★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
The only thing "7 standard deviations" tells you is that this result is not a statistical fluke.  It says nothing about the analysis' correctness or accuracy.  It is far more likely that this is a subtle systematic error than truly new physics that will upend the Standard Model.  The only difference between electronic hydrogen and muonic hydrogen is the mass of the electron/muon (the electron and muon have been very consistently found to be indistinguishable otherwise in many experiments for decades), and it's hard to see how this might affect the size of the proton.  The authors suggest a possible new muon-proton force.  First off, that would be truly bizarre, but more importantly if it is on the scale necessary to affect the size of the proton by a few percent, it should be easily detectable in colliders, and it's not.    Embed Quote
