★What are common misconceptions around the use of standard deviations in statistics?
Consider an exponential distribution whose density is given by for .  It has a mean of and a standard deviation of .  Roughly 63% of the mass of the distribution lies at most one standard deviation left of the mean, and about 23% lies at most one standard deviation to the right of the mean. So what about two standard deviations?  You have about 32% of the mass of the distribution at most two standard deviations to the right of the mean, but you still only have 63% of the mass at most two standard deviations to the left.  That really makes it difficult to apply something at all like the 68-95-99.7 rule for normal distributions, and even makes it a little tough to interpret the standard deviation as a unit of variation. In fact, the mean and standard deviation only really make sense for symmetric distributions, where the mean is the point of symmetry, and the standard deviation tells you the natural measure of scale for the distribution.  For a non-symmetric distribution, it's really not at all clear what these quantities are measuring.    Embed Quote
