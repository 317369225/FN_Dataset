★Is it true that there is a difference of one standard deviation in IQ between Caucasian Americans and African Americans?
No, it's not true. Historically, some specific IQ tests yielded those results, but current IQ tests are much better developed and normed, and if you control for SES, the Black-White IQ gap is diminished to about a third of a standard deviation now.    Embed Quote
