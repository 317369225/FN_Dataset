★Can we do a standard deviation on this data set?
There are two ways you could do Standard deviation set, one is tke difference between observed(o) abd expected(e) values and compute mean and standard deviation for these value for all 100 reviews. Second way is to take Mean and Standard deviation for observed and expected values separately. This can give a fair estimate to whether observed and estimated match with these two parameters as comparison basis. In my opinion estimates of mean and standard deviation on error is a better estimate to compare the observed and expected values, it determines the prediction quality    Embed Quote
