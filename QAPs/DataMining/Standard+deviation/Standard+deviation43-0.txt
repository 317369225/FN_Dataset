★Why is standard deviation better than deviation about arithmetic mean?How standard deviation and Mean deviation differ from each other? The answer says, "then it has been shown theoretically that the standard deviation is the best estimate (most efficient)". Can someone please explain why?
Consider a simple example. In the following figure, look at images B and C. Who do you think is a better shooter of the two ? Intuitively, most people will say B. Why ? Consistency. When arithmetic mean is just a measure of the average score, standard deviation pretty much gives an idea about the consistency of data. So, while arithmetic mean of C is close to the bull's eye, he isn't a consistent shooter or more random. Where as B is too far away from 0, but still is consistent with his shots. Which means B is a better shooter than C.    Embed Quote
