★Why is there a difference in proton size by about 5% (approximately seven standard deviations) within muonic hydrogen, compared to hydrogen?
I doubt I could improve on the excellent answers already given, but I will just add that experimental physics, especially at that level, is incredibly difficult and often indirect. We often have to make inferences about certain quantities based on indirect measures. That being said, I usually like to withhold judgment until there is some kind of corroborating follow-up.    Embed Quote
