★Is there an intuitive explanation for the difference between standard deviation and sample standard deviation?
On a high school level, she can explain that every data point is a degree of freedom of our knowledge about the data based on the sample we have.  By computing the mean, we have taken away one degree of freedom.  To compute standard deviation, which uses the mean, we have to account for the fact that now we only have (n-1) degrees of freedom left. That would be intuitive, not require writing any additional formulae, and at the same time gently introduce the kids to the mathematics of information theory.    Embed Quote
