★Why we should use standard deviation over mean? What type of problems can we solve with standard deviation?Please give some practical example .Thanks
That would depend on the distribution of the data. Once you plot the distribution, one of the following scenarios are possible: Central tendency within customer spec; spread also within customer specs Central tendency outside spec limits: variation under control Central tendency within spec; large variation. Or Both Central tendency and variation outside customer spec. Scenario 1: do nothing Scenario 2: project metric should be around CT. (I am averse to using mean as a measure of CT and when in doubt, prefer to use median) Scenario 3: project metric should be around variation (std dev or IQR or stability factor) Scenario 4: the project needs to have 2 phases. Phase 1 around reducing variation, phase 2 around improving Central tendency. The customer feels pain from variation more than CT. So when in doubt, improve variation first the. Go to improving CT Hope that helps    Embed Quote
