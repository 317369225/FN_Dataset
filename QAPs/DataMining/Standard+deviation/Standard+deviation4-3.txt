★What does it mean when standard deviation is higher than the mean?In stats, if the standard deviation is higher then the average, what does that tell you about your data?
Just to elaborate other's points, the coefficient of variation is only meaningful for ratio scale variables on . That said I teach students to look at it and the mean always. For many variables you can benchmark it well a priori. For instance for a Likert type item scored as integers, the largest it can possibly be can be calculated in advance by allocating half the values to the lowest and half to the highest category. You can also calculate the value for an intermediate position, say allocations of even probability for all categories. Very small values of the SD are usually indicative of a problematic response pattern.    Embed Quote
