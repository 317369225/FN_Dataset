★If a sample size = 400, sample mean = 44, sample standard deviation = 16, then what is the margin of error?
This sounds like an intro stats question, so the answer you are looking for is probably something like twice (or even better 1.966 times) the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. Margin But there are several important assumptions that I have made to get to this answer. I assumed that you mean "margin of error in a symmetric 95% confidence interval for the population mean."   I assumed that the data could be modeled by independent samples.  I assumed that the samples were distributed in a way that a sample size of 400 was sufficiently large that the central limit theorem could be employed.  (That's the theorem that tells you that you can approximate the distribution of the sample mean using a normal distribution.)    With all those assumptions, you can establish that the sample mean will follow a normal distribution and that a normalized version of the sample mean will follow a Student's t-distribution with 399 degrees of freedom.  The appropriate value that leads to a 95% confidence interval from this distribution turns out to be about 1.966 (which is often approximated by 2).    Embed Quote
