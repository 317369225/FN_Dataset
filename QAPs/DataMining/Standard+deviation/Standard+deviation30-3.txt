★How do you draw a distribution curve of a data set if only the median, mean and standard deviation are provided?Assume the following values Mean: 60 Median: 50 Standard deviation: 20 Range of data: 0-100
You are asking for a non-parametric estimation with only 5 values (mean, median, stand, minimum and maximum value) Thus you can't, unless you make an hypothesis about the underlying distribution, try to fit the data using the given parameters and then use a specific test for your assumed distribution. Otherwise, if you have the data, you should try non-parametric estimators (such as  Kernel Density Estimators) on a subset of your data and optimize the hyper-parameters on the remaining one (in the case of a Nadayra-Watson estimator, the hyper-parameter would be the bandwidth h) Hope this was clear. Let me know if I completely missed the point or if my answer wasn't useful at all. Kernel density estimation: a link about a commonly used technique for non parametric density estimation. If you are interested about the subject, let me know, I will link you to more useful resources.    Embed Quote
