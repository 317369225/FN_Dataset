★What does it mean when standard deviation is higher than the mean?In stats, if the standard deviation is higher then the average, what does that tell you about your data?
If your data is approximately normal, it means you should expect some negative values frequently (since 0 is less than 1 standard deviation away.) If your data isn't allowed to take negative values, it likely means your data is skewed the to high values, or there are high outliers.    Embed Quote
