★When building a portfolio, is it better to use an asset's past data to find its standard deviation, or to use its projected standard deviation?
I have no experience with finance but I'll tell you this much. Don't use methodologies blindly. Anyrhing that projects into the future has to be based on the past and at best also based on the past of other variables and outside information. Understand why the method of prediction is justified and the full rigorous rationale behind it. In terms of volatility, my naive understanding is that we're talking about fast variations. These are likely hard to predict but maybe can be bounded above and below. This is a guess from someone with zero background in finance but I wanted to provide an outside perspective.    Embed Quote
