★What are the various IQ tests and how do they differ, in particular with respect to mean and standard deviation of score?
Anyone can publish a test and call it an IQ test, so, there could be tests with any mean and standard deviation.  However, the major IQ tests are all normed to have mean = 100 and standard deviation = 15; in fact, they are renormed every so often to maintain that. This is certainly true of the Wecshler scales (WAIS for adults and WISC for children), the Stanford Binet, the Woodcock Johnson and every other test I've heard of.  Anyone who published a test with a different mean and/or SD would sow confusion.  It is straightforward to change any set of scores to have a mean of 100 and sd of 15. Note that none of the above implies that IQ is normally distributed. There is evidence that it is not and that scores on at least some tests have "fat tails" - that is, more people far from the mean then the normal distribution would predict. As to other differences - the major tests vary tremendously in what exactly they test. Most of the major IQ tests are made up of a bunch of subtests designed to test different aspects of intelligence, and the exact subtests change over time as tests are revised. Some tests, such as Raven Progressive Matrices, are designed for a more specific purpose - the Raven is designed to not involve language at all (it is purely visual).    Embed Quote
