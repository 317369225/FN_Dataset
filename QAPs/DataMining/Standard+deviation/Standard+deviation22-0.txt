★Why are both standard deviation and variance taught and used if they are so similar?Are there uses so different to justify teaching kids two different concepts? Is there a simple way or concept to memorize which is the root of which? Are there different applications to both?
Adding to Ashish, if you have independent variables, their variances add. That means that if you take many samples independently from the same distribution, the variance of their sum grows linearly in the number of samples. That makes variance a really useful concept. Understanding it also allows you to understand covariance and correlation. However, variance doesn't have the same units as whatever quantity you're looking at, so the standard deviation has value as an intuitive measure of spread. As for memorizing which is which, I can't imagine that to be very difficult.    Embed Quote
