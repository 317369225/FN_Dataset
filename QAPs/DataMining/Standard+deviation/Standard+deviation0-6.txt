★Is there an intuitive explanation for the difference between standard deviation and sample standard deviation?
We must start by understanding "population" and "sample."   A big source of the difficulty, especially at the high school level, is that populations are illustrated with small finite sets of numbers.   As a result, the math used to compute the population standard deviation looks about the same as the math used to compute the sample standard deviation. It would be far better to use first a population example of, say, weights of house cats.  We do not have a roster of all the house cats, so the exact population standard deviation is not known.   (By the way, it's fun to ask high school students to guess this standard deviation.)   Now.... with a sample of cats, a sample standard deviation can be computed. Once students are comfortable with this type of example, they can be introduced to the special case of a finite population.   That still leaves open the question of dividing by n or by n-1, but I'll leave that one for now.    Embed Quote
