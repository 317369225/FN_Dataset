★Why is Mean Absolute Deviation a better measure of volatility than Standard Deviation?
The difference between the two are subtle but pronounced. To give you a short answer: The Mean Absolute Devation(MAD) is a robust estimator while Standard Deviation is not. Also, MAD is a measure of absolute difference while SD is a measure of the square of differences. Let's compare the formulas for MAD vs SD MAD: SD: If you look at the equation for MAD, you can see that you basically take the median of the differences between each value and the median. This calculation is robust, or insensitive to outliers, and is advantaged in assessing volatility. Why? Let's say you have a stock that moves on average 2-3 points a day. Then suddenly, either due to a freak event or otherwise, it shoots up 200 points one day.  If you just took the SD, which incorporates the mean, it would be very very high due to a single day or points contribution. However, this is unrepresentative of the vast majority of the previous days movements where it was only 2-3 points. SD's non-robust nature due to its usage of the sample mean in its calculation makes it unreliable. Secondly, the units of SD is also a little difficult to interpret. Squared deviations vs Absolute deviations could play tricks on a trader's mind.    Embed Quote
