★What other interesting properties would a probability distribution whose mean is equal to its standard deviation have?
"What other interesting properties..." What interesting properties are you aware of to begin with? I can't tell you other interesting properties without knowing what you already find interesting. If you're talking about a probability distribution whose mean and standard deviation are just arbitrarily equal, then your signal-to-noise ratio / coefficient of variation would always be one, which would imply mean your standard deviation is certainly on the same order of magnitude that your mean is. In a way, this might imply that the distribution is actually un-interesting. If you're talking about a distribution whose mean and standard deviation are not arbitrarily equal but are instead inherently equal as a result of the properties of the distribution itself, then one such example is the exponential distribution. I'm not sure if this is the only parametric distribution where this is the case. Everything about the exponential distribution is pretty interesting, so, I guess there's that? Exponential distribution A similar thing is the Poisson distribution, where the mean (which is the only parameter of the distribution) is equal to the variance (the square of the standard deviation.) This is kind of odd, because in practice we often use mean +/- standard deviation to describe things so that they both have the same units. Mathematically, the variance and mean of the Poisson distribution are equal, but I'm not sure how to reconcile that one, given what I just said about units.... Anyway, Wikipedia has some information about how one can accurately infer the mean based on the standard deviation alone, if something is Poisson distributed (though citations are needed for this part,) and how this can be meaningful in scientific applications:Poisson distribution    Embed Quote
