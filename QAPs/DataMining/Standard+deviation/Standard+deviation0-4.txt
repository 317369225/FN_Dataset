★Is there an intuitive explanation for the difference between standard deviation and sample standard deviation?
There are great explanations here. But sometimes high school students learn more easily through inductive reasoning. They need to "experience" the need of the N-1 first, explain it later. You might try to let them do this "experiment": (1) Choose 3 arbitrary numbers. This is the population. For example, choose 0, 1, and 2. (2) Calculate the Population Mean (3) Calculate the Population Variance (4) Take all possible 2 sample from 3 arbritraty number. There are 9 possible samples: 0 and 0 0 and 1 0 and 2 1 and 0 1 and 1 1 and 2 2 and 0 2 and 1 2 and 2 (5) Calculate s^2 using n for every sample This is the wrong formula though, but we're going to show them why it is wrong. 0 and 0 => ==> 0 and 1 => ==> 0 and 2 => ==> 1 and 0 => ==> 1 and 1 => ==> 1 and 2 => ==> 2 and 0 => ==> 2 and 1 => ==> 2 and 2 => ==> From these 9 possible combinations, the average value of sample variance is: Now we have a problem because the average value of sample variance is different from the population variance if we use n. Thus, we need to fix this by using n-1 instead of n. (6) Calculate s^2 using n-1 for every sample 0 and 0 => ==> 0 and 1 => ==> 0 and 2 => ==> 1 and 0 => ==> 1 and 1 => ==> 1 and 2 => ==> 2 and 0 => ==> 2 and 1 => ==> 2 and 2 => ==> From these 9 possible combinations, the average value of sample variance is: As you can see, the average value of sample variance is exactly the same with population variance if they use n-1 instead.    Embed Quote
