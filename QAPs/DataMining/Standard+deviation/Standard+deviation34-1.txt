★What is the distribution and standard deviation of predictions of childbirth (due dates?)I take it the average length of a pregnancy is 40 weeks and 3 days (or something) and that the most children statistically would be born on this day.  But what is the standard deviation?  Does anyone have a nice plot with enough datapoints on early and late births?  I would be very interested in seeing the distribution.
I don't like to mess with this all calculation and actually i don't understand. I have found a website Mumzone which also offers expected pregnancy due calculator widget for easy calculation of pregnancy due date..    Embed Quote
