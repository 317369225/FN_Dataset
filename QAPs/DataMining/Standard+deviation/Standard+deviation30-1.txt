★How do you draw a distribution curve of a data set if only the median, mean and standard deviation are provided?Assume the following values Mean: 60 Median: 50 Standard deviation: 20 Range of data: 0-100
This problem is ill-posed. Essentially you have five pieces of information: The mean, median, standard deviation, and upper and lower bounds of the sample space. Beyond that you know nothing. The fact that the median is larger than the mean implies a bit of left skew, because nonparametric skew = (mean - median)/SD = -1/2, which is somewhat useful to know. Expect a longer left tail. If you're good with optimization problems, you could use maximum entropy: Maximum entropy probability distribution You could also probably rescale a beta distribution to fit the general pattern pretty well.    Embed Quote
