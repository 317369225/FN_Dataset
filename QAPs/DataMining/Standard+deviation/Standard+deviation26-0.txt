★How do you estimate the population standard deviation using the sample standard deviation?
Let v be your sample variance. Then (n/n-1)*v gives you an unbiased estimator for the population variance. Lets call this estimator T. Then by the invariance property under continuous and differentiable transformations the square root of T will be an unbiased estimator for the population standard deviation. The calculated value based on the sample for this estimator T can be used as an estimate. Further you can calculate the confidence interval for your population parameter using the result that the ratio of the sample and population variance follows a chi square distribution.    Embed Quote
