★Is there an intuitive explanation for the difference between standard deviation and sample standard deviation?
The variation you see in a population is as large as it is in part because of the outliers or extreme values. Although not many men are taller than six and a half feet, some are and their height is a long way from the mean. This means that they contribute a disproportionately large amount to the variance, which is the average squared distance from the mean. Such people rarely get into samples, however, precisely because they are outliers. So the variation you see in a sample tends to be smaller than the variation you see in the population as a whole. If we wish to estimate the variance of the population and all we have is the variance of a sample we are faced with the problem of the sample variance likely being smaller than the population variance. So we need to bump it up a bit. It turns out that if we multiply it by n/(n-1) that does the job. This multiplier is reasonable because, as n gets large n/(n-1) gets closer to 1, i.e. as the sample size increases, the bumping up we do gets less. And this is because as the sample size increases, the likelihood of some of those extreme values getting into our sample increases. So the sample's variance starts becoming about the same size as the population's.    Embed Quote
