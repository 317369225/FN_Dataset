★What is the use of mean and standard deviation for detecting cracks in images?is there any way to find the depth of crack from wavelet coefficients using 2d images and how to do it?
Canny edge-detection filter the image with the derivative  of the Gaussian filter mask generated by the standard deviation  parameter.  The value of standard deviation(w.r.t. mean) determines the width of the  filter matrix, and controls the amount of smoothing produced by the  Gaussian component. Side-notes: An impulse response is associated with a linear system. A median filter  is non-linear, therefore, there isn't an explicit impulse response, although median filter is better at preserving edges while reducing noise,than gaussian blur. What does it indicate about a data set if the mean is lower than the median? Sameer Gupta's answer to What are the best travel hacks?    Embed Quote
