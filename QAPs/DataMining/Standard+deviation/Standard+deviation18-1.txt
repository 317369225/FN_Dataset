★What does the standard deviation metric tell us for a non-normal distribution?What does the standard deviation tell us, if anything?  I know the standard deviation metric is relevant for normally distributed data (68, 95, 99 rule), but can we infer any such information or rule for non-normally distributed data?  If not, what's the point of examining the metric for non-normal distributions?
The standard deviation has the same basic interpretation for all symmetric distributions, although the specific proportion of the data that falls within a given number of standard deviations is sensitive to the specific distribution.  However, once you break out of that class, the mean and standard deviation both become much more difficult to interpret.    Embed Quote
