★How can I combine multiple columns when computing mean and standard deviation in R?
For this particular example, you could use mean(rbind(survey[,2], survey[,3])) This would apply 'mean' function after binding the rows of columns 2 and 3 In this case the answer would be 4.5 {mean of 5 and 4} You can include any number of columns you want in the 'rbind' function. The same can be done for obtaining standard deviation sd(rbind(survey[,2], survey[,3])) In this case, the answer would be 0.5477226 {sd of 5 and 4} There must be other ways of doing it, which would be much faster or more efficient.. but they'll be more important if you are dealing with several thousands of rows of data.    Embed Quote
