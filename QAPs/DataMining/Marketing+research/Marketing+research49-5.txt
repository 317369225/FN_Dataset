★Should I conduct market research before starting development on an app?How do I know my app will be interesting and/or popular? What are the techniques you employ to carry out this research?
You should create a rapid prototype, before development, just the main screens and flow (low or high fidelity) and share it with your target audience. Collect feedback and make decisions based on the data. Your friends would (almost) always would love your app, but make sure your real audience has a need for it, and willing to pay, or participate if the monetization... ("if you are not paying for the product, you are part of the product"). I am a big believer in validating ideas, designs and business model early. I've been doing this for a long time. Have a look at http://www.intuito.com, it was built exactly for that.    Embed Quote
