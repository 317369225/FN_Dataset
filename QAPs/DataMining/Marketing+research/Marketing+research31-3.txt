★Is Survey Monkey a recommended tool for market research? Why?
I will go out on a limb and say that, unless you are looking to field a remarkably simple survey, Survey Monkey is inadequate.  It is important when engaging with online respondents today that we meet their expectations concerning the conditional showing and hiding of questions and options, as well as offering compact designs for complex questions. Elegant survey design requires a tool that is more powerful for all but the most basic of surveys. Confirmit is our platform of choice. I will repeat what Timur and Greg said as well; a great survey tool will not be able to make up for a poorly designed survey instrument.    Embed Quote
