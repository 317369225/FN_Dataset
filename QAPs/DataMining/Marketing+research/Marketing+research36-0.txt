★Digital marketing, how it has changed marketing research?
Digital marketing allows companies to get real--time information about what customers want. In the past, research was mostly based on interviews, which are biased and can't compensate for the fact that what people say they will do and what they will actually do are two different things. Paco Underhill started this trend of behavioral observation research but it is slow and expensive With digital marketing, an entrepreneur can pitch multiple product ideas, colors, pricing strategies, value propositions and marketing strategies - and can find out what works and what does not, with minimal investment. Advanced analytics tools provide multivariate testing capabilities (MVT) to test multiple components of a message in real-time. Entrepreneurs launch 'dummy' product pages to gauge interest and pricing - all the way to waiting until customers click on 'Buy Now' to capture the information until the time when the product is actually ready to buy. These are only a few examples of how digital technologies enable much more effective, inexpensive and quick market research    Embed Quote
