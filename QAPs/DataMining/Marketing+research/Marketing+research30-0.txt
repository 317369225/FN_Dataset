★How is market research on brand equity conducted?As in what is the objective measure of brand equity and its procedure?
The term "brand equity" is used in a variety of ways. I like to start with a clear definition, so we all know what we're talking about. Keller's concept of customer-based brand equity is the most useful: Brand equity is the difference that knowledge of the brand in the mind of the customer (brand awareness and brand associations) makes to customer response to an identical generic product or service. In other words, when all other things are equal, what difference does the brand make? This can be measured in many ways: Price premium (i.e. price customers will pay for the branded product or service vs an identical unbranded product or service) Price elasticity of demand (i.e. how much could price be increased before demand for the brand would fall?) The contribution of brand preference and loyalty to market share, especially "felt" loyalty rather than just inertia. Market share alone is not a reliable indicator of brand equity, because factors such as price and distribution can account for significant differences in market share that are not attributable to the brand Channel effects such as willingness of retailers to allocate shelf space, etc. and others... Measures and insights relevant to brand equity can be obtained through many different qualitative and quantitative research methods. More specific techniques that can isolate and quantify the effect of brand equity include conjoint analysis/choice modeling.    Embed Quote
