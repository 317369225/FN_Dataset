★What are some innovative marketing research methodologies?
Mobile research is the hottest qualitative method being discussed right now but IMHO it has limitations as a true qual method.  Online qual isn't new anymore, but the activities that you execute with respondents online grows everyday - vendors are creating tools and qual researchers are coming up with new things to do everyday.  I would say this year I have gotten a lot of requests for video journals and digital ethnography.    Embed Quote
