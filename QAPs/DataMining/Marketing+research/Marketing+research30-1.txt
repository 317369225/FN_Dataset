★How is market research on brand equity conducted?As in what is the objective measure of brand equity and its procedure?
The objective measure of brand equity is market share, whether it be in dollars or other units. This is relative, however, because the total market size varies by industry, company, product, etc and a brand may not be well-known by the general public but it may have great equity in a small niche market. Also, I would argue that all business activities have the ultimate goal of growing market share, otherwise the company wouldn't be in business. Measuring market share can be done by measuring the individual components that make it up, such as: units sold number of customers repeat purchases customer loyalty (low turnover)This can be done through image studies, purchase preference surveys, brand recognition/recall rates, brand associations, and a hundred other procedures.    Embed Quote
