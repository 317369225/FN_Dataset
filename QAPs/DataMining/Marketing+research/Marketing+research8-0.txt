★How do you do market research for a startup idea?
1. Read the book Nail it then Scale it. 2. Define the problem you think you are solving. 3. Define who you think has this problem. 4. Ask the people who you think have this problem, if it is indeed a problem. Also ask how big of a problem it is. Do not mention a solution, just ask if it is a problem. 5. Once you have "nailed a pain" then come up with a solution. 6. Ask the people with the problem if they think your solution would solve the problem. 7. Repeat steps 2-6 until you have a group of people willing to pre order. 8. Start building the solution.    Embed Quote
