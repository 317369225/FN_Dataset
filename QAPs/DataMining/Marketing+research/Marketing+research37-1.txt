★What is business research and market research?
Thanks to Hazan Mirza for the A2A. "Business research" is broad -- it could mean research for, by or with business, or (quite frankly) anything the writer wants it to mean. It's nicely put by Dan Sklaire in his answer and I could do no better. "Market research" does have a specific meaning -- and I think Wikipedia provides a good enough overview: Market research.    Embed Quote
