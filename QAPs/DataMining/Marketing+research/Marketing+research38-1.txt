★Which market research firms (online- or email-based) would you recommend?
There's a lot of great research companies out there, each with different specialties. Some companies focus on particularly industries (CPG, Automotive, Hospitality, etc.).  Others are known for particular methodologies or research with a particular market segment or region. Ultimately, the best research solution is the one that fits your needs. With that said, here's a couple of places to look for full service research firms: The annual Honomichl 50 provides a report on the 50 largest market research companies. Greenbook.org and Quirks magazine both have directories that list providers by specialty and geography. The Advertising Research Foundation gives out an annual set of awards to top researchers by category.    Embed Quote
