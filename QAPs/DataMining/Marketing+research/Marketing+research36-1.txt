★Digital marketing, how it has changed marketing research?
Way too few people at this point are learning what they could about their customers from Facebook. You can get psychographics, which we've never really had before, and find out what people like and don't like without the bias problems of traditional marketing research. Check out graph search to see what other pages your fans like. Use the Facebook ad interface to see which things your fans like. Over time, by testing different types of Facebook posts, you can see what the like and dislike. You can run Facebook ads to test company names, product names, slogans and more- just see which one gets the best CTR. Survey with Survey Monkey or Typeform or Qzzr. There's no shortage of ways to tap into your market and get better info.    Embed Quote
