★Where do startup entrepreneurs get market research?I am curious about where startup people find facts, stats, and market knowledge numbers, if they don't have the money to purchase an entire market research document?
We work with startups to conduct qualitative interviews with their target market to help them understand which product features to prioritize and how to build their messaging and inform marketing strategy.  Oftentimes, in just a handful of well-crafted interviews, we are able to learn a significant amount about their target markets. Research documents are more expensive if you're looking for statistical data, but many research firms publish blogs to the public with useful, share-able data points.    Embed Quote
