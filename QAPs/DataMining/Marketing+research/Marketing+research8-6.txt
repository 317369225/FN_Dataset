★How do you do market research for a startup idea?
There are many different methods that entrepreneurs have used and that have worked for them. So here is what I try and establish with market research... find what the customer wants? what the customer will buy? what the competition is doing? what is working for the competition? I've always struggled to be effective when completing market and customer research for a new product or business. But over the course of the last few years I've actually had some time to reflect on what works. I wrote about my process here...http://ecofounder.net/business/r... I also include all the resources and links you need to get started. If your launching a business or product this should guide you to being effective by getting you straight to the information and answers you need.    Embed Quote
