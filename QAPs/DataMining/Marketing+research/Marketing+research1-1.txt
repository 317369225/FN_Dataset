★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
Absolutely. Most of the mistakes I've seen businesses of any size make have been due to the thinking they know the market place rather than taking the time to actually find out. For the past 15 years, I've been advising clients in the nonprofit and start up world. What I love about them is their eagerness to get going, get their product or service into the hands of their market, and see their dreams come true. The challenge comes when I ask them questions about their market and they can't answer them. They know all about them, and nothing about their consumers. They expect to put their product out there, do "marketing," and make millions. I eventually created a workshop called "No One Cares About You." where I explained that deep down, consumers don't really care about you. They care about how you're going to solve their problem/need/want/desire/etc. And that's what market research tells you how to do. I disagree with what Shashank PS says about a completely new product being unlikely benefitted from market research. This is where research will benefit you the most - Who exactly is your market? Does you market even want your product/service? Does it fill a need they have? If they don't know they need it, how can you convince them they do? What channels do they like to be reached on. How much would they be willing to pay? The questions are endless. I find that most people want to find a way to skip the market research part because its seen as boring. They want to jump right into the fun stuff! But let me finish by saying that the better you know every facet of your market, the more they will want to know you. =)    Embed Quote
