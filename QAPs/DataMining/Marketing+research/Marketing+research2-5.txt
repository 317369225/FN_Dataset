★What are the best blogs for learning market research?I am keen to learn about basic fundamentals of conducting market research. The key topics being creating questionares, identify and selecting samples etc. I am looking to find blogs which specifically deal with this subject
I don't write only on market research but I have written on my own experience and found a way that works for me. You see I've always struggled to be effective when completing market and customer research for a new product or business. But over the course of the last few years I've actually had some time to reflect on what works. I wrote about my process here...http://ecofounder.net/business/r... I also include all the resources and links you need to get started. If your launching a business or product this should guide you to being effective by getting you straight to the information and answers you need.    Embed Quote
