★Should I conduct market research before starting development on an app?How do I know my app will be interesting and/or popular? What are the techniques you employ to carry out this research?
In combination with the comments from Prashant and Etay, both fantastic advice, you can test real demand by doing the following. Create a Google Adwords campaign targeting the keywords someone might use who is looking for an app like yours. Create a landing page (mobile optimized, of course) that gives a mock-up image of the app on a phone and talks about some of the features. Make it look like a real (non-app store) promotional page for a real app. Include a big button that says "Get The App!". Install Google analytics on the landing page. When someone clicks the "Get The App!" button just have a message that says something like, "This app will be released soon. Enter your email address below to get notified when it is released." Then run the campaign for a week or so and watch the click-through rate (CTR) for each keyword as well as the clicks on the "Get The App!" button and, ultimately, any resulting email sign-ups.This doesn't have to take very long or cost very much. Just set a daily Adwords budget and an overall campaign budget that you can afford, maybe $200-300.    Embed Quote
