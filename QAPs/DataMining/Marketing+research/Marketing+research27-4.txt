★What are some good examples of leveraging crowd wisdom in market research?
Think this depends a bit on how you define crowdsourcing. If you include non-explicit participations, then multi-variate and A/B testing may be the most powerful crowd-driven research today. I think firms tech/media research firms like Forrester or polling organizations like Gallup have long used "crowds" or panels to understand markets. Organizations like GLG expert networks are also proving important. More recently we have been using Amazon Mechanical Turk for traditional consumer surveys inspired by some of this research http://crowdconf.com/papers.html In our experience with the www.thebetacup.com we received a large number of concepts in response to a brief. A larger group of peers rated and commented on these and then the best ideas where further commented on by end customers. The result was crowdsourced concepts evaluated by both expert and end customer groups. This allowed selection of a winning concept for further investment in store tests.    Embed Quote
