★How do start up business do market research?Like the facts, stats, market knowledge and everything that has to do with it.
Successful ones build their business case from the ground-up. They don't usually rely on the top-down analysis and stats from research reports. They do on-the-field customer development and customer research and estimate how many more customers they can realistically get. They look at the actual metrics of the competition to validate but don't believe their projections. And mostly its the founder who does this research by actually talking to the customers.
