★Where do startup entrepreneurs get market research?I am curious about where startup people find facts, stats, and market knowledge numbers, if they don't have the money to purchase an entire market research document?
Check with a local university. Go to the Marketing department or Entrepreneurship Center and tell them you are interested in getting some market research done. Many students are required to do a market research project in order to graduate. This could take longer and could be less informative than paying a business to do it, but then again it's free and it'll be done by a young college student that knows what's trending in that demographic.    Embed Quote
