★Where do startup entrepreneurs get market research?I am curious about where startup people find facts, stats, and market knowledge numbers, if they don't have the money to purchase an entire market research document?
I've always struggled to be effective when completing market and customer research for a new product or business. But over the course of the last few years I've actually had some time to reflect on what works. I wrote about my process here...http://ecofounder.net/business/r... I also include all the resources and links you need to get started. If your launching a business or product this should guide you to being effective by getting you straight to the information and answers you need.    Embed Quote
