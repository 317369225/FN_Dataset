★Which is a more interesting job? Market research or Business analytics?
If you like digging into granular usage data for a single product in an attempt to spot usage patterns and revenue trends, then you'd probably find business analytics more interesting. I'm not quire sure what you mean by "market research" -- if you're talking about being an equity analyst for a specific sector at an investment bank, then you'd enjoy that if you find top-line revenue and share price forecasting based on macro trends and business fundamentals (not strictly related to product development) interesting. In terms of being an in-house market researcher at a product-focused company, that set of duties is usually combined with more traditional marketing responsibilities in a marketing function, which would involve demographic evaluation and strategic advertising targeting but probably not much with revenue forecasting. Business analytics is more introspective and focused on the specific usage of a product or portfolio of products; market analysis has a macro element to it that involves a general understanding of a company's current product portfolio and product pipeline and where it fits into the dynamic needs of the marketplace in that vertical.    Embed Quote
