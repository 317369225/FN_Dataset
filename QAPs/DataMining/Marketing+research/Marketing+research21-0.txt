★What is the importance of marketing research?
Imagine this scenario—you're throwing a dinner party and assume that 30 strangers will turn up since that's how many came to the party your neighbour had last week You hire caterers at $200 an hour who create a six-course menu, starting with foie gras, veal for the main course, and ending with freshly-made ice cream. It's the night of the party and no one shows up for the first three hours. Finally four people show up—they're all lactose-intolerant vegetarians, so they make polite chit-chat, then leave after 10 minutes. You're left with a four digit bill, a whole load of leftovers, and your solitary sense of failure... Now imagine the same situation, only this time you meet the people beforehand and discover their dietary wants and needs, their availability, and even their personalities. Now your guests are no longer strangers. You also know how many to expect, what time they plan to arrive, their shared interests, and—most importantly of all—exactly what they love to consume. The result? OK, it's not the best dinner party in the world, but everyone has fun. In short, it's a success. That's the importance of market(ing) research: Key decisions like hiring, product selection, and availability can be made based on first-hand information, not assumptions. Any assumptions you have can be evaluated by simply asking questions prior to building a business rather than after expending precious resources. You can even discover information your competitors don't have, then act upon it to create a competitive advantage at best and a whole bunch of happy customers at worst.    Embed Quote
