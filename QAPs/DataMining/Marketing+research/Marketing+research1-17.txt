★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
Understanding the market is extremely important. For a small   business, where budget is tight and time is extremely precious, this   understanding can be acquired by means other than formal market   research.     My opinion is based on the experience I have, which is with a mid-sized IT   Services company that competes world-wide.     There is enough and more information readily available out there today; you   just need to find it. We get information off the internet, from analysts   reports, from what our competitors are doing, from what our clients /   prospects are demanding, from what our Sales people (feet on the ground) are   hearing, from what we hear on the social media, from what we see in trade   shows and events, and what we gather from trail-blazers (from any industry)   in the world. All information is circulated to everybody and are discussed   over regular meetings. Actionable items are derived out of these   meetings.     In a world where change is constant and the need to continuously address   this change essential, it will not do to wait for too long to understand what   the market wants. By then the market would have already changed:-)    Embed Quote
