Market research can be done in various ways. Each specific approach can give you different data that you may need on developing your business and your product/service. I can recommend you to try user testing as a different approach. UsabilityTools UX Suite offers 4 combined tool that allows you to test your users to get solid data on their online behaviors. Online behavior? - Well, let's say you have a prototype of your product page and you need opinions of people. You can ask your friends and colleagues on how it looks, but in the end, you will not get a tangible data out of it.  For this, I can recommend you implementing screenshot click testing and send out to your friends and colleagues to test it out again. Because you know, data matters. Also, you can create surveys (Which you can buy respondents with Cint) that will help you get insights from your target audience. Another tools UsabilityTools offer is Voice of Customer. It is extremely helpful if you want insightful feedback from your users about your product and service. By implementing feedback widget on your website, you can also measure your customer satisfaction, improve your website's performance and your conversion. And yes, I do work for UsabilityTools :)    Embed Quote
