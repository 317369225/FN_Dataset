★What is business research and market research?
Here is how I distinguish the two:  Market research typically involves some kind of data collection, usually by contacting people in your primary market, by survey, interview, emails or focus groups. It can be with business respondents or consumers.  That's called primary research, where contact is made. Secondary research is typically done by looking at existing statistics, studies or documents already in the market, such as market sizing, governmental data, etc. Business research can be alot of things. This might be simply you or someone you hire who searches the Internet for information about markets, competitors, companies, etc. It can be reading annual reports or analyzing websites and generating conclusions. It's a very broad term. I'm sure that someone else can add to this cursory response, but it should be a good start!    Embed Quote
