★Will crowdsourcing replace traditional market research?
I agree with Josh that customized research will always be necessary for companies- but I think a "controlled", crowd-sourcing model is ideal. What's more valuable, 40 answers from the general public on the telemedicine industry, or 40 answers (where the experts get paid for their contributions) from physicians, hospital administrators, healthcare consultants, insurance companies and telemed companies themselves? The careful curation of your sources will always be necessary in strong research, and in giving these stakeholder sources a piece of the pie, you will inevitably build better research than what's put out by random analysts at market research firms. The crowdsourcing research companies who carefully curate and build a critical mass of experts in each vertical, that these questions are then sourced to, will be the winners.    Embed Quote
