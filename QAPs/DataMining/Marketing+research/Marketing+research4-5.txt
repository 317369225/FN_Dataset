★Will crowdsourcing replace traditional market research?
If you think about crowdsourcing as a way to obtain data from twitter, facebook and blogs... I will say that it´s a good tool to know if your campaigns are being heard and talked about. These tools are good to monitor the conversation and lear from what users are saying. Let´s say you have 10 products in your web and the one that´s being promoted it´s not being talked about. With these tools you can refine your online strategy. It´s good to follow what users are saying and work in that direction. Hope that´s help.    Embed Quote
