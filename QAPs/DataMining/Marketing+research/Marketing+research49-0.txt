★Should I conduct market research before starting development on an app?How do I know my app will be interesting and/or popular? What are the techniques you employ to carry out this research?
You should absolutely start some research before development, but the bulk of the research/surprises/changes will occur during development. You need to check if the idea already exists. If it does, then why is yours going to be better? Why are people/why are they not using it? There are a lot of things you need to evaluate before you decide that your app is going to be successful. Due diligence is probably the most important research to conduct. If you don't do it, your app may be useless or even border on legal issues.    Embed Quote
