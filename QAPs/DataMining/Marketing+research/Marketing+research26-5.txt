★What are some good resources to use when doing market research for a startup?(Besides MTurk) :-]
Some of the methods I use personally: 1. Google Adwords Keyword Tool What's the search volume like? Keyword suggestions with high volume could be use an alternative solution. 2. Google Trends Making sure relevant keywords are on the rising. Also use it to see which location have a higher search volume for the keywords. 3. Craigslist and Forums Is there something that people keep asking for or constantly posts? 4. Talking to people I think will be using my product This one would be the most invaluable one. The real challenge is developing the right set of questions to ask. I learnt more in a day of talking to a customer than all the Internet scouring I did in 3 weeks. 5. Observation Observing users in their product usage can be rewarding - for instance, if I were to do free movie streaming on the mobile with ads as a revenue, I might have trouble with the connection if they spend a lot of time in the subway.    Embed Quote
