Hi there! We have some really great blogs on market research. I see that Rick listed some great resources, but as he mentioned, many of these resources didn't hit on many methodological points. As a survey company, methodology is our middle name! I find that one of the best ways to find these blogs is to simply Google search "SurveyMonkey Market Research". Here are some of my favorites: Marketing Surveys, Sample Questions, and Examples How Successful Marketers Identify The Best Ideas The Metric Most Brand Marketers Can't Measure " SurveyMonkey Blog How to Test Images, Messages, Packaging, and Product Concepts with Surveys Measure Brand Loyalty: Build Brand Power I hope this helps you, and some other Quora visitors, out!    Embed Quote
