★How can Quora help improve qualitative market research?
Be creative: i.e., don't just do a "focus group." This might include: 1. Form a small user panel and field them questions on particular topics of interest via email or text message.  After gathering individual responses, have them convene in an online focus group via Webex or other online meeting service. 2. Ethnography: visit users and observe how they use it - either in person or via an online service that can track their usage and record their page views and mouse movements. 3. Perform in-depth interviews with power users to uncover their needs and values by using interview techniques like "laddering."  This may help uncover other needs for services not already offered on the site. 4. Hire a company that gets it: i.e., one that won't offer you cookie cutter solutions from their set of existing methodologies.  One tipoff that should raise the BS meter: if they use a sub-brand for each of their techniques/methods.    Embed Quote
