★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
Doh. If you don't do it how do you know what people want? If you do t know what people want going to Vegas is a lot more fun and less stressful. But it doesn't need to be complex. Get out of the house and talk to people.  I'm running a stand at an exhibition in Singapore at the moment. Wow! Does that tell me what my customers want? It sure does. For another startup we're making pork crackling. Crazy idea maybe but our market research is to make scratchings and go out and give them to people. Do they like them? Third iteration now and the take up is massively higher and far more moorish. Next experiment is to find out how much people will pay.  Then if we have enough peeps who like it and will pay snob we may start the company. Once we have some sales and have been operating a bit then we might do a business plan. How that turns out all depends in what sales and feedback looks like so we decide whether it will be a lifestyle business or it can scale and we'll be raising cash.    Embed Quote
