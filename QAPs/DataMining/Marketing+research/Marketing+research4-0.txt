★Will crowdsourcing replace traditional market research?
There will always be a place for some high-end, custom market research.  But, the newer crowdsourcing options will replace the majority of the standardized market research market as well as expand the market into smaller businesses that did not do market research before. In my opinion, traditional market research firms are pretty old, bloated, inefficient, expensive dinosaurs that prey on Fortune 500 company marketing execs with big budgets.  (I hope there's not many traditional market research peeps on Quora yet). So the new crowdsourced market research companies like aytm.com and crowdtap.com (no affiliation) will be quite successful in my opinion.  They offer a better, faster, and cheaper result than the traditional competitors.  And frankly, that's the promise of almost all well-structured crowdsourcing companies: Better Faster Cheaper The tradeoff is that in order to achieve B, F, C - you also need to standardize the inputs and outputs.  So, traditional market research firms will need to offer more highly customized solutions to stay in business.  Anything that's standardized will move to crowdsourcing.    Embed Quote
