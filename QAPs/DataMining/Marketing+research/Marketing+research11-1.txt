★Would you outsource your startup's market research?
Market research is, by nature, a proprietary endeavor. Startups generally need to bring in outside help to expand their perspectives and get access to tools and talent they may not be able to maintain in house. That gives startups a much better chance at thorough market research that actually gives them the information they need. However, startups that hand over the reins of their market research projects are much less likely to get what they need. It's critical to remember that the founder(s) created the vision and the product. Market research projects tyrn out best when all parties involved work as partners to get the best results, with the startup company keeping a firm hand on the reins.    Embed Quote
