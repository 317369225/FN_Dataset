★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
This is an interesting question. My experience is that many large corporations conduct or pay (a lot) for market research, and then fail to act on the findings. Smaller companies usually don't carry out good quality market research either because it's too expensive, or it just never occurs to them. Understanding your customers is immensely valuable no matter what size your company is. Being able to justify $20k or more for a one-off project once per year or so may be the deciding factor.    Embed Quote
