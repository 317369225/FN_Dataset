★Which market research firms (online- or email-based) would you recommend?
It really depends on the type of service you are looking for, the geographical scope and the sector expertise. Most MR firms have developed the capability to conduct research online or via e-mail. If you look for a specialist in just data collection, then you might want to check with companies such as SSI, Toluna, GMI, Research Now just to name some global ones. There are many more who provide good services and might be focused on certain regions or countries that meet your requirement. If you go for a data collection specialist, then you have to take care of the study design and analysis yourself. If you require full service MR, then I would start by looking into sector expertise first. It's difficult to make a general statement whether the big ones that you can find in Honomichl are the best choice. What you buy with big companies like TNS, IPSOS, etc. is a name (label) and methodology. It's likely that your requirement can be covered by one of their department. But most likely they might be higher priced, too. There are many very good mid-size and small MR agencies who provide excellent service. Often those are specialized in some type of study or sector.
