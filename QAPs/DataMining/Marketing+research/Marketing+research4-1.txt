★Will crowdsourcing replace traditional market research?
Crowd sourcing definitely has the possibility to be very disruptive to traditional research methods.  However, I don't know that it will ever supplant existent methods.  Think supplement rather than supplant. One of the primary problems with crowd sourced data is that it is not generalizable to the population under study.  There are also significant biases introduced into the data.  For example, think of CNN's Twitter sentiment analysis coverage during the 2010 US elections.  It was way off from actual results! However, the problems with crowd sourced data do not make it completely invaluable.  The uses I see for it are mostly to supplement findings from traditional research methods.    Embed Quote
