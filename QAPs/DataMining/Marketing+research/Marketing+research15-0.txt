★What are some innovative marketing research methodologies?
Oy vey. This is a broad question with several ways in. 1. Some things, like Bayesian statistics and discrete choice analysis (DCA), have been around for a while but are waaaay underutilized in marketing research because they're not as easy as Likert scale direct response survey questions ("would this ad increase or decrease your likelihood to purchase Acme Brand Consumer Product X?"). So it would indeed be innovative to use these methods (3 good examples: The Modellers use DCA, Affinnova uses evolutionary algorithms, and BrainJuicer uses prediction markets). Other things, like mobile surveys (apps, txt surveys, .m sites) and in-home video diaries (like QualVu) are new technologies that open up new doors to new data. Protobrand's Meta4, for instance, lets you do projective techniques but with a distributed, large, quant online sample. An under-appreciated factor is the THEORY you apply to your data: social psych, behavioral econ, material anthro, game theory, etc. You can be quite innovative with old data, just by viewing it through a new theory. Finally, just as there's a diffusion of innovation through consumer populations (early adopters, laggards, etc.), what's innovative to one client might be old hat to another.    Embed Quote
