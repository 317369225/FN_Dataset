★Where do startup entrepreneurs get market research?I am curious about where startup people find facts, stats, and market knowledge numbers, if they don't have the money to purchase an entire market research document?
You can buy survey respondents from services like Survata (https://www.survata.com). You can target the respondents to get the exact demographic or behavioral segment that you need (disclaimer: I work there). Especially for entrepreneurs, services such as ours might be preferred since it provides the same breadth of information for a fraction of the cost of a traditional panel research company.    Embed Quote
