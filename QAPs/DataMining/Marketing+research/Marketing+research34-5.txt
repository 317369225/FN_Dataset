★Which is a more interesting job? Market research or Business analytics?
Market research is doing the research, asking people, doing surveys etc etc - provides the raw data you can then do analysis on. Business analysts are experts in the industry in which they operate, be it finance, manufacturing, retail or research. For example, a business analyst working in the finance industry must understand calculations for a payback period and internal rate of return, as both calculations are required to calculate returns on an investment. Business analysts must also be comfortable with data manipulation and often must be able to perform analyses using spreadsheets and database tools.Good luck.    Embed Quote
