★Will crowdsourcing replace traditional market research?
Hard to say, I think  that Crowdsourcing should come in conjunction with traditional market research. Crowdsourcing may give you a better understanding of what the public is looking for and how people portray the reputation of a company or a product but it can’t give you all the indicators that traditional market research can give. Actually, I was under the same dilemma a few months ago and found something that is neither traditional or crowd-based, it’s called SpyFu (I think I found it onChekkt.com). I think it’s a valuable tool for anyone who’s doing market / competitive research.    Embed Quote
