★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
I suppose it depends on the actual "market research" that is done. In my personal opinion, the less abstract the research is, the more useful it is. For example, a survey asking people how they feel about a problem is a lot less useful than creating an experiment (with a very simple prototype) and measuring user response. Small businesses have the advantage of being small and having the ability to make quick changes. They should use that to their advantage.    Embed Quote
