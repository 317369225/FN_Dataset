★How can Quora help improve qualitative market research?
I'm assuming that the question is focusing on how Quora could be incorporated into the qualitative market research toolbox in order to add something new and worthwhile. At this point, Quora seems to be a community of early adopters and tech-savvy folks. It has limited reach among mainstream consumers and is not yet suitable for posing questions to a broad audience. I do see potential value in reaching out to the Quora community when designing qualitative research on innovative new products and services, especially in the tech area. Quora could be a first stop in generating relevant question threads for a discussion guide, using language that is current and savvy. Also, by monitoring the answers throughout Quora, a good qualitative researcher could obtain insights into emerging trends and shifting perspectives. But it's early days, as I said. Tons of future potential.    Embed Quote
