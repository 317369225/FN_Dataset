★How does Warren Buffett make his market research?
I agree with Michael Lovell and add my two cents. He reads annual reports since his 20s with the intention of memorizing a lot of informatoin and making everyhing fit together. Suppose you read Coca-Cola's report and you try to see how the information fits in that industry and how it is related to other industries, to its suppliers and the supply chain. You try to understand industry dynamics and how it has evolved. You try to learn an understand management. They key is that it is not just Coca-Cola you are learning. You are learning a part of the puzzle that you will be able to piece together later. If you then read a report 5 years later you will be able to piece apparently simple diparate facts into a deep understanding of what the  main issues are, the drivers, and to see their effect in other companies and other sectors. Most sector analysts, almost by definition, would have a hard time coming up with that level of understanding.    Embed Quote
