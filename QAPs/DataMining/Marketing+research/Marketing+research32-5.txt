★What are the best ways to motivate respondents for market research?Apart from incentives, is direct feedback an option? And is gamification a good path to follow? Other ideas? ...
Motivation factor will differ for a variety of respondents that may include – individuals, professionals, companies etc… I say it would depend on your approach to market research. Monetary incentives (coupons, discounts etc…) could be your best bet to drive the respondents and if you have an idea that can be converted into a game it might be useful. I suggest segment your respondents based on some criteria that will help you establish a motivation factor of your respondents. Example - If your list of respondents includes companies, they might love to participate in a research if at the end of your research you would share your findings with them or publish their name as a participant. Visibility is a motivation here. And while you’re at it and if feasible, schedule a phone call or try one-2-one meetings rather than sending out questionnaires or survey forms to your respondents. It uncomplicates which in itself is motivating. Similarly, for a different section of respondents you would use a different strategy.    Embed Quote
