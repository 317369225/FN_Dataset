★What is the future of market research?
It's mobile + video. Mobile is empowering consumers and making it more convenient for them to interact with brands - whether they are purchasing a product, researching a brand, asking friends for advice and reviews on social media sites. People don't have the time to drive to a focus group, nor are they interested in brands interrupting their lives in any way. Think of what's happening in marketing right now: the new trend is a purely permission-based model. Why video? The ability that video gives you to read non-verbal communication, to see things through the consumers’ eyes, and to capture “in-the-moment” insights is unmatched. Mobile (and all market research, for that matter) methodologies that ignore video are harvesting only a small fraction of what companies need to make informed decisions. Mobile research allows us to move away from having consumers describe hypothetical situations and closer to respondents sharing the facts and actual happenings around them – but these insights can be skewed if you can’t compare what they narrate against the visual reality around them. That’s one reason video responses are superior to written responses. On-the-go text qualitative research demands great effort on the participants’ part, which could affect the quality of the insights. Video takes less effort to produce on the go because participants don’t have to reproduce what they are experiencing but capture it as they live it.
