★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
Yes!!! Market research is a challenge for many small businesses. The data that you may need to acquire may not exist in a database, nevertheless your marketing strategy should be well informed with real information. My recommendation for market research for small businesses will always be the customer or prospect survey. Just pick up the phone and call your best customers to clearly understand what you do well, what you do that is unique, what you could do that no one else does. This type of research is essential for creating a marketing strategy and positioning statement that gets results.    Embed Quote
