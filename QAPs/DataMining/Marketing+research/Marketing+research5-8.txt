★Where do startup entrepreneurs get market research?I am curious about where startup people find facts, stats, and market knowledge numbers, if they don't have the money to purchase an entire market research document?
Its been my experience that startups do what most folks do - search the web.  Many analysts blog and will release top-line data from their research which is easy to surface if you know who covers your space.  If you're a reasonably savvy searcher, you might also be able to uncover additional data in newspapers or industry/trade magazines available online.  I have known the odd startup to use their local library and if they have connections to a b-school, the attached library may subscribe to some market research aggregators.  I have also heard of startups just using their own networks to ferret out copies of useful research.... FYI, if you are an early-stage Ontario-based technology entrepreneur, you may qualify for free provincial market intelligence services offered by MaRS, where I currently work.    Embed Quote
