★What should marketing research parameters be?As a marketing manager you have the opportunity to organize and set a  mission for a new research department. What are some of the parameters  you are going to consider? Thanks. Tyrone
You can only quantify the costs that you save compared to the previous situation: did you outsource it first? The 'value added' by the research is less easy to quantify: it should improve the quality of decision making, but how do you value this in dollars? Perhaps a better paramater is the internal grades that colleagues give to the work of the department.    Embed Quote
