★What are good ways to do proper market research?We want to found a business and look for potential customers. However before meeting with customers we want to have an overview about the market we are entering. Any suggestion whats the best way to do market research?
Talk to your potential customers. In this stage, you're not trying to sell your product or service. You just want to ask certain questions that will help uncover the main problem you need to solve and what price range customers will be willing to pay. This is easier than you might think. You need the courage to go in at a slow time for the business ( or call in) and ask for the manager or whoever you think can answer your questions. The question are really important. Make sure you have a list of specific questions you will like answered, about 3-5 questions. If your business has customers that can be found in your area, this is a good way to do market research. Cheers.    Embed Quote
