★Why do startups seldom hire market research companies?Why do big companies?
Echoing what Ian Crosby said, startups are usually unaware of who their customers are. More often than not they have identified a problem that exists and know that there are people out there that will want to use their product/service, but they may not know exactly which segments of these people their product/service will resonate with best. I'm working at a startup right now in the e-commerce field and the customers who have received the most success on our platform are ones that are using it in ways we would have never expected. When you are first starting out, there is a lot of iteration that goes on. You come up with an idea, you push it out to the world and you see what sticks. You take the good things and iterate on those. This process naturally leaves you to continually discover newtypes of users that you might not have identified at first - whether it was because you were unaware they existed, or because your product/service has evolved into something different enough from the beginning that you are now filling the needs of a new set of users. It doesn't make sense for a small company to waste time and money at hte beginning when the results of the market research will more than likely be obsolete withing weeks or months, if not days.    Embed Quote
