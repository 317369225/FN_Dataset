★How can Quora help improve qualitative market research?
There are significant benefits and detriments to any research methodology.   And you should never use just one approach to make conclusions. When questions are worded in a non-biasing way, Quora is an excellent place to get an intial and very raw gut-check from it's user base (which happens to be VERY valley-centric, tech-saavy, male-heavy and interconnected in it's nature) So, asking a tech or venture related question with the expectation of getting some broad directional feedback might be of use. There's minimal value in utilizing Quora to form conclusive feedback on ANY topic that's unrelated to a very VERY specific set of issues.   Because of the source validity derived from having a 'network' of people whom you follow and the use of qualifications, you MAY get more relevant feedback on certain issues where people have expertise... but then again you must be weary of veiled self promotion.    Embed Quote
