★Is Survey Monkey a recommended tool for market research? Why?
I agree with Timur that Survey Monkey is "a bit of a credibility killer" for market research surveys.  Survey Monkey makes it very easy for people with no survey training whatsoever to send out a survey, but the downside of that is that lots of people see some very bad surveys come to them from Survey Monkey.  The result is that Survey Monkey has a lot of market share, but the brand does not confer any credibility on the people sponsoring the survey.  If you're really strapped for cash, there is a survey program called SurveyGold that's only $100 but ranks higher than Survey Monkey according to this Survey Software Review 2014.  I also have found that Survey Monkey isn't as functional when you want export your survey data for your own analysis in SPSS, SAS, or other statistical software.  As for QuestionPro and SurveyGizmo, I'm less enthused about QuestionPro, because I have found their product to problematic from a data security standpoint.  On the other hand, I have generally been impressed with SurveyGizmo and have found their telephone tech support to be top notch.  Qualtrics is great in terms of the functionality it offers, but if you're on a shoestring budget, it'll cost you.    Embed Quote
