★What is necessary to become a market researcher/analyst?Are there any course you would recommend, either long distance or part-time ones in London. Apart from courses what else could be done to improve ones research and analytical skills?
I always think it is best to show that you can actually do something. In terms of analysis, you can write a few papers, create a blog, or do an online presentation to show-off your skills. Being able to program surveys is a marketable skill.    Embed Quote
