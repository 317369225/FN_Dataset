★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
Yes. Above all, small businesses lack the resource of time. You can't afford to spend 6, 12, 18 months going in the wrong direction.  That's far more costly than spending a little money on a survey. Also it's practically free to ask questions to your friends, family, suppliers and most importantly, your customers.  Even if I was running a lemonade stand I'd ask if people thought I was pricing too high or too low and if they liked the taste.    Embed Quote
