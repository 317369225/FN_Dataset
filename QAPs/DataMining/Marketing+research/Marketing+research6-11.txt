★What are some good new market research tools?Need some exciting (as data can be) alternatives to old comScore and Compete...
I'm a pretty big fan of Illuminate, seeing as agencies are generally priced pretty steeply and it can be hard to know the right questions to ask (which can present problems in using a straight up survey tool), something like Illuminate (http://www.illuminatecontent.com, disclosure I'm a co-founder) can be handy as its low-cost and self-service but has a lot of "built-in" market research knowledge (it's kind of like a self-service agency). That makes it easy to get feedback on product features/service offering, the shape of the market, and run focus groups on your own without spending too much.    Embed Quote
