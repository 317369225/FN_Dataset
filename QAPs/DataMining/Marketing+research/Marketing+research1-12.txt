★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
I have 10 years experience in market research and using it to develop products for a Fortune 500 company.  I agree with everything Amy Shropshire said regarding the importance of market research in developing new products.  Market research doesn't have to be expensive either.  I'm a big fan of qualitative research when you're on a tight budget.  For $10,000 a reputable market research company could find you 15 consumers in your target group (just make sure your target group is specific and sizable enough to meet your sales goals).  If you're going to show them the product or prototype then meet the consumer in the correct context.  For example, if the product is dish soap then you'd want to meet them in their home and have them wash dishes with your product to better understand how your product is different/better than the current state.  You will be surprised how much inspiration consumers will give you.  You will end up wanting to make your product even better. If you have a lot of friends you could use free online survey tools like www.surveymonkey.com.  I think I have also used Zoomerang.  You could post a link on facebook.  Post questions on social networking sites, too.  Give your product to 15 people you know who are in your target group and let them use it for a couple weeks and then sit down and have a conversation with them about their experience. Market research companies should be able to help you design affordable research and will consult to help you find the right thing for your needs.  Just call around till you find one that can easily and cheaply access your target audience.  I liked MarketTools because they seemed to be the best value.    Embed Quote
