★How do you do market research for a startup idea?
Startups typically have a smaller research budget, so I would recommend going with a faster, smaller and more nimbler technology. You can buy survey respondents from services like Survata (https://www.survata.com - disclosure: I work there).  You can target the respondents to get the exact demographic or behavioral segment that you need.    Embed Quote
