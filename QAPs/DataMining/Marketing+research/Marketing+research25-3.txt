★What is the difference between design research and market research?
Adding to Ash's answer: Design Research is essentially more qualitative in nature - how do people use the product, what are their key needs etc. - which can further be converted into insights for conceptualizing better products ahead. Market Research on the other hand is more  quantitative in nature - number of people buying one product vis-a-vis another one etc. - which might tell you the market performance of products, but won't answer the real 'why' behind them.    Embed Quote
