★Which market research firms (online- or email-based) would you recommend?
Can you clarify the type of online research you are looking for? This would help us to provide a more specific answer to your question.    As the other posters have noted, the right company will depend on your requirements. Here are some of the factors you should consider: 1) your study requirements such as whether it is global, or market -specifice, B2C or B2B 2) The sector that you are in or researching, e.g. pharma, financial, media, polling etc. as you might want a firm that have researchers with a specialism in that area 3) Project scope: are you looking for full service research, or just online data collection / sample? Are you looking to develop an ongoing research tool, such as your own online community panel, or simply to access someone else's? 4) Your own resources / level of involvement: How 'hands on' do you want to be e.g. self-serve access to software, or have the company take care of everything for you?   With some of these clarified, you might get some more tailored recommendations.    Embed Quote
