★Where do startup entrepreneurs get market research?I am curious about where startup people find facts, stats, and market knowledge numbers, if they don't have the money to purchase an entire market research document?
At Lab42, we leverage social media in order to offer market research at a low-cost, much lower that traditional market research document. We were built by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs, and we know how vital market research is to the success of your startup. Basically, we exchange virtual currency for completed surveys on social media sites, like Facebook. This allows us to target respondents, and provide results quickly and cheaply. If you have any questions about Lab42, feel free to message me! I'd love to speak with you regarding your startup.    Embed Quote
