★What is necessary to become a market researcher/analyst?Are there any course you would recommend, either long distance or part-time ones in London. Apart from courses what else could be done to improve ones research and analytical skills?
The best researchers are those who understand the mechanics of analytics AND who can explain findings to others in a way that's relevant, meaningful, and actionable.   Try building your skills in this area by looking for ways to explain the numbers reported in industry press and the news to your colleagues and friends.  In terms of formal training, professional organizations related to the field usually offer a round-up of upcoming training and conferences. For example: The Web Analytics Association has details about recommended analytics training courses here: http://www.webanalyticsassociati... The Burke Institute offers some excellent seminars & training for both basic & advanced market resaerch skills: http://www.burkeinstitute.com/ Any basic-to-advanced course in statistics will also be invaluable.   Books and blogs from industry thought leaders and agencies are another good way to develop skills and gain exposure. A few of my favorites include:   Web Analytics: An Hour a Day (http://www.webanalyticshour.com/) and the author's blog, http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/ Measurement agency comScore posts a lot of interesting analysis on their company blog: http://blog.comscore.com/ Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project routinely posts well-written, easily digestible, and free findings about online trends, http://www.pewinternet.org/   Finally, never underestimate the power of clear, crisp communication through both words and visuals. Read up on and practice storytelling (Best bet: Made to Stick, http://www.madetostick.com) and make a habit of observing good design, especially through infographics, like those seen in USA Today, the New York Times, and Wired Magazine.    Embed Quote
