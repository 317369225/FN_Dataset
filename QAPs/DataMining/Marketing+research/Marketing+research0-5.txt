★How do you conduct market research?It seems to me that the success of business plans are dependent on good market research. Therefore, it seems business opportunities would be revealed by researching all markets, somehow. Is this possible? How do people conduct "market research" ? (I truly know nothing about this)
I definitely agree that market research is key for developing (and even established) businesses. By knowing their audience, a business can develop and pivot effectively. At Lab42, we conduct market research using social networks, such as Facebook. Basically, a quiz is administered to users after they've played a Facebook game (think FarmVille). In exchange for their completed survey, they receive virtual currency. By using Facebook, we're able to target very specific demographics and a fresh user base each time; this is done very quickly and at a low cost. Of course, traditional methods of market research, as described above, can also be effective; it really depends on the needs of the business.    Embed Quote
