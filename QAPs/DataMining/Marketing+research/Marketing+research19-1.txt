★What is necessary to become a market researcher/analyst?Are there any course you would recommend, either long distance or part-time ones in London. Apart from courses what else could be done to improve ones research and analytical skills?
MRS has an extensive learning program for all levels, mostly in London - Training | Market Research Society Still market research is more like a craft than science. The best way to develop a necessary skill set is to join a large market research company (think TNS, Nielsen, IPSOS) at an entry level. Almost any academic background which includes some statistics and data analysis will usually work for an entry-level analyst position; economics, sociology, psychology, and sure CS and any engineering degree should open the doors.    Embed Quote
