★Is Survey Monkey a recommended tool for market research? Why?
I'd love to echo what Timur said - Survey Monkey is not known for a well rounded market research tool. That being said, they do a great job at what their tool is made for - data collection. As Timur mentioned, doing market research consists of more than just creating a survey - and a lot of that deals with how you word the survey questions. That is why here at Cvent we have created an enterprise level feedback management tool that has a perfect use in market research and have paired that solution with subject matter experts to help consult your team to make the best survey you possibly can. Our tool allows you to have access to every portion of the survey life cycle in one tool; collect, analyze, and act. The Cvent Web Survey Software will allow you to collect your data easily with high response rates, analyze that data natively in the tool, and publish your results in an easy way. I'd love to learn if you have a market research project you're looking to launch - shoot me an email! gandia@cvent.com Best, Greg Andia    Embed Quote
