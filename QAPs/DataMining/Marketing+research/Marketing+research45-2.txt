★Which company does the best market research for new product development?Which company conducts market research that consistently results in profitable or high-performing products?
Gartner offers great insights into developing products for the enterprise sector. Their reports are comprehensive and very well put together. Gartner "Hype Cycles" map out the various technologies in various verticals (ex: Social Networking, Media and Entertainment, Unified Communications etc.), and predict years to mainstream adoption and market maturity for those technologies. They also offer great vendor rating reports, where they analyze public technology companies from the perspective of an enterprise client. Gartner reports don't touch on consumer products much, for B2B I have yet to find a better database though.    Embed Quote
