★How do you conduct market research?It seems to me that the success of business plans are dependent on good market research. Therefore, it seems business opportunities would be revealed by researching all markets, somehow. Is this possible? How do people conduct "market research" ? (I truly know nothing about this)
There are so many techniques to conduct Market Research. We can divide the main Market Research techniques in two big groups: Traditional techniques New methods In the first category there are basically Surveys and Focus Groups. In the second category we have plenty of emerging techniques, such as: Biometric Measurements, Virtual Shopping Online Collaboration Tools Live Audience Response Social Media Data Mining (probably the most important and effective way to get information about the market) As Sarah Ostman, also in my startup (Cubeyou) we provide Market Research through Social Media, but not administering surveys, just analyzing users' interests and behaviours, thanks to Data Mining algorithms.    Embed Quote
