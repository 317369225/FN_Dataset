★Should I conduct market research before starting development on an app?How do I know my app will be interesting and/or popular? What are the techniques you employ to carry out this research?
No. If you do not have an idea that you will be a customer of, market research will not help much. Market research can give depth of problem / opportunity but at first it has to be your own need analysis. This world is filled with examples of user research firm's illogical reports defining some opportunity by someone who never solved any or created something worthwhile. Be your own guide. User research can validate and assure the need. It is worth that much. Don't start other way round. HTH    Embed Quote
