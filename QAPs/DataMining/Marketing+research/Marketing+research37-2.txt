★What is business research and market research?
Business Research is primarily to understand the business goals and KPIs.How the particular industry or business is performing and shaping up. Market Research is to understand the consumers of that business : this can be to understand how the companies in the category are behaving and not earning/growing,how the users/business or end-to-end consumers are perceiving the brand or how are they reacting towards the brand/category. For example : Business research would be to understand the financial metrics : the market cap/market size/share etc from the industry sources about a particular firm or the category while the Market Research would eb something on the lines of understanding if the Brand (not the word 'company' here)is being accepted/rejected/absorbed/loved/hated/reviewed/et cetera).
