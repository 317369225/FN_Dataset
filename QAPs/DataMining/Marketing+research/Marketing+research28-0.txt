★How will augmented reality influence marketing and market research?
Visual processing, which is the common interpretation of Augmented Reality could have a huge range of implications within Marketing and research. Effectively the ability to Recognise, Track and Manipulate live streamed images allows for a much higher level of automation in things like: Facial recognition Eye tracking Body language interpretation And Categorisation of the above Higher levels of automation almost universally mean lower costs and more proliferation. If it develops as I believe it could the implications of this technology are similar to the advent of Search Engines on the Internet, which essentially organise and filter text based content. Apply this model to Video and Images and you have a powerful tool that will allow you a whole new dimension of information otherwise lost. -A marketing Gold Mine    Embed Quote
