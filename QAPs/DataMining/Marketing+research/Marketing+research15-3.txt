★What are some innovative marketing research methodologies?
Mobile, social, digital are all where the latest innovations are coming from when it comes to new ways to get data, but in addition to how we collect insights there's the incredible amount of data already in existence that needs mining. Now that we have all kinds of information from consumers available there still needs to be the ability to make sense of the data. An example in the healthcare space is the expansion and adoption of electronic medical records (EMR) which provides healthcare providers and social workers with the potential to see patterns in diseases, drugs and treatment procedures across large populations. That is the potential in EMR, but the reality is that much of this data is not yet being leveraged to solve medical problems and often the fears of following HIPAA requirements and different EMR platform compatibility barriers as well as adequate staffing for this purpose prevent EMR data from becoming the source for treatment innovations. Once these barriers are overcome and more data mining can be done with anonymous patient level data there can be some breakthroughs in how patient information is leveraged to improve outcomes.    Embed Quote
