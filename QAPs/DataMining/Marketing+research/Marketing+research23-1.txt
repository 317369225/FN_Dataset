★How does Warren Buffett make his market research?
During his appearance with Bill Gates on CNBC at Columbia University, he mentioned that in the 1950s the firm Moody's published a book each year that had a description and financials on every publicly traded company.  He said the book was 3 inches thick and that he read every page, every year.  In doing so, he found 1 or maybe 2 original investment ideas that went on to make him money.  He said if you are getting your ideas from someone else, you are too late to the party and on the wrong side of the transaction.  Bill Gates agreed that you cannot always think with the crowd, no original thinking and hence no original ideas arise from doing so.  Get going and do your own research. :)    Embed Quote
