★How much does market research cost per response?Just a range, any information will help
The cost per response is falling all the time, especially for the self-service options. If you're willing to put some work into creating your own questionnaire, then you can collect responses on Google Consumer Surveys, Survey Monkey Audience or Mechanical Turk for as little as 10c per response. One warning about Google Consumer Surveys: they'll only ask a maximum of two questions per respondent. If you're running a multi-question survey then you'll end up collecting responses from different people.    Embed Quote
