★What are the best ways to motivate respondents for market research?Apart from incentives, is direct feedback an option? And is gamification a good path to follow? Other ideas? ...
Motivating people should be a mix of different aspects (and probably I forgot lots of them…): The subject of the survey should be close enough to the respondent. This is a must have to start the survey - if people are not interested, they will not start. Choose the right contact method (phone, face to face or online), and even better, offer the respondent to choose the way he wants to complete the survey Once people have started, they should be motivated to complete it. And again there should be a mix: Do not patronize the respondents: Avoid the asking of boring/repetitive things; do not ask things you already know... Make it fun; gamification can be a tool to do this, but also some nice visual things can help (as example: in a web based survey use a simple flash instead of a grid) Challenge people; make sure they must think before they answer a question and start an intelligent conversation with them. How about we treat our respondents like they all had an IQ above 120? Make sure they are and remain involved; feedback at the end of a survey is a nice way to do this, but maybe not always possible. If not send them some feedback later on (you might want to ask them additional stuff later on) And, as a final note, leave the research up to real market researchers and their suppliers. Those people know how to sample, how to word questions...    Embed Quote
