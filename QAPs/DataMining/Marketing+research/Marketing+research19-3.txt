★What is necessary to become a market researcher/analyst?Are there any course you would recommend, either long distance or part-time ones in London. Apart from courses what else could be done to improve ones research and analytical skills?
Lots of people have analytical skills. The key, in my opinion, is to learn how to communicate those results so they can be usable and actionable by non-analytical team members. Anything that will improve your communication, presentation, or data-visualization skills will help you stand out.    Embed Quote
