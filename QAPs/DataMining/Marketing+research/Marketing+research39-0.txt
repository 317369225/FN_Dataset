★What companies use big data for market research?
All, big data! The term has become a buzz phrase, so I guess you would have to first define what you mean by "big data". When I think of projects requiring text analysis of large data repositories, such as an international car manufacturer's customer service transcripts over a 10 year period, I would think of that as "big data" in my particular profession. Clearly, this is quite different than "big data" that an astrophysicist, for example, would be dealing with. Using my example, I would suggest that all large consumer products and manufacturing companies (e.g. Revlon, Toyota, Maytag, Pfizer, etc.) and service providers (Bank of America, State Farm, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Columbia Pictures, etc.) Would be dealing with a "big data" situation when conducting market research. Public figures like those running for office would also be potential users of big data. Any entity that provides a product or service for a mass audience would be a potential big data user given this example.    Embed Quote
