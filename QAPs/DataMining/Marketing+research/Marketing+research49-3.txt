★Should I conduct market research before starting development on an app?How do I know my app will be interesting and/or popular? What are the techniques you employ to carry out this research?
The short answer is: You never know. You should always do your due diligence and validate your app idea with research. Identify your target audience and start asking them questions. Try to interpret their responses and see how your idea stacks up. Also keep in mind that users generally do not know what they want until they see it/ use it so if you are developing something other than a game try to keep that in mind.    Embed Quote
