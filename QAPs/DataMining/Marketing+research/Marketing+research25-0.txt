★What is the difference between design research and market research?
Market Research Gives business insights early on by identifying target segments and opportunities. What people say they will buy. Statistically valid large sample sizes. Broad insight. What/who: Segments, trends and demographics. Business insight. Identifying and uncovering target customer segments, preferences, opinions and requirements. More quantitative. Tends to involve large numbers. Typical example: Quantitative one-way communication online survey. Design Research Provides appropriate inspiration about how a solution should be designed by identifying key needs. Why people said they would buy. Small sample sizes. Deep, focused insight. Why/how: Understand what target segment want to do with the product. Insight into the design, innovation and iteration process. Finding the needs people don´t even know they have. More qualitative. Observed behavior of users. Typical example: Qualitative Ethnographic observational study and two-way communication interview.    Embed Quote
