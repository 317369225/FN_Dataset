★What are the best "market research apps" available?I am looking for a list of apps that includes either apps from "traditional" market research agencies (GFK, Kantar, Ipsos etc), internet panels, or new type of market researchers (eg crowdtap)
Illuminate (http://www.illuminatecontent.com, disclosure I'm a co-founder) is handy as its low-cost and self-service but has a lot of "built-in" market research knowledge (it's kind of like a self-service agency), so it avoids the issues of survey tools where you have to know the "right questions" to ask. That makes it easy to get feedback on product features/service offering, the shape of the market, and run focus groups on your own without spending too much.    Embed Quote
