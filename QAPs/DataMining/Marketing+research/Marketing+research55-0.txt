With the advent of nimbler technologies, you can do market research for a lot cheaper than through traditional panels and methodologies. You can buy survey respondents from services like Survata (https://www.survata.com - disclosure: I work there).  You can target the respondents to get the exact demographic or behavioral segment that you need.    Embed Quote
