★Will crowdsourcing replace traditional market research?
Yes, but most likely not via the so-called 'crowdsourcing' sites. Consumer interactions over the web are getting richer and more numerous, making many web services the masters of very real and very valuable market research data. Most if not all will figure out ways to mine this (some like Amazon and Netflix already do so, very successfully). Services like Facebook, Twitter, Formspring, Quora and Hunch all have an identity tied with user data and when (not if) they figure out a way to address privacy concerns (this can't be too hard if one takes focus off an individual and address groups or clusters instead), we may well have a new breed of firms that offer faster, better and cheaper market research.    Embed Quote
