★What are the best market research techniques?
The best thing to do is to spend time with your users and your prospects - try to understand them and to see your business from their perspective. How does your category fit into their lives? What are they seeking when they are in your category?  One on one interviews are the easiest way to go about this. Who you talk to is as important as how you talk to them. I would recommend having a very clear definition of who your prospect/user is before talking to folks in order to make your learning representative. I would (of course, I would) recommend consulting with a qualitative professional before doing any research, or at the very least seeking out best practices. Bad interviewing can produce disastrous misunderstandings.    Embed Quote
