★How do you conduct market research?It seems to me that the success of business plans are dependent on good market research. Therefore, it seems business opportunities would be revealed by researching all markets, somehow. Is this possible? How do people conduct "market research" ? (I truly know nothing about this)
I have been working on some projects that I hope to merge into my LLC. I am by no means an expert at market research, but I can share my progress so far. I have been tinkering with this web service Dollar Answer. Basically it lets you create a question intended for a targeted demographic, you pay $1(plus fees) to ask the question. Respondents can earn $1 for answering. The only down side I see to this is that there doesn't seem to be a very big user-base at this time. Also, if other entrepreneurs are like me, they don't have a lot of money, and a handful of answers is not as good as tens of thousands.    Embed Quote
