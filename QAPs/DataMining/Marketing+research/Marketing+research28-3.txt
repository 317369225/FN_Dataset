★How will augmented reality influence marketing and market research?
I will leave it to others to answer the marketing part of the question! I will say that 'push' marketing - the AR equivalent of pop-up ads, etc - will get very annoying very rapidly. The big issue with augmented reality in general it seems to me is ensuring 'augmented' doesn't just mean 'cluttered'. For market research, I think improved product/location/object/word recognition in AR will make touchpoint-based self-reporting studies, like the ones pioneered by MESH Planning in the UK, a lot easier. I think there's also an opportunity for panels - if a panel member can use AR (or even just a barcode scanner) to see whether there are any active surveys around a brand, product or category it could invert the typical recruitment process.    Embed Quote
