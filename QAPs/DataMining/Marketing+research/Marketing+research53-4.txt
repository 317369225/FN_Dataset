★Why do startups seldom hire market research companies?Why do big companies?
Echoing the other answers, very often you don't know who your customer is before you get your product out there and start iterating. Ever since reading it I've been obsessed with the ideas presented in Eric Ries' book The Lean Startup, getting your product out there as fast as possible with an MVP (minimum viable product) is essential so that you can start iterating with feedback from consumers as soon as you can. Also, agencies are generally priced pretty steeply for early stage start-ups.  Something like Illuminate (http://www.illuminatecontent.com, disclosure I'm a co-founder) can be handy as its low-cost and self-service. That makes it easy to get feedback on product features, the shape of the market, and run focus groups before you've launched without burning too much capital (a key point from Lean Startup).    Embed Quote
