★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
Is it useful? Yes absolutely! It can save money with mistakes, enable sales growth and profit but understanding who will buy, why they will buy and how much they are willing to spend. So many small businesses skip this or do half heartedly only to have to pick the pieces through their sales processes (and I should know from how people approach me for telemarketing). It's not just a case of "will they buy or won't they" that's important to a small businesses but who are the clients or customers they should prioritise with. Small businesses are under enormous pressure with marketing budgets so it should be a case of spending a bit to gain a lot. So often I see small businesses do market research in some form but totally miss the actual size of a market as otherwise projections are a complete fantasy.    Embed Quote
