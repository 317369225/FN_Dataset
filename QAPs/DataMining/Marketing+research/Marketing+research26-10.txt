★What are some good resources to use when doing market research for a startup?(Besides MTurk) :-]
Established, thriving businesses have the ability to learn a great deal every day from customer interaction. Since startups don’t have any customer interaction they have to create ways to test their theories initially and on the fly. The key to both making and affirming your initial assumptions is to set-up what I call Discovery Test Sessions with prospects that might easily fit into your initial smallest market group. These are essentially staged one on one meetings. This can be a little tricky since you have no relationship with said prospect. I often find that there are industry or trade groups that may contain your initial target market, and by joining these you may have an easier time gaining access to this group. Another possible option is to offer free sample products or beta test relationships to those willing to provide you with agreed upon feedback. The main thing is that you start talking to prospects about what they need, what they think, what works, what doesn’t and what they don’t have now. This is how you evolve your business, your features and your assumptions based on serving a narrowly defined target.
