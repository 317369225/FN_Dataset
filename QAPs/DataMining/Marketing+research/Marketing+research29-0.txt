★Which is the best Market Research Report on 3D Printing?
The Wohlers Report is an exhaustive overview of the 3D printing market. Read it and you will know what is happening and what will happen in 3D printing. You'll know the materials, the machines, the service bureaus and relevant technical developments. You'll be able to look at machine sales, material sales and individual explanations of technologies, trends, markets and applications. Terry Wohlers and his team have unprecedented access, respect and standing in the industry for their market knowledge. The Report helps you see what is happening and not what is being hyped, what is possible not what some reporter finds interesting. Wohlers Associates (I wrote for the Wohlers Report in 2011 and may again but am pretty sure that most of the people in the industry will agree with me here.)    Embed Quote
