★Is Survey Monkey a recommended tool for market research? Why?
Keep in mind that a poorly written survey is poorly written regardless of whether you use a free tool like Survey Monkey or a full-service experienced marketing research company. If you already have extensive experience writing surveys, then use the free tool. If not, make sure you find a consultant who DOES have extensive experience before you launch your survey. A poorly written survey will generate terrible data and misleading results. Be wise.    Embed Quote
