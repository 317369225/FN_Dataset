★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
What I've observed over the years is a mentality among new companies that they (the founders/entrepreneurs) are the market (i.e., "my market are all the people who are like me") which leads them to think, "why would I need to ask anybody else what they need or want?" This may be okay at first; in fact, I think is this "gut intuition" that drives the momentum to get the first few versions of a product or business off the ground. Don't mess with the inspiration. But eventually the all-knowing entrepreneur will hit a wall. His/her user base is growing beyond friends and family; advisers and employees are diluting their air-tight vision; "feature creep" is setting in; it gets harder and harder to define goals; companies start asking "so who are our customers/users? and what do they really think/want?" It's at this point that you have to spend the $10K to $20K on market research. Costs won't be that high if you sample your current customers/users; but I would strongly recommend talking to "prospective customers" too. It will cost more to recruit them, but it's worth it. Your current customers/users will give you a good handle on what is working well/not so well, and help refine positioning; while prospective customers/users are invaluable for understanding how to make the most of those precious initial moments when judgments are made.    Embed Quote
