★How do you conduct market research?It seems to me that the success of business plans are dependent on good market research. Therefore, it seems business opportunities would be revealed by researching all markets, somehow. Is this possible? How do people conduct "market research" ? (I truly know nothing about this)
I've always struggled to be effective when completing market and customer research for a new product or business. But over the course of the last few years I've actually had some time to reflect on what works. I wrote about my process here...http://ecofounder.net/business/r... It comes down to understanding how to complete your secondary research and then your primary research. I also include all the resources and links you need to get started. If your launching a business or product this should guide you to being effective by getting you straight to the information and answers you need.    Embed Quote
