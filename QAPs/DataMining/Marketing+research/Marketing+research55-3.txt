★What are good ways to do proper market research?We want to found a business and look for potential customers. However before meeting with customers we want to have an overview about the market we are entering. Any suggestion whats the best way to do market research?
Go to universities. Ask students, who study something in the field of marketing, to do a research around your product. There are currently working 5 students around my startup idea. Just contacted the head of that section and now it's their course. If we are happy, they succeed. It's win-win + it's free! Communicate closely what you want to know and be grateful after the work is done.    Embed Quote
