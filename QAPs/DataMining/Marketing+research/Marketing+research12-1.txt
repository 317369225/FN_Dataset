★What are the best books (in English) on market research, especially quantitative market research?
The Psychology of Survey Response by Roger Tourangeau is a classic that provides a good foundation for traditional quantitative market research.  Handbook of Marketing Scales by Netemeyer and Bearden is a useful reference book to help inform questionnaire development.  A relatively new book that's useful for focusing and increasing the actionability of your research is Drinking from the Firehose:  Making Smarter Decisions without Drowning in Information by Frank and Magnone.  For newer research methods, Ray Poynter authored a good handbook of online and social media research.    Embed Quote
