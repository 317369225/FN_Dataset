★How does Warren Buffett make his market research?
Reads Annual reports (aka 10-k) and various other documents required of companies to be submitted to the SEC.  Also, subscribes to several business journals/magazines that pertains to sectors he is familiar with or looking to invest in. I would also add several newspapers such as the wall street journal. The important thing to realize is that he says he says he spends atleast 7 hours out of his day just reading these documents and thinking.    Embed Quote
