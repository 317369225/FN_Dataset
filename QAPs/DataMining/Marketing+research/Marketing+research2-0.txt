★What are the best blogs for learning market research?I am keen to learn about basic fundamentals of conducting market research. The key topics being creating questionares, identify and selecting samples etc. I am looking to find blogs which specifically deal with this subject
Several companies keep blogs that serve to cross promote their products. There are, however, a few decent blogs about the market research industry; I am not aware of any that go into great methodological detail, as that information is often what gives researchers their value. I would check out the following blogs/websites: http://Greenbookblog.org This is the blog of the American Marketing Association. Lots of decent information on trends in the MR industry, etc. Quirks (link: Find Market Research Companies, Facilities, Jobs, Articles, More) Quirks is a US-based MR magazine and website Research (link: news, analysis and jobs for market researchers) UK-Based, similar to Quirks, still covers most of the major happenings in MR Reg Baker. (link: The Survey Geek) Reg is one of the smartest and most level-headed people in MR. He appreciates new methodologies, but is critical of "shiny object syndrome." A must-read. I don't think Don Dillman keeps a blog, but he is highly regarded by the academics in the industry. He has several books that could help you learn. Malhotra's textbook on MR can be useful, too. Follow the hashtag #mrx on Twitter - that's the spot for the daily conversation on market research Good luck!    Embed Quote
