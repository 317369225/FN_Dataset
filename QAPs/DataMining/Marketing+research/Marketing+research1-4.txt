★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
Depends on how you define market research. I think market research is essential to a new product or service; however, I don't think that necessarily means you need to pay for it through hiring a consulting firm or doing an expensive market analysis.   There are simpler forms and strategies to find out if there is demand for the product and service in the market. You can call your customers, test market select groups, and do beta testing to see if it is a product your customers are interested in.   Building on Amy Shropshire's questions: Who exactly is your market? Does you market even want your product/service? Does it fill a need they have? If they don't know they need it, how can you convince them they do? What channels do they like to be reached on. How much would they be willing to pay? Are there influencers you can approach with the product to test and understand if it will succeed?   You have to look at the four P's of marketing: product, place, promotion, and price to make sure to taylor the service or product to what your research says. Utimately, your best research as a small business will be to beta launch the product or service and see if it gains legs. If it doesn't or receives negative feedback, to kill it quickly and retool.    Embed Quote
