★What is the future of market research?
Over the last couple of years, it's become trendy to talk about "disruptive" technologies that are supposed to change market research forever.  There's a great deal of hyperbole out there right now, including much talk that certain types of market research are going to disappear.  Others will say that one sort of tech-based market research is the "future". A couple of things to keep in mind: 1. Nobody knows the future.  When people talk about what the future will be, they're actually talking about their perceptions of the present, its relationship to the past, and their hopes or fears about the future. 2. Technologies are usually additive.  They don't typically replace older technologies, and despite the enthusiasm for new technologies, they aren't truly universally applied. Remember the paperless office?  It never happened.  We still use paper, though we also use electronic screens for some things we once could only do with paper. Are eBooks replacing physical books?  No, though there are some sorts of books that aren't being published in physical format anymore.  eBooks are great for some things, but they're lousy for others.  When interstate highways were invented, were old-fashioned roads abandoned?  No, though some poorly planned cities suffered from decreased traffic when the new highways were put in. My point is this: We can't be certain about the future of market research, but keeping past cycles of technological development in mind, what's likely is that older, non-digital, non-social, non-mobile methodologies will keep going strong, where they are appropriate for use.  The future won't belong to any method or technology.  We're more likely to have a mosaic future, and the ones that are currently hot will settle down to become just another choice among many.    Embed Quote
