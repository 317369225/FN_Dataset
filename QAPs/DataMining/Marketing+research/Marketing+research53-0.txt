★Why do startups seldom hire market research companies?Why do big companies?
Startups don't use market research firms because: 1) The most important 'macro-market' question to any startup is the market size. This can usually be deduced from publicly available statistics. 2) Startups often don't know who their customers are until after doing several iterations on the product and releasing it into the wild. Why bother researching customers before you know you're researching the right ones? 3) Once they've found customers that are a great fit, startups are small enough that "management" can talk to those customers directly and make their own conclusions. They don't need a third party firm to do the data gathering or analysis. 4) Market research companies are expensive and don't give discounts to startups. If you have $100k, you're going to spend it on building product, not building a business plan. Large businesses use market research firms because: 1) They don't have people on hand that can interview customers / experts effectively and run the statistics. They do however, have ample cash to hire a third party to do so. 2) They are trying to answer more specific/nuanced questions than the 'macro' questions that a startup has. They're trying to fine tune product features and pricing rather than simply prove that there are lots of potential buyers for what they're selling. That means they need more detailed data than what are publicly available.    Embed Quote
