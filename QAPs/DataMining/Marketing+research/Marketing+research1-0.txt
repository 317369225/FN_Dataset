★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
Absolutely! If you don't know your market, you don't have a business - regardless of your size. The good news is that with social media, it makes it a whole lot easier to get that research of your market. Interact with your current consumers on Facebook, Twitter, and any other social sites you are on. Ask your followers questions. Make polls. Ask what they most like about your business/ service/products. Ask what they'd like to see more of. Ask about their lifestyles and find out their demographics. If you're thinking of adding a new line - ask your loyal social media consumers. This not only gets you insight into what your customer wants, it lets them feel like they're contributing to your business too. You can even get a little more sophisticated and run contests (like a Vote Contest , or an Essay Contest ) to keep connecting with your consumer online, and conduct continuous market research, to keep making sure your business is giving your clients what they want. That's what makes any business a success!    Embed Quote
