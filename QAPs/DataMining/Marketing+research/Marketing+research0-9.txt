★How do you conduct market research?It seems to me that the success of business plans are dependent on good market research. Therefore, it seems business opportunities would be revealed by researching all markets, somehow. Is this possible? How do people conduct "market research" ? (I truly know nothing about this)
The best way to start is with primary market research! This thread has some great insight on some of the best methods: How do start-ups conduct online primary market research? - Questions and Answers - mosaicHUB One point that I really liked from it is that Focus Groups have been made a lot easier with the creation of Google+ Hangouts. Rather than being forced to get a target group to put aside the time to physically leave whatever they're doing to take part in your focus group, you can now conduct them online with up to 10 people. Hope this is helpful! -Kim    Embed Quote
