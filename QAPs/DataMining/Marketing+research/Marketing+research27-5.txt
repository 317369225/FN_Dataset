★What are some good examples of leveraging crowd wisdom in market research?
I was reading the book Reality Is Broken by Jane McGonigal recently. She has plenty of good case studies in the book, but here are a few that might more closely fit what you're looking for: Investigate Your MP's Expenses project by the Guardian used crowdsourced labor to pour over tons of receipts and files from the British Parliament to do just that - investigate expenses. Folding@Home, which is a program PlayStation users can run on their game decks to participate in folding proteins, which is vital to biological research and saving lives. At first this started as basically a way to make a supercomputer via PlayStations, but it developed to actually involve the game station owners who now use their brains to help fold better proteins. World Without Oil by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This was an online game where players would collaborate to come up with ways to survive an oil crisis apocalypse, focusing on their real lives in their real home-towns.There are tons of examples of crowdsorucing. These are not all exactly market research, but they may provide examples on how you can translate this to market research. For instance, the Investigate Your MP's Expenses is market research in deciding what people think is appropriate behavior. The World Without Oil game is all about seeing what people think is vital and how they can work together. These examples can be adapted, depending on what you need.    Embed Quote
