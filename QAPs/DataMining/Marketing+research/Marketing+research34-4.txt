★Which is a more interesting job? Market research or Business analytics?
Well there is no right or wrong answer to that. The task for each is different. While the role of analytics is to infer the consumer portrayed behavior - Could be WRT his brand choice his retailer choice trends, seasonality etc. Research is more about un earthing the 'WHY's behind the consumer choice. Its more about understanding consumer perceptions and attitudes. Given this, it entirely depends upon what excites you.    Embed Quote
