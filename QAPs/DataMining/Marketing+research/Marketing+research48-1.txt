★Is market research necessary for new product ideas?Apple does not do market research for their products. Japanese "Kaizen" means "continuous improvement", which is in relation to quality but it also recommends launching a product with minimal market research or no market research and then improving the product after launch based on users comments and feedback.
Yes, market research is quite central to the development of the product. Though it may seem that companies like Apple do no market research, that is far from the truth. It is quite alien to develop a product without understanding what people need, what will 'sell'. Yes, continuous improvement is the key to satisfying customer interests and companies and startups today exploit that concept to the fullest. That is why we see the 'news' and the 'betters' and the 'relaunching' of several products. That's what lean startups are all about right?
