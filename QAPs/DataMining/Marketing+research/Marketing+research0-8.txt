★How do you conduct market research?It seems to me that the success of business plans are dependent on good market research. Therefore, it seems business opportunities would be revealed by researching all markets, somehow. Is this possible? How do people conduct "market research" ? (I truly know nothing about this)
Cate Riegner's response is a terrific overview of various research methodologies available.  An additional option is to use a social media listening tool to learn if anyone is talking about the problem your company/product/service may solve.  Those conversations may help you identify market needs and opportunities and if anyone is already meeting (or trying to meet) those needs. SocialMention is free and the free version of Alterian's SM2 are options to get you started. Regarding your question of researching "all markets" that is a more difficult task.  The best research results come from having at least an idea of what market you want to play in and who your audience might be. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
