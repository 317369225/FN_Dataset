★How will augmented reality influence marketing and market research?
I think there will be lots of individual, possible competing steps, before we work out all this stuff. I don't think it'll be minority report style though. That user interface looked a lot of effort!   One aspect is suggested by 'word lens' the live translation service. If you've not used this its worth a look at the youtube clip.   By extention, it is easy to imaging a word lens that doesn't translate but just adds more information, maybe initially it'll be reading a 2D bar code on the object we want to augment, or maybe it will be recognising the object without the need for the bar code.   Once we move to headset viewers (contanct lens???) you don't have to look at people through our iphones of course    Embed Quote
