★What are the best ways to gather market research online?Market research is necessary before investing significantly in creating a new product. Is there a way to do it efficiently online with a targeted audience?
We utilize proprietary tools called MROC (Market Research Online Communities) which allow a tightly specified audience across a broad geographic area to answer questions and interact with the stimuli that they are provided with.  These can be remarkably rich environments and they can be either very controlled or free-formed.  There are benefits to each.   Another interesting use of these communities is that we can allow the users to interact with each other, which adds a layer of social interaction to the mix.    Embed Quote
