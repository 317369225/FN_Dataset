★What are the best blogs for learning market research?I am keen to learn about basic fundamentals of conducting market research. The key topics being creating questionares, identify and selecting samples etc. I am looking to find blogs which specifically deal with this subject
It's not a blog, but my company, B2B International (a global market research specialist), does have a Publications section to its website.  There are articles, white papers and even e-books, all of which are free to access/read, and deal with a whole range of subjects: from the basics through to fairly complex areas of research.  Take a look - I hope you find it useful!
