★What different companies provide market research for potential startup ideas?What companies like "PickFu" and "Proved" survey customers on potential startup ideas? Also, are any of these services empirically validated (i.e. a good result in the research actually correlates to a successful product)?
Take a look at TapResearch.  You can create a survey of any length, target the specific population you need and get any number of responses for between .30-.50/complete.  We work with start ups working to validate ideas, pricing, design, etc all the time.  We reach ~100M respondents who are normal people using 10s of thousands of different mobile apps.  Feel free to reach out for more information.    Embed Quote
