In addition to Jared Turner's excellent suggestions, I would suggest against printing surveys for in-person market research, as this method will cost you more in the long run. Instead, I recommend you to use a mobile survey platform, like QuickTapSurvey - Mobile Market Research Survey Example QuickTapSurvey is the perfect mobile survey tool for interviewing consumers and collecting market data in a fun and engaging way. Some of the benefits of using QuickTapSurvey are: -no manual data entry - capture data directly on a tablet that can be exported into popular file formats for analysis -works without an Internet connection -make surveys fun and interactive -use with online surveys - Import your SurveyMonkey surveys into QuickTapSurvey. Add mobile-specific features and collect responses offline    Embed Quote
