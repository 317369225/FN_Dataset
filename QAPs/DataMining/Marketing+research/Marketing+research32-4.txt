★What are the best ways to motivate respondents for market research?Apart from incentives, is direct feedback an option? And is gamification a good path to follow? Other ideas? ...
At Qualvu, we have found that there are two main drivers for consumers to complete any kind of market research assignment: monetary incentive and passion. Results are best when the two are combined. If you prefer to offer store credit or a discount, we have found that coupons aren't as interesting as a gift card because it equals cash. But, the most important thing to keep in mind is that the incentive should be directly proportional to the length and amount of assignments, as well as the involvement your study requires.    Embed Quote
