★Is Survey Monkey a recommended tool for market research? Why?
Depends on whether you are planning to do qualitative or quantitative market research. If you want to do qualitative research, sit down and talk with prospective customers (folks who are not fishing with you) and current customers (folks who are fishing with you). This is the best way to empathize with your customers and understand their pain points. Once that is out of the way, you can validate the qualitative research with survey tools. Like many have said here, more than the tool, it is how you design the survey that is more important. I have used SurveyMonkey and have found it extremely easy to use.    Embed Quote
