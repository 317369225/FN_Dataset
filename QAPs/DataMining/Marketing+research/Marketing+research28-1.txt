★How will augmented reality influence marketing and market research?
In my opinion, Augmented Reality will ultimately usher in a new user interface... a new way for people to interact and engage with data.  A Human User Interface, where a predominant part is motion/gesture based.  Additionally, it will further empower people to have these experiences while being mobile... out in the real world and not stuck at a desk. Subsequently, I think that AR's influence on marketing will be vast and largely unpredictable at this point.  The Kinect has already allowed us to move past the Minority Report (as some of the hacks have shown)...  But look at Iron Man 2, and the computer interfaces he used and you can get an idea of where the industry is headed... not tomorrow (or the next day), but it's where we're all headed.    Embed Quote
