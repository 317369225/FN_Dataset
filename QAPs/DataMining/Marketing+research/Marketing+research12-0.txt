★What are the best books (in English) on market research, especially quantitative market research?
For those needing an introduction to research methods in business, I recommend: 1. Marketing Research: An Applied Approach (by Malhotra and Birks) 2. Business Research Methods (by Zikmund, Babin, Carr and Griffin) For advanced quantitative procedures, I recommend: 1. Marketing Research: An Applied Orientation (by Malhotra and Dash) 2. Multivariate Data Analysis (by Hair Jr., Black, Babin and Anderson)    Embed Quote
