★Is market research necessary for new product ideas?Apple does not do market research for their products. Japanese "Kaizen" means "continuous improvement", which is in relation to quality but it also recommends launching a product with minimal market research or no market research and then improving the product after launch based on users comments and feedback.
I suggest that the value of market research is directly related to the degree to which your product/service is similar to others in the market. If a product is unique (iPad) and starts or substantially changes an industry, market research might be worth less. If you build it, they will come because consumers did not know they needed something that had never seen before. If you want to start a house painting business, you had better understand your market well and understand how you can compete against so many others doing the same thing. In industries approaching perfect competition (remember that from your Economics class?), market research will allow you to identify opportunities to differentiate and be successful. It might also tell you to consider another path.    Embed Quote
