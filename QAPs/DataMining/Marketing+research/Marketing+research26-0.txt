★What are some good resources to use when doing market research for a startup?(Besides MTurk) :-]
I can't believe no one said this. Find a subreddit that addresses the market or space you plan to launch in, subscribe and watch the articles (and the comments to those articles) for a few weeks. See what people say, what they react to, what they link and dislike. Etc. Unfortunately, when it comes to market research I feel it's less about the tools and more about the effort. How much time do you put it? How willing are you to actually listen to the feedback around you? Are you falling prey to the confirmation bias? All those factors will ultimately matter more than whether you use Wufoo or not.    Embed Quote
