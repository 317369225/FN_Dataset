★How do you conduct market research?It seems to me that the success of business plans are dependent on good market research. Therefore, it seems business opportunities would be revealed by researching all markets, somehow. Is this possible? How do people conduct "market research" ? (I truly know nothing about this)
All great responses here!!! If only it was like this: When we do our homework we first think about: What problem(s) are you solving? How does it result in positive feelings for users? Who else is selling something similar? After that we start playing with our spy tools to see what we can learn from our competitors. The great thing is they've already done most of the work for us and validated a profitable market. All that's required from us is figuring out what's working for them or what they've missed so we can cover that in our brand. Amazon & Clickbank are good places to see what’s already selling in your niche. You'll want to check popular items. Reading 1-3 star reviews on Amazon will help you make a better product. For clickbank you'll want to search by gravity and cross reference with cbengine to see what's currently profitable. Quantcast & Alexa are for demographics. You may get a chance to see ages groups, education, salary, and other interests. It can help you laser target your ideal buyer aka customer avatar. Similarweb checks global traffic of website, ads, and referrals. Reddit can allow you to see what the current chatter is around a user’s needs. Besides the cat pictures from imgur here we find subreddits to be the best in understanding consumer pain and addressing that with a solution. Moat checks competitor display ads. Spyfu checks how much your competitors are spending per keywords on google adwords, search ad copy, and how much they’re being shared on social media websites.
