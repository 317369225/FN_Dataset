★How can Quora help improve qualitative market research?
One big positive about qualitative market research is that it's great at getting real opinions and ideas from users. The problem is that sometimes it is difficult to sift through and decide what is important, useful, or worth spending time on. With Quora you can present open ended research questions and get longterm feedback that is ranked and commented on. The better answers (or ideas) will float to the top as more people agree with them. That is often missed through typical qualitative research as one person does not know what another has said. Commenting allows for probing not just by the person/company asking the question but by anyone trying to dig deeper. This raw, thoughtful discussion could really prove to be valuable. Also, because questions have the opportunity to be answered by experts in their field they can provide information an average user/consumer may not have thought of. Frankie Johnson, you are correct in saying that the current state of Quora is crowded by a small niche group of people (primarily the tech community). So, at this moment tech product questions will prevail but as it expands it could be beneficial for a wider range of products and services.    Embed Quote
