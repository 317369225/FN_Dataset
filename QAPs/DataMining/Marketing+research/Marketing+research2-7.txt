★What are the best blogs for learning market research?I am keen to learn about basic fundamentals of conducting market research. The key topics being creating questionares, identify and selecting samples etc. I am looking to find blogs which specifically deal with this subject
*Disclosure: I am the UK Manager of Marketest.   I would suggest to look into market research guides that are available online as well as blogs; after all blogs are more of an opinion where as guides will give you the tried and tested facts about market research. That is not to say that market research blogs will not give you useful information, but what works for one company may not necessarily work for another.   As part of our market research services we all offer an online market research guide on our website. This contains information on; -      How market research works -      Why market research is used -      Advantages of market research -      Stages of market research -      Types of market research questions -      Defining a market research sample -      Questionnaire construction -      Poll methods -      Interview methods -      Results analysis   I would seek out guides like this initially to find out some more information.   Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
