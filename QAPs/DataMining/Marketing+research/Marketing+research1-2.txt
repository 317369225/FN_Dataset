★Is market research useful for a small business?Is it worth it?
There are compelling arguments here for both sides. I have 2 quick thoughts: 1) Market research can hugely beneficial - not unlike learning about the structure of the face and effects of physics. Market interactions are like getting punched in the mouth 1st hand. Imho, you learn more from the 1st and know more from the 2nd. 2) I had no idea I wanted 1k songs in my pocket until I heard Steve Jobs tell me I could have it. Similarly, I might have scoffed at the idea/concept of Twitter in a conference room. But after week 1 using it, I was hooked. Just my $.02.    Embed Quote
