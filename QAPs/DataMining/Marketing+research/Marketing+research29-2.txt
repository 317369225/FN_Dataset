★Which is the best Market Research Report on 3D Printing?
Hod Lipson, a professor at Cornell University, just published a book for a general audience on 3D printing.  If you know a little bit about 3D printing, you'll probably be disappointed by the book.  If you are a hobbiest and know nothing about 3D printing, it's probably a good tutorial to start with.  It is quite approachable. Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing: Hod Lipson, Melba Kurman: 9781118350638: Amazon.com: Books I agree with Joris.  I have not read the Wohler report, but from what I understand it's a pretty good report.    Embed Quote
