★Which iPad PDF viewers allow you to edit the title metadata and then send the file to iBooks?
Stanza for iOS is an excellent pdf and ePub reader program that does allow you to edit metadata. I find myself doing this a lot, and in fact I use Stanza on iPad as my main pdf reader, over iBooks. It also allows you to download pdf files from within the application, so rather than follow a link to a pdf file from Mobile Safari, I usually copy the link, open Stanza, and download the pdf directly into Stanza. On my desktop machine I tend to save pdfs from browser or email attachments to Dropbox. Then on my iPad I open the pdf in Dropbox and save it to Stanza.    Embed Quote
