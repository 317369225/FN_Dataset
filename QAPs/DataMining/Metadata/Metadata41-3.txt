★What academic reference management tools provide successful automatic metadata extraction from a collection of PDF files?It seems like it shouldn't be hard to detect the title of each file and look up the metadata online automatically, but I haven't yet encountered a tool that does this robustly for computer science papers. This is a follow-up question to What's the best academic bookmarking tool?.
Even I was looking for a tool like this. However, when I wanted to write one myself, I was told that there were some copyright issues. I never investigated the issue further, but I would like to know the facts.    Embed Quote
