★What academic reference management tools provide successful automatic metadata extraction from a collection of PDF files?It seems like it shouldn't be hard to detect the title of each file and look up the metadata online automatically, but I haven't yet encountered a tool that does this robustly for computer science papers. This is a follow-up question to What's the best academic bookmarking tool?.
Both Refworks and Zotero support limited collection of metadata from various sources including PDFs however some people find that this functionality is somewhat frustrating because it is heavily dependent upon the creator of the original document correctly formatting the data and adding it in the appropriate fields.  No bibliographic tool can match the data to the fields on the fly from the raw information about a document.
