★What is the size of an SAP ERP database metadata?If a SAP ERP table definitions should be dumped to a file containing the tables, structures, data elements, domains and table types, how much space this file would be?
SAP Does not use a separate file or a different database to store its meta-data like table definitions, data elements or even the ABAP code. Instead, SAP uses the same database space to store its metadata too. Eg. DD02L - Table that stores all available SAP Tables DD03L - Stores Table fields, DD04L - Stores Data Elements, The source code of all ABAP programs are stored in as compressed RAW string in REPOSRC table. Not only this, whenever you keep a breakpoint in anyprogram, even that data is captured in database tables (ABDBG_BPS & ABDBG_INFO). SAP ECC 6.0 Installation package along with Oracle database occupies around 50 GB including its Kernel and atleast 250 GB of hard disk space is needed to get this software up and running. This 250 GB also includes reserve space for the custom data to be stored. So we can ballpark the space needed for meta data to be something between 50 to 150 GB.    Embed Quote
