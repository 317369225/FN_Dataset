★Is there a model for metadata that addresses concepts like "context" and "addressability"?e.g. so that apps can be designed to understand what content to send to a person based on context, and whether the content is 'allowed' to be sent or 'appropriate' based on its addressability attributes. Feel free to discuss any other metadata attributes that make content more useful, customisable and personalised.
This is complex to address, and very important. While context itself could mean several things here, right from knowing where the person is, what is he doing, what is he seeing and what conversation did he involve in and so on which are contexts on their own, it is very challenging to really be able to represent this context as a metadata for determining the right content to be delivered to the user. A simple way is to determine what text is the user reading at a particular moment. This could be thought of as being represented in the form of 1) Which document is he reading - A unique pointer to the document. 2) The Offset of the String he is reading - The offset from the beginning of the document where the string starts. 3) The Length of the String he is reading - The length of the string in terms of characters. You could also add more semantics to this by thinking of representing what is the user actually reading, by identifying any entities and events inside the actual string. I am just thinking from top of my head about this and representing the context is difficult. Interested in knowing what others think of it.    Embed Quote
