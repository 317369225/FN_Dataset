★What is the best/simplest way to change the metadata for a Wordpress powered website?I want to change the description that shows up in google for individual pages on the website (http://www.sloacupuncture.com/).
I too recommend either AIOSEO (All in One SEO Plugin) or for even more features check out Yoast's SEO plugin. There's also one called Headspace 2. These all give you a great deal of flexibility for search optimizing your WordPress site. While you're at it, and if you're not using it already, I recommend the WP Category No Base plugin as well for better optimizing your URLs. Although I'm not sure if you need this along with the other plugins mentioned (http://wordpress.org/extend/plug...).    Embed Quote
