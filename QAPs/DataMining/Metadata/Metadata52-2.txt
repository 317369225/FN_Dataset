★Why aren't record labels supported in music metadata tagging schemes?Record labels are a good heuristic to go by when sifting through tracks. Why aren't they part of the ID3 spec? Not to mention, most CDs/LPs clearly make mention of what label the artist belongs to. Labels are part of the artistry and are deply interwoven into music culture. Why are they left out of the metadata? How can label functionality be implemented?
Both ID3 fields TOWN and TPUB could be used to add labels. You could also use a custom field. ID3 tags apply to tracks and not so much for albums, I think its one of the reasons. There isn't any field for UPC/EAN or Catalogue Number either. And yes, if music players showed a field for labels it would have certainly helped... #musicmetadata    Embed Quote
