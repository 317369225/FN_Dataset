★Is there a model for metadata that addresses concepts like "context" and "addressability"?e.g. so that apps can be designed to understand what content to send to a person based on context, and whether the content is 'allowed' to be sent or 'appropriate' based on its addressability attributes. Feel free to discuss any other metadata attributes that make content more useful, customisable and personalised.
Related Content Database, Inc. (RCDb.net) provides time indexed metadata via an API so that developers can unlock context of film and television programming in their apps.    Embed Quote
