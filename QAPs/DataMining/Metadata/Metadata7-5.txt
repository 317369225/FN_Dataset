★What is the best method for editing/managing metadata of digital photos?
The information that you are looking to add is not really EXIF, it's IPTC.  Programs like Lightroom (Aperture is Mac only) will do it, but it's a bit pricey if you only want to add information to scans. Irfanview can add and view IPTC information.  It's a great, free program. There really isn't a way to ensure that the data remains in the file.  The file format isn't designed for data security, and many programs are not metadata aware and will strip out the data if you save the file in that program.  The best way to ensure the data is to keep a master copy with the data intact.    Embed Quote
