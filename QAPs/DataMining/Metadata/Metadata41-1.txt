★What academic reference management tools provide successful automatic metadata extraction from a collection of PDF files?It seems like it shouldn't be hard to detect the title of each file and look up the metadata online automatically, but I haven't yet encountered a tool that does this robustly for computer science papers. This is a follow-up question to What's the best academic bookmarking tool?.
Zotero can do it if the PDF has metadata embedded in it. http://www.zotero.org/support/re...    Embed Quote
