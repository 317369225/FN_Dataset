★What problem would you solve at an ebook and publishing metadata hackathon?There are many discussions on book metadata and even companies like Small Demons scraping and working with in-book content, but if you had access to ebooks and book metadata what would you try to solve? Discoverability is a hot topic for the publishing industry, but requires a bit more user data. Say I was throwing together a hackathon with only the above data, what should I try to fix in a day or two?
Develop a library for any language to sort Library of Congress and/or Dewey Decimal with Cutter call numbers in correct shelf order A PadMapper like interface pulling data from multiple public API's like OCLC's xISBN, LibraryThing, Google Books, Amazon, etc with the potential to include Syndetics data and a standards compliant set of widgets that libraries can integrate into existing catalogs. Widgets for catalogs that offer direct download of books based on the provider and the direct link in the $856 /u MARC field. MARC record download and modification scripting tool for the major providers, allowing automation of catalog updates. Auto creation of MARC and/or ONIX records based on standards compliant internal ePub 3 metadata. Big ideas, no time :)    Embed Quote
