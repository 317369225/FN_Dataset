★What is the best source for book metadata?
For the publishers who are our clients (among them Simon and Schuster, Macmillan, Cengage Learning, Oxford University Press and other publishers or distributors), my company NetRead Software and Services (http://www.netread.com and http://facebook.com/netread) is the best source of updated book (both print and ebook) metadata. We receive updated metadata (including images) from our clients daily and convert the data to not only ONIX (the industry's XML standard) but also to other proprietary formats used by major industry players. We then deliver fresh book metadata to our client's channels or partners both on-demand and on a regular, scheduled basis. As our clients are the publishers or distributors, for anybody to receive metadata from NetRead, he would have to contact each of our clients first and request them to put him on their channel/partner list. Because we are part of our clients' supply-chain, some of the metadata can be sensitive and not meant to be public. Hence, this requirement. For publishers who aren't NetRead's clients, the best source of general book metadata is probably either Bowker (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.R...) or Baker & Taylor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak...). However, one has to pay to get book metadata from them. I'm not sure if it's on a subscription basis or per title count, but my understanding is it's not cheap. With NetRead, all that is required is a relationship with the publisher whom you want to receive metadata from. Lastly, with regards to EBooks: NetRead is one of the most "connected" and complete distributors of EBook metadata currently in the industry. We can and do deliver updated metadata and content to EBook channels like Amazon and Apple on-demand and in real-time. We are currently expanding our services here both on the publisher side and the channel side, so please feel free to contact me/us for any specific inquiries.    Embed Quote
