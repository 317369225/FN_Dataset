★What's the difference between master data and metadata?
Despite being nearly 5 yrs old, I found the following post to be a good explanation of the differences and overlap between the two concepts: Master Data is not Metadata ...especially paragraph 2: Metadata as I’m sure you’re aware is data about data.  It describes data but it isn’t generally considered business data.  For example, customer metadata would describe the attributes of a customer entity, the datatype and size of the attributes, which programs produce the data, which programs consume the data, what business rules are enforced on the attributes, etc.  In a BI environment, derivation, transformations, source system, and last load time are also important.  The key thing to understand is that you can know the complete metadata for customers without knowing who a single customer is.  Master Data, on the other hand, is the real business data.  Customer master data is an authoritative list of customers.    Embed Quote
