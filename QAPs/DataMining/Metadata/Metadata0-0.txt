★What is metadata?
I would like to provide an answer from the perspective of Performance Measurement.   Say we have a department with a number of performance measures floating around. There is a separate individual responsible for each of the measures. Whenever we need a number, we would approach the individual that is able to get the number for us.    Now to borrow from Russ Beinder's example - consider a library. With a lot of books inside. And a catalogue with a description of each book and where you need to go in the library to find each book.   The library in this case is equivalent to our department.   All of the books in the library are comparable to the different pieces of data floating around our department.   The library catalogue would be equivalent to the metadata, which is a catalogue of the DESCRIPTION of all the data in the department (i.e. what is the data, where can we find it, etc).   Take away point: Metadata is not a catalogue of the data. It is a catalogue of the description of the data.    Embed Quote
