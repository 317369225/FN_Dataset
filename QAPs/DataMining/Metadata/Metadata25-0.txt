★How do I generate the metadata of an XML file?Is there any open source Java library available? means the structure of xml file and position of each tags in this xml file so that we can keep track any movement of tags e.g say tag xvy1 is shifted from position 4 to 9 position or it is removed completely.Please suggest any open source API in java
An XML file as such doesn't contain any metadata about position of tags etc. By your definition of metadata, the parser takes care of validating an XML document according to a particular schema. Your web browser has this schema validation code and hence its able to detect the syntax of the document ( "well formedness" etc ). You can refer to Mozilla's open source code base to check how it's implemented. https://developer.mozilla.org/en... Check the following links for W3C's definition of an XML schema and how to specify your own schema. http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema www.w3schools.com/Schema/ Cheers !    Embed Quote
