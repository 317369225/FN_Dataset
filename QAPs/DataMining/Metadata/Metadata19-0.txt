★Semantic Web: What are the differences between RDF databases, Metadata databases and Graph databases?
There is no specific category of databases called Metadata Databases. At least not very well known even if there is any. People may refer to the systems that allow storage of a lot of metadata about an entity as "metadata databases", but ultimately, they are stored in any of the known database storage models: Relational / Network / Hierarchical / Graph etc. or even RDF stores, if it is RDF conformant data. The phrase "RDF Databases" is again not widely used much of late to refer to the storage that houses RDF triples and Quads. They are simply referred to as "RDF Stores", as these can be: Stores built on top of relational databases with specific approaches to host and retrieve RDF data, Flat file based native solutions, Even lightweight wrappers on top of existing data storage solutions. RDF Stores are characterized by their need to store the triples of (Subject, Predicate, Object) kind, and more recently, Quads (Subject, Predicate, Object with an identifier for further reference), so that they can be used for semantic querying to glean inferences. Graph databases use the basic graph structures of nodes and edges, and their properties, to store data. It can be seen as the most obvious representation of an entity-relationship model. In that sense, RDF Stores can be seen as a specialized case of graph databases. Also, worth going through Joshua Shinavier's answer to a similar thread: What are the differences between a Graph database and a Triple store ?    Embed Quote
