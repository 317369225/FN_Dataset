★How do I generate the metadata of an XML file?Is there any open source Java library available? means the structure of xml file and position of each tags in this xml file so that we can keep track any movement of tags e.g say tag xvy1 is shifted from position 4 to 9 position or it is removed completely.Please suggest any open source API in java
If you have to validate your XML format whether it has the tags correctly closed or not you can use Dom4j in Java. I have been using dom4j extensively for past few years. It helps in parsing your XML to String or vice versa. Not only parsing, you can manipulate, iterate, add, delete, modify elements or nodes in your XML effectively using dom4j. If you want to verify your XML with a standard XML format you need to create an XML schema or .XSD file. The XSD tells the rules which should be to followed by the XML file. XSD file defines the format of the XML file. XSD will be telling what will the name of the element be and the data type of the element's value. It can be used for setting constraints for each and every node or element in the XML. XSD can be defined in a standard and Russian doll notation. For details about how to write your XSD document, you can refer W3Schools. There are also online converters available which can create a XSD file based on your XML. The Api used for comparing your XML and XSD will be JAXB (Java Api for Xml Binding) Better post your question in Stack Overflow.    Embed Quote
