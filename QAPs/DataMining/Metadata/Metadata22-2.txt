★What music metadata API is best for querying genre or tags by album and artist?
I know I'm late here, but anyone interested in this topic will want to check out  Rovi's API. Rovi leverages the well known music database that powers AllMusic.com and many, many other products. And the metadata catalog is pretty huge (e.g. more than 30 mm albums). The associated genre hierarchy is professionally curated and uses a controlled vocabulary, meaning you'll get consistency from album to album and artist to artist. Some useful links: music coverage stats (how many albums and artists in the Rovi database): http://www.rovicorp.com/products... (see the coverage tab) API documentation: http://developer.rovicorp.com/docs demo app that retrieves genre and tags by album or artist using the Rovi API: http://www.allrovi.com/name/flor..., http://www.allrovi.com/music/alb...    Embed Quote
