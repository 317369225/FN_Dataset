★What is the best method for editing/managing metadata of digital photos?
What you are looking to change is called the photographs metadata. The technical term (assuming you are using JPGs) is the Exif data. This is automatically captured and stored by the camera (including GPS for most camera phones if not disabled). This is obviously not the case for scanned photos. While I use Lightroom to manage this process for my scanned images, if you are just looking to change this metadata you can actually do it directly from Windows Explorer. Just right click any image file, choose Properties and click the Details tab. Picasa will also let you do this. Lightroom will make it much easier to make bulk changes on your PC. Lightroom will also help you make the images look better :)  Hope that helps.    Embed Quote
