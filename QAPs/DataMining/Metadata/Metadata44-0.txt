★Recommendations for Onix software for a small publisher wanting to submit robust metadata?I am about to publish a couple of epub books and want a cheap but reliable (and comprehensible!) way of doing it correctly. And using a Mac, just to narrow my options!
I can't vouch for it personally, but OnixEdit looks capabable enough. It's also modular, which allows you to buy what you need. $99 isn't bad, but it looks to be Windows only. OCLC (according to listserv chatter) has an internal tool to convert MARC to Onix. You may have luck contacting them. Also, MARCedit (which is a kick-ass text editor by any standard) is fully capable of handling Onix files. If you are just editing Onix files, this would be my first choice. http://people.oregonstate.edu/~r... (You can run MARCedit on a Mac via Mono)    Embed Quote
