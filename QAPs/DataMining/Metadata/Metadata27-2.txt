★What is the best way to clean up song metadata?I haven't seen much written about Tune Up since this: http://techcrunch.com/2008/12/11... Is Tune Up great or are there other products you recommend?
I feel TuneUp is pretty awesome. I spent quite some time getting my 50,000 track library in order, mostly using CoverScout, but when TuneUp came along I signed on and it has been a constant source of tagging info    Embed Quote
