★Have anyone actually used HCatalog Metadata interface for Hadoop?
I am trying to use it for sending data availability notifications to Oozie coordinator. But I am stuck at installation part as documentation is not very clear. It uses hive meta store for persistence storage, so you to first configure hive meta store then HCatalog. The current version is 0.50 which supports reading and writing files in any format for which a SerDe (serializer-deserializer) can be written. By default, HCatalog supports RCFile, CSV, JSON, and SequenceFile formats. To use a custom format, you must provide the InputFormat, OutputFormat, and SerDe.    Embed Quote
