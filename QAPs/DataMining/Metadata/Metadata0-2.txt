★What is metadata?
If you think about metadata in terms of something less generic than data it might help. Imagine a book. It has an author. The name of the author is metadata. The book also has a publisher. Once again, the name of the publisher is metadata. If you consider the contents of the book to be data then the author is data about data. Imagine a business problem such as reducing the number of paper files at a company. Paper files require space to store and take time to search when information needs to be found. The storage problem can be solved by scanning the documents and storing them electronically. If I scan an invoice I might want to find it later by searching using the invoice number. Unfortunately the scan is just a picture of an invoice. The solution is to add invoice number metadata to the document. Now I have the picture that I can view and the invoice number that the computer can search for. There is plenty of software that will allow you to attached or relate metadata to a file.    Embed Quote
