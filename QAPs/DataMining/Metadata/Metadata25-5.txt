★How do I generate the metadata of an XML file?Is there any open source Java library available? means the structure of xml file and position of each tags in this xml file so that we can keep track any movement of tags e.g say tag xvy1 is shifted from position 4 to 9 position or it is removed completely.Please suggest any open source API in java
An XML file is a flat file containing data in the tag format. It does not have any metadata file to help you keep track of the changes that you or your program make to that xml file. There is one tool Diff, Compare & Merge XML that will help resolve a part of your problem. Elaborate on your question and provide more requirement details so that the community can help you resolve this.    Embed Quote
