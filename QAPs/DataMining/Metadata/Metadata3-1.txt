★What is Dublin Core metadata?
Dublin Core is one of the simplest metadata schema available. Dublin Core's origin is from a workshop hosted by OCLC (Online Computer Library Centre) in Dublin, Ohio. The main focus of the workshop was to build a technology to describe and organize and provide access to information over networks. They believed that the only way to do that was to create a common set of metadata elements that could be used to describe things on the web. In other words, there was a need for a metadata core to the web. Thus the Dublin Core Metadata came into existence.    Embed Quote
