★What's the difference between master data and metadata?
Looking at the Time frame of questions and Answer.. Not sure, if I am replying to very old question. However, let me put my words as well Meta Data is data about data which indicates the characteristics of data which will be managed as corporate asset by MDM product. Defining an Data Model in MDM projects is a Critical exercise, though it is done in almost every application, Reason being, MDM applications are integration intensive and any change in the Data model has cascading impact on all the Integration interfaces, Data Model, Matching rules etc.. Hence, there is specific mention in MDM applications about Meta Data Definition.    Embed Quote
