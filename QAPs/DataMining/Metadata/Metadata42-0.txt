★How does Mendeley's PDF metadata extraction feature work?When you add it to your collection and it looks up the citation for you. Is there DOI type metadata in the PDF? where is it and how is it accessed?
Mendeley uses a three step process to extract details from a PDF. First, the client looks within the PDF for embedded metadata, similar to how Flickr can recognize the camera used to take a picture. However, many PDFs don't contain this information, particularly older ones which are scans of print copies. The next thing Mendeley does is to look within the text of the document to see if it can find an identifier string, such as a DOI, Pubmed ID, or Arxiv ID. If it finds one of those, it then looks up the metadata in the appropriate database (using Crossref for DOIs). There are still a significant fraction of papers (maybe as many as 20% of papers uploaded to Mendeley) that don't have DOIs, For this, Mendeley uses some machine learning algorithms to identify the title, author, and publication year and uses that in a Google Scholar query to try to retrieve the information. In the future, Mendeley will be able to use its own records about which metadata is associated with which files to automatically fill in these details.    Embed Quote
