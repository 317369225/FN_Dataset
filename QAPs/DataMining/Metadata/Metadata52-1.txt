★Why aren't record labels supported in music metadata tagging schemes?Record labels are a good heuristic to go by when sifting through tracks. Why aren't they part of the ID3 spec? Not to mention, most CDs/LPs clearly make mention of what label the artist belongs to. Labels are part of the artistry and are deply interwoven into music culture. Why are they left out of the metadata? How can label functionality be implemented?
Good question - I don't know of any official answer but I'll take an educated guess: 1. The ID3 metadata guidelines - I've not dug into it in a long time but I believe it was a non-profit, open-source type of project.  The data that labels send out, may not go to them directly - they may aggregate it - I don't know.  2. Believe it or not, with some exceptions, most consumers do not either know nor care about the labels as their names are not always real "brands" as they once were.  Various classical, jazz and world labels still represent the music genres they were built on - but many don't anymore.  Motown, Putamayo, Rounder, Decca Classical, Deutsche Grammophone, Harmonia Mundi, ECM and a few others are examples of labels that act as a stamp of approval and/or are associated with genres.  So many labels have merged, been sold, switched infrastructures, etc. - most folks just don't know. 3.  If the 300 pound gorilla (iTunes) had a field for it, maybe that would encourage it to be part of "standard" meta-data. I hope this helped. Steve    Embed Quote
