★What's the difference between master data and metadata?
In data warehouse terms - Master Data is more like a central, critical data that is used by many subject areas across organizations for business critical reporting. It's more like a highly used "conforming dimension". Managing the master data accuracy becomes critical as it is used across organizations (like, customer operations group or finance groups within a big company) for analytics/reporting etc. An example for Master Data would be a dimension that contains information about customers or a dimension that contains info about employees or call center agents. Meta data is information about data. Example, data types, table schema etc.    Embed Quote
