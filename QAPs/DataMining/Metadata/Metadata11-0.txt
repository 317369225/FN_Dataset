★What problem would you solve at an ebook and publishing metadata hackathon?There are many discussions on book metadata and even companies like Small Demons scraping and working with in-book content, but if you had access to ebooks and book metadata what would you try to solve? Discoverability is a hot topic for the publishing industry, but requires a bit more user data. Say I was throwing together a hackathon with only the above data, what should I try to fix in a day or two?
I think in the shortest term, scraping and allowing for keyword searching in e-books is the best possible way to ensure a seamless transition for users seeking information from non-fiction e-books, since for the most part, the youngest and least experienced person knows this simplest access method through the ubiquity of Google and the internet. Bypassing metadata--which only the most knowledgeable amateur or professional even knows exist in the first place--would be a good first step, but only a first step, Making robust metadata completely searchable from the same interface one uses to search by keyword, and indeed making metadata totally invisible unless one looks for it otherwise, would be the logical next step. The real issue is not one of access within e-books, imho, but access to them--e-book publishers are not making anywhere near the amount of $ from NF e-books as they do from fiction best sellers, so they have no financial interest in digitizing the bulk of them. A better market solution must be found as well.    Embed Quote
