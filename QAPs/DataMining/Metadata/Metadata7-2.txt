★What is the best method for editing/managing metadata of digital photos?
Use software intended to help with this. I use Aperture (for Macs). You import the photos and then work with keywords (its term for metadata tags). You can also edit other metadata fields and create custom fields. Besides providing a handy interface, the main metadata benefits for Aperture are 1) You can set metadata for multiple photos at once, and 2) face recognition. You give it the names of the faces it recognizes, and it will tag and organize all the photos with those faces (sometimes it needs some help, but overall it's pretty good).    Embed Quote
