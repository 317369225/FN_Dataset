★Can you implement Schema.org tags within Metadata?Schema - http://www.schema.org , now used by Google, Bing & Yahoo.
Yes and No.  If you mean using metadata in the document <head> then the answer is definitely no.  But while we are all used to limiting meta data to the document <head> that is not the only place we can use meta tags. Some things are done through container objects like DIVs or block elements like Header tags as Theo said, by marking up the H1 tag, but some data that schema.org supports can and should be done using meta tags inside the body of the page. For example, if you are using the markup to add rich data about a product you are selling a book and you list the price as $19.99 - You would wrap the price in a tagged span like this: <span itemprop="price">$19.99</span> But you would include, within the same itemscope, a meta tag like this: <meta itemprop="priceCurrency" content="USD" /> to let the search engines know that your price is in US Dollars without needing to actually display USD anywhere on the page. Schema.org has some decent tutorials like the one for a single book per page at:http://schema.org/Book that may help make this more clear for you.    Embed Quote
