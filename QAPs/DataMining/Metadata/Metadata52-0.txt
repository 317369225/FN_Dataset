★Why aren't record labels supported in music metadata tagging schemes?Record labels are a good heuristic to go by when sifting through tracks. Why aren't they part of the ID3 spec? Not to mention, most CDs/LPs clearly make mention of what label the artist belongs to. Labels are part of the artistry and are deply interwoven into music culture. Why are they left out of the metadata? How can label functionality be implemented?
Yes the label is very important both the http://musicbrainz.org and http://discogs.com databases store label information and many tagging applications make use of the TPUB field for labels, and the TXXX frame with the CATALOGNUMBER field can be used for storing catnos.
