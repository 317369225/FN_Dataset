★What's a good method for storing arbitrary metadata?Examples might include GPS trip data, images, or JSON documents. The data should be able to be arbitrarily large and easily manipulated.
As Krishna remarked already, a document data store like MongoDB or CouchDB could work (OrientDB is another).  There is also an interesting pattern that could be used to effectively do the same thing in existing RDMBS. Store your unstructured/semi-structured data as a blob, in your code track which attributes are of interest to you (json structures, elements in xml, etc), then create a new table for that attribute, when you come across it again add a new row in the new table pointing back to the unique_id of the blob.  The only issue is going back in time to add new indexs and capture all the blobs that have that element can be a bit expensive. I would suggest the easier route of just using MongoDB or similar document stores. A better explanation can be found at the url below. http://bret.appspot.com/entry/ho...    Embed Quote
