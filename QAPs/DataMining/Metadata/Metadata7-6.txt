★What is the best method for editing/managing metadata of digital photos?
As a Windows user I find Windows Live Photo Gallery meets my needs. It will identify faces, allow you to add location info (country, state, city but not lat/long), star ratings, captions and tags (equivalent of PhotoShop Elements albums). There's a also a simple boolean flag you can use for workflow status. You can scan directly into Windows Live Photo Gallery if you wish. All of the metadata you add is maintained in the EXIF data. You can bulk tag photos by selecting multiple photos with the usual Windows selection mechanism and assigning a tag, location, date, etc.   The filtering of views by date, image type (includng video), star rating, tags, folder and person is fast and efficient. It can publish to Flickr, FaceBook, YouTube, SkyDrive. I have been using it for years and find it does everyting I need for day-to-day work. I have a combination of scanned images, photos from half-a-dozen cameras, plus machine-generated images and hours of video.    Embed Quote
