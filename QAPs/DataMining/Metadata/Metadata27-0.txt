★What is the best way to clean up song metadata?I haven't seen much written about Tune Up since this: http://techcrunch.com/2008/12/11... Is Tune Up great or are there other products you recommend?
I've been using TuneUp for over a year; while it's far from perfect, it's better than any other tool I've tried (even with its frustrating reliance on iTunes), though I must confess that I've not tried that many. It's using Gracenote's music signature DB along with (I believe) a number of other tricks based on filenames. The main frustrations I have with it are around not having enough control over the matches it finds - for example, it might find the same track in a number of different releases, and pick some random compilation album as the Album rather than the original release - there's no way to point it at the right one. That said, it's mostly great to use, pretty fast and easy, and I managed to clean up a large number of tracks with it. You do have to keep an eye on what it's doing, though. The company's still active - in fact, an acquaintance recently started working there in engineering and is enjoying it.    Embed Quote
