★Are there any plans for Facebook to retain photo metadata?Right now all meta data is stripped, with the two leading hypotheses being privacy and space saving reasons. Does anyone know whether or not the facebook photo team plans to retain some photo meta data in a future update, or whether this is a permanent "solution" for them?
I find the likelihood that this is to reduce storage size to be very low. EXIF data is less than 1% of the data for a photo. And now that FB has gone to high-res photos, that storage argument is looking very weak. Also, a FB engineer answer a question about this a few months ago: Why doesn't Facebook photos use EXIF data? It explains that they DO use some of the EXIF data already (orientation, description) and that they are looking into using more if it can be done broadly without impacting user privacy.
