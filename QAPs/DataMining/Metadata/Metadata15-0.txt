★Will MyShoeBox store photo metadata?Also: can I organize photos into folders - not shareable galleries?
Yup. We pull all sorts of metadata out of your photos (time, location, etc). We use this to auto-organize your collection, power our rediscovery engine and for search. Take a look at the search feature for some examples of the types of metadata we extract. We don't currently offer custom metadata or folders. Our goal is to make photo organization as simple as possible (and require minimal effort). We're always improving the system, but nothing public to announce at this time.
