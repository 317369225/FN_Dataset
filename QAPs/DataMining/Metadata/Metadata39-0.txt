★What are the common tools that retailers use to manage their product data and metadata?Are there popular content management systems for this? Or do most retailers have home grown solutions?
Many retailers and e-commerce sites use data management platforms (DMPs) to collect their 1st party consumer data in order to optimize campaigns. Using the same DMP, they can then organize that into audiences with the option to include 3rd party data to extend their reach which they can then target in ad-servers. They can also sell their 1st party data by exporting these audiences to exchanges. Alternatively, research can be done on audiences to find out common interests and demos that make up said audience. All of this is done within the same platform making DMPs literally a one-stop shop for companies such as e-commerce sites. Full disclosure: I work at a DMP, so I may be (read: am) biased. That being said, many e-commerce sites do indeed use DMPs to simply answer your question.    Embed Quote
