★Recommendations for Onix software for a small publisher wanting to submit robust metadata?I am about to publish a couple of epub books and want a cheap but reliable (and comprehensible!) way of doing it correctly. And using a Mac, just to narrow my options!
We are currently evaluating ONIXEDIT, Title Manager from Stison, and Firebrand Eloquence Metadata Solutions. Hopefully one of these three will be suitable for small publishers - and yes we want something which will work on Macs too.    Embed Quote
