★What are the common tools that retailers use to manage their product data and metadata?Are there popular content management systems for this? Or do most retailers have home grown solutions?
I'm familiar with three approaches for managing product metadata from my time at Best Buy running content management for BestBuy.com. PIM (Product Information Management) systems. Best Buy uses one of these on the enterprise side of the house. BestBuy.com gets feeds from this system. CMS (Content Management Systems). BestBuy.com uses Fatwire Content Server for both web content and product content for a portion of its catalog. Home-grown systems. BestBuy.com uses a home-grown aggregation system built on Oracle to handle some of its product data. My experience is that there is no one "right" approach - there is not a dominant player in the market, or a most popular approach. I think this is mostly because vendors are trying to create a single solution to a multifaceted problem. The needs of retail stores are different from those of online stores, and trying to solve both sets of problems with one tool is just asking for trouble.    Embed Quote
