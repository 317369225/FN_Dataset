★Is there a model for metadata that addresses concepts like "context" and "addressability"?e.g. so that apps can be designed to understand what content to send to a person based on context, and whether the content is 'allowed' to be sent or 'appropriate' based on its addressability attributes. Feel free to discuss any other metadata attributes that make content more useful, customisable and personalised.
At the root of things, for an app to 'understand' a context there is, I believe, an inescapable need of keyword matching in the traditional way. For example adsense parsing the top most mail in a Gmail account to figure out context and then present advertisements is an example. Keyword matching doesn't seem a wrong approach per se, in that even us, the emotional human beings, essentially match "abstractions, shape & sound" to arrive at a 'context'. There are of course a number of parameters in play. I think that relationship between units of meta-data (attributes), i.e hierarchy/relationship of meta-data1 > meta-data2 > meta-data3> right upto the current layer of data in question will contain a more wholesome picture about a given content. That is the context you will be looking at to get closer to addressability, and then appropriate content I believe.    Embed Quote
