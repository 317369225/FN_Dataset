★Which cameras record the most metadata?EXIF tag format with relevant metadata e.g. GPS position, elevation, exact direction and angle of each photograph, and any other relevant information.
Exact direction and angle is the tough part.  The iPhone and the Ricoh G700SE have a compass, but I don't think they record the slant.  The iPhone does not record elevation.  Compass direction is probably not very accurate.  Even latitude/longitude can be inaccurate, especially in urban settings where the GPS signals bounce around among buildings.    Embed Quote
