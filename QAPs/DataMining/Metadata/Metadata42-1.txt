★How does Mendeley's PDF metadata extraction feature work?When you add it to your collection and it looks up the citation for you. Is there DOI type metadata in the PDF? where is it and how is it accessed?
A short answer is that we get what information we can from the PDF itself, using simple pattern matching, looking at embedded metadata and using machine-learned classifiers to try to extract the main fields (title, authors, year etc.) from the content.  That information is then used as a basis for an online lookup in sources like ArXiv, CrossRef, PubMed and the 'Search by Title' feature uses Google Scholar as well.  See http://www.mendeley.com/research... for more details on the content extraction.    Embed Quote
