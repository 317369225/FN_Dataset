★What academic reference management tools provide successful automatic metadata extraction from a collection of PDF files?It seems like it shouldn't be hard to detect the title of each file and look up the metadata online automatically, but I haven't yet encountered a tool that does this robustly for computer science papers. This is a follow-up question to What's the best academic bookmarking tool?.
I have been using Mendeley Desktop for biology pdfs, and it generally works quite well. If I know the PubMed retrieval number, Mendeley can correct its automatic metadata extraction if I think it's wrong. It also supports retrieval through a few other databases. I have not tried it out with computer science papers, but it might do the trick for you.    Embed Quote
