★What laws affect metadata?
This is very much an area of the law that is in flux right now, and courts are still grappling over the question as to whether metadata is an integral part of an electronic document or is independent of the document. The issue comes up most often when there are lawsuits that require the exchange of documents as part of the discovery or exposition process prior to trial. Metadata can often be used to authenticate documents (by having hallmarks that show who created it and when), but it can also reveal things that might legitimately not be disclosed (such as whether a document was created by a lawyer). Let's say, for example, a Word document went through the hands of several people before it was issued in it's final form. The metadata may reveal that someone saw it even though they say they didn't review it before it went out. In that case, the metadata could be relevant. However, if something like a customer alert has to be approved by several people before release (including the lawyer) is the evidence of each and every person who reviewed the document relevant? What if they didn't make any changes? As you can imagine, a large lawsuit can involve several tens of thousands of documents. Metadata can easily multiply that to five times as many sub-documents showing edits or other review. That can quickly get a manageable number of documents to an unmanageable number of documents. The developing rule, which is really less than ten years old, is now "proportionality" when it used to be "semblance of relevance". How much documentary evidence is used is proportional to the amount of money at stake, and "fishing" for metadata may or may not be allowed.    Embed Quote
