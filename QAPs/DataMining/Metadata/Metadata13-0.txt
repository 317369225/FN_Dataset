★Can you implement Schema.org tags within Metadata?Schema - http://www.schema.org , now used by Google, Bing & Yahoo.
Yes, you can absolutely use microdata markup on any valid HTML element - including <html>. Two examples where this sanctioned by Google - which is one of the developers of schema.org. (1) If you use Google's +1 button generator (http://www.google.com/webmasters...) and select "Article" and fill in the title and description fields, this is the code supplied by the generator. <!-- Update your html tag to include the itemscope and itemtype attributes --> <html itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"> <!-- Add the following three tags inside head --> <meta itemprop="name" content="Aaron's Title"> <meta itemprop="description" content="Aaron's description."> (2) Google Programs Developer Jenny Murphy had this to say on a Google Groups post (https://groups.google.com/forum/... You can add the itemscope attribute to any element on your page that contains all of the attributes that make up that scope. This includes the <html> element at the root of your page (since by definition it contains all of the elements on your page), but you may find it technically easier and more readable to add the itemscope further down your tree to the lowest parent of all of your microdata. In summary, adding microdata to the elements before <body> may not always be the best course, especially as Google will give greater credence to markup applied to elements visible to humans on the page ("Only use meta with content for information that cannot otherwise be marked up" - http://schema.org/docs/gs.html#a...).  But doing so is valid.    Embed Quote
