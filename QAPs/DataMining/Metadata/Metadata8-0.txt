★Does Google GFS still use a single master node for metadata/coordination?References: http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?... http://labs.google.com/papers/gf...
For many years GFS has used multiple masters.  Only one master is really the active master, others are standby and can serve read-only requests.  When the active master fails, the remaining masters elect a new one. As others have said, GFS is being phased out in favor of Colossus, where meta-data is inherently distributed and actively served out of multiple nodes anyway.    Embed Quote
