★What is metadata?
Metadata simply means data about data, extra useful information on data - In context of databases, metadata would be info on tables, views, columns, arguments etc. For example, say you have a table to store personal info, which has columns that keep the social security number, phone, address, name, surname, birth date etc. for each person. While describing this table, you would also have to describe each column with a data type, and a length - precision etc. right? (The column to store the birth date of a person would probably be described as DATE type, whereas you might want to define the name column's data type as VARCHAR2- Here, what you call 'data', would be the dates which are stored in the table. The metadata would be all the other stuff you specified while you were creating the table, which defines how that data can be stored and accessed.  (Each RDBMS has its own way of storing and managing metadata I guess. All objects have extra info on what they are / how they can be accessed etc.)    Embed Quote
