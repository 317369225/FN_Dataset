★What is the best/simplest way to change the metadata for a Wordpress powered website?I want to change the description that shows up in google for individual pages on the website (http://www.sloacupuncture.com/).
Others have mentioned Yoast an excellent SEO plugin. But if you just want to change meta data then you can use "Add Meta Tags" plugin, I have used this plugin since 2006, it is simple and light. http://wordpress.org/extend/plug... This will add meta tags to your posts and descriptions, you can add descriptions for your categories and tags manually from your admin interface.    Embed Quote
