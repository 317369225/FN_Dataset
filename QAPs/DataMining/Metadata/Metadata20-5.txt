★Is there a free tool which can complete music metadata by identifying the song?I have a very large collection of songs but the metadata is very haphazard. What free tool can be used to correct this? Open source tools which work on Linux are preferred.
iriver Plus 4 is an excellent client for Windows. It is free (beer) and has excellent song based media recognition supplied by AMG. There are a number of features which are not found in other systems and the metadata quality has no equal.    Embed Quote
