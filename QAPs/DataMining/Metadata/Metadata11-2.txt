★What problem would you solve at an ebook and publishing metadata hackathon?There are many discussions on book metadata and even companies like Small Demons scraping and working with in-book content, but if you had access to ebooks and book metadata what would you try to solve? Discoverability is a hot topic for the publishing industry, but requires a bit more user data. Say I was throwing together a hackathon with only the above data, what should I try to fix in a day or two?

Essence of the story is that existing (publisher or 3rd party supplied) meta-data doesn't allow you to do much stuff that interest consumers. The most interesting meta-data is the one that is yet to be created for books. Another observation is that most publishers think about meta-data about something that is supplied Google solely for the purpose of SEO and forget about the specific mark-up language needed for Twitter, Facebok, etc.  and what start-ups might make use of...    Embed Quote
