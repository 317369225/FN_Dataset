★What academic reference management tools provide successful automatic metadata extraction from a collection of PDF files?It seems like it shouldn't be hard to detect the title of each file and look up the metadata online automatically, but I haven't yet encountered a tool that does this robustly for computer science papers. This is a follow-up question to What's the best academic bookmarking tool?.
Mendeley desktop is the most hassle free way to extract metadata from PDFs..zotero can do the same, but mendeley has 2 GB of free storage while zotero only has a 100 MB. Also check out Colwiz desktop..excellent tool.    Embed Quote
