★What is the difference between structured and unstructured data?
Take an HTML page on Amazon as displayed by the browser (edited as per Abhishek Chanda's comment). That's unstructured data. Now extract specific details from this page that you'd like to clearly see without having to do a CTL+F on the page and possibly later dump into your DB (which of course has some schema). That's now structured. Here's an XML example. It could be structured to meet any format- XML, XLS, JSON or whatever your machine can read and parse. <product>       <productname>Edit Tool, Three Tools per Pack</productname>       <product_url>http://example.com/prod1.htm</product_url>       <product_id>B000MIJC86</product_id>       <price>$19.99</price>       <rating>1.5 out of 5 stars</rating>       <meta_description>Edit Tool, Three Tools per Pack: 5/8, 1/2, 5/16: Office Products</meta_description> </product>    Embed Quote
