★What is the best way to organise my personal unstructured data?I have lots of music, photos, documents, videos etc. They are filed by type, not topic in 5 - 6 different programs according to the type of data that they are. Tagging and organising them is hugely time consuming and there is little immediate ROI for doing so. Is it possible to have a more systematic approach?
To start with , you can use Everything Search Engine for instant search. This one's free and fast , though limited functionality. As Yin Yau mentioned - X1 is a better alternative but it isn't free. For file tagging -Tabbles ( http://tabbles.net/ ) can be used and for Music files per se - Jaangle is a fast & lightweight option.    Embed Quote
