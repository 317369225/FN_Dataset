★How can the NoSql database store unstructured data?How its different store un structure from RDBMS?
Simple. Imagine, in Java, being N an integer: SpecificObject myObjects = new SpecificObject[N] If SpecificObject class is final, then every instance of that class will have the same structure, the same way that every row in a RDBMS. Moreover, to reach this point, you have to define a lot of rules about that structure. Just imagine all the necessary code. Now, let's have: Object[] lotsOfDifferentObjects =  new Object[N]; You are not constrained anymore to a specific structure, and instead you are able to store any kind of Object there. In practice, the structure of one element in a table/collection is not so different from another one. In certain way, it's easier to store that kind of "unstructured" information but sometimes it becomes messy to read or process.    Embed Quote
