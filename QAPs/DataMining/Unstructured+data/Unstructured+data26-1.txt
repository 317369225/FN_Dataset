★How is unstructured data like images, PDFs & videos transformed into structured data?For example: In case of face recognition, do we require a statistical model?
You could go about it many ways. You could start with a totally blank slate, and train your algorithm on a (hopefully very large) dataset. There, you are letting your algorithm decide for itself what features are important for classification, and then hope that it will create a classifier or a feature extractor that would classify data outside your training set the way you want with high probability. An example of this approach is using neural nets for handwriting recognition. Another way would be think for yourself: what features are important, and prod your classifier in that direction. For instance, for facial recognition you could tell your classifier to look for particular curves. That 'pre-conceived idea' of what you are looking for amounts to having a model, and probably the best example of this is the Bayesian approach and its use of the prior. So the answer to your question can be yes or no depending on the context and methods used. In general, this sort of structure extraction is a very hard problem    Embed Quote
