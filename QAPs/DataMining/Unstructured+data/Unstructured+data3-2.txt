★What is the value of unstructured data?Why would a company allow e.g. Word documents to be used for important information instead of a structured database?
Ah Ha! :) During the 90's and part of the 2000's i worked on an idea and a research that relates to this question...It was resulted in a new technology, methodology and lots and lots of very interesting artifacts... But i had no funding, so .... it died. Anyways, the answer, TMHO, is that we still lack the tooling for a proper, "spontaneous" knowledge management/composition/manipulation application. i still dream about writing that solution i designed, which was named Milkshake....*dreamy eyes*...    Embed Quote
