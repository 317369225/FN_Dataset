★What are the good ways to process unstructured data into structured data to build predictive model?
I would recommend investing some time in learning Pig and using it for processing  as it is precisely made for this purpose. As compared to writing Map Reduce jobs, Pig is very simple to learn and provides a lot of predefined string processing and mathematical functions. Also it has a very nice documentation and supports grouping, filtering and doing other operations on the data. (Pig Latin Reference Manual 2) Pig also supports custom UDFs written in Java or python which can be extremely helpful in writing complex logics. Another benefit of using Pig would be that the output generated by Pig can be directly used by Hive external tables or data can also be stored into Hbase tables (HBase Storage). All these components make Pig a very powerful data flow language for processing unstructured data.    Embed Quote
