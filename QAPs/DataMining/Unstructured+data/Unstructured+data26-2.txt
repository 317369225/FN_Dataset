★How is unstructured data like images, PDFs & videos transformed into structured data?For example: In case of face recognition, do we require a statistical model?
This is a surprisingly deep question. There are many ways that unstructured data is dealt with. For natural language, there is a massive body of work that provides the theory and tools to create a structured dataset from unstructured data. Natural language processing For images, one easy way is to encode the intensity of each pixel and create a structured dataset. This dataset can then be processed in many ways to create a more usable dataset. Wavelet transforms are used commonly here. Videos employ similar methods but they are more complex and I won't venture an answer here.    Embed Quote
