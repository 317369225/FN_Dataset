★How is the data warehousing scene changing with the advent of Big Data (especially Unstructured data)?
Right at this moment, very little. As noted, big data is being used to analyze and use unstructured data, which is not an area that the warehouse has played in. Another factor playing into the lack of change in the warehouse is that the use cases for big data are still immature. The focus has been on the customer and being able to drive insights from customer generated/customer related unstructured data. As those use cases mature even more and expand to include operational, logistical, even HR related unstructured data, more opportunities to add structure and create metrics will be realized and then added into the warehouse Looking forward to big data maturing the question becomes, how will big data and the warehouse play together? Some will say that big data will replace traditional warehouses, others say it will be a new source of data, and some have yet to drink the big data kool-aid. I don't think big data is mature enough to know yet if it will replace data warehouses (I don't think it will), I think it will be a new source of data, and I think the potential is there, but realizing the hype might be an overreach. Below are my 'predictions' on how will big data change the warehouse in the future: - Archiving strategies will change to use big data and its commodity hardware as a viable strategy. Retention in the warehouse will be reduced as getting to historical data will be easier and cheaper on big data. - Data warehouse hardware will become cheaper or organizations will not need as "much". With big data being on commodity hardware and the reduction of retention periods putting pressure on the hardware vendors, as well as increased innovations in processing power and storage options, hardware will become more efficient and cheaper. Teradata has already gone towards being able to run Teradata 14 on VMware. I think this trend will continue    Embed Quote
