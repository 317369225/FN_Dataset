★What is the best way to organise my personal unstructured data?I have lots of music, photos, documents, videos etc. They are filed by type, not topic in 5 - 6 different programs according to the type of data that they are. Tagging and organising them is hugely time consuming and there is little immediate ROI for doing so. Is it possible to have a more systematic approach?
Adding to Yin Yau's answer, Apple's Spotlight, incorporated into OS X, indexes as much of your disc as you want it to. By identifying the indexing parameters, you are able to search on file titles and type, by file locations and by file content – at least for documents containing text and/or metadata such as the EXIF data in many photographs. The link below describes Spotlight and it's capabilities. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2531    Embed Quote
