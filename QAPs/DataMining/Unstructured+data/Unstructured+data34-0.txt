★Question of the definition: Is HTML structured, semi structured or unstructured data?
When it comes to data, as a person who's been in the teams that had to extract data from HTML, I would be strongly against the idea of calling HTML structural! :-) (Yes, extracting data from HTML is a pain.) From the browser perspective, however, HTML probably should be considered structual. Well, if it has a standard, an automatic validator and a number of independently designed pieces of software that display it in more or less the same way -- it gotta be. XML is structured by definition, and is still used to return data from REST API-s. Although JSON seems to be taking over, which is good. Please keep in mind I'm a big data guy and my understanding of what "data" is may differ from what was meant to be asked.    Embed Quote
