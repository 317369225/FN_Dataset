★What is the difference between structured and unstructured data?
The bulk of information on the web is unstructured.  At this point in  the development of technology, more effort is being put into  interpreting unstructured data than structuring it in standard ways. Structured data is generated and/or displayed using some kind of a data schema or pattern that is represented separately.  It forces information into a fixed number of patterns, which can be both useful and limiting.  The structure helps programs store, analyze, search the information.  A disadvantage is that structured data requires specific programming for each type of structure, and it is difficult to standardize the schemas so this code can be reused. Unstructured data typically refers to flat strings of text.  For machines to assign "meaning" from them requires natural language processing, which is inexact and time-consuming.  One advantage is that this interpretation code can be generic -- it does not much depend upon the schema.    Embed Quote
