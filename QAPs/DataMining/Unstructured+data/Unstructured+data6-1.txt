★What is the best way to organise my personal unstructured data?I have lots of music, photos, documents, videos etc. They are filed by type, not topic in 5 - 6 different programs according to the type of data that they are. Tagging and organising them is hugely time consuming and there is little immediate ROI for doing so. Is it possible to have a more systematic approach?
If you are by nature disorganised, then anything that requires extra effort is unlikely to stick unless something radical has happened? If not, think about how often you need to find a file and how long it takes vs the time to index everything, and see if its actually worth it. If not, why not just tag from now on anything that seems importantish, plus anything you had to go back for. This is the minimum effort approach, and will help in the future if you do want to formally index everything. After a few years, most major stuff will be tagged, so there will far less old stuff to sort through. This is the approach a lot of public sector organisations are using, because its cheap, and doesn't need extra people to do it.    Embed Quote
