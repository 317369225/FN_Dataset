★What is the actual difference between semi-structured data and unstructured data?
The line between unstructured data and semi-structured is a little  fuzzy.  Unstructured Data: Essentially everything else that has not been specifically structured is  considered unstructured.  The list of truly unstructured data includes  free text such as documents produced in your company, images and videos,  audio files, and some types of social media.  If the object to be  stored carries no tags (metadata about the data) and has no established  schema, ontology, glossary, or consistent organization it is  unstructured. Semi- structured Data: If the data has any organizational structure (a known schema) or carries a tag (like XML extensible markup language used for documents  on the web) then it is somewhat easier to organize and analyze, and  because it is more accessible for analysis may make it more valuable.
