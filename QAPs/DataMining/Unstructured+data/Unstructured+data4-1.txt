★What are some good examples of unstructured data domains?where much more work is needed.
(Added Apr 10: I've written an extended response, posted to http://www.allanalytics.com/auth...) Images -- Determining the "features" (people, places, objects, and their in-image interrelationships) and what they are doing; also inference about the image-capture apparatus. Audio -- Who or what is in the audio stream; what activities, speech, emotions, etc. are captured; what are the interrelationships among the things recorded in the audio and how do they change over the course of the recording. Video -- The cross-product of my image and audio points. Work is still needed on text, too.    Embed Quote
