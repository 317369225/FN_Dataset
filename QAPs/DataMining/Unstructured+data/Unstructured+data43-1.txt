★Who are competitors to Autonomy? I'm particularly interested in ones that glean structure and apply it to unstructured data.
I guess the real answer here is a little blurry. The answer can shift if the data being indexed is documents and email, numbers, media, "live content" or a combination of things. The Autonomy algorithm for context and meaning is the clear leader in the space of unstructured indexing. The main competitor that nips at Autonomy's heels is Recommind. They have a similar context and unstructured engine that works in a similar fashion - but not on as many media types or as fast. I've been active in unstructured data and context aware algorithmic processing for about a decade. Please provide more clarity and I'll provide more guidance.    Embed Quote
