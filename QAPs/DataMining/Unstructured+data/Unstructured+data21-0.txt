★Is it possible to use a sort routine to sort unstructured data?
It depends what answer you want and how unstructured it is. If it's totally random data then sorting it won't help much, unless an alphabetical list is what you want. However if you can trigger the search after a certain text string such as the start of a postcode, then that may work. You need to sample a bit manually and see if it is concatenated, which makes life much easier. Worst case is it is a free text field for the public to fill in as they choose - even if it's supposed to be an address that still goes horribly wrong. Next time, try to get it at the start of the process and explain how to get data that can be analysed by simple form changes etc.    Embed Quote
