★What is the value of unstructured data?Why would a company allow e.g. Word documents to be used for important information instead of a structured database?
“Gartner defines unstructured data as content that does not conform to a specific, pre-defined data model,” writes Gartner’s Darin Stewart. “It tends to be human-generated, and people-oriented content that does not fit neatly into database tables.” Here it seems as though there’s a kernel of truth in the tendency to think of big data and unstructured data as one and the same, no? By its nature,  the majority of big data is unstructured; it cannot generally be analyzed by relational databases due to a lack of structure. This definition, however, is overly simplistic – in the very same post from which we drew the above definition, Stewart indirectly acknowledges that unstructured data is not the only form of big data that exists: “While ‘Big Data’ technologies and techniques are unlocking secrets previously hidden in enterprise data, the largest source of potential insight remains largely untapped,” he explains. ”Unstructured content represents as much as eighty percent of an organization’s total information assets.” I pulled this information from the article Why Big Data And Unstructured Data Aren’t The Same Thing. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
