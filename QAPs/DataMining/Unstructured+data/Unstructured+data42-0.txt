★For those startups with extensive demand for unstructured data (e.g. intagram, tumblr) storage, why did they choose to deploy an open source solution (e.g. Ceph) but choose to use Amazon S3?For those startups with extensive demand for unstructured data (e.g. intagram,  tumblr) storage, why did they choose not to deploy an open source solution (e.g. Ceph) but choose to use Amazon S3?  1) Is it more cheaper? (I assume not).  2) Is it because the open source solution not stable enough?
3) because of maintenance burden and CAPEX. Some companies do use private object storage, especially when they have specific requirements, i.e. low latency, regulations or replication to the regions, where AWS S3 doesn't have datacenters.    Embed Quote
