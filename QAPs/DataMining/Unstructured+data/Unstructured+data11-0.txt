★What can a business truly learn from unstructured data?My company (a large fortune 100 company) currently only analyzes structured data which is stored in relational databases. What business value could come from analyzing unstructured data via Hadoop?
This is easier with an example.  You could use Named-entity recognition and Sentiment analysis to determine public sentiment towards companies.  If you built this in realtime from Twitter data, it may have value for realtime trading algorithms. Considering the shenanigans of athletes on Twitter, you can do the same for realtime stock trading on athletes: Buy and Sell stock linked to the value of a pro athlete brand.  Whether or not actual value is realized is tbd.    Embed Quote
