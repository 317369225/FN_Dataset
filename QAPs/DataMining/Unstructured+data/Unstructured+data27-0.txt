★Which startups are focused on revolutionizing online retail using contextual learning and unstructured data?
One startup that was early in the space is Shopkick. You can read a nice (& recent) article here: The $30M App That Rewards You For Just Browsing. From Wikipedia: "Shopkick created a highly accurate inaudible audio signal that is unique to each store that can be detected by smartphone users who have the shopkick app installed, when the app is open. Once a shopkick Signal is detected, the app delivers reward points called “kicks” to the user for walking into a retail store, trying on clothes, scanning a barcode and other actions. The audio signal is either broadcast through a small transmitter in the store (no internet required, just power), or played directly through the stores' existing music system." You can take a look at this AngelList search to see some startups working on these solutions. I also like to check on Crunchbase Search. I also like to follow Robert Scoble who has really great insight and startup recommendation on the Age of Context ;) My favorite are Estimote Beacons, EDITD, Euclid Analytics. But there is more and will have many more. People will use Project Tango, Beacon, Contextual data, Big data, new kind of database and even crypto currency. Hope this help !    Embed Quote
