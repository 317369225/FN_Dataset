★Is it possible to extract information from unstructured data or semi-structured data using NLP?IS it possible to get the summary of the entire text using NLP or stochastic language??
Yes it is! Take a look at VisualText / NLP++. This system is tailored for Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics, including the extraction of information from unstructured text. I receommend to start here: Getting Started Package This package contains everything you need to get started with NLP++. Yes, you have to learn a new programming language but it is similar to C++ and you don't have to use a black-box API. You can use the VisualText and NLP++ for free for non-commercial projects.
