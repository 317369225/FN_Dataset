★How is unstructured data like images, PDFs & videos transformed into structured data?For example: In case of face recognition, do we require a statistical model?
This is  one of the questions with simple idea and very difficult implementation. Hundreds research papers written about object recognition, face recognition, feature extraction from different unstructured data sources. The answer is that there is no "silver bullet" and universal solution.  If you need to extract structured data first of all you need to define data model and to use existing or to develop your own tool to extract features from unstructured data that fits into your data model. I suggest to take a look at research papers about feature extraction arXiv.org Search    Embed Quote
