★For those startups with extensive demand for unstructured data (e.g. intagram, tumblr) storage, why did they choose to deploy an open source solution (e.g. Ceph) but choose to use Amazon S3?For those startups with extensive demand for unstructured data (e.g. intagram,  tumblr) storage, why did they choose not to deploy an open source solution (e.g. Ceph) but choose to use Amazon S3?  1) Is it more cheaper? (I assume not).  2) Is it because the open source solution not stable enough?
Ceph built RADOS storage system. Up the RADOS, Ceph can provide Block Device , Filesystem and Rados Gateway service. Using all of these service, End-users can merge all their structured and unstrucured data into one Ceph storage system. And almostly Ceph is free to use but Amazon S3 is expensive.    Embed Quote
