★How does Autonomy analyze unstructured data?
Autonomy utilizes a term centric index - effectively a reverse index of terms(words) pointing to documents - known as an index.  This is complemented by numerous underlying data structures to make operations fast e.g. b-trees, hash tables etc.  Each word is associated with a term weight - determined principally by the term occurrences in the whole index and per document.  Effectively an TF-IDF weight - this is well documented and pretty straight forward.  In addition, they build a model for each language - the document is assigned this language when it is indexed.  Each document is effectively represented by a vector of terms - as is the query text.  At query time the engine computes the distance to the closest documents using these vectors - again reasonably straightforward.  The so called 'meaning' is simply a relevancy calculation using the language model for the document and the term weights.  The user is presented with a result set and relevancy scores.  The meaning is nothing more than marketting - IDOL is no more intelligent than lucene or mahout running on hadoop.  The solution is well optimised as it allows the user to issue varying queries e.g. matching on meta, geo-spatial queries etc.  Working with autonomy the discussion always needs to be: they have a optimized search engine. nothing more.    Embed Quote
