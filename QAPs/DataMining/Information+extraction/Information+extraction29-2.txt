★How does social media analytics work? How is meaningful information extracted from social media (e.g. Twitter)?I have been searching about getting meaningful information from Twitter. I have found so far that some perform sentiment analysis of tweets and some look for occurrences of specific words and made decision on base of that. But I am still confused that how meaningful decision are taken Can you just elaborate it with example of recent gold prices (or any other topic of your choice) and twitter?
Based on the sentiment analysis, Twitter will gather ample number of words, on which people re discussing daily. So twitter can create customized views and topics based on those words, so that people will involve more on this. Also, on a particular topic, say Immigration in USA, Twitter can easily identify what is the peoples view on the recent government decision based on the sentiment analysis.    Embed Quote
