★Big Data: How is big data stored? Do they use databases like Oracle? How do they extract information from them?
Relational Databases are based on set theory and are more suited to store structured data. They are over-kill (less scalable) for data that can be effectively used as key-value pairs or for column level operations like aggregates. They are under-kill (low on performance) where data operations need more context (like parent child relationships, distances etc). Big Data which is generally 80-90% unstructured data is best stored where schema definition is not required at write time (and can be defined at code level at read time) - generally NoSQL databases which are categorized as below, Key-Value (Stores data by primary key - distributed hash tables) Columnar (Provide high performance on column operations, parallelization) Document (Designed to understand encoding / mark-up within a document type ) Graph (Designed to work with multiple relationships within data – social, network)    Embed Quote
