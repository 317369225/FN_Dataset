★How do SVM and CRF compare when applied to the task of information extraction?SVM = Support vector machine CRF = Conditional random field
Svm is not suited for structural prediction problems where the coreelation of multiple labelling is also important. On the contrary, CRF is designed to grasp this need to predict structural labels by also reading the correlations. SVM might be an ingredient of an CRF model as well, in order to predict intiail labels of the things and then CRF might propagate labels to fine tune the predictions through many different inference methods. Therefore, this structural property urges many use cases of CRF in Computer Vision, NLP in which the structure is important part of the problem.    Embed Quote
