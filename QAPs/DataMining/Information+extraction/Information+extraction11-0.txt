★How do you explain "information extraction" in layman's terms?
Do an exercise. Go to http://www.quora.com/careers and choose any available position. I chose "Data Scientist" and the following exercise worked but I think it should work for all. Now upload your resume and you will see that Quora is now analysing your resume. After it has done analysing it, the fields below would populate automatically. This is Information Extraction. Formally, Information extraction is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents. P.S. It is my dream job.
