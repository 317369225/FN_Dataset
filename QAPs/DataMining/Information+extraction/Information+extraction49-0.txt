★Given an arbitrary document, how can you extract information within it?
One way to do this could be to think of (both of) these as classification problems. Know whether it is a resume or notYou could train a classifier to recognize resumes vs non-resumes, using word features, then use it against new documents to decide whether its a resume or not. You will need enough examples of resume vs non-resume documents. Extract some information (i.e experience, name and so on)You could train a named entity extractor that classifies each word in the document in IOB (In, Out, Begin) format. Named entity extractors can be multi-class classifiers or you could train and use a series of entity extractors each recognizing a different type of entity (experience, name, etc) and then combine the results.    Embed Quote
