★Is it possible to extract information about the list of downloaded apps of the user with his permission?(iOS & Android)If yes, how?
Downloaded, I don't think so, but installed yes, you can. To get the list of installed apps on an android device, here's the snippet final Intent mainIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MAIN, null);mainIntent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER); final List appsList = context.getPackageManager().queryIntentActivities( mainIntent, 0); On iOS, there are a few methods which can be used, but they won't get you the entire list, only some of the apps. Daniel Amitay has a nice framework for this. You can find it here - iHasApp I have used it and it gets most of the apps, but as I said, not all. Daniel explains in his blog post (How To Detect Installed iOS Apps) what techniques you can use.    Embed Quote
