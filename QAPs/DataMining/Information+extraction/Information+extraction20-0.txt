★Is social network analysis a form of information extraction technique?
Absolutely! If you have correct and complete communication information about individuals in an organization, you know exactly who is most central, who is most contacted, and basically: who are the influencers, regardless of official positions, organization hierarchy an other official information. Social network analyses will show you information that people inside the network you are studying might not be waarde of and for sure would not be able to quantify.    Embed Quote
