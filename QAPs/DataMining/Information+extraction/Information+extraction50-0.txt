★What kind of useful information can I extract from a data set comprising of consumption over time?
This is a rich dataset and you can go far beyond just "cataloging" the results.  For example, here's what I would look at: Which items are purchased together?  e.g. A + B show up together 80% of the time Which items precede other items?  e.g. 60% of the time B shows up within 2 mo of customer buying A What is the periodicity of behavior?  e.g. 70% of the time A is purchased every other month If you have the marketing calendar, are there relationships between what the customer bought and what was ocurring from a marketing perspective? Etc This type of analysis can really help marketers understand how to shift / capture demand through marketing levers (promotions, coupons, etc.) By the way, this type of analysis also helps you get past "first level" understanding, i.e. the typical "answer" is to promote what the customer has already purchased.  Sometimes that may be an ok strategy, but it doesn't really take advantage of what we can know about that customer.    Embed Quote
