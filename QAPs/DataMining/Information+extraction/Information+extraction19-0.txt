★What are some good books to get started with understanding and using classification, clustering and mining, information extraction and predictions for building recommendation engines?I'd like to know what would be a good place to start reading on these topics for someone  proficient in programming, web development and with a computer science background
I believe the easy way in starts with Toby Segaran's Programming Collective Intelligence. It gives you hands-on Python code for recommendation engines and other machine learning tasks. Another rather easy book is Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques ("The Weka Book"). It is a good exposition of data mining and machine learning. It uses the Weka framework which is not my favourite, but gives lots of principles including an important part about measuring learning success. Next up is Mahout in Action. This book is the joint work of several authors, so it contains several introductions to various parts of machine learning. It starts to get tricky when the book discusses using Mahout for distributed machine learning. However, the chapters about representation and feature engineering are invaluable. Some more theoretical and deeper treatments of machine learning are Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning and Elements of Statistical Learning. But one of the first three books would probably suit the task better.    Embed Quote
