★What is the best algorithm and method for close-domain question answering and information extraction?
I believe this is still largely a research subject. One possibility is to extract Subject Verb Object (SVO) triples from sentences from some corpus of knowledge, then extracting one or more of subjects, verbs or objects from the question and matching to the answer sentences, ranking the results by decreasing number of matches. You can find a general overview of this approach here: Question-Answering Using Semantic Relation Triples. I have used knowitall/reverb to extract SVO triples - it misses a lot of triples, however it is really easy to use. Other (probably more accurate) approaches would involve using parsers from NLP libraries to extract the SVO triples manually - see this Page on stanford.edu.    Embed Quote
