★What tools/framework can I use in order for my system to extract information from an input text and store the extracted information on a database and be retrieved for later processing?
Take a look at VisualText / NLP++ including KBMS, a Concept Grammar database. This system is tailored for Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics: NLP++ | NLP Cloud While the NLP Cloud is available now, I receommend to start here: Getting Started Package This package contains everything you need to get started with NLP++. Yes, you have to learn a new programming language but it is similar to C++ and you don't have to use a black-box API. You can use the VisualText and NLP++ for free for non-commercial projects. Join the NLP++ Community to ask questions, discuss your analyzers and to learn more about NLP++: Learning, Using, and Teaching NLP++ Kind regards, Dominik Holenstein NLP++ Community Manager    Embed Quote
