★Is there a "practitioner's guide" to information extraction from text?Information extraction from text is a hard task involving machine learning and natural language processing technology. Is there a book/survey/tutorial covering the domain? It is better if it's a bit application oriented (discusses tools, software etc.). The closest I can find is a survey in 2008 by Sarawagi (Information Extraction) but it is mostly theoretical. Are there any other resources?
Look at the tutorial sections (or books) of popular information extraction libraries. NLTK Book LingPipe: API Tutorials These two libraries are the most beginner-friendly to get started on information extraction tasks. You can then try Mallet and GATE.    Embed Quote
