★What are some good resources to learn about information extraction?
Sarawagi, Sunita. "Information extraction." Foundations and trends in databases 1.3 (2008): 261-377. (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cs... ; http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?i...) This review is a survey of information extraction research of over two decades from these diverse communities. We create a taxonomy of the field along various dimensions derived from the nature of the extraction task, the techniques used for extraction, the variety of input resources exploited, and the type of output produced. We elaborate on rule-based and statistical methods for entity and relationship extraction. In each case we highlight the different kinds of models for capturing the diversity of clues driving the recognition process and the algorithms for training and efficiently deploying the models. We survey techniques for optimizing the various steps in an information extraction pipeline, adapting to dynamic data, integrating with existing entities and handling uncertainty in the extraction process.
