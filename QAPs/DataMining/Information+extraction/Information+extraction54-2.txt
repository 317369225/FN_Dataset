★Is Facebook extracting information from my phonebook and suggesting friends?Recently I have been observing friend suggestions on Facebook for people who do not have even one friend in common with me. However, I know the person and have the person's number saved in my phonebook. Also, this is a recent feature that I have observed and I believe it is after Facebook took over Whats app.
Yes. Check the app permissions. And fyi, the moment we install FB into our phones, it can read our private SMSes, find out our exact location, check our call logs, read your storage... Have a look at the permissions again, I'm not even exaggerating.    Embed Quote
