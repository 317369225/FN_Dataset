★Is it possible to extract information from unstructured data or semi-structured data using NLP?IS it possible to get the summary of the entire text using NLP or stochastic language??
Absolutely. There are many NLP approaches which completely disregard term (word) order and look solely at term frequency among sets of documents. One of the primary examples of this is term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf–idf). Easy to implement and surprisingly powerful.    Embed Quote
