★Is there a "practitioner's guide" to information extraction from text?Information extraction from text is a hard task involving machine learning and natural language processing technology. Is there a book/survey/tutorial covering the domain? It is better if it's a bit application oriented (discusses tools, software etc.). The closest I can find is a survey in 2008 by Sarawagi (Information Extraction) but it is mostly theoretical. Are there any other resources?
I found very useful (and well-written) the book Natural Language Processing with Python. Unfortunately, if you are not interested in developing with Python, then it could be a little bit boring. I don't know personally any specific book about information extraction in particular. Of course I can suggest you the bibles of NLP: Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing Speech and Language ProcessingHere you will find almost everything you need to have a very very strong theoretical/methodological background in Information Extraction and others.    Embed Quote
