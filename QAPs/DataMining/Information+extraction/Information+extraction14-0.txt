★How well do Hierarchical CRFs perform for web information extraction, and are there better alternatives?Reference: research.microsoft.com/pubs/70300/tr-2006-69.pdf This paper details the use of Hierarchical CRFs to extract product name, image, description, price, etc. from html pages to build a product comparision engine. This approach performs both block detection and attribute labeling simultaneously.
We have used this approach. In general it did not work because it is very difficult to keep up to date such a structural training corpus. But we did break the task into several layers then train sequence and a single object classifiers. Another very good approach is to use html regularities on page, detect similar subtrees.    Embed Quote
