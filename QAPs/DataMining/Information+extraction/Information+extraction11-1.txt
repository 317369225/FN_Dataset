★How do you explain "information extraction" in layman's terms?
I have to second Ishan Jain's resume example in his answer. Most people will see that resume's have mostly the same information but in an almost unlimited number of formats. It's a good example because people understand what resumes look like, the type of information that is in them, why you would want that information and why you would need it in specific formats for computers, etc. Find other similar examples, and I would avoid getting into any ML type aspects, explain the problem not the types of math used for the solutions.    Embed Quote
