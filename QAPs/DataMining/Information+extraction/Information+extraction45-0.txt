★How much information can be extracted from a crime scene using bloodstain pattern analysis?Basically, is it like Dexter at all?
I haven't seen Dexter, but I suspect they take some creative liberties. Bloodstain Pattern Analysis is a very powerful tool in crime scene reconstruction.  There is a tremendous amount of information that can be obtained through a skilled analysis and under the right conditions.  Some examples include location of victims and subjects within a scene, their relative movements in the scene, identifying various bloodshed events, and sequencing events.  But, that is just a broad brush answer.  It would help if you have some specific information in mind.    Embed Quote
