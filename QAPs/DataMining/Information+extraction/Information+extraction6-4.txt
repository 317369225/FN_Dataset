★Will machine learning overtake heuristic/rule-based approaches in entity tagging/recognition and information extraction?Companies are adopting either machine learning or heuristic approaches to entity tagging and in general extraction of information from various kinds of documents/sources. Is there tangible evidence to claim that machine learning will overtake heuristic approaches to these technologies?
I find it doubtful.  Machine learning is a type of heuristic analysis, that simply allows feedback to be fed into the decision engine.  The feedback allows the algorithm to weight the different heuristic conditions.  In a sense, what is called "Machine Learning" is a meta-heuristic engine. Note the number of scholarly sources that use the terms together in a Google search: http://goo.gl/dMOlP    Embed Quote
