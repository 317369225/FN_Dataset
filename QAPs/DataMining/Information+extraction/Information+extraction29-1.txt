★How does social media analytics work? How is meaningful information extracted from social media (e.g. Twitter)?I have been searching about getting meaningful information from Twitter. I have found so far that some perform sentiment analysis of tweets and some look for occurrences of specific words and made decision on base of that. But I am still confused that how meaningful decision are taken Can you just elaborate it with example of recent gold prices (or any other topic of your choice) and twitter?
It really depends on what your goal is for using Twitter. There's plenty of analytic software out there that will pretty much give you the same type of metrics; it just depends on what you're trying to measure. For example, you mentioned a tweet's sentiment, this might be a useful metric to track if your main concern is maintaining a good online reputation. Another example, some social analytics software rank the Twitter followers that have interacted with your tweets by level of influence. This is a great metric to monitor if you are testing if your messaging is reaching your core audience and are trying to expand your reach. Targeting major influencers on Twitter will help get you a bigger audience and make sure your messaging is on brand and effective. Not to mention you can get plenty of insights about your followers' demographics, location, etc. which is information to consider if you're not too sure who your target audience is yet. You can also just track the popularity and reach of your tweets so you can get an idea of how to better write your tweets. There is a lot you can do with your social media analytics, first step is figuring out what your goals are and how to quanifity/measure them.    Embed Quote
