★What are the best schools for studying Natural Language Processing?
Penn has an extremely strong NLP group. Among our distinguished NLP faculty are: Two famous, senior researchers: Mitch Marcus - Penn Computer Science: Mitch has a long list of well cited work (Page on google.com) and is perhaps best known for constructing the Penn Treebank, an extremely widely used resource in the NLP world Aravind Joshi: (Now emeritus, but still comes into the department) One of the pioneers of NLP, and among the most decorated NLP researchers in the world. And two young superstars: Ani Nenkova Chris Callison-Burch But I think the most impressive thing about Penn NLP is our list of alumni, who have gone on to populate the other top NLP schools. A small sample includes: Kathy McKeown -- Henry and Gertrude Rothschild Professor of Computer Science at Columbia (former chair of the department, current director for the institute of data science) Julia Hirschberg -- Percy K. and Vida L. W. Hudson Pofessor of Computer Science at Columbia (current chair of the department) Michael Collins-- Formerly at MIT, now Vikram S. Pandit Professor of Computer Science at Columbia David Yarowsky -- Full Professor at Johns Hopkins  Eric Brill -- Formerly of Johns Hopkins, now VP of research at Ebay Philip Resnik's -- Director of the University of Maryland's computational linguistics program Michel DeGraff -- Full professor of Linguistics at MIT Nick Montfort-- Associate professor at MIT Jason Eisner -- Full professor at Johns Hopkins And plenty more -- see Penn Natural Language Processing alumni for a more complete list. Its hard to find a more distinguished group of Alumni anywhere.    Embed Quote
