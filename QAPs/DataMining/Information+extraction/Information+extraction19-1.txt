★What are some good books to get started with understanding and using classification, clustering and mining, information extraction and predictions for building recommendation engines?I'd like to know what would be a good place to start reading on these topics for someone  proficient in programming, web development and with a computer science background
Besides books mentioned by Yuval (all of them are great), I could recommed Data Mining---Concepts and Techniques, 2nd ed., Morgan Kaufmann, 2006 which will give you solid theoretical background for Data Mining (e.g. clustering, classification, rule mining). The second, very usefull, book Mining of Massive Datasets by J.Ullman. The greatest thing about this book, is that it is available online.    Embed Quote
