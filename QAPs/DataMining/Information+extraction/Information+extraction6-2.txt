★Will machine learning overtake heuristic/rule-based approaches in entity tagging/recognition and information extraction?Companies are adopting either machine learning or heuristic approaches to entity tagging and in general extraction of information from various kinds of documents/sources. Is there tangible evidence to claim that machine learning will overtake heuristic approaches to these technologies?
Companies work on real time data across different domains and source type(like email,mircoblog, forum etc) , its hard to train and maintain datasets in different domain in day to day work  as compared to tweaking gazetteer list and pattern based rules in   Heuristics based system like GATE(http://gate.ac.uk/ie/annie.html). I think  domain adaption and active learning approaches can sort out of problem to some extent. With the growth of ontology and semantic web, machine learning approaches will be helpful  to overcome problem of training data. But right now it easy to tweak heuristic based system with ontology.    Embed Quote
