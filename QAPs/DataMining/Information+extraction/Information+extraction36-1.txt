★How can I extract information from the Crunchbase API?I am interested in extracting company information from the Crunchbase API but am not a programmer. I know there is integration with Ruby on Rails but am having trouble getting started. Any help would be appreciated!
Paul's answer is absolutely correct and kudos to him for providing a code sample for Ruby. In addition to using the developer API to access the data programmatically, you can also download much of the data in an Excel spreadsheet that we update and publish monthly. In fact, it was last updated yesterday and can be found at the following URL: CrunchBase Data Exports    Embed Quote
