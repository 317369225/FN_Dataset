★Is Facebook extracting information from my phonebook and suggesting friends?Recently I have been observing friend suggestions on Facebook for people who do not have even one friend in common with me. However, I know the person and have the person's number saved in my phonebook. Also, this is a recent feature that I have observed and I believe it is after Facebook took over Whats app.
Yes, In the app permissions, you can see that Facebook can access your contact details and also if you've synced the contacts you've made it easy for them.    Embed Quote
