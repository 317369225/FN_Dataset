★Is it possible to extract information about the future from photons?
Er... yes. But it's not as exciting as you think. For example, let's consider a collection of photons which, when arranged on your retina, look like this: You have just learned something important about the future: there is a fist on a course which will, if you don't do anything about it, intersect your nose. That's news you can use: it's time to duck. That's the great thing about photons: since they travel at the speed of light, they bring information from your entire future "light cone": That contains everything that can conceivably affect you. Since nothing will travel faster than those photons, events outside the light cone can't ever affect you. The photon can, conversely, bring you at least some warning about the future. It's still up to you to use the information you get from that photon to build up a model of the world, and extrapolate that model forward, which is sometimes extraordinarily difficult or even impossible. But for a large category of events, "predicting the future" is not only possible, but an everyday operation. We call it "science": extrapolating the future from present data. Those photons are a key part of it, because we're able to use them to get the fastest conceivable information about distant things.    Embed Quote
