★How can I extract information from Quora?I am a grad student major in mis. I am going to do a BI analysis with Quora information (such as questions and answers, etc) as the raw resouces, but I find that Quora does not provide any API related to the information extraction, so I wonder whether there are other ways I can get the raw information from Quora.
