★Is it possible to extract information about the future from photons?
Lets look at this idea of photons being everywhere at the same time as mentioned above. The word 'instantaneous' in classical physics is replaced by the word 'simultaneous' in special relativity. Only here, it can depend on the relative motion between source and observers. Therefore, proper time for a photon; which is zero; simply means it is 'simultaneously' in two places at the same time; emitter and observer. Simultaneous means something different between different frames of reference. The speed of light, linking different space regions together is the closest thing we have to the classical notion of instantaneous. Instantaneous is an idea that sounds good but is another example of how much folly there is to devote onself solely to philosophy without emperical evidence from science - there can be no real or objective meaning to the word as far as nature herself is concerned.    Embed Quote
