★Is there an iOS API which can read (extract information) from the first-party (Apple) Notes or Reminders apps in iOS 5?Can developers make apps that can read (extract info) from the built-in Notes or Reminders apps in iOS 5? Also, can apps send location-based commands to the reminder?
There is no way for third party devs to read your Notes or Reminders. There is a backgrounding API that devs can use to have their app receive a notification that a "significant" location change has occurred, and respond accordingly, which might conceivably be used for location-based reminders.    Embed Quote
