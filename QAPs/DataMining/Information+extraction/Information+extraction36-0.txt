★How can I extract information from the Crunchbase API?I am interested in extracting company information from the Crunchbase API but am not a programmer. I know there is integration with Ruby on Rails but am having trouble getting started. Any help would be appreciated!
You can easily query the Crunchbase API using Ruby. However, before you starting making requests there are two things you need to do: Register for a Chrunchbase user account: http://developer.crunchbase.com/... Apply for a Crunchbase API Key: http://developer.crunchbase.com/...Once you've got your API Key, you can write a simple Ruby script that pulls information from the API. The following is a sample script for pulling all Crunchbase companies: 1

 require 'open-uri' require 'json' companies = Array.new result = JSON.parse(open("http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/companies.js?api_key=[Your API Key]").read) result.each do |company|   companies << company["name"] end print result To run this code, you can save it as 'script.rb' and enter ruby script.rb in your console. If you're interested, you can browse the CrunchBase Documentation for other routes, such as how to pull information on one single company or individual.    Embed Quote
