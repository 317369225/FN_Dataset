★Google: Is Google Shopping based on feeds or information extracted from web pages?
Google Shopping (formerly Google Product Search, formerly Froogle) is now a pay-to-play service. This changed in late 2012/early 2013. Merchants provide feeds or create product listings through AdWords. (Source: Google Product Search To Become Google Shopping, Use Pay-To-Play Model) In particular, Google says advertisers will provide data feeds or create product listings through Google AdWords, in campaigns that are set to run on Google Shopping. Other services do indeed extract data from product shopping pages in order to build a more inclusive catalogue.
