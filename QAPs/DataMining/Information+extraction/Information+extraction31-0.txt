★To an Amateur, what is the best explanation to 3D shape reconstruction using structured light method? How is depth information extracted exactly?
Structured light is light of a particular shape (usually horizontal bars or dots). When this light is incident on an object, it bounces back from the surface in a particular manner. By studying this pattern using sensors, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D scene. Now, the depth information is obtained the same way our human eye perceives depth. Closing one of our eye, we cannot perceive the depth of an object accurately. Similarly, the kinect has two color cameras at certain distance. The kinect first captures one image from one camera and the at the same instant captures the second image from the second camera. Now it detects the parallax displacement of the individual objects by comparing the two images. Objects closer to the kinect get displaced more, while the objects away form the kinect have less displacement. In this way, the depth information is extracted.    Embed Quote
