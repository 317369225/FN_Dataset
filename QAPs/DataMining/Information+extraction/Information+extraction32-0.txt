★What is the major problem, use or business case that Open Information Extraction (OIE) should solve? Which need or pain does or will it solve and for whom?
I am building a Named Entity Recognition and Context API - Ingen.io. Right now it works with data mainly from Freebase (limited and often outdated resource) which is in turn harvested from Wikipedia. The problem is that data is not only crowdsourced but also centralized. For a certain fact or relationship to be recorded in Wikipedia, respectively Freebase - it takes time and good will. OIE will solve this problem for us and allow us to extend our knowledge tremendously and in return be able to identify and disambiguate more accurately named entities in text. Just by browsing the topics and findings here: Open Information Extraction my mind is racing to so many business spheres that can benefit - Marketing, Advertising, etc.    Embed Quote
