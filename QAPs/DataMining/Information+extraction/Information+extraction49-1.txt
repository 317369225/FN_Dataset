Here is an example The topic is relevant to your question. Look at the example to see a number of arbitrary blue link documents that have been identified on a concept map as having information about Semantic Computing. The information contained in the arbitrary blue link has been identified and relevant sentences  machine extracted. One benefit is you can read information across many sources and compare them by meaning in terms of the concept. We are creating a structured semantic map of information contained in arbitrary docs covering every common area of knowledge.
