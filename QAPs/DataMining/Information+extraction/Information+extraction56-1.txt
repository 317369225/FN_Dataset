★What relevant information can be extracted from mobile phone picture metadata?
While there is not much metadata to be gleaned from smartphone pictures other than the date and location of the picture I am sure Google and Facebook will be able to make use of this in some way. This data would be one piece of a puzzle in a complex algorithm that would help predict what, when, and where advertisements or events would be the most appreciated or viewed in turn making these investments more profitable.    Embed Quote
