★Will machine learning overtake heuristic/rule-based approaches in entity tagging/recognition and information extraction?Companies are adopting either machine learning or heuristic approaches to entity tagging and in general extraction of information from various kinds of documents/sources. Is there tangible evidence to claim that machine learning will overtake heuristic approaches to these technologies?
One of the big arguments against machine learning is the amount of annotated data required to learn the contextual combination of features that characterize particular semantic entities. During my graduate research though I came across weakly-supervised methods that use a small set of words belonging to the same semantic category to extract contextual cues for that category.  These cues are then used to extract more instances of the category, which are then used to identify additional contextual cues and so on, until a vast number of instances are identified in context (see Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification by Collins et al.)  This seems like a very promising approach for named entity recognition that eliminates the need for extensive training sets. Collins et al reported 92% accuracy using their method, which is good enough for many information extraction applications. Bottom line machine learning will overtake rule-based approaches in entity recognition, particularly using these weakly or unsupervised algorithms.    Embed Quote
