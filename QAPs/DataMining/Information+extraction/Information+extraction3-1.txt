★What are the most powerful open source information extraction tools?What sort of information?  How is the data stored and formatted?
One of the things to look out for is flexibility in the tool: because data sources can be messy. So, at Scraperwiki, we let you code the scraper itself, then run it for you. This also means that others may have had a similar need, and written a tool to pull out very similar data. A few tweaks can let you pull it through. The data is sorted by the scraper itself, so you tell it how you want it organised, and it's stored in a simple, SQLite database—though you could pull it out in a number of formats (e.g. download as CSV), or access it via the API (have a look at my scraper here, with API docs: Documentation / Web API) We're working on an even more flexible platform in the coming weeks.    Embed Quote
