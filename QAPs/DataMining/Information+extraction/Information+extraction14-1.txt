★How well do Hierarchical CRFs perform for web information extraction, and are there better alternatives?Reference: research.microsoft.com/pubs/70300/tr-2006-69.pdf This paper details the use of Hierarchical CRFs to extract product name, image, description, price, etc. from html pages to build a product comparision engine. This approach performs both block detection and attribute labeling simultaneously.
You can use wrapper induction as an alternative approach. Wrapper induction technique (http://www.cs.washington.edu/hom... )     which  uses wrapper/template for information extraction. Wrapper  induction is used to automatically construct wrapper from web source. Wrapper induction algorithms use HTML/XML regularities, NLP techniques or taxonomy for constructing wrapper. (http://www.cs.sfu.ca/cc/470/qyan... ) would be helpful in understanding wrapper induction.    Embed Quote
