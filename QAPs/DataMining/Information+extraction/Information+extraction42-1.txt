★What is a rare corpus and how can information be extracted from them?Rare corpus means rare books here like books on mythology.
Rare Corpus simply means  "Rare Books". I was bit confused over the intended use but as you have cleared that you are working with "Text analysis" I am very sure this is exactly what it means. Strange way to put it but Rare Corpus (Books)  just means exactly that. Maybe they want you to look into old/rare books and how to extract information from them.    Embed Quote
