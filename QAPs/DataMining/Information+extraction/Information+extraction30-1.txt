★What is the best algorithm and method for close-domain question answering and information extraction?
You need some natural language processing first to crawl the webpage. After that, you need a bunch of generic data structures to hold any datum it can scrape off the web page. After that, you need some more NLP to process the question to get rid of the noise and get the core query. Given the many ways in which this data can be presented (even in a more or less formal document like Wikipedia articles), I'd suggest beginning with a very targeted approach (infoboxes only? just biographies? etc.) and then expand little by little.    Embed Quote
