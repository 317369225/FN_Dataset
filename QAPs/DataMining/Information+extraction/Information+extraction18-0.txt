★Which information extraction software or tools are most used in real businesses?Hi, I would like to kjnow which of the Information Extraction tools/ software are mostly used in applications for real business? I do not mean academic software or tools but tools which have already proven that they scale in a real business environment (like in social media monitoring, products reviews analysis etc...). Maybe you also know where one can find source code or demo? Best regards,
Our information extraction pipeline(s) (we have multiple, depending on what the extracted information is going to be used for) are mainly built in-house using Java. Our latest one uses UIMA with custom algorithms for the annotators (some based on well-known algorithms such as Negex, Medex, etc). For batch operations we are evaluating Storm. The previous pipeline that we built was pure Java (it used some NLP/ML libraries like OpenNLP and Weka) and used Akka for distributing the workload on a cluster - it also used Cassandra to store the inputs and intermediate results of extraction, and Solr to store the output.    Embed Quote
