★What is a rare corpus and how can information be extracted from them?Rare corpus means rare books here like books on mythology.
Rare Corpus is not exactly a day to day term in Data Science community, please cite any literature which uses the term if I am totally missing something out. I think meaning of rare corpus is a corpus where examples related to a query are less in number. So for example, I need to find a book like book A from set of all books in the world, where A belongs to a rare genre (say "Dothraki<or any other language with less speakers> detective"). Another problem would be say you enter a rare "Dothraki detective" phrase and you want to find books where it is mentioned. The first problem is problem of unbalanced classes in classification and has been studied by some scientists. The best (and most recent) work I can think of is by http://www.di.ens.fr/~grave/ . The second problem is actually trivial if you use a general search engine like solr, but when one tries to scale search engines up using surrogate queries or frequent n-grams, it might be hard to find bigrams from a rare set of documents.    Embed Quote
