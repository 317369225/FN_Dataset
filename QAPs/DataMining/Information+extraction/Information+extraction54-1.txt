★Is Facebook extracting information from my phonebook and suggesting friends?Recently I have been observing friend suggestions on Facebook for people who do not have even one friend in common with me. However, I know the person and have the person's number saved in my phonebook. Also, this is a recent feature that I have observed and I believe it is after Facebook took over Whats app.
Too Technical for me.    Embed Quote
