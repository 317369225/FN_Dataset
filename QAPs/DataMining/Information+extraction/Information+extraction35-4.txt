★Is it possible to extract information about the future from photons?
In a way yes, let's say the Sun disappears, that info would reach the Earth after 8.3 minutes, trouble is gravity would travel at more or less the same time, if it was somewhat slower, we on Earth would have known that we are in big trouble.    Embed Quote
