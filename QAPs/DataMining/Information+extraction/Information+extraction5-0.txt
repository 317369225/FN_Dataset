★What are the differences between Semantic Parsing and Information Extraction?Maybe in terms of: input and output steps involved
Semantic Parsing is a much harder task than Information extraction. It involves transforming natural language sentence into a meaningful representation(say first order logic) so that computer can understand. It involves finding relations in the  text. Semantic parsing is applied in Question answering systems like Watson, Text summarization tasks. These tasks often need to understand meaning of the text rather than just understanding grammar and syntactic features. This would also involve problems like word sense disambiguation where you would have multiple meanings for the same word(bank ->(financial institution, river bank)). Information Extraction is basically extracting meaningful data from text. Tasks like finding Dates, Email addresses, Phone numbers come under information extraction. You can do these tasks using a regular expression and other text processing tricks. In other words, Information Extraction could be used as a sub task  in Semantic Parsing.    Embed Quote
