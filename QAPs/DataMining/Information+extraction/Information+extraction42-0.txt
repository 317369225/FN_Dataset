★What is a rare corpus and how can information be extracted from them?Rare corpus means rare books here like books on mythology.
There are several things we need to define better before coming up with a good practical answer. Well, the question description mentions that by rare corpus, we mean rare books. We can assume that there are many terms (words) which are not popular in regular text, thus appearing as high IDF terms. Now next part is, what information do we really want to extract? Information Extraction is a huge field. This is like saying "Ohh it doesn't work? May be we should apply some computer science to it." Do we want to create a search/retrieval engine over it? Are we attempting to find named entities? Or do we need to extract action triplets in the form <Subject, Object, Verb>? Now assuming a rare corpus, we can believe that we won't get much benefit by trying to make use of publicly available knowledge bases. We may not even find regular NLP tools useful that work by making use of statistical analysis - though we might be able to fine-tune them for our benefit. Let's say you need an NER tool  (Named Entity Extraction). If the usual tools fail, you can annotate some data yourself (yes, manually) and create a model to fit with the regular tools. Triplet extraction techniques can work quite well if the grammar in your corpus is consistent with the grammar in regular use. Retrieval tools can work after some more effort with fine-tuning the scoring criteria, or building them yourselves (it's not hard). So stay open for some manual work as well. Good luck!    Embed Quote
