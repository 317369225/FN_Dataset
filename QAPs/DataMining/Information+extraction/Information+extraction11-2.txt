★How do you explain "information extraction" in layman's terms?
There are many forms of information extraction. You could be a data analyst, for example, or torturing possible terrorists to extract information. The form of information extraction that I do at work is transforming raw data into information. The data is often called information but it is really not if not seen in a broader context because of its dependencies to other data. Retrieving the data, making the connections and visualizing them is what I call information extraction. Data leads to information, that leads to knowledge, that leads to insight. For information extraction from possible terrorists I suggest you watch Zero Dark Thirty. You can extract a lot of information on the extraction of information by watching that movie.    Embed Quote
