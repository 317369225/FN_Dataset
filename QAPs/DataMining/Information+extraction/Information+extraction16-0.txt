★Why is semantic role labeling not popular in the information extraction field?
Semantic Role Labeling is not a tool, it is a problem. It is one problem from among the many problems targeted under the umbrella of Information Extraction. No article or paper will mention both Information Extraction and Semantic Role Labeling together (since it is usually understood that Semantic Role Labeling is an IE task). So, your search parameters while not being wrong is not optimal enough to find relevant results. Simply searching for "Semantic Role Labeling" or "FrameNet" or "PropBank" would have given you several relevant results.
