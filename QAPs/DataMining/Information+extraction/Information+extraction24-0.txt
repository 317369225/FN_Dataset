★Is there any way to put information extracted from OCR to different fields of a database?I have extracted the medical information from the medical report.. Now I want to store the name,date of checkup and other information into the database how can i extract the information and put them in correct fields?? Are there any APIs available for this purpose??
There are some information extraction which are trained on pubmed and medline clinical trials(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), MESH index(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh) and UMLS to extract medicine, symptoms, diseases and effectiveness. Some of these tools are Ytex(http://code.google.com/p/ytex/) Ytex uses apache  UIMA for information extraction, weka for machine learning and index documents. The tools is based on CTakes(http://ohnlp.sourceforge.net/). Ytec uses ms sql server to store documents and result. You can find database schema and query example in http://code.google.com/p/ytex/wi... MetaMap (http://mmtx.nlm.nih.gov/) is another biomedical information extraction, similar to Ytex. Kea(http://www.nzdl.org/Kea/download...) can be used to extract biomedical key phrases(http://www.nzdl.org/Kea/examples...)  I suggest you to store result in key value data store.  But you can also store result in database with following schema.  Docid, name entity type id, name entity, count . Here Docid is id for document Name Entity id  represents the type of named entity found, which includes drugs, disease, symtoms etc. Name entity:-  name of named entity found count:- count of named entity in document    Embed Quote
