★Will machine learning overtake heuristic/rule-based approaches in entity tagging/recognition and information extraction?Companies are adopting either machine learning or heuristic approaches to entity tagging and in general extraction of information from various kinds of documents/sources. Is there tangible evidence to claim that machine learning will overtake heuristic approaches to these technologies?
As Paul points out machine learning is used in information extraction and entity tagging as a way to build and refine heuristic approaches. The most critical part of the pipeline for information extraction is good training data and good feature engineering.   As for machine learning overtaking heuristic/rule-based approaches, I think its all about the right tool for the job. For example applications where one has a reasonably good dictionary of entities in unstructured data heuristics would be the right way to go. On the other hand if the raw data is too chaotic/complicated for a human to derive rules then machine learning would be the way to go.   However, leaving aside academic research, for any real world application of information extraction and entity tagging would be well served by using a hybrid methodology, that incorporates rule based and machine learning approaches where appropriate.    Embed Quote
