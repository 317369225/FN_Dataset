★Is it possible to extract information about the future from photons?
The answer is No, of course not.  Only in theory or in movies can this happen.  The future has not happened yet.  We can say we predict it, but in truth, we're only theorizing about what will probably happen.  Or we can make up some cool-looking images that explain it, but the'yre still theory because it hasn't been proven (nor is it likely to be.)    Embed Quote
