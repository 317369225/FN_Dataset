★Will machine learning overtake heuristic/rule-based approaches in entity tagging/recognition and information extraction?Companies are adopting either machine learning or heuristic approaches to entity tagging and in general extraction of information from various kinds of documents/sources. Is there tangible evidence to claim that machine learning will overtake heuristic approaches to these technologies?
It already has. When extracting or tagging free-form natural-language text, machine learning approaches dominate rule-based approaches and has for more than 10 years. One can verify this by looking at the performance of systems entered into shared tasks at TAC, ConLL, BioNLP, etc. Similarly, ML approaches dominate speech recognition, credit-card fraud detection, product recommendation, and most other problems where there is vast and noisy data. Heuristics are still important, however, because people must choose the features used by the ML algorithms.    Embed Quote
