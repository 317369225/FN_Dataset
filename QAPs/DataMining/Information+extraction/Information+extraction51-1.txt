★What are the possibilities of storing and extracting information in and from our brain?Like feeding it data through some device or extracting data?
Outside of the realm of sci-fi, certainly not currently possible. But given that the brain emits electric signals, there is certainly the possibility that these could be decrypted, extracted, stored and analysed...in some faroff future, if scientific advancement, study and innovation continues. I could imagine that to be done via some embedded microchip that is able to record all brain data directly in a manner that it can be understood in a similar manner to how cognitive processes understand sensory input. So like an external cognitive simulator. However, so far I as aware...there is nothing even close to any of these things even in a lab or even in principle using current science.    Embed Quote
