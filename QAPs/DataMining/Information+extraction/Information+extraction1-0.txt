★What is the current trend in information extraction?
I personally have never used either of these, but I would prefer to use a generic Semantic Role Labeling tool, based on the propbank corpus, as I can see how it could be used (I might use it in the Kaggle Word imputation competition, for example).  NELL I'm not too sure about - it has a large database of known facts (according to the website, currently 50 million), but how many of these are correctly known? And how would you use this in a project? This does not answer your question.  Both of these tools appear interesting, and suggest ways they can be used, but I don't know which is being used and by whom or where.    Embed Quote
