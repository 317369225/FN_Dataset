★Is information retrieval different from information extraction ? If yes, how?I recently came across a research paper in which these two terms were written and described as two different steps of an algorithm. Can someone please help me understand better about the difference between these two terms ? Thanks in advance.
Information Extraction means to extract structured information from structured or semi structured document. A classic example is to extract company details like company name, vacancy position, salary offered, prerequisites etc. from a natural language text. Another example:- extraction of name, email, address etc. from resume. Information Retrieval is retrieval of information (documents in most cases) to satisfy an information need. Information need is expressed in terms of queries. For example:- if you want to know about Barrack Obama, this is your information need. You form a query like "details about Barrack Obama(say)" and  you fire it on Google. Google retrieves documents related to Barrack Obama. This is information retrieval.    Embed Quote
