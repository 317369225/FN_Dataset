★What are the best schools for machine learning and information extraction?
A lot of courses (MOOC or traditional) are available in Europe too (UK: Glasgow, City University London, Goldsmith - University of London, Imperial College; France Telecom ParisTech, ECP) but many forget that a Data Scientist must be good at CS/IT and hard science but also at business applications and ethics & law. The latter is too often forgotten in the curricula, but it's a massive challenge for this discipline. Check us out at Data ScienceTech Institute, with our most intensive 1,600hrs MSc programmes , Data Scientist Designer (science background) and Executive Big Data Analyst (engineering and business backgrounds), in partnership with the likes of SAS France and KDnuggets (Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro) And because we care for CSR, we also provide a range of scholarships, covering from 50 to 100% of the tuitions fees. ;)    Embed Quote
