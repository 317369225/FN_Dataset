★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
There are a lot of good answers here so I will suggest this: Since you work at a nonprofit, see what you can get (in terms of infrastructure, software and services) for little or no money. Software vendors will often give deep discounts to charities or nonprofits, and there are a lot of professionals and consultants who are interested in doing pro bono consulting work. Try to find someone who is interested in whatever cause or demographic your organization supports and ask them if they would be willing to contribute their time to help your organization.    Embed Quote
