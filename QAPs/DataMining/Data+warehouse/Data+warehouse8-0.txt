★What is the process involved in building a data warehouse?
To build a data warehouse, you first need to copy the raw data from each of your data sources, cleanse, and optimize it. The process of getting data into a data warehouse is called ETL: Extract, Transform, Load. 1. Extract the data from the source system. One of the primary challenges is that you’ll need to avoid copying all the data every time you sync. Some of your data sources could have millions or billions of records, and copying every record during every sync isn’t a good idea. This optimization is when data extraction becomes complicated. 2. Transform the data. In this step, data is cleansed, denormalized, and pre-calculated so that it’s ready for analysis. Cleansing the data means that you resolve any inconsistencies (i.e., links that have been tagged in different ways, or order statuses that have been tracked differently over time). Denormalizing optimizes the data warehouse’s ability to read data, and pre-calculations include the calculations that you know you’ll need frequently. 3. Load the transformed data into the warehouse. Once your data is loaded into your warehouse, it’s officially ready for analysis. You can query it directly via SQL, or you can work with it in a business intelligence tool.    Embed Quote
