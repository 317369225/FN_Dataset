★Is it a good idea to build a data warehouse on NoSQL database?With massive data to analysis, In my opinion, maybe its a good start to do data warehousing on big data platform, in this case, certainly on nosql database. I know its different, not an apple to apple between big data and data warehouse in analytics matter, but, with latest technology stack on hadoop ecosystem, is it possible to bring this solution? datawarehouse on nosql?
I'm afraid it's not good idea just yet. I think analytics tools cannot use HBase efficiently, for they are all based on SQL:/ To be more specific, Pentaho claims great performance with Hadoop. But in my experience, their analytics is optimized for Oracle:) I lack first-hand experience with Pentaho/Hadoop though, so I hope someone can give us more insight.    Embed Quote
