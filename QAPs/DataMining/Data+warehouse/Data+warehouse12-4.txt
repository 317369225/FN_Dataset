★Why should I use an existing ETL vs writing my own in Python for my data warehouse needs?I've been reading the Kimball Group Reader and they strongly recommend I use an existing ETL. Looking at solutions such as Kettle, SnapLogic, and Talend it seems their GUIs complicate the solution instead of making it easier to model and understand.
Hard to answer without knowing your exact needs, but assuming your time is valuable, seems like you would have to re-invent much of what is in existing ETL tools before you even had a good viable solution.  At a previous job, we did in fact write the entire system in Python.  Using an existing tool this time around has allowed us to get things done far more quickly than before, and scale the work to more (non-programmer) users.    Embed Quote
