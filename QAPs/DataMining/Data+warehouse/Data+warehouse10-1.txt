★What is the best data warehouse product/service for a startup?Should one build a bespoke architechture? Zoho Reports? Private SQL Server?
There is actually a fairly simple answer to this question. First of all though let's get some assumptions out of the way: > You know what a data warehouse is and know that you want one. > You are willing to trade a few rough edges for performance. > You have a strong bias for open source. > You have a working familiarity with MySQL. If you agree with my assumptions then you should use the Infobright storage engine for MySQL as your database and you should use Pentaho Data Integration for your ETL processing to populate the database. Infobright Community Edition is a columnar storage engine that compresses the stored data an will outperform standard MySQL InnoDB by about 10x on analytic queries. Alternatives to consider here are InfiniDB (also MySQL but strange license) and LucidDB (good license, not MySQL based). Pentaho Data Integration is actually one of the best ETL tools on the market at any price and it's free! It also has a very strong community that can help you out with issues. To top it all off you can write your own components in the language of you choice. Other tools make claims to better absolute speed but PDI offers a built in scale out capability that is unmatched (IMHO). Alternatives to consider is Talend (good license, less user friendly, smaller community).    Embed Quote
