★What is the best data warehouse product/service for a startup?Should one build a bespoke architechture? Zoho Reports? Private SQL Server?
There are some good answers here. Joe's is particularly good in that it proposes the solution that minimizes cost but maximizes functionality--clearly a priority for a startup who wants to generate value from data. My answer is totally biased, but it comes from a deep experience and research on the industry. I'm on the exec team at RJMetrics, and we are absolutely the data warehouse of choice for small, high-growth online businesses. I joined the company because I was a user of, and believer in, the product. I ran analytics for a high-growth SaaS company that you've probably heard of based in NYC. Our biggest limitation at that point was time, not money--we didn't have time to write tons of SQL or to stitch together different pieces of technology for ETL and warehousing and visualization. We didn't have time to maintain servers or ETL cron jobs. I've done three startups now, and I'd always say that time was always a bigger limiting factor than money. If you're spending time on something you don't have to, you're doing it wrong. At RJMetrics, we manage every aspect of the analytics stack for you. Connect your data sources and we'll replicate the data, cleanse and optimize it, load it into a warehouse powered by Amazon Redshift, and then give you a visualization layer to build whatever analyses you want. We'll get you implemented in 7 days and zero investment on your part (free trial!). And all of this is completely customized for your business and particular dataset. You can do a lot of this with open source software and a lot of elbow grease and custom code. But...IMO, that's not a great business decision. Spend your time building your product and finding customers.    Embed Quote
