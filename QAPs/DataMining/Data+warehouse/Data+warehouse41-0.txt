★What is the tipping point from using databases to using a data warehouse for reporting?
Unfortunately, the answer really is it depends on data creation (data being input into the database), reporting needs, volume of data, and database design patterns.  Eventually, you will likely get to a point where: generating reports will be cumbersome given the normalization of the database; reports and/or input will be adversely affected due to balancing efficiency of inputs vs. speed of reporting (in form of locking, indexes, disk activity, joins, aggregation); you start to use off-the-shelf OLAP or ad hoc reporting tools that are optimized for data warehouse schemas (e.g., star schema or snowflake schema) At that point, you will need to do the cost vs. benefit analysis of whether it is time to invest in a data warehouse tool (or build your own).  I don't know if any "models" exist for this, though I'd be suspect that a generic one would fit all the parameters that should be used for such a definition.  I guess if you want to use "tipping point" here, I'd say when 80% of your processing resources are consumed by reporting needs in a transactional database, it may be the "tipping point" to a data warehouse...though that is a very forced definition.    Embed Quote
