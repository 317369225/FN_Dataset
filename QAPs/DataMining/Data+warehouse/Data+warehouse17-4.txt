★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
You seem poised to create an endless trail of dependent DWH's - that is, you'll need a DWH to manage your DWH, and another one to manage that one, on and on. I defer to Anthony Sutcliffe's answer: an SaaS company should not on its face have data growth rates that spill over past the capacity of simple data management models to contain and use them. I might look at the assumption that the cure is a DWH implementation and not better data prioritization practices. Determine what's important, objectively, and choose a model that manages that first and foremost. Beyond this, unless you want to change from a SaaS to a DWH company, use the expertise of others rather than becoming your own consulting and provider. Getting rid of Excel, etc is something to do first, so that at least you're not dealing with mountains of garbage data. Excel is a spreadsheet tool, not a database tool. You can use it to lay out web pages if you like, but the only people who would are people who don't know any other way to do it. In general I'd advise you use a CRM for your CRM, an ERP for your ERP, a helpdesk system for your helpdesk, etc - and a DWH leader as your DWH. And they can talk to each other if you're using systems that will keep you ahead in 2014.    Embed Quote
