★Do you prefer data warehouse or Hadoop for big data process?I find traditional data warehouse users would not accept Hadoop due to its hard coding and debugging, but without it, how do you deal with big data problems now? Do you have to scaling up the database/DW continuously due to the growing data size and high concurrency?
So a "data warehouse" is a service that can answer questions about data, and Hadoop is a technology family that can be used as a part of a data warehouse. Traditional data warehouses are backed by an RDBMS such as Oracle, and have some known limitations around scalability, while Hadoop scales very well horizontally: need to handle more data? Add more machines. If the amount of your data and processing requirements, are increasing, it is possible that they will exceed the limitations of the existing data warehouse hardware; you can only add so much RAM and so many cores to your big iron database server, before you resort to sharding and other expensive, complicated techniques. So the answer to your question is, "yes". If you don't want to embrace a distributed, clustered, fault-tolerant, scalable system like Hadoop, you're going to be stuck with scaling up vertically. As for building a hadoop-centric data warehouse, it's not a simple task. And people who can work with Hadoop are in high demand, currently. But there are companies out there that specialize in this sort of thing (WibiData comes to mind).    Embed Quote
