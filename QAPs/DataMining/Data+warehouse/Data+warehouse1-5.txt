★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
There are some good suggestions here. To these I would add, invite in the usual BI folks -- Tableau, QlikView, Tibco Spotfire, Microstrategy, and a Microsoft reseller who knows PowerPivot. You might be surprised by the results you get from a fast prototyping exercise. Your data volume and source variety is modest by today's standards and you don't need a bleeding edge solution - though sometimes those are more fun. I never did a QlikView project with fewer than 10 data sources; a typical QlikView analyst can merge structured sources like that in days or hours without the organizational footprint of a DW. It will depend on a better understanding of your requirements.    Embed Quote
