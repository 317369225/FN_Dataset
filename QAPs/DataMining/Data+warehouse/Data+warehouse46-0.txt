★What are Good books on Data warehouse that refreshes concepts?I am looking for a book that refreshes data warehouse concepts. I am not particular about the technology that the book is based on, I would prefer if it is not too much tied to the a particular technology. Best would be a book that talks about concepts, and alongside gives real life problems faced or seen by the other. What are the best books for this topic?
The Data Warehouse toolkit, 3rd Edition. This is the latest update from Ralph Kimball. I had the first edition and recently bought this one to see what the latest best practices are.    Embed Quote
