★What is a career for a female in the data warehouse field?Especially SSIS, SSAS, SSRS. Is it true that you will not be able to settle down like doctors in later years of your life (after 40) and you have to constantly keep on looking for new contracts?
I'm a female database administrator, over 40, working at the same awesome company for over 8 years (and in this career for over 15), married and raising two children, one of whom has special needs.  There is nothing about being female that has set me back, although having children has taken time from both my husband's and my regular workday - which it should, if you're doing it right.  I tend to work more off-hours to make up for any time lost, but I consider that a positive that my work environment lets me. I can't say that there is no difference being female or male in this career, but I can tell you that being female, being a mother, or being married has never held me back professionally.  Being dyslexic probably has, though... :) I think it's a disservice to frame your question based around your sex.  You can do anything you put your mind to - there is nothing genetically or socially (if you're in the US) that will hold you back.  Just make sure you have a solid understanding of relational theory, a good grasp of what your tools are doing underneath your GUI (especially with Microsoft products!), and know your business and its data.    Embed Quote
