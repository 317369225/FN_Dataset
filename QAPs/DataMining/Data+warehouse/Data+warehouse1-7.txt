★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
Some new paradigms of build a data warehouse. 1. Build a Logical Data Warehouse using Data Virtualization and Data Federation technologies like Composite software.  Leave data where it is .i.e Do not ETL. Trying to come up to a one schema that can represent the needs of the Enterprise can be a 3-5 yr project. 2.  Use a Hadoop + NoSQL approach. i.e dump all your data into a good folder structure , Use Hive for once in a while queries , Use NoSQL based datamarts for fast queries. Now - the NoSQL databases are not fully there yet. So might want to wait for another year for them to evolve. Use Hadoop for ETL to datamarts 3.  Move to the Cloud if you can - either use products like GoodData or Use Amazon redshift    Embed Quote
