★Does big data threaten the traditional data warehouse / business intelligence model / stack?
I think they do two different things.  An EDW solution allows users to write algorithms that give very precise answers.  The downfall is that there algorithms tend to be computationally intensive which limits the amount of data that can be churned through.  Big data has the ability to churn through huge volumes of data but precision is sacrificed.  Big data is highly effective for trend analysis, improving customer experience and other types of process.  EDW type analytics are good for fraud detection, predicting values with granularity down to the unit, etc.  These ought not be thought of as an either or scenario.  Both work well in conjunction.  Big data platforms can reduce the workload of EDW and increase efficiency in trending type tasks.  Big data platforms can also narrow down where to look for things allowing the analyst to refine the EDW algorithms further because the data load will be reduced. Regarding the second part of your question.  EDW and Big data platforms aren't getting their data from the same pool.  EDW data is typically structured transactional or master data.  Big data platforms are primarily pulling unstructured and semi-structured data into the mix.    Embed Quote
