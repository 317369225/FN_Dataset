★Why should I use an existing ETL vs writing my own in Python for my data warehouse needs?I've been reading the Kimball Group Reader and they strongly recommend I use an existing ETL. Looking at solutions such as Kettle, SnapLogic, and Talend it seems their GUIs complicate the solution instead of making it easier to model and understand.
Unless you want to enter the Tel software market, you will spend a lot of time writing software instead of migrating / managing data (which I am assuming is your real job). If this tool is going to be used by many developers in an enterprise setting, you will spend a lot of time writing code to manage the etl code. Probably more than you think This is classic buy over build ... buy because there are people dedicated to solving issues you haven't even thought of yet. Build if your needs are so unique that there isn't a solution out there (extremely rare)    Embed Quote
