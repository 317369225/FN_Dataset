★Do you prefer data warehouse or Hadoop for big data process?I find traditional data warehouse users would not accept Hadoop due to its hard coding and debugging, but without it, how do you deal with big data problems now? Do you have to scaling up the database/DW continuously due to the growing data size and high concurrency?
It depends on the requirement. Answers are limited to non-OLP use cases. At least for today, scalable options for traditional RDMS backed data warehouses exists. So if your ecosystem of users and applications are built around that then I will stick to it but work in horizontal scalability. In some cases, if trade offs can be made a No SQL option can also be considered if the cost of migration makes sense. For dealing with unstructured data and working with them, I would go with an HDFS/Hadoop approach. This provides the greatest flexibility when keeping data in its rawest unstructured form. I can build some structure into with tools like HBase, Hive and friends. The major trade off is that it needs to be carefully designed as queries are unlikely to be returned in real time. In some cases, a hybrid is taken. Raw logs and data stored in HDFS/Hadoop exposed via Hive and Sqooped to an RDMS for use. Doing analytics on an RDMS is more convenient as a lot of tool and expertise exist. But, HDFS/Hadoop allows me to store more cost effectively.    Embed Quote
