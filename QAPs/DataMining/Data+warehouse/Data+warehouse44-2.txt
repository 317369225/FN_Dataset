★What is the difference between a distributed database system  and a centralized data warehouse?answers for non-software engineers
They are two very different things: A distributed database is a system where different parts of the database are distributed at different locations. You need some clever technology to keep the parts of the database synchronised across locations. A data warehouse is a database which is designed for analysing data and making decisions; centralised means its is located in one place. I don't know of any data warehouses that are distributed.    Embed Quote
