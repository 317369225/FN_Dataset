★Is it a good idea to build a data warehouse on NoSQL database?With massive data to analysis, In my opinion, maybe its a good start to do data warehousing on big data platform, in this case, certainly on nosql database. I know its different, not an apple to apple between big data and data warehouse in analytics matter, but, with latest technology stack on hadoop ecosystem, is it possible to bring this solution? datawarehouse on nosql?

So you can now do a Data Warehouse running SQL on Hadoop.   SQL is too common a language in the business for it to die on the vine. More and more technologies are adding the ability to do SQL in the Hadoop ecosystem    Embed Quote
