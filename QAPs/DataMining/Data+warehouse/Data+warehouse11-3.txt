★What is the difference between a database and data warehouse?Why should I have a separate database and data warehouse?
Data warehouse is generally for huge storage of historical records It is used for reporting purposes whereas database is for current day to online transaction processing. Normally, the data in data warehouse is not supposed to be updated only inserts should happen into data warehouse Ideally, the current data should become part of data warehouse, after some pre-decided time period, after which it will only be used for analysis purpose and not for transactions. Most important difference between them is: in Database, data is normally kept in normalized format whereas in data warehouse, it is purposely De-normalized to avoid joins while generating huge reports to save time.    Embed Quote
