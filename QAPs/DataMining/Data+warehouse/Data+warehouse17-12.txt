★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
You've received a wealth of knowledge and insights here. One more thought: the foundation of great information systems (transaction & analytics) is information architecture. ex: customer-order-product-source-purchase etc. Your role is to lead the organization's definition of its architecture. What are you recording and how do you want to report/analyze it? Start at the top with what questions the business needs to answer. That will drive your architecture. You'll see the missing integration and solve that as you build your dw.  Like any good blueprint, your architecture will let you build things in 'chunks'/modules in accordance with your organization's goals/needs. The first resource you want to contract for is a data warehouse architect - with a limited deliverable: a data architecture design (blueprint) for you to build from. Yes, find a smart resource who has done it successfully before. We are few but super cost effective in the long run. Have fun. This is a great business leadership opportunity for IT professionals!    Embed Quote
