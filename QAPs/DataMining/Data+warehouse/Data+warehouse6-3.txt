★Are there any practical (near) real-time data warehouse solutions?And how do they work compared to a classical data warehouses, batch analytics platforms like Hadoop and stream processing engines like Storm or S4.
It depends on what you mean by 'real-time' and what you mean by 'data warehouse'. By real-time, do you mean the ingestion rate, and therefore the latency or freshness of data, or do you mean the ability to query and get results in real-time, and are those query pre-canned or ad-hoc?  Or some combination of both of the above? By data warehouse do you mean something like the traditional definition which would be a central repository of data from different sources, containing current and historical data, and used for decision support?  Or just a store of data, relaxing the rules around conformed dimensions and referential integrity. There are solutions available across the whole spectrum, starting with super low latency CEP type systems like Storm, offering super low latency actions on current data.  Through caching layers which still have low latency but possibly access to more data.  Key value stores that can do range scans like MogoDB  Down to modern, columnar high performing databases such as Vertica, Redshift, Paraccel or similar products using in-memory databases or similar like Exasol. We're assuming you meant big data too since you mentioned Hadoop but at smaller volumes, products like  SQL Server will do very low latency data warehousing.  SQL Server is used by F1 teams for in-car telemetry with very low latency ingestion and querying requirements. Sorry I haven't outlined the answer for you, but hopefully if you're looking for a solution, this has given you a more to think on to help you refine your requirements.    Embed Quote
