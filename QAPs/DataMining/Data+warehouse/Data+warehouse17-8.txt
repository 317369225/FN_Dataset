★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
NoSQL databases generally scale better, but SQL databases generally provide better querying capabilities. ETL by definition creates copies of data, usually devoid of a lot of context. Instead of building a traditional data warehouse consider exposing data from source systems in an uniform manner, then utilize in-house BI or cloud-based analytics services. Utilizing an HTTP web service (API) to data will work for both internal and cloud approaches. For MongoDB you can utilize a REST wrapper (HTTP Interface), while for relational databases, SlashDB (Home) is a very good option. For full disclosure, I work on SlashDB.    Embed Quote
