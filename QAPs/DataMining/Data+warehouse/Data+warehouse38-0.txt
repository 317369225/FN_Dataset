★At what size (number of employees) does a business typically invest in building a data warehouse?I'm trying to understand when businesses begin making the big investment of building their own data warehouse and staffing a team interanlly with architects and analysts. I need to understand "when" in terms of size and I need to measure size in number of employees.
Actually, the size (number of employees)  does not matter. A better indicator of when to invest in a data warehouse is whenever the business has a necessity and is ready to measure its key metrics. For example, while at Netflix, the data warehouse team was there from its early days. While the team remained small for the first few years, we were pretty much measuring all aspects of the business. The management had the foresight to believe in the power of data and invested early. As a member of its early DW team, I can vouch that w/o this, they would not have been as successful. My recommendation is that every business should start growing its analytic arm as soon as possible. This is so very true in the internet era.    Embed Quote
