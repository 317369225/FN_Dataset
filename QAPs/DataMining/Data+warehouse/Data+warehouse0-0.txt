★What is a data warehouse?
Data Warehouse is simply a database. But what makes it different from transactional Database is because it's designed for analytical purpose. A good Transactional Database shall be normalized into separate relational tables (to reduce redundancy), but this condition can become a disadvantage when we want to analyze the data by querying many relational tables. The query will take much resource and long time to finish (especially when you want to build dynamic report with many dimensions *read it: Business Intelligence). So a man named William Harvey Inmon came up with an idea to rebuild the structure of the database by denormalize the relational tables into a simple schema called Star Schema. The star schema itself is later called the Data Warehouse and the process to get the data from Transactional Database, denormalize the data, clean and harmonize it and then insert it on Star Schema's Tables is called  ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Loading).    Embed Quote
