★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
I'll do it for 1.5 million..   just kidding.   I'd stay away from Hadoop - doesn't sound like you have the data volumes that would warrant a Hadoop cluster.   You ultimately need a data model to put the data together, and then some way to access the various data. Could be as simple as an excel with links, could be as complex as a full blown data warehouse.   I would recommend looking at Amazon's Redshift (as other's have suggested), but try and get a data modeler consultant to come in and build you a data model for your data first.    Embed Quote
