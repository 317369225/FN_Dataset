★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
As people have already said multiple times, this is too complex and case-specific to answer here. Also, any answer would require more information than has been provided. So, let me provide you with a short answer that is only slightly facetious: Hire someone who has seen it done before. There are enough companies in this space now that there are a number of people who have done this before in all of the standard tech centers - the Valley, Boston, London, New York, etc. Usually the person who did it may be tough to get - they are senior players in a company that may be doing well, but they will have direct reports who were part of the process, saw where it went wrong and where it went right. That is the person you want - they are highly experienced (and this is one of those areas where experience and feel often trumps raw book knowledge) and they are motivated to build their own system. They won't be cheap, of course, but this is such a critical part of your business that that should not matter.    Embed Quote
