★At what size (number of employees) does a business typically invest in building a data warehouse?I'm trying to understand when businesses begin making the big investment of building their own data warehouse and staffing a team interanlly with architects and analysts. I need to understand "when" in terms of size and I need to measure size in number of employees.
With Amazon EC2/S3, building a data warehouse doesn't really require a lot of hardware startup cost or a big team dedicated to maintaining the database and doing analysis. What you really need is ONE capable developer who understands the gist of your business. This person should be able to develop the process to upload the data onto S3, come up with the Hive schema to describe your data, generate summaries from your data on a regular basis, and build dashboards to track the core metrics for your business.  This sounds like a lot of work but with Amazon EC2/S3, elastic map/reduce and  the typical LAMP stack, all of these can fall into one person and can be done within 2 months.  (Note: this doesn't include the time to download your original data. If you have a huge database to start with, say 10TB, it's going to take a while for you to download all of the data and port them into S3. ) In the case of Khan Academy, we actually have our analytics code open sourced. You can refer to https://github.com/Khan/analytic... to witness how a data warehouse can be built with just a few thousand lines of really simple code. Since the warehouse is built in early summer 2012, we have had quite a few applications and dashboards coming out of it. It's really really powerful and I recommend people to start building their data warehouse as early as they feel knowing the overall picture of their business will help them make superior strategic decisions on their products and user growth. You might have to hire one more person to do it but it will be worth it most of the time.    Embed Quote
