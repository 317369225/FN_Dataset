★Why are data warehouse appliances so popular?If you have a good team of sysadmins and DBAs why wouldn't a normal set of hardware and software work just as well as an appliance? Also, with an appliance, aren't you limiting your expansion options?
I want to second everything Steve said.  I think that a built from scratch approach is only appropriate when you are also building the business from scratch.  In my experience the use of an appliance occurs when an existing business realizes they have multiple data bases, often hidden data bases such as random Access and .xls files on desk tops that need to be accessible.  In this situation an appliance is easy.  It would be impossible to expect any in house IT group to create ETL software from scratch, it is difficult to expect in house IT groups to develop a post hoc data model that will allow for clear linking and translation/transgeneration of data from various sources and source types into a well ordered data warehouse.  This is why IBM, Oricle, Taradata etc. can provide a well tested solution in the form of a data warehouse appliance.  I suppose the final reason that businesses buy the appliance is the ease of hiring a temporary army to just get it done.    Embed Quote
