★Why are the operational system keys not recommended for forming data warehouse primary keys?
A few of reasons... What if you have multiple source systems populating the same table?  There exists the chance that those two operational systems have overlapping keys.  Your ETL will break once those keys overlap as the Primary Key will be violated. A lot of times, your operational system key (or natural key) is a composite key (multiple columns). Unless your source system used intelligence surrogate keys, neither could your warehouse.  IE, the primary key in most date dimensions is just the date in number format YYYYMMDD, or something similar.  This is handy to use because you don't have to perform any kind of lookup or join operation on your dimension to know its key. Performance.  Its much faster to define a single numeric column in each table to perform table joins (especially because your indexes will be smaller on disk and less prone to any kind of data skew if you use an auto-incrementing number).  They will be much slower if you have to join to multiple fields in each table.  And your fact tables could start to get quite big and confusing if each dimension it joins to has multiple fields making up its key.    Embed Quote
