★Does big data threaten the traditional data warehouse / business intelligence model / stack?
I think you are missing a key part of the BI paradigm - self service.  A properly designed Business Intelligence system is designed to be used by consumers of the data for both ad hoc queries and canned reporting.  One of the beautiful things about Kimball Methodology is that the Star Schema is immediately intuitive to people who may understand how to use data, but don't necessary understand data structures. Even though there are packages like Hive for Hadoop, the NOSQL databases are still a long way away from having the breadth of end-user oriented tools that traditional Relational Databases have for them. The key to building any system is to understand that there is a time and place to use any toolset.  Being pragmatic is always better than being dogmatic.    Embed Quote
