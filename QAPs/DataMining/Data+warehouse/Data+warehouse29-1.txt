★Is Data Warehouseing necessary for a business intelligence service?It seems like GoodData, Domo, RJMetrics and others have recreated most of the traditional BI stack just in the cloud. Is there a better way?
I believe the answer to this question is the consultant's answer to every question: It depends. A traditional data warehouse architecture usually includes a place to stage, transform, and serve enterprise wide data.  Data from its upstream systems is manipulated and loaded into a format conducive to analytic reporting.  This will also often times include things like joining disparate sets of data.  Any SaaS solution would need to be able to replicate the flexibility an in-shop warehouse provides. While there are some good SaaS BI solutions out there, a few things to consider are: Unless you're willing/able to build out dedicated network pipes to your SaaS provider, you're at the mercy of whatever network performance the internet will give you.  If your current warehouse processes 100's of gigs or more a day, this can be an issue (unless all your upstream sources are hosted by the same provider as your BI). Sometimes BI reports will include data external to the warehouse.  This is why many BI tools can federate data from multiple sources into a single semantic layer.  This presents a challenge with an SaaS solution that can't do something like read a spreadsheet from an internal network share or integrate with your OLAP tools. As with all SaaS software, you lose a lot of control over the upgrade/release cycles.  This can be problematic if you have code that is using features that are being deprecated.    Embed Quote
