★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
Not sure if you ever chose an offering here, I came across your question via a Google search, but we offer a Cloud based analytics engine that can be accessed via font-end solutions like Excel, Power bI, Tableau, QlikTech etc. Without knowing all of your details I would estimate an intial set-up of a system being in the $20,000 range and then a monthly usage fee of around $1,000 to $1,500. Plus you would need something like Tableau and/or Excel for your users, so maybe about $10K if you go Tableau for all 5.
