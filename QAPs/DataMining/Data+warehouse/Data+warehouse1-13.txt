★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
here is a more agile/less money wasting option: - build an operational data store (ods), which is a db server that has the databases and tables you need all on one server. This can be in the cloud on Redshift or Google Cloud SQL or on a machine in your office. You can use an open source db like MariaDB and an open source tool like Talend or Pentaho for the ETL (getting it from the source to your machine) - create views across dbs and tables to see the data you want and expose them with a reporting tool if needed. check out spagoBI, it is open source. - create aggregate tables for data that is easy to query but the query runs too long. - create fact tables for data aggregation that is not easy to express with sql such as needing to compare a previous version to current version and create deltas. This fact table can be made first with only source pkeys and put a view on it to show details. This is a good way to get the details flushed out before creating dimensions - create dimensions for data that history will be lost. This will be a slowly changing dimension that saves history. As time goes by, you will end up with more dimensions and will get to a point that you have a fully built cube, but it doesn't have to start that way and is actually a waste of time and money if you don't know exactly what you need. When you talk to visualization vendors, they will all be hoping you have a data warehouse and cubes built, because that will make their tool work easily. If not, then after you pay you will find out that there is a lot of work to do. This goes against most data warehouse experts advice, but building a minimum viable product and building on it over time does not fit most vendors project or profit schedules, so they will naturally not like that idea.    Embed Quote
