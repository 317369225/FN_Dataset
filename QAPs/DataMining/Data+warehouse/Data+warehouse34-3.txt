★How valuable is the CBIP (certified business intelligence professional) certification from The Data Warehouse Institute (TDWI) ?
Loretta - I completely agree with your take.  Especially for us who entered the DW/BI space before there was much formal education, I viewed these certifications as a badge of honor ... a mark of those who had spent a lot of time in the trenches but had also bothered to learn and understand best practice.  Certifications in general can sometimes say little about whether a person can execute.  Some of the technology specific certifications can get stale as soon as the next version of the tool comes out or an individual has stopped working in that space for some time.  To maintain a CDMP or CBIP, one has to continue their education.  I think that gives some indication of the level of their professionalism.  Why is it few ever question the value of a PMP?    Embed Quote
