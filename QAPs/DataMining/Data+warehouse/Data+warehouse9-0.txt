★What are the scalability limits of existing data warehouse products?From what I've heard Teradata, Netezza, Grenplum, Vertica, Aster, RAC, and SQL server at most scale to 2PB.  Most hit scalability limits well before this.  Read-mostly parallel databases should be able to scale to hundreds of servers, so why do these systems not scale that high?
Those aren't all the same thing. Oracle RAC isn't shared-nothing, although Exadata gets some of the shared-nothing benefits. Microsoft's shared-nothing offering is very immature, as it was based on the troubled DATAllegro acquisition. Anyhow, Teradata has scaled to well over 2 PB of user data at eBay, as per http://www.dbms2.com/2010/10/06/... Netezza is said to be over 2 PB at Catalina Marketing. Greenplum and Aster have had somewhat more trouble with extreme scaling; perhaps they still assign work in overly large chunks to the instances of PostgreSQL on each node.    Embed Quote
