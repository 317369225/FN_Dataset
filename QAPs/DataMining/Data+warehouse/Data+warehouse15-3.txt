★How does the rising popularity of Hadoop impact legacy data warehouse vendors like Teradata?
All of the customers I interact with have some sort of EDW project either stood up or under development... some with more success than others.  The places I see Hadoop and EDWs intersecting are ETL/staging/data cleansing sorts of work, or archiving older data.  One customer I know of estimated that they were using up around 20-25% of their Teradata environment for ETL & data staging, and they have decided that they would rather shift that workload to Hadoop versus having to spend more money to add to their Teradata environment.  Pick the right tool for the right job.  Hadoop and the applications that run on top of it work very well for certain types of data processing tasks, and the much lower cost model versus traditional RDBMS's is making it very appealing.  As the Hadoop ecosystem continues to evolve I think we'll see more and more work moving there.  Existing EDW implementations aren't going anywhere, but I believe more and more new EDW-like projects will move workloads to the most cost-effective environment.  In many cases, that will be Hadoop.    Embed Quote
