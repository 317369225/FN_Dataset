★Which is the best open source/ free database management system for building a data warehouse?What is the best data warehousing / OLAP solution present in opensource and used by big companies?
I believe the definition of best must be defined by the one that meets business needs.  To do that in data warehousing I will say it is always about the people who design and build it and not about the technology. Find someone who is great at data warehousing and pick what they like and not what the CTO read about last month in some magazine.  If you limited me only to opensource technology I could easily handle most petabyte data warehouse requirements with just git, postgres, python and Memcached.  Especially if I was allowed to solve many of the DevOps support problems with AWS.  AWS is not required for me but I often find organizations who want to start a data warehouse did not know that they were not ready to support the hardware requirements needed for a data warehouse.   That seems to be even more true in the open source world.  Data  warehousing in the cloud also saves a lot of money because buying/maintaining data warehouse sized hardware in triplicates (or more) is a waste when compared to the pay for what you use cloud model.    Embed Quote
