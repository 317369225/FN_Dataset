★Why should I use an existing ETL vs writing my own in Python for my data warehouse needs?I've been reading the Kimball Group Reader and they strongly recommend I use an existing ETL. Looking at solutions such as Kettle, SnapLogic, and Talend it seems their GUIs complicate the solution instead of making it easier to model and understand.
Note: this answer was written in 2010. Much has changed that makes Python more attractive today. I don't think a tool like Kettle is attractive for the GUI, which is more marketing than anything else... However, these tools do a few things that are difficult: (1) External-memory algorithms... Unless all your data files fit in RAM, Python will give you trouble once you start doing fancy things. (2) Parallel processing... Python, as far as I know, is just not great at multithreading... but if you have 4 or 6 processors on your machine, then you really want to use them all to process the data. Maintainability is a non-issue. Python can be just as maintainable as any ETL tool. If you work for a company that can't hire another Python guy, then change job.    Embed Quote
