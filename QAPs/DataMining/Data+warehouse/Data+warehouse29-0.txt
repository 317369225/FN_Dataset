★Is Data Warehouseing necessary for a business intelligence service?It seems like GoodData, Domo, RJMetrics and others have recreated most of the traditional BI stack just in the cloud. Is there a better way?
Chris is absolutely right. I'm going to answer in a different way, as I read the question slightly different. Is a data warehouse required for a BI service - again it depends. If you want to perform analytics against enterprise worthy data with multiple sources of the data to feed it, then yes you need a data warehouse to backbone the system.   If, however, you are doing analytics against a subset or contained set of data, CRM solution, Ticketing, etc, then no, either an operational data store (ODS) or data mart would be sufficient. You might, depending on performance, availability, and data cleansing go directly against an operational system.   I'll give you an example. If you are doing analytics to determine customer segmentation for marketing, or analytics on logstics to support a complete product life cycle in a Just In Time logistics model - Data Warehouse.   If you are doing reporting and trending on call center statistics, such as call volume and first response closure or IT specific analytics like ITIL with Incident Problem and Change, or even CPU - I/O - Network statistics, then you don't need a data warehouse.    Embed Quote
