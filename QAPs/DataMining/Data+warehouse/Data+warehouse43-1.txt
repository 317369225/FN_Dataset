★What is a career for a female in the data warehouse field?Especially SSIS, SSAS, SSRS. Is it true that you will not be able to settle down like doctors in later years of your life (after 40) and you have to constantly keep on looking for new contracts?
We've had full-time female developers, BAs, QAs, PMs, architect, what else do you need?  We don't fire people, they leave on their own volition.    Embed Quote
