★Do you prefer data warehouse or Hadoop for big data process?I find traditional data warehouse users would not accept Hadoop due to its hard coding and debugging, but without it, how do you deal with big data problems now? Do you have to scaling up the database/DW continuously due to the growing data size and high concurrency?
Though I am an HP employee, I haven't worked with Vertica, but it is said to be simple to operate (offers full ANSI standard SQL support + additional functionality) and at the same time able to handle "Big Data" amounts of data. Vertica Analytics Platform | Big Data Analytics    Embed Quote
