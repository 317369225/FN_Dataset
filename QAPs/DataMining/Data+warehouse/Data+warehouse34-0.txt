★How valuable is the CBIP (certified business intelligence professional) certification from The Data Warehouse Institute (TDWI) ?
According to them it's worth $8,200 per annum in increased salary versus non-certified professionals...according to them, that is! I'm going to try not to rant here. Everyone who knows me, knows I am not a big fan of certificates and certifications.  Particularly generalized certs' like this one, and particularly not ones with such a low passing standard.  I can get a CBIP Practitioner level certification with a 50% pass rate; a Master level with 70%. Really, a Master Level designation with only 70%+...what does does that equate to...a C/C+?? For me, it's a neutral proposition - it's not as if you would be excluded from the job for having it, it's really just a question of what value you get out of it. To me it's another in a long list minimally useful certs which really won't do much to increase your prospects (unless you're entry level and need something to hold up for experience. I really wish these guys, and others, would start to focus on the practicals versus the generals of any given industry. If you came and told me you were certified in retail/energy/social/financial analytics, data management, data warehousing, that would be something I paid attention to.    Embed Quote
