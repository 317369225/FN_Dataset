★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
A Data Warehouse is the only alternative to the issue you have listed above. In order to combine 10 data sources together you must create  a datawarehouse. Data Warehouse is not a product as most companies like to sell it, it's a concept. A datawarehouse is nothing more then a database with a lot of coding. Whether you want to "buy" a datawarehouse or build something from scratch, the results will be the same- A database with a lot of coding behind it to connect one dataset to another. The only way to achieve the above is to import all the data into a "database", link it all up and create the reports/analytics that you need. $2.5M seems like a lot of money and because Data Warehouse is extremely popular your vendor is jacking up the price.
