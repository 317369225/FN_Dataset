★How valuable is the CBIP (certified business intelligence professional) certification from The Data Warehouse Institute (TDWI) ?
Full disclosure - I have the CDMP and CBIP.  I enjoyed reading your first hand experience comments.  Criticism is always an acceptable comment to help us reflect on the value and usefulness of each credential - so I applaud the original critique, but only from that perspective.  A well researched answer is necessary to establish value from at least four perspectives: employer, certificate holder, human resource development and the customer of services provided by these professionals.  Without useful research data any critique or responses have little merit.  TDWI surveyed CBIP holders and published their research.  One can criticize research methods not results unless you have research data with the same or better methods - uninformed and broad generalizations are poor reporting.  I advocate doing research on these areas and publishing the research later this year - using independent professors from multiple universities.
