★Do you prefer data warehouse or Hadoop for big data process?I find traditional data warehouse users would not accept Hadoop due to its hard coding and debugging, but without it, how do you deal with big data problems now? Do you have to scaling up the database/DW continuously due to the growing data size and high concurrency?
DW/DB users has to ask for Hadoop to scale out, but Hadoop has to employ another professional team to deploy and maintain, it is only suitable for the data size reaches many many TBs or even PBs data, and it is not worth it for small and medium scale clusters. If facing structured data computing involving complex business procedures, MapReduce hard coding is low efficient, and Hive and Pig can only do some very simple queries.    Embed Quote
