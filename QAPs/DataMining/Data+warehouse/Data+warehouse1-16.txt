★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
Yes, there are definitely alternatives....  For systems under $2.5M, statistical metrics offer proof that a $50K, Microsoft SQL Server provides equivalent performance to a $2.5M Oracle solution, hardware included.  My suggestion is to avoid going the next step to free-ware database software and by building on the Microsoft platform you will have access to the broadest range of system administration, DBA and development resources.  Microsoft Excel is by far the most prolific BI tool in the world and other industry standard BI tools are built for MSFT SQL Server before other database vendors.  For data integration, "MS SQL Server Integration Services" will connect to the sources you list above and more.  For 50 million rows of data you estimated above, you will need to calculate the average row size in bytes and multiply by 3 for indexes to predict the amount of raw disk you will need attached to the system.  Then multiply that by 2 for redundancy and factor in costs for archive storage as well.  Personally, I'd call the local Microsoft office and ask to speak with an "Application Platform Solution Specialist" who should be able to architect this for you and if you ask real nicely may have a technical person come out to install the software on-site.  You should be good to go for under $100,000.  Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
