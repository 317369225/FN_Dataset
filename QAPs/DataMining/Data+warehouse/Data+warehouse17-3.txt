★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
Excellent and detailed answer, Patrick. I would add: 1.  Price will likely be the biggest driver of the technology stack and staffing you choose 2.  Deliver something new and useful early on. If all you do at the end of nine months is deliver a report they used to get an Excel, use of your DWH by others will likely wane. 3.  Agile?  Not sure this is really the best approach. Better to have a strong understanding and predictions about what questions are frequently asked and design an architecture that answers the majority of those questions. IMHO, after designing an architecture and determining technology requirements, you can use Agile to make your tasks smaller. Instead of delivering a partial solution after one year, you can deliver one story, and then another and another, giving the appearance that quite a bit is being delivered, all the while you are building on a foundation that will be extensible to future uses. Pure agile treats each story as independent and leaves a lot of waste and dangling tables. Your data needs are not unpredictable.  Don't treat them as if they are. Just bite size them so you can build your foundation and deliver simultaneously.    Embed Quote
