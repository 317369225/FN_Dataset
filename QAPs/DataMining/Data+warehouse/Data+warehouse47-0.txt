★What is a good way to begin the development of a data warehouse?
Since the question is how to begin development, I'm going to assume business case, ROI, and business requirements are already defined. Also this is from a traditional DW build - not an unstructured or "new" BI warehouse (HDFS, NoSQL).   The first step in developing any data warehouse is to start with the logical data model based on the business requirements defined. Once you have the logical defined, then identify the sources of data for those subject areas. With the sources identified, take the source data model, the logical data model, and build the physical data model. Once the physcial data model is built, build the integration (extract, transform, load).   I'm going to take this farther than just beginning. So once the integration is built, then you build the aggregation (if necessary). Next step is to build the semantic layer (business language over technical - i.e. taking CUST_ADDR_LN1 to Customer Address, Line 1)   Once the semantic layer is built, then you build the reports and dashboards ontop of it.   Congrats, you've built your data warehouse, with proper care and feeding, it will grow to fulfill all of your reporting and basic analysis needs.   BTW - Its a whole lot easier to describe the high level steps than it is to do it. A GREAT team with a reasonable amount of subject areas - 5 to 6, would probably take 6 months to do this. I also didn't include testing, data quality, and data management best practices (like profiling).    Embed Quote
