★Can MariaDB be used as a data warehouse for BI?Would it be a winner in both worlds: aggregations performance on one side and data structure flexibility on the other? If not, which DBs could serve as a better candidates?
I wouldn’t use it. I value data quality, the ability to model my data based on the data, I like mature data abstraction layers and I don’t consider any db I have to pause when doing backups a mature db. I also like advance features required to do advance analytics. Also I get hired by people who often care a lot about securing their BI data. Often at the row level. MariaDB barely knows what security is. I am sure someone can make it work if they want to put enough work in it. I currently enjoy using Oracle more than anything else for BI, DWH and advance analytics. Postgres is solid ever since 9.0 I have found Teradata and SQL Server to not be very fun to use but I can get them to work eventually. They each have different advantages that I almost never care about when compared to Oracle. i.e. Terdata is a great for aggregation of lots of data if you have money to burn. Most advance analytics I do, needs much more than just aggregation. Redshift is very new to me and I really like it for some kinds of DWH BI solutions. It is not as versatile as they claim but it something to think about.    Embed Quote
