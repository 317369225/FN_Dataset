★Why are data warehouse appliances so popular?If you have a good team of sysadmins and DBAs why wouldn't a normal set of hardware and software work just as well as an appliance? Also, with an appliance, aren't you limiting your expansion options?
1) "If you have a good team of sysadmins and DBAs" is quite an "if". And people who were "good" in the past may not keep up-- you see, for instance, people using techniques they learned in Oracle 8 or 9 that are actively harmful to apply to more recent versions... "I'll just disable all that newfangle 2) Even if it works just as well, it may be more work to get up and running, keep running, etc.. 3) Some appliances aren't "normal" hardware. If you control enough about your hardware and your software, you can make all manner of optimizations that a customer buying a general-purpose system couldn't match. (Look into Oracle Exadata-- not an appliance, strictly speaking, but... not exactly normal hardware or software either. Plenty of secret sauce on those burgers. I'm sure Teradata and Netezza etc. have their own cleverness too.)    Embed Quote
