★What is the tipping point from using databases to using a data warehouse for reporting?
I generally use the term data warehouse to describe a database that sources information form multiple disparate source systems for the purpose of presenting business information to empower enterprise resource planning and decision support.  If the data warehouse also derives new data from the disparate source system that becomes the source for other applications I will call that data warehouse a corporate information factory.  If there are not multiple disparate source systems than I just call it an application reporting database.    Embed Quote
