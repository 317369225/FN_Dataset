★What are the scalability limits of existing data warehouse products?From what I've heard Teradata, Netezza, Grenplum, Vertica, Aster, RAC, and SQL server at most scale to 2PB.  Most hit scalability limits well before this.  Read-mostly parallel databases should be able to scale to hundreds of servers, so why do these systems not scale that high?
2PB is not necessarily the upper bound. I know of commercial RDBMS setups that exceed the number. For most database systems, their performances start to plummet when the index doesn't fit in memory. Shared-nothing, sharding (partitions) works very well for data warehouses. A shared-nothing db is easy to scale by adding more nodes to the cluster. One bottleneck in a shared-nothing db is operations that require communications between different nodes, for example, a sort operation. Such operations require significant data movement in the cluster and can significantly slow the cluster down. Be noted that Oracle RAC is not a shared-nothing db and is not designed for warehousing. It is advertised for its high availability (transparent failover and continuous availability), which matters more for online processing than data warehousing.    Embed Quote
