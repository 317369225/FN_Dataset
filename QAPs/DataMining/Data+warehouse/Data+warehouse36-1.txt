★What are some successful large scale healthcare data warehouses?
I disagree that Intermountain is gold standard. I do agree that they were early product builders but there are architectural limitations to this product. I am actively working on developing a platform.  Health catalyst and is based on old architecture and is not scalable if the data size is beyond certain limit. It is not suitable for modern data architectures. The biggest problem in healthcare data warehouses is Extracting EMR (mumps based) data and Healthcare content like PQRS metrics, ACO metrics, Pop Health metrics. Information builders, Oracles OHADI, McKesson Analytics products are also playing in this space. In general, Technology adoption is rudimentary in healthcare.    Embed Quote
