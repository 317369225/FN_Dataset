★Does big data threaten the traditional data warehouse / business intelligence model / stack?
Also inherent in your statement is I think a misconception that both big data and EDW's rely on a single version or view of the data. That concept is an Inmon concept that is proliferated because of the lack of good data and BI governance. As long as there is strong governance in place, there is nothing wrong with having multiple versions of data, in fact, in larger shops it might even be necessary as a single version becomes expensive to maintain with large data sets and competing business priorities.   Big Data on the other hand shouldn't even have a single version of data concept, as the data is unstructured and the use cases are more often defining what the single version should be as opposed to publishing what it is.    Embed Quote
