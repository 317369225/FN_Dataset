★How does the rising popularity of Hadoop impact legacy data warehouse vendors like Teradata?
I think once tools like Apache Drill, Cloudera's Impala, or Hortonworks' Stinger are mature and stable, they have a much better chance of displacing traditional data warehouse vendors.  Furthermore, hosted tools like Amazon's Redshift and Google's BigQuery relatively cheap and easy alternatives to self-hosted solutions.   Overall, I see a lot of parallels between the rise of Hadoop and the rise of Linux.  The first Red Hat distribution of Linux came out in 1995.  20 years later Linux has displaced most traditional Unix distributions especially for new installations. Hadoop first came out in 2005.  In little under 10 years it has built up a very strong open source community and has multiple vendor distributions.  While many of its offerings are still immature (e.g. near real-time analytics queries), it has a lot of momentum behind it.  Furthermore, projects like Storm and Spark are offering scalable, integrated services that are not found in traditional data warehouses.  Just like Linux didn't eliminate the traditional Unix distributions, I don't see Hadoop eliminating the traditional data warehouse vendors.  However, I do see more and more new efforts choosing Hadoop or hosted warehouses over traditional vendors because of a lower barrier to entry and access to a large developer/user community.    Embed Quote
