★What are some problems with using Microsoft SQL for a data warehouse?
In my experience SQL Server 2005 can support a DW, however there will be plenty of tuning to do before getting the server to a production status. Disadvantages:  Like most MS products, random memory issues can be a problem. Trouble shooting these problems can be extremely difficult as windows logging is notoriously "not awesome".  The most challenging aspect of a DW on Sql Server, is that the out of the box Sql Server settings are designed to optimize OLTP systems, and these settings will mostly cause problems in a DW environment. Advantages: Sql Server tends to a bargain compared to other DB tecnologies. I would also add that I have read that Sql Server 2008 has some outstanding DW features built in.  However I don't have any experience to back up these claims. My last comment is that if you are all ready a Microsoft shop, you may find you can leverage MS's compatibility across your platforms.    Embed Quote
