★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
Everyone has had excellent suggestions, I apprecciate your input and the thought you've given to your answers. Unfortunately my agency became paralyzed after they were given the first quote of 2.5 million dollars and the decision makers did not investigate other possibilities. I offered up the various suggestions mentioned in this thread but no one was receptive. It was disappointing to say the least.    Embed Quote
