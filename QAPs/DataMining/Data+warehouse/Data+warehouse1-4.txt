★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
There is one unique technology that allows for central access point to disparate databases without coping it to a central data warehouse. It is called SlashDB and it won't cost nearly as much. Disclosure - I work for them. SlashDB automatically constructs a hyperlinked representation of all your databases so that their content becomes accessible to end users and applications under standard document formats like XML, CSV, JSON and HTML. In other words it automatically creates a web api (REST/HTTP) out of databases.    Embed Quote
