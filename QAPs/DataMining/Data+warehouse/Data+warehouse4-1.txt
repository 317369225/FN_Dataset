★What is a good introduction to data warehouse?technologies, companies, markets, application, notable people, etc.
I work for Greenplum (bias out of the way) Patrick Pitre wrote an excellent answer.  I'm going to try and make a point without confusing things too much.  The interesting thing about the data warehouse space is that it is becoming much more diversified.  The traditional EDW, what I consider this question and answer to be primarily about, has been and will be, the ability to ask and answer questions about the current and historical state of business.  In other words, the EDW is designed so that you can find out, how many widgets sold in 2011, then drill into November 2011, then drill into Thursdays in November of 2011, etc.  The same types of inspections need to be run on whatever questions the business finds valuable.  This requires a certain amount of data federation, data governance and strict schema.  The key notion is that when I hit run on a report script, or refresh on a dash board the answers better be write with out me having to go in and checking the data at an atomic level. A lot of the new buzz in data warehousing is about predictive analytics.  Often times predictive models are easier with less structured databases and a 'new product' being sold is the analytical data warehouse ADW.  This is the space where Hadoop lives.  The only reason I bring up the ADW is that the lines between ADW and EDW are blurry especially when you get sales reps involved, potential Hadoop purchases and the 'sexiness' felt by COIs when big data is mentioned.  Now more than ever, a clear purpose for storing and analyzing the data needs to be determined so you can focus on building an environment that fits current, and as much as possible, future needs.    Embed Quote
