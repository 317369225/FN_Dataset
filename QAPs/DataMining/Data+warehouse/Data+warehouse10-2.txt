★What is the best data warehouse product/service for a startup?Should one build a bespoke architechture? Zoho Reports? Private SQL Server?
Depends on the requirements. How much data, what kind of performance, frequency of data loads, budget, infrastructure (hardware and staff) to support it, Availability, DR, etc. Are you looking to do an enterprise data warehouse or a collection of data models. Are you looking for operational reporting to make tactical decisions, analytics for identifying trends, or reporting to provide a visualization of where the company is?   Data Warehouses are notoriously hard to build. I've heard everything from a 90% to a 50% failure rate (http://ijltc.excelingtech.co.uk/...). I would suggest defining the business problem you need to solve as opposed to just thinking you outright have to have a data warehouse, especially as a start up. Small companies (and large ones) get by fine using Access and Excel for BI, I would think as a start up solving business problems with a data warehouse is a bit overkill.    Embed Quote
