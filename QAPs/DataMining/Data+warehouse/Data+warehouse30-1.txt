★What are some good examples of applications written against data warehouses?
Our company BP Analytics strongly believes in developing applications that runs against a Data Warehouse? Why not isn't a data warehouse a reformatted version of all your data (whether it be ERP, Excel sheets, Access Databases, External data). So if a data warehouse is your massive black box with all the answes should you not build applications against it. From our perspective most company applicaitons should be built against a Data Warehouse, especially one that has been validated and proven to be accurate.
