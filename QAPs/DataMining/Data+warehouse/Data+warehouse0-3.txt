★What is a data warehouse?
Depends on the purpose. the DW, also termed BI, is a technical tool/application to enhance the decision capabilities of enterprises. 1. A DW can be used as a repository for data 2. A DW can be distributed, consolidated or federated 3. DW success is directly proportional to business participation, ownership and accountability from start to end.   Gartner reports: 'More than 50% of BI implementations will fail to meet business expectations' and over my last 15 years or so of working with fortune 1000 companies I can ascertain that is about as accurate as one gets. BI Valuenomics reports: "Over 98% of BI projects are declared successful in week 1 after go-live. Yet less than 50% of them remain successful by week 10'    DW is a technocratic view of a decision engine. The key is is deploying a global DW/BI methodology in a 'Enterprise BI Cookbook' that assures that these technical applications meet, and even exceed, business expectations. My recommendation is to not focus on the catalyst or the technology but business needs and then select the DW/BI or technology that will best meet your business needs    Embed Quote
