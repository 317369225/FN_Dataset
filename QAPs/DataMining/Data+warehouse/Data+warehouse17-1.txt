★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
As stated by others this is a really tough one to answer without a lot more detail, more than you are probably willing to share on the public internet and more than we are going to dig through for free advice ;-) I'd agree that getting defined goals so you know where the goalposts lie is probably the most important thing to focus on right now. Once you know what your targets are, and how you will be measured for success, it will become a lot more academic from the implementation side. As far as infrastructure, I'd recommend going cloud or private cloud (if you MUST run your own datacenter, take a look at MAAS to "cloudify" your own servers). This is a layer of abstraction that makes life a lot easier. Don't let deployment become your biggest barrier, especially with today's tools available. Once you know what direction the goalposts are, you can then start looking at your players to see what kind of team you can put on the field. Are you more worried about operations and infrastructure, or implementation and development? Getting a grip on your risk profile for this project should tell you where you can bring in help from the outside (and if it is really needed or not). I'm a MongoMaster so of *course* I'm excited to see folks recommend MongoDB, however without knowing what you are implementing in any detail I cannot tell if this would be making your life easier or more difficult. MongoDB is awesome for chewing up tons of unstructured data, as well as adhoc reporting - but the BI tools are still woefully unaware of MongoDB for the most part, so you would be taking a decidedly DIY approach for anything touching MongoDB (most likely). Apologies for the generalities, kinda hard to get into more detail without having a deeper understanding behind the specifics of your circumstances.    Embed Quote
