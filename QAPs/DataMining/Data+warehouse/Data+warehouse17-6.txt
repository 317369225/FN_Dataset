★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
1 - It definitely seems like hiring some form of consultancy for this project will be necessary. 2 - I know you mentioned later that cloud hosted solutions are "not of relevance" right now, but if scalability is a concern, you should certainly consider some type of virtual server deployment or virtual private cloud solution (even if you host it internally) that is able to grow with your needs at a couple clicks of a mouse. With modern technology, it seems unnecessary from a cost management perspective to invest in the ongoing physical hardware. If security is a concern, take a serious look at smaller data centers or private cloud providers (like my employer, Netrepid - Home Page). 3 - This is probably going to be the biggest challenge in this entire project. My suggestion would be to find your new dashboard solution as early as possible in the planning phase and work with them to prepare your new DWH with their solution in place. This could help aid your consultant search, as well, because once you select your dashboard they may have recommended consultants to help you through the process. The old data migration is a concern, sure - but if you have the new dashboard solution in place early, they should be able to begin migrating that old data and hopefully even begin running co-current with your existing setup before you switch. To be honest with you, I would probably do you a disservice by offering insights into questions 4, 5, and 6, as they are way outside my area of expertise. If you were interested in connecting with someone at my company to discuss these logistics, I could certainly make that happen, however. Contact me privately and I'd be happy to connect you with our CEO who consults on issues like this. Best of luck with this project. Hope my insights were somewhat useful.    Embed Quote
