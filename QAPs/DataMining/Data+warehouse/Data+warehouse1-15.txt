★What are alternatives to building a data warehouse?
Many good and valid solutions here---might also think about the data integration itself though---probably not just a physical problem to be solved by machinery whether it be cloud based or a big MPP solution, etc... How will you get this data together in such a way that it is meaningful to the end users--all of them with potentially disparate views and questions to be asked--understanding the metrics needed (now and in the future) can sometimes be the most difficult task (think data governance/stewardship issues). Maybe you already have this issue resolved?  Then again be careful of the age old problem of asking a question from these data sets and getting multiple "correct" answers.  Good Luck!    Embed Quote
