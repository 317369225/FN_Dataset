★What is the tipping point from using databases to using a data warehouse for reporting?
I LOVE this question (it’s my research/career passion). One problem with many data systems is they don’t communicate data in ways users can easily understand. For example, in 2 studies by the U.S. Department of Education, it was found that educators (smart people! …though I’m biased here) making inferences from data system-generated reports do so with only 48% accuracy. Thus one feature vital for successfully data reporting (yet often overlooked) is the need to make the data “over-the-counter” in that the data’s viewers are assisted in easily understanding the data and using it correctly (just as an over-the-counter product must offer labeling and other features to ensure its contents are used correctly). This is especially essential for “high stakes data” used to make decisions with major consequences. A set of data system/reporting standards (involving effective implementation of a help system, supplemental documentation, user-friendly data visualization, etc.) at www.overthecounterdata.com/s/OTCDStandards.pdf summarizes over 300 studies on the best ways to communicate data. One of the key studies from which these standards sprung (a quantitative study in which key standards tripled viewers’ data analysis accuracy) is my own, available “open access” at PQDT Open. Best of luck! :-)    Embed Quote
