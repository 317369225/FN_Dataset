★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
1. Bring qualified DW consultant team to create and implement skeleton warehouse 2. Request detailed SOW (statement of work) to be provided prior to beginning of the project based on your requirements and your business objectives 3. Make sure that project includes turnover and education of the architecture and development team 4. Make sure that project is a fix bid and mutually agreed on a timeline per provided SOW phases P.S.
