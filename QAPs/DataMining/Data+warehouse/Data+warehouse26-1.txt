★Which is the best open source/ free database management system for building a data warehouse?What is the best data warehousing / OLAP solution present in opensource and used by big companies?
I have been notified this answer "Needs improvement". That is the most obnoxious automated message I've received for a while. I guess I fail at Quora. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ It depends on your needs and the size of your data set. For example, Why aren't you just using MySQL or PostgreSQL? Presumably, their performance or scalability aren't good enough. Often the first one I'd look at is Infobright Community Edition. But of course it's somewhat crippled vs. the paid option. Also, do you mean "open source" or do you just mean "free"? That distinction is pretty important. There are also problems for which Splunk is both highly appropriate and free. There also are important cases in which Hadoop/Hive suffices. I could keep going, but anyhow your question is somewhat underspecified.    Embed Quote
