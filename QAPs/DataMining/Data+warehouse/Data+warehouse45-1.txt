★Why are the operational system keys not recommended for forming data warehouse primary keys?
Chris' answer is great -- I would also add a few things 1. Future proofing. Even if a table in your DW only has one source right now, it's possible you might find another source that would add to that table in the future -- and then you could run into namespace key conflicts if you didn't have a surrogate. 2. Operational key format standards.  You don't know if the format between source systems per Chris' answer in #1 will be similar.  Adopting a surrogate key let's you maintain the flexibility to have whatever key format standard you want. 3. Operational data migrations.  If operational or relational source systems migrate their data to a new system, their keys may change or get updated.  You have an opportunity to maintain the exact same surrogate key you generated in the DW but simply update the metadata including key in source system.    Embed Quote
