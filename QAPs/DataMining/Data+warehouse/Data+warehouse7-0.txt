★Do you prefer data warehouse or Hadoop for big data process?I find traditional data warehouse users would not accept Hadoop due to its hard coding and debugging, but without it, how do you deal with big data problems now? Do you have to scaling up the database/DW continuously due to the growing data size and high concurrency?
I suspect that over time "Enterprise Data Warehouses" will evolve from being a single RDBMS that handles everything, to a series of related 'data services' that all handle different workloads.  Most or all of the data may be stored in HDFS, but you can have a variety of applications running on top of it that can be used to perform different sorts of tasks. An application designed for processing massive amounts of analytics data will probably not be the best choice for servicing low-latency dashboard sorts of requests.  One of the selling points for Hadoop 2 with YARN is that the architecture is now able to handle many different sorts of processing paradigms, so with the same 'single source of truth' data set in HDFS, you can do traditional SQL queries, in-memory work, MapReduce and graph processing, among others.  Have all your data in one place, and then pick the right tool for the job to access it. As Eric mentioned, the small pool of skilled workers will limit Hadoop adoption for these sorts of efforts, but that will change over time as demand keeps rising and Hadoop-based applications become more user-friendly.    Embed Quote
