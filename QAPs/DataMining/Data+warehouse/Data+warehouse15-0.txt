★How does the rising popularity of Hadoop impact legacy data warehouse vendors like Teradata?
My overall impression of Hadoop is that it will likely increase demand for storage of traditional warehouse vendors in the short to medium term.  In the long term (10+ years), I predict we will see vendors blend these kinds of technologies so its relatively seamless to users (EMC is well on the path to doing this today and so is Teradata to a lesser extent). Take for example this overly simplistic but very common flow of how Hadoop is implemented and used most commonly today within enterprises: Hadoop is the storage and processing system for "unstructured" data.  Once you put "structure" behind that data, it needs a place to live if you intend to build a process to analyze it.  Enter: The EDW.  Teradata's core product (and other MPPs) is best served to handle this.  Even when you crunch the data out of Hadoop, there is still a lot of it, much more than traditional systems today generate. The data demands that Hadoop creates requires the organization to expand their EDW. To clarify from the article, the Teradata size is mentioned at about 9.2 PB while Hadoop is over 40 PB.  This I would expect to also be common because Hadoop is storing a lot of additional data that isn't relevant or valuable to the company.  The valuable data has to be identified and extracted from the mass of gibberish before it can be useful. To also completely contradict the point I just made, I've also seen examples where organizations have leveraged Hive as a sort of "Archive" for historical EDW data instead of buying additional storage for their EDW.  This is because it is much cheaper to store data in Hadoop than in something like Teradata.  Of course, this comes with the consequence that Hive tends to have a much slower response time than something like Teradata.    Embed Quote
