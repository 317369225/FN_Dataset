★Why are data warehouse appliances so popular?If you have a good team of sysadmins and DBAs why wouldn't a normal set of hardware and software work just as well as an appliance? Also, with an appliance, aren't you limiting your expansion options?
The simple answer to the question is that appliances are popular because they initially and easily solve the biggest quandry in DWBI - Users want more data faster - Always. DWBI is like drinking from a fire hose. The moment you get a bigger hose, they just drink more water. Its due to the inherent nature of BI. If a user gets an answer to their question faster, that leads them to the next question even faster. Think 5 year old kid that continually asks why.   Appliances are a newer technology, so most older data warehouses are now being upgraded to appliances because they are running into scalability, age, performance, or all three. Appliances provide a quick way to deploy new technology in the space that is already tuned to the BI workload and provides users data faster. Eventually they will need to be replaced by newer technology that gives the users what they will eventually ask for - more, faster, maybe even with a please.   So popular with the user base because they meet the needs, popular with the IT leadership because they are quick to deploy, usually either come with a managed service (Teradata) or are easy to support (Netezza), or feed the IT religious zealots (DBAs, usually Oracle - Just kidding, kinda), and are typically sold as the best things next to sliced bread because Big Data is the new buzz word.    Embed Quote
