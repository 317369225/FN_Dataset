★Do you prefer data warehouse or Hadoop for big data process?I find traditional data warehouse users would not accept Hadoop due to its hard coding and debugging, but without it, how do you deal with big data problems now? Do you have to scaling up the database/DW continuously due to the growing data size and high concurrency?
I think that the future will consist of organizations larger analytic applications being hosted in a SaaS model where the company who is hosting these applications is using the equivalent of a Netezza or Teradata Data Warehousing Appliance to take advantage of Massively Parrallel Processing.   I don't think organizations are going to want to have to host their own Data Warehouses when they can effectively outsource this to the companies who are hosting their enterprise applications. The one issue here is security and how that's handled in a SaaS model with someone else "owning" their data - but I see this being solved with encyption methods.    Embed Quote
