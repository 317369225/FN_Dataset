★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
This is not the kind of question that could be answered in just a short response of a couple of paragraphs. It would require a full understanding of the company business strategy, IT strategy as well as  much more detailed list of requirement. I've recently seen a company that insisted that they needed to capture and store a lot of data; and their data growth was in excess of 50% every 16 weeks. When I went through the individual components with them, it turned out that about 90%  of the data was irrelevant and never going to be used; but they still insisted that they had to keep it "just in case". I would advise getting in some specialist advisors to help you out. It will cost money, but it will probably work out cheaper in the longer term if you get the right people.    Embed Quote
