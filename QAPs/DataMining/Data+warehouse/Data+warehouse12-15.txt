★Why should I use an existing ETL vs writing my own in Python for my data warehouse needs?I've been reading the Kimball Group Reader and they strongly recommend I use an existing ETL. Looking at solutions such as Kettle, SnapLogic, and Talend it seems their GUIs complicate the solution instead of making it easier to model and understand.
Depends on your level of skill in programming. A lot of softwares, both commercial and open source are fully featured with the tools you need for your data warehouse needs. I work for a financial institution and were considering building our own software in Python. However, we found it really hard to build it from the ground up and we could not get our data from our "legacy" systems to transform into our new data systems. We looked at a bunch of companies and went with this software called Centerprise from Astera Software.Here is the link to their site, try their demo. Maybe you can get an idea of how they build their software and see the difference between a commercial software and one that you can build. Centerprise Data Integrator 5.0 It saved us much more money than building the software from the ground up and paying all of our programmers overtime. Plus, the months of headaches were gone because we were using something that worked. In short, just go with an existing ETL.    Embed Quote
