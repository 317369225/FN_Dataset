★What is the best approach for the successful kick-off and continuous implementation of a data warehouse?
1. I'd hire some software generalists. Someone who passed Google interviews once would come to my mind (most ex-Google full time software engineers who were hired before 2009 are good) 3. I think without looking into what you actually do and going into your project general answer is difficult to get on this one at least. 4. No - any project management tehniques should do. Software was built much before agile. 5. There are much varieties around, in my opinion.    Embed Quote
