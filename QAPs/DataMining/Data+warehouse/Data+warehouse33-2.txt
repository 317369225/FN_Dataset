★What does a typical data warehouse and business intelligence organizational structure look like?Number of FTE's, roles and levels of employees, etc...
Can you clarify what company size & industry? In general, the bigger the initiative, the more likely you are to have differentiation in the delivery side between architects, data integration/data warehouse engineers, and BI/analyst types. If you are a 10-person startup then it might be one person running reports directly on a transactional data store. As a starting point, in a technology organization of 30-50 people where the focus of the DW/BI program is to provide offline analytics to <10 staff (typically execs and upper management), I would say you could make do with 1 main business sponsor at the C-level, 1 sr engineer/architect, possibly another 1-2 PT engineering or data analyst resources to help with implementation, and a few power users, say in product or marketing, who can help drive requirements gathering, data modeling, product selection, etc. But it all depends on constraints such as reporting requirements, budget, available expertise, time to delivery, etc. As far as the org chart, in my experience the team is likely to report into the CTO or COO.    Embed Quote
