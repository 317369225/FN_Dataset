★What is a data warehouse?
Rangga pretty much hit this one on the head, but wanted to expand a bit. Data Warehousing, as a practice, encompasses a much larger scope than a simple database. That's where it starts, but to be of full value, processes such as Data governance and meta and master data management are essential. Data Warehouses are typically used in two capacities, either as a centralized hub for integrating applications in need of common data or as a repository for data to be used in analytics and reporting.   Data modelling, which is what Rangga described with a star schema is usually broken into two camps of thought - the Inmon or Kimball approach. Inmon favors a totally 3rd normal form of the data and created the Information Factory approach which is a single version of the truth and promotes a single relational model for all data. Kimball was the individual actually responsible for the proliferation of the star and snowflake schemas and the uses of data marts which provide specialized versions of data for reporting and analytical usage.   Inmon is known as the father of data warehousing for coining the term, while Kimball is known as the father of business intelligence. Most data warehouses use a hybrid model of a 3rd normal form in a star or snowflake schema.   Kimball's book - The Data Warehouse Toolkit is a best seller in the space. Inmon has numerous books and articles that he's written as well.    Embed Quote
