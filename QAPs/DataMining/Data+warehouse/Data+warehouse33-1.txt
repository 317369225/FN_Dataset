★What does a typical data warehouse and business intelligence organizational structure look like?Number of FTE's, roles and levels of employees, etc...
Each company is going to have a different org structure. The warehouse isn't any different from other applications in that you have to have a support structure, a development structure, a strategic component - either product or program management. Sometimes that's all contained in a single team, sometimes its split between the silos I mentioned, sometimes its split between infrastructure and application, and then in the silos, and then divided into teams.   All depends on the complexity of the organization - bigger companies will typically have a more heirarchial, complex structure. Smaller companies will be flatter and less complex.    Embed Quote
