★Is it possible to implement FFT on FPGA?I understand FFT. But I am new to FPGA .  So, I don't how to begin. For example,how to give an analog signal to FPGA? How should I start?
FFT is an optimized algorithm for computing the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform). There is no analog in the implementation - you first have to use an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) to get a discrete-time signal from the analog signal, which is a sampling rate and samples. I would start with implementing a vanilla DFT as separate real and imaginary parts, then implement an FFT butterfly.    Embed Quote
