★Is it possible to implement FFT on FPGA?I understand FFT. But I am new to FPGA .  So, I don't how to begin. For example,how to give an analog signal to FPGA? How should I start?
sure.FPGA includes an inside core about FFT. if u want to get an analog signal u should pass the AD transform to digital    Embed Quote
