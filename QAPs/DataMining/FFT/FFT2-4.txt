★Is it possible to implement FFT on FPGA?I understand FFT. But I am new to FPGA .  So, I don't how to begin. For example,how to give an analog signal to FPGA? How should I start?
Sure it is possible. But a more apt question would have been whether it is possible in your case. To answer that, some basic information is required: 1. Sampling frequency of analog signal. 2. How many point FFT do you want? 3. What FPGA will you be using and at what frequency? If analog signal is sampled at few kHz, then it will not be very difficult. However, if sampling rate ~1MHz and you need to implement something like 64/128 point FFT, then it is very difficult and would require a lot of design and optimization effort unless of course some ready-made IP is available. I would suggest using suitable DSP processors as they are well optimized for MAC (Multiply and Accumulate) operations.    Embed Quote
