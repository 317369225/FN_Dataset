★Is it possible to implement FFT on FPGA?I understand FFT. But I am new to FPGA .  So, I don't how to begin. For example,how to give an analog signal to FPGA? How should I start?
Yes. But FFT is a purely digital transform, so you would have to sample the analog signal into the digital domain first. If you would like to understand how this can be done, have a look at one of my FFT designs (128N decimation in time) in verilog: https://github.com/mammenx/synes... This design works on analog audio signals that have been sampled and digitised before being fed into the FFT engine.    Embed Quote
