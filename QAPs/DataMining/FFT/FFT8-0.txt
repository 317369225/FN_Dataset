★Can someone review my question on FFT complexity?I added a comment here: Anonymous' answer to Fourier Transforms: Is it true that convolving a 3x3 matrix and a Full HD image is slower with FFT? Can someone verify my comment?
'FFT' is actually an acronym applicable to an entire family of fast transform algorithms. But most of them assume a power of 2 for the number of points, while you will have to do several of them to patch together into a 3D convolution. But as long as you can choose the size of each transform as a power of 2, or pad/window the data without degrading it so that you can use a power of 2, then the FFT will be much faster than a convolution -- unless you have specialized hardware that can do the convolution more quickly, such as a modern GPU. BTW: do you mean convolving a 3x3 matrix with a "full HD image"? Are you going to be sliding the 3x3 matrix throughout the image? In that case, there is little point in convolving it with the whole image at any one time. And are you doing a discrete convolution or a circular one? There is a wide choice of fast algorithms for the latter: the FFT is the best known, but not the only choice.    Embed Quote
