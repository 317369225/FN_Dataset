Is collective stupidity just as possible as collective intelligence?
First we need to define collective stupidity, which is acting/being collectively (not individually) unintelligent. Given this definition I believe it is certainly possible, indeed if you look at the history of humanity, there are tons of examples, like wars, arbitrary laws, etc. Probably there are more examples of C. Stupidity than of C, Intelligence    Embed Quote
