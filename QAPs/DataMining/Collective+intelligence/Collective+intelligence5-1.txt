Is collective stupidity just as possible as collective intelligence?
I would argue that financial bubbles are an example of "collective stupidity."  The "consensus" ultimately reflected in the market price for a security can deviate substantially from its intrinsic value. Bubbles can be fueled by a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  Stock price appreciation leads to more favorable coverage and better access to promotional opportunities, which lead to more price appreciation.  Value investors often benefit from the opposite effect, where valuations for a security are sent into a negative self-reinforcing feedback loop and become irrationally undervalued.  Think about the public perception of "toxic" securities during the 2008-2009 timeframe--many have produced strong returns as the economy has improved. I enjoy being a contrarian; my outlook on the markets would be fundamentally ill-advised if the markets were all efficient and "collective intelligence" led to consensus that accurately reflected the value of each asset.  Thankfully, they are not!    Embed Quote
