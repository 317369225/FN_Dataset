Stupidity: Who do you think should be in a "really smart person but did a really dumb thing" list at the collective intelligence blog?
The Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh:             (This is the front cover of the TIME Magazine, July 16, 2012) Dr. Manmohan Singh is a renowed economist, completed his doctorate from the prestigious Oxford University, has worked for United Nations for three years and is the only Sikh Indian PM to be re-elected to power after a 5-year term. He has held several key positions in the Indian Government like Chief Economic Advisor, Reserve Bank of India Governor, advisor in Ministry of Foreign Trade(MIFT), Head of Planning Commission. Despite of all this, he's criticised today in almost the whole world for being a failed politician, who has fallen victim to a dubious and corrupt government  headed by a deceitful monarchy and essentially a No.2 guy on a No. 1 post! He's ever popular in the media for his apathy towards Indian people and inability to control the falling nation and the failing law and order.
