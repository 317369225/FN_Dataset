Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
Reddit is an excellent (albeit not perfect) example of a hybrid model. The front page is the accumulated collective intelligence of all users on the site, but it can personalized with subscriptions to topic-specific "sub-reddits" ranging from the niche to the super-niche. This way you get a good read on what's going on overall, plus the added benefit of extremely relevant content. You can also follow specific-users if that suits your fancy. I don't think a lack of personalization is what's holding it back. I think the answer is in what Andrew brought up -- that it's collective intelligence is self-reinforcing. If people don't agree with what comes up daily on the front page, they won't stick around. I think the real question is not whether collective intelligence or a relationship-oriented model works better, but how you achieve the right balance between the two. If you wanted a more accessible experience, perhaps you slide the bar slightly towards a personal connections model and you'd lose some of Reddit's insular nature. Slide it too far and you lose the benefits of collective wisdom. I think balance is key.    Embed Quote
