Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
I thought about commenting on Andrew's answer but on second thought, I'll add one. First, Twitter does captialize on collective wisdom or the power of its aggregate base of users through things like RTs and trending topics, though of course its core layout is based on what's on the minds now of the people you follow. Thus users choose whose opinion they get served up, rather than relying on the communities' collective opinion of what I should view now - this kind of self set filter is clearly preferential as a means of consuming information. Twitter used 140 characters to keep updating simple and able to be done by phones, a brilliantly simple play that made it more widely accessible quickly. As to Digg, there were already other news sites out there so making one where a community picked the best stories wasn't the hugest innovation. Finally, with aggregators like Google Reader in the mix where you can self determine the order in which you receive the whole internets' say on everything, community voting news sites seem like they'd always be at least in part a novelty when community voting is their main schtick. And I don't think Reddit is a failure. [UPDATE: Quora User notes Reddit got 1 billion page views this month.]    Embed Quote Updated 8 Apr, 2011. 517 views.
