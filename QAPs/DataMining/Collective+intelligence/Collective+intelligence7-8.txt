Stupidity: Who do you think should be in a "really smart person but did a really dumb thing" list at the collective intelligence blog?
The Unabomber case may be relevant. There are obviously several mistaken decisions on the part of the subject. With respect to collective intelligence, there were public activities such as the America's Most Wanted show. There was also a consideration of how it would be perceived, e.g. a complicated capture might become one side's siege or another's hostage-taking. As far as blogging, and in addition to individuals, it may be interesting to consider whether a collective can outperform agencies, private groups, corporate organizations, or bureaucracies, and how they may fit together, both from this instance as well as in general. Other areas include how the internet responds to censorship or corruption, e.g. sousveillance. The converse is whether botnets eventually defeat all comers.    Embed Quote
