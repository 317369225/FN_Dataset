What factors facilitate collective intelligence?
In older systems of culture many of the different types of intelligence were ignored, as their usefulness to be of any recognised value to society wasn't needed. Over time, educational systems became more diverse, but still a considerable degree of structure that creates situations where those that happen to be suited in the environment thrived, and the rest were either pulled down to everyone elses level or didn't get enough education that worked for their type of intelligence. However, that is changing, we will soon have a generation of people that can pursue any interest they wish with increasingly less impediment due to a society that is already well on its way to becoming more flexible by enabling any member to provide a service to another that is more inline with their nature. So, factors that facilitate collective intelligence occur by enabling; education that is personalised to the individual (and is entirely of their choice) the only other uniform education would be to require that the interest is adapted to be in the service of society. enabling the individual to engage their views equally with any other through systems that support very advanced communication systems between all members who finds that of interest. I notice that Glistening Deepwater and Flemming Funch are thinking on the same lines and the question is basically the same. What are the key factors to consider in cultivating collective sentience at increasing scale? I notice also that Viki Saigal has mentioned that overlap of questions.    Embed Quote
