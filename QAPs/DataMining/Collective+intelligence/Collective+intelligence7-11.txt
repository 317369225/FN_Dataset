Stupidity: Who do you think should be in a "really smart person but did a really dumb thing" list at the collective intelligence blog?
Nobody.  How are we competent to judge the actions of very intelligent people who make decisions based on their unique understanding of whatever they are interested in?  Even if the person admits something was a mistake, they are still more competent than we are on that subject.  For us to label it as a mistake even in that case is hindsight bias, as in after they explain to us what reasoning they had in doing it and how it was a mistake, we suddenly act like it was obviously a mistake to begin with.  What do you know about it? The same reasoning applies to the average person or even less than average people as well.  They are the sole experts on what decision they should make with the information they had available at the time. Let them tell us which of their actions were a mistake, with the sole purpose being so we can learn from it.    Embed Quote Updated 22 Jan, 2013. 134 views.
