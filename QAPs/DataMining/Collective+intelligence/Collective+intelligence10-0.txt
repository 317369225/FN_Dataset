How do you promote team diversity to facilitate collective intelligence?
You could simply assign people from diverse backgrounds to a team. Select on race, gender, psychological profile (meyer-briggs or something alike), whatever dimensions you want to have diversity in. If you don't have the people, hire them. Self-formed teams would be a different matter.    Embed Quote
