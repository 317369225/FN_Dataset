What factors facilitate collective intelligence?
Well, I hate to be contrary here, but intelligence (a difficult term to define) is a trait of individuals, not groups.  Individuals are intelligent in that they have learned and developed the tools provided by their culture to solve problems and expand the knowledge of the culture (admitted a poor definition). Societies have cultures.  What we mistakenly call collective intelligence is, IMHO better called culture.  Collaboration sites like Wikipedia are seeking to produce culture. Individuals make contributions to culture via collective work. It seems a petty point I know, but it leads to an important insight: the studies of sociology and anthropology provide insight in to producing collaboration systems on the web.  Look at groups on the web creating content as social groups and using social concepts rather than using biological concepts appropriate only for a single individual. Collective intelligence makes it seem as if we are being merged in to a super brain.  This idea has been around in social thinking since Plato, but it has proven insufficient time and time again and will likely do so again. The book I have seen on how culture forms in content creation sites like Wikipedia, Daily Kos, and Debian was Cyberchiefs Autonomy and Authority in Online Tribes Mathieu O'Neil http://us.macmillan.com/cyberchiefs Like all good sociological text it does not try to present a business school type best answer, but examines the social dynamics which promote and endanger the formation of culture and community online in content production sites. Again, because it is sociology it does to try to judge which site is more intelligent, but it does consider the effectiveness of sites and dangers facing them.    Embed Quote Updated 20 Jun, 2011. 104 views.
