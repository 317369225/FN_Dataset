Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
While Digg may be in decline, Reddit, a very similar site, is not -- it just had 1 billion page views this month. Occasionally, there is some more value in Twitter.  I follow almost entirely people in tech, but 90 percent of their tweets are about what they ate for lunch.  Annoying.  Or they are echoing something they found on Reddit.  I think that a hybridization of the two could be really successful - upvote/tag tweets you like, and they all get featured on some global frontpage and categorized by their tags.    Embed Quote
