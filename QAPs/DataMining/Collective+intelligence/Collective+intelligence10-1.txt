How do you promote team diversity to facilitate collective intelligence?
The "Groups" chapter in the featured "Introduction to Sociology" Wikibook might be useful, here. http://lar.me/e0 But much of the research in this has been in social psychology (which is featured in that chapter). Much of this question and potential answers to it relate to research on groupthink, group polarization, the small world phenomenon,  and group formation, which are all part of the basic toolkit most social scientists borrow from social psychology. In terms of group formation, something from social psychology I've found fairly effective in getting students to understand some broad strokes is Tuckman's well-known "forming, storming, norming, performing" model. It's so easy to remember and it's so specific (it's about task-based groups, or teams, which are but one potential group type, from a social science perspective) that it's easy to teach. Which is probably the reason it's so frequently mentioned. We could  (and often do, throughout social sciences) get much deeper into the types of dynamics having to do with the ways diverse groups emerge, are maintained, change, and disappear. But it's probably useful to make sure we're constructing knowledge in compatible ways, before we go further. After all, a benefit of all of these Q and A sites is that they're not only about what William Perry would call "received knowledge." But the constrained context makes it hard to go all the way to constructed knowledge and the type of collective intelligence which differentiates human brains from computers.    Embed Quote
