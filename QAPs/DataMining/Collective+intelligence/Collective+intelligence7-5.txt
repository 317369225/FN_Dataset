Stupidity: Who do you think should be in a "really smart person but did a really dumb thing" list at the collective intelligence blog?
I mean it probably, at least personally, has to be Woody Allen. He fooled around with Soon-Yi who was Andre Previn and Mia Farrow's adopted daughter and yes Woody and Mia weren't married so Woody wasn't really breaking nature's rules. However, the consequences were kind of annoying. American media portrayed him as a singularly perverse individual. People unfamiliar with his work or life, hear his name and say "Oh that guy who married his daughter" and many variations on the same theme; none of which are true. I think an artist has to be recognised by his work and not by the choices he makes his personal life. I am a deep admirer of his work. Starting from his early days as a stand up comic (and in my opinion he remains probably the funniest stand up comic in the history of the medium) to his early laugh a line films and then to his deeper films as he matured. His very funny contributions to the New Yorker. I am familiar with almost everything Thurber, Perelman,Dorothy Parker and the likes ever wrote and Woody towers in front of them if judged on comedic value. Moreover, he is an incredibly articulate man, with a very profound view on human existence and extremely well read and knowledgeable despite never having finished college. So, I wouldn't say it was a dumb thing what he did but rather an unfortunate one for it veiled the many millions who could have otherwise enjoyed his work unprejudiced by the choices he made in his personal life.    Embed Quote
