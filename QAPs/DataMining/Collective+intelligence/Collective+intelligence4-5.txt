Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
Digg or Reddit are not failures, however Twitter did get more users because it is not just about link sharing: It's about receiving news from brands, companies, or people you have interest in. Twitter contains direct news that are happening in real time, like the live tweets of Osama Bin Laden's death, or the protests in Egypt etc. and it does not rely solely on third party links. Following certain accounts like Mashable, CNN etc. will get you the latest news as fast if not faster than Reddit or Digg. Twitter realized that there are organizations who are already doing a great job getting the latest news, so no need for a community-voting system. Twitter is personalized and will allow users to get news based on their likes and tastes.    Embed Quote
