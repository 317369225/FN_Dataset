Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
Because a following/friend model can provide each user with a personalized experience while a site with one homepage cannot. As a result, sites like Digg converge to a self-reinforcing community that is often hardcore and niche, rather than relevant and personalized to a mass audience. However, it should be noted that the question is flawed/leading because Digg is still quite successful, just not dominating. The site has 9M+ uniques/month in the US and is ranked #110 in the US by Quantcast: http://www.quantcast.com/digg.com. A better phrasing of the question would probably be something like, "Why did Twitter and Facebook become top 10 sites in the US whereas Digg did not."    Embed Quote Updated 20 Mar, 2011. 3,845 views.
