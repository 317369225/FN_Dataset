Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
I don't see it directly mentioned in the other answers, but the reduced role of anonymity on Twitter/FB helps both sites semi-police themselves and remain more open to new users. That's not to say that everyone on Twitter/FB are friendly or are posting under their real name, but a large percentage of users are public with their identity on these sites. On an entirely anon/handle based site like digg/reddit/fark it seems that a vocal minority can often develop, that brow beats any user that doesn't conform to the established sites group-think. Over time this mentality can cause the site to narrow focus and spiral into an endless series of in-jokes and recycled content. The anonymity of the site provides the space for these self appointed "mindguards" to wall off the site to new users or alternative ideas with extreme vehemence. That's not to say that all sites should switch to use your actual name. Reddits AMA section has produced some of it's most interesting original content and necessitates an anonymous system. But anonymity breeds contempt.    Embed Quote
