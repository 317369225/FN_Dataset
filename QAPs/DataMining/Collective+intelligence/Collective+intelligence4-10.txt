Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
Let's not discount the influence of mobile on users' behaviour - Twitter/Facebook became mass-market at around the same time that the world and his dog got a smartphone and, recent announcements aside, there are any number of ways to consume and feed into Twitter on the move. The same cannot be said for Digg - there isn't even an official Android app.    Embed Quote
