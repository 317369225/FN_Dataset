Collective Intelligence: What are best tools and techniques for documenting and sharing "tacit knowledge" within an organization?
I think the previous posters need to lookup the meaning of tacit knowledge. Stereotypical blogging, wikis or enterprise portals like SharePoint are ill equipped to handle the capture, cataloging  or dissemination of Tacit Knowledge. Mentoring techniques are the mostly used to pass on Tacit Knowledge. However they are rarely measured, it's hard to gauge the success of these efforts until the student is separated from the teacher and then evaluated. As far as techniques - well, you can videotape tasks as they're performed by an expert, the expert can do either a narrative voice over, or a textual annotation but that only provides a multi modal view of the 'lessons'. Is a video mentor sufficient? It's certainly better than nothing; but we could do so much more. Traditional ECM tools can help consumers find the content through markup, tagging and search. I think, given enough time you could build a mentoring platform...perhaps that's an idea for a product/service.    Embed Quote
