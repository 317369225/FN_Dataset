What factors facilitate collective intelligence?
There are many factors as you can see from the good answers here. Perhaps the most important one though is 'diversity of search'. This is the basic principle of 'try everything', with a filter for amplifying what works as the add-on feature that makes evolution work. An example is an ant colony. Scout ants are very different in size, configuration, and behavior from most of the other individuals. They lead dangerous, often fruitless lives, which seems to go against the concept of natural selection. However, their diverse searches turn up food and nesting terrain that dramatically adds to the collective's survival, and thus to that of their own DNA. No single ant can make good choices about location or resource allocation. But diverse search, coupled with positive feedback (eg pheromone trails) can lead to good choices, which is the whole point of collective intelligence.    Embed Quote
