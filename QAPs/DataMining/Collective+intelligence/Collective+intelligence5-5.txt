Is collective stupidity just as possible as collective intelligence?
As there are no stupid questions, only stupid answers, and a number of intelligent answers have already been given. Let me try what's left. No, not referring to echo chamber effects, that counts as intelligent answer. Let me question the assumptions behind the question. My subjective logic goes as follows. Hypothesis: collective stupidity is just as possible as collective intelligence. Argument: chances to get a usable answer from the crowd are about 50/50 Conclusion: We need more context. Or we need to ask what do we expect to learn ?  Hypothesis: collective stupidity is more likely than collective intelligence. Argument: the assumption discloses the asker's worldview, possibly a bias for self-fulfilling prophecy. The crowd may be inclined to go with it, so as not to disappoint. Conclusion: You must have kinda known this already, do you really want a majority vote? Hypothesis: collective stupidity is less likely than collective intelligence. Argument: believe the best of people and prepare for the worst. The assumption discloses the crowd's bias for self-fulfilling prophecy. The crowd may be inclined to go with it, so as not to disappoint. Conclusion:   We kinda knew this already, do you still want a majority vote?I believe my circular reasoning is bad mostly because it's not very good. Your logical fallacy is begging the question    Embed Quote
