Is collective stupidity just as possible as collective intelligence?
Collective stupidity is, in my view, a result of widespread inattention to facts, meaning slanted perception of reality. If the input, the data, isn't correct, our reactions may appear to be stupid. Since the mass media are often guilty of sloppy treatment of facts, mostly by not asking the right questions, I would say that collective stupidity is very much possible. It is even probable, given the reliance of many on media reporting for their "facts". Collective stupidity is very much a function of uncritical acceptance of slanted reporting that twists or omits relevant facts, making it impossible to arrive at intelligent conclusions.    Embed Quote
