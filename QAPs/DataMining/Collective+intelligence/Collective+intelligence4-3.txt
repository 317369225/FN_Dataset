Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
Computerworld wrote an article about this topic today http://www.computerworld.com/s/a... and it endorses what Andrew Chen says above -- by giving participants a custom home page, Facebook and Twitter have avoided the clique mentality at Digg and its clones. When my Diggs didn't make front page, I simply gave up trying. At FB and Twitter, my only readers are my followers and friends, so I get better feedback and encouragement.    Embed Quote Updated 4 Feb, 2012. 504 views.
