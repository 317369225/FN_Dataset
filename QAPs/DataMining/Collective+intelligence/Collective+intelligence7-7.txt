Stupidity: Who do you think should be in a "really smart person but did a really dumb thing" list at the collective intelligence blog?
We forget that people are prone to greater stupidity in greater numbers. Historically poor political decisions aside (which are indeed made by groups of leaders), giving in to mass hysteria or "groupthink" is the number one dumb thing smart people do. People get caught up in the "power of the situation" as well as informational social influence, engaging in the actions of the people around them. An otherwise intelligent individual may find him or herself part of a bullying mob, a group of idle bystanders, drinking poisoned Kool-Aid, jumping off the the proverbial bridge or trampling shopkeepers and each other to get the latest I-product. So my answer, in short, is everyone.    Embed Quote Updated 24 Jan, 2013. 396 views. Asked to answer by Luis Felipe Garcia.
