What factors inhibit collective intelligence?
Culture, or maybe sub-culture. Companies often think about silos as organizational boundaries, but they area really cultural and organizational. Organizational culture is often characterized as homogeneous, but it's more like group of separate cultures that are working together. A company with a manufacturing/management/logistics culture like Nokia is going to find it hard to out maneuver competitors that have design and innovation cultures. It's not that Nokia isn't smart, some of the smartest people in the world are there and have been there, but it is hard for design and innovation subcultures at Nokia to interface with the management culture. They talk about this in the scripts papers as biases and what I'm describing is cultural bias which tends to be tacit.    Embed Quote Updated 14 Jan, 2011. 208 views.
