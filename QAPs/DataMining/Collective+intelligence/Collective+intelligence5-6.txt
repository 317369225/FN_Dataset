Is collective stupidity just as possible as collective intelligence?
Of course. Doesn't history prove it? If you simply take governments, nations, religions, you will get enough examples of how groups can collectively get wrong and enter conflicts most group members would rather avoid. Does anything get more stupid than war? Although there are many worthy arguments to claim some wars make sense, if you look at it from a practical pov, it is stupid, right?    Embed Quote
