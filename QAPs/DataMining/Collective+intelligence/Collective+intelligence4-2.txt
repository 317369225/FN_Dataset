Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
Web 2.0 was not about Collective Intelligence. Digg and Reddit and Delicio.us weren't either. They certainly opened the door for crowds to let their voices and choices be known, which is good. But voting stuff up or down is a far cry from "real" Collective Intelligence. Not that we really know what that is yet. But, surely, it will be a lot more complex than simple stuff like that. Why Twitter is winning out, is not, in my opinion, because there's anything deep and wise about a 140 character limit or about the follower model. The model is, however, flexible enough to allow for some of that real complexity which is needed. It doesn't get in the way of people connecting and self-organizing in a myriad of ways. We could say that why Twitter works better is because it isn't overly ambitious. It doesn't try to tell us how exactly good stuff should emerge from what we do. It doesn't impose any voting or rating mechanism on us. It leaves us relatively free to do the stuff we want to do, which allows more collective intelligence to emerge.    Embed Quote
