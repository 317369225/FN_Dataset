What factors facilitate collective intelligence?
Respect of the thoughts of others and truly celebrate the diversity within a collective group. All "thoughts" and "beliefs"  have value, if only to the person who possess them. If the "collective" cannot respect individuality, the individuality will never respect the collective, and hence and collective action will fail, or at the very best become a draconian machine that is simply labeled as a "collective" intelligence to rule and control the sheepish masses. Collective intelligence is to bring up all in the collective, from "their" place and ensure that "my" place  and "your" place are respected while at the same time respecting the place of the other.    Embed Quote
