Stupidity: Who do you think should be in a "really smart person but did a really dumb thing" list at the collective intelligence blog?
I will go with Steven Spielberg along with a host of other smart people who invested with Bernie Madoff. It is shocking no one really took the time to understand how Madoff's so-called investment worked and they just went along with Madoff since he was a "so-called" financial expert. It is sobering lesson for us all like Enron to really take the time to understand where we are putting our investments and money or we can end up like Spielberg and many more.    Embed Quote
