How do you promote team diversity to facilitate collective intelligence?
One possible method is what I call orthogonal regrouping. Rather than have one group for one purpose, have a range of groups for different purposes and no two people share the same group twice. When coordinating orthogonal regrouping within a large group, using the correct mathematical algorithm may be necessary. Groups are often biased by the dynamics of a particular group at any one time. By regularly regrouping people, that bias is minimised and the broadness of the range of people everyone works with is maximised. Not all situations work well with orthogonal regrouping but when it is a practical solution it can be quite powerful.    Embed Quote
