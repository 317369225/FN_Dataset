Stupidity: Who do you think should be in a "really smart person but did a really dumb thing" list at the collective intelligence blog?
I nominate John McCain for choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate in the 2008 election. (I know you can argue his handlers convinced him to do it, but it was still ultimately his decision). In fairness, there was a lot of anti-Bush sentiment and a lot of excitement about the possibility of an African-American President, so it was an uphill climb, but I'm not convinced it was an unwinnable election. McCain still had a reasonably centrist record going in -- there was some room to create daylight between him and Bush -- and Obama's relative lack of experience was one of McCain's most powerful arguments against him. And then he went and chose Palin for his running mate, in a fairly transparent grab for disaffected Hillary supporters. The problems with this move were that a) her social positions and cozy relationship with the oil industry pushed him further right, removing a lot of the daylight between him and Bush and b) it put someone even more inexperienced than Obama on his ticket, blunting that argument. Meanwhile, most of the Hillary voters saw through it anyway and many were insulted that McCain considered the two equal.    Embed Quote
