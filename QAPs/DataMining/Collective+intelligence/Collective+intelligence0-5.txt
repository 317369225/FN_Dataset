What factors facilitate collective intelligence?
At the most basic level having access, being able to critically consume information and establishing shared norms, including identity and reputation, is crucial.  In regard to the technical design of collective intelligence online communities, gamification and wikification are two emergent factors. While, the concept of object centred sociality is useful in understanding how collectives form and grow. Stack Overflow (and others) have shown how game elements, points and badges can provide both incentives for participation and mechanics for creating higher quality content. Not only do users earn points and badges for recognise quality contributions, but they "unlock features" as they gain reputation enabling them to perform higher level functions. The other thing Stack Overflow does is encourage others to edit other users' posts. By making every answer (and question) a wiki, the concept of collective ownership of the answers and questions is greatly enhanced with the emphasis on producing quality content rather than maintaining individual ownership and copyright of content. Object centred sociality states that collectives form around objects of interest.  Collective intelligence communities need to consider how they are formed being constrained enough to have a common object while also diverse enough to ensure quality. This may result in strictly defining the collectives, like Stack Overflow and its sibling sites has done using several separate websites, or segmenting a single website as Quora does using Follow features.    Embed Quote Updated 14 Dec, 2011. 106 views.
