Is it possible to gauge the collective intelligence of a human group organism? Would such a measurement be meaningful?
Perhaps corporations are the easiest "human group organisms" to evaluate.  The Price-to-Earnings ratio or the Price-to-Book ratio could be used as a metric for intelligence.  Earnings and Book value are fairly directly related to the corporation's current value - sales and investments.  A share price of 8-times earnings is fairly common and might be said to represent the 'excess' intelligence of the group above and beyond what a random group could do with the same resources.  Companies that are perceived as being smarter (e.g., likely to grow, develop great new products, make lots more money) have higher P/E ratios.  I just checked and found that Amazon has a P/E = 532 right now.  Of course, such market evaluations of corporate intelligence are sometimes wrong.  Prior to 2000, lots of dot-com companies were believed to be much smarter than they really were.  So maybe you need to look at long term running averages to get a better evaluation. ----------------- Here's a much more speculative notion that I've been thinking about for a while.  Perhaps Technology is a super set of humanity.  It looks like Technology wants to spread and wants to develop new capabilities, much as people do.  But such a super set might have a very different sort of awareness than we have.  We can't chop off an arm, ingest it, and use the nutrients to grow wings.  But Technology does that all the time.  Could we understand or evaluate such super sets any better than our kidneys understand us?    Embed Quote
