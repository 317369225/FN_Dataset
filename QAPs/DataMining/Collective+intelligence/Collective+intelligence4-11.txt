Why did "collective intelligence" sites like Digg fail while Twitter succeeded?
I think trust plays a large part. If you have a friend who is not only your friend but also specialised in a particular area, you're more inclined to listen to what they have to say than somebody you've never interacted with. I also think progression plays a part. Whereas Digg and Reddit would have been spectacular circa 1999, when the internet was still used by a relatively small number of people - and therefore it wasn't so likely you could call on your 'friend', now times have changed - niche audiences have become even more niche. Twitter, due to its very nature, is something likely to be your first port of call, because it is handy and simplistic in design.    Embed Quote
