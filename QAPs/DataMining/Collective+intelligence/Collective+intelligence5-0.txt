Is collective stupidity just as possible as collective intelligence?
Yes, and Groupthink is one of the most common example of collective stupidity.  Heaven's Gate, Bay of Pigs invasion, Financial Crisis, etc. are all examples of it. In "Wisdom of the Crowd", James Surowiecki listed 4 criteria for collective intelligence to work: Diversity of opinions Independence Decentralization Aggregation Of these, IMO, independence is the hardest to achieve, especially in a work environment.    Embed Quote
