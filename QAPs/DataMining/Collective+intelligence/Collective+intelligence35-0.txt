Which would be a better gift: Programming Collective Intelligence or Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach?
I like both books very much, but they are completely different.  Collective Intelligence is a romp through a bunch of fun examples.  AI is a careful look at an entire field from wise and experience authors.  For most people, I'd think Collective Intelligence would be a better gift, because of the "fun factor", but they're both excellent books.    Embed Quote
