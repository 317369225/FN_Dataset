What factors facilitate collective intelligence?
The recent Science paper by Woolley et al. claims: "The authors show that this c factor [collective intelligence] was not strongly correlated either with the average intelligence (i.e., g factor as measured through an intelligence task) or with the maximum intelligence score in the group. However, c was correlated with the average social sensitivity of the group and in the equality of term turn-taking as measured through socio-metric badges in the group. It was also correlated with the proportion of females in the group although OLS regressions implied that this was because females were more likely to take turns an to be more socially sensitive." http://acawiki.org/Evidence_for_...    Embed Quote
