Stupidity: Who do you think should be in a "really smart person but did a really dumb thing" list at the collective intelligence blog?
Elliot Spitzer was smart enough to be elected governor of New York, but resigned from office after his use of $3000 'escorts' was revealed.  Before being elected governor, he had worked as a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, and he'd been New York Attorney General.  As AG, Spitzer had prosecuted two alleged prostitution rings in the US, obtained a civil injunction preventing Big Apple Oriental Tours from advertising, and brought criminal proceedings against Big Apple co-owners Norman Barabash and Douglas Allen.  Spitzer certainly knew how easily law enforcement could learn who the clients are for these companies and how quickly famous clients could become publicly known clients. Eliot Spitzer and Spitzer's Hypocrisy: Worse Than You Think - Reason.com There's a pattern to a lot of "smart guy, dumb decision," cases.  People think being rich, famous, beautiful, or smart will keep people from revealing, or getting angry about, or penalizing them for actions that get everyone else in trouble.  I respect civil disobedience that accepts the penalties that come with breaking laws you want changed - Ghandi, Daniel Ellsberg, ...  Bill Clinton was dumb about Monica Lewinsky, but at least I don't remember him crusading against promiscuity. But Spitzer qualifies as dumber than dumb.    Embed Quote
