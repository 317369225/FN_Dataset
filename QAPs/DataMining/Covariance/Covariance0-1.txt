★What is an eigenvector of a covariance matrix?
The largest eigenvector of a covariance matrix points into the direction of the largest variance. All other eigenvectors are orthogonal to the largest one. Now, if this direction of the largest variance is axis-aligned (covariances are zero), then the eigenvalues simply correspond to the variances of the data: It becomes a little more complicated if the covariance matrix is not diagonal, such that the covariances are not zero. In this case, the principal components (directions of largest variance) do no coincide with the axes, and the data is rotated. The eigenvalues then still correspond to the spread of the data in the direction of the largest variance, whereas the variance components of the covariance matrix still defines the spread of the data along the axes: An in-depth discussion of how the covariance matrix can be interpreted from a geometric point of view (and the source of the above images) can be found on: A geometric interpretation of the covariance matrix    Embed Quote
