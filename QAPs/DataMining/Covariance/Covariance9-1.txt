Is covariance only a mathematical formula or is there any data in which I can see covariance?
Covariance measures the linear relationship between random random variables.  If there is truly a linear relationship between the variables, then it's measuring something real and tangible.  If there is an approximately linear relationship (e.g. if you can think of it as "linear with second and third order corrections" or something of the kind) between the variables, then it's approximating something real and tangible.  If the variables are related in a very nonlinear way, then it's not a particularly meaningful measurement, but could be useful despite not having a tangible meaning: say, as a quick and dirty way of demonstrating that the variables weren't independent of one another. So the answer to your question depends on whether the relationship between earthquake magnitude and number of buildings collapsed is truly a linear one.  I don't see any reason it should theoretically be exactly linear, but perhaps it's approximately linear.
