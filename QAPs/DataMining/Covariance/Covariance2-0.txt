What is an intuitive explanation of covariance?
The covariance between two variables is positive when they tend to move in the same direction and negative if they tend to move in opposite directions. To see how we arrive at the definition, first think about two variables each with mean zero. That is, each variable could be positive or negative but is on average zero. To summarize whether the two variables move together, we can look at the product: When both variables have the same sign, it's positive; When they have opposite signs, it's negative; When they are both large and have the same sign, you get a big positive number; When they are both large and have opposite signs, you get a big negative number; And so on. The average value of this product is the covariance: it's positive when the two variables tend to have the same sign and negative when they tend to have opposite signs (weighting by magnitude). What if the two variables do not have mean zero? Well, the means aren't relevant to whether the variables move together or not. The mean only describes the overall level of each. So we don't care about the means for this purpose, and to make things easier, we may as well set them both to zero (by subtracting off the real mean of each). Then we can look at the product as above. That is one way to motivate the definition of covariance.    Embed Quote
