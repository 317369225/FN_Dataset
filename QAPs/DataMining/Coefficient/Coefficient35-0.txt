What is an intuitive explanation of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient?
See this wonderful intuitive explanation of (sample) covariance: Page on Stackexchange, and note that Pearson's correlation is simply this covariance divided by the sample standard deviations of and of . The reason for this is simply rescaling: on the StackExchange page, the covariance would be different if the and axes were measured in inches versus in centimeters, and likewise if one axis was measured in inches and the other in centimeters; correlation fixes this "flaw" (not really a flaw) by rescaling covariance so that its range is and is unitless. For example, the sample covariance between humans' heights in inches and humans' heights in centimeters would be a number that depends on the spread of the heights in your sample (whether you were measuring adults only or both adults and children) and would be in units of inches times centimeters. The sample correlation would be exactly 1 (since height in inches equals height in centimeters times a constant 2.54).    Embed Quote
