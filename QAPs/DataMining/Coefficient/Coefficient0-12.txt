★How did Mint acquire 1.0m+ users without a high viral coefficient, scalable SEO strategy, or paid customer acquisition channel??
It was brought to my attention by word of mouth... awesome functionality and super easy to use - I've told many friends about it. I also think the design and branding has a lot to do with it. I wasn't afraid to fork over my data in big part because of the personal referral but also the user experience is superb, site looked credible and legit.    Embed Quote
