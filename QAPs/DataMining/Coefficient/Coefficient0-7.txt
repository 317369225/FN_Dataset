★How did Mint acquire 1.0m+ users without a high viral coefficient, scalable SEO strategy, or paid customer acquisition channel??
Mint had a great product and was simple to use. I'm sure it had a SEO strategy, paid for adwords, was promoted through blogs, news sites and had partnerships which brought in traffic. From my standpoint, the single biggest factor is the product itself. Reason being, how many people would pass their complete financial information banking, multiple credit cards to an internet site? In Mint's case, a lot of people. This is clearly a win for the product and the value it brought to the table. This is also proof that trust plays a big role on the internet. A lot of times I hear companies saying "we shouldn't put our CRM info or our Email server on the cloud, since the info is hugely proprietary and sensitive". Well .. what can be more sensitive than your financial information. Mint's biggest win was to give consumers the sense of security that their  financial information was safe. Everything else they did could have been done by any other online enterprise.    Embed Quote
