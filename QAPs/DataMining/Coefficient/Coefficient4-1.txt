What is the definitive way to calculate viral coefficient for a social game?
Virality (e.g installs from invites) multiplies non-viral growth (e.g. paid installs). So it's more enlightening to determine an "amplification factor" overall rather than just a viral coefficient, also known as K-factor or contagion. This is especially true with a Facebook game due to the variety of paid methods of promotion possible. Use for v = total installs from invites / total non-paid users and then for p = total paid installs. Calculate amplification factor growth as (1/1-v)*p. P here can be total users from all non-organic invitation channels.
