★How did Mint acquire 1.0m+ users without a high viral coefficient, scalable SEO strategy, or paid customer acquisition channel??
I'm not sure how this "no paid customer acquisition" theory came about. Probably from Patzer talks (I've heard him say they didn't advertise or something to that effect)?  I can think of 2 paid channels that I'm pretty sure of: 1) They used Adwords.  I worked at competitors during Mint's rise and would note the various ads they were running.  How is adwords not a a paid customer channel?  I'd be curious to know what the budget was. 2) They paid for ads on bloggers' sites.  I saw the ads with my own eyes and have confirmed it with at least 1 blogger I know that ran them. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know, but this is what I remember.  In any case, I'd theorize that paid customer acquisition played a role in user adoption. UPDATE:  Marc from Wesabe also points out the Mint marketing budget as a compelling reason for their growth. - http://blog.precipice.org/why-we...    Embed Quote Updated 2 Oct, 2010. 5,501 views.
