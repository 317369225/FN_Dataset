★How did Mint acquire 1.0m+ users without a high viral coefficient, scalable SEO strategy, or paid customer acquisition channel??
I spoke to Aaron forth, VP of products at Mint, several times, after he left eBay. In my view : 1.  From the outside, I also thought Mint solved a simple problem lots of people face : getting an overview of your financial situation. Banks have zero interest in providing the service (They like data to be spread accross multiple accounts). Every now and then, the service becomes super useful : when about to make a downpayment for a house...etc. I also thought the lead gen revenue model was very clever, not too agressive and nicely integrated in the product. 2. Impression of trust : I should also say I was impressed to see them gaining the trust from the users with their financial data. Quite an achievement  I think. 3. People. they attracted serious talent (Like Aaron) super early on, which never hurts.    Embed Quote
