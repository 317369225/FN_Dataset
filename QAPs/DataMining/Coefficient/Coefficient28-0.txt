Glass is smooth. Why does it have a seemingly high coefficient of friction?
Glass has high surface energy and thus high wettability. This leads to higher adhesive force with many types of counterface material and, more importantly, a more pronounced water meniscus effect, which increases adhesive forces between opposing asperities in the presence of moisture. When the coefficient of adhesion between two mating surfaces is significant, then smoother surfaces produce a higher coefficient of friction because the adhesive component of the friction force is more significant than the mechanical one (ploughing, or the plastic wave).    Embed Quote
