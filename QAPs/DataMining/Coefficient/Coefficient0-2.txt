★How did Mint acquire 1.0m+ users without a high viral coefficient, scalable SEO strategy, or paid customer acquisition channel??
I agree with all the points made above. Too many startups think they can become huge by solving a problem that doesn't exist. While Mint wasn't the only PF site at the time, it was very clearly the easiest to use and the company put a ton of effort into the user experience. As a tech reporter at the time, and a follower of the personal finance space online, the second I got into the Mint beta I knew the company was destined for success... if I had a billion dollars I would have invested it in the company right then and there, and that's honestly the only company I ever felt that strongly about, esp in beta form. I wrote about this at the time on GigaOm... http://gigaom.com/2007/09/19/rev... The equation for success is pretty simple... find a problem to solve (or a solution to improve) that's relevant to a massive amount of people. Then remember that the problem your solving is for these people and make it easy for them to use. That means innovating a little but not too much that the average person isn't comfortable on your site. The only negative I have to say about Mint these days is that at times it feels very advertising heavy, but at least even the advertising is built into the UI in a way that's useful. Every piece of the site is deliberate, or so it seems, and nothing is clearly the hack job of a brilliant engineer who has no idea how people actually use websites.    Embed Quote
