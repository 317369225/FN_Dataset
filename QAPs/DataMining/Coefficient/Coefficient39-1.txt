Are the highest correlation coefficient indicators most helpful in prediction?
As others have pointed out, highest correlation does not always mean best in prediction, though it is often the case. Correlation is just linear relationship. When we talk about "most help", it must be with respect to some measurement/model. There are other measures of prediction power of an input, depending on the statistical model used. For example, if you use Random Forest, there is a variable importance measure. If you use Lasso (L1 regression), the first inputs that enters the model are the most important. If you do a simple regression and rank all inputs according to there t-statistics, this can be used as a measure of variable importance as well. Variables with the highest correlations might not be the most important to prediction with respect to the above three ways of measuring variable importance. In general, the problem you are considering is probably variable selection, which I suggest reading Chapter 2 of the book Elements of Statistical Learning to get a flavor of. TLTR: From my practical experience, it is often the case, but not necessary.    Embed Quote
