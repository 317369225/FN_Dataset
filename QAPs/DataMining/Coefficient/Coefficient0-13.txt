As markets plunged, foreclosures rose, and jobs were lost, many people looked for ways to save as much money as possible.  Many consumers were at a point where their credit card debt was running rampant and savings accounts were virtually non-existent. Mint has a very simple to use interface that provides even the most clueless of consumers a simple way manage their finances.  Many consumers are wary of giving one site access to all their financial information.  However, the economic collapse helped push even the most wary consumers towards tools that would allow them to easily and efficiently manage and track their finances. Personal finance management tools were essential for many families trying to get expenses under control, save more, and pay down debt quicker in order to weather the financial crisis as efficiently as possible. Mint.com was in the right place at the right time to serve a very large need for many consumers.    Embed Quote Updated 28 Feb, 2011. 1,935 views.
