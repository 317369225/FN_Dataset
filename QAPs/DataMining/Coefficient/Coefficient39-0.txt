Are the highest correlation coefficient indicators most helpful in prediction?
Even for the linear model with squared error loss, what you're saying is true only in a very limited sense. If you had to pick just one variable to use for prediction, the one most correlated with the response would fit the data the best -- maximizing correlation is equivalent to minimizing mean squared error.  Beyond this, it's clearly false: if you're picking two variables to use for prediction, the two most correlated with the response also might be very similar to each other and therefore worse than some other two variables which jointly carry more information about the response.    Embed Quote
