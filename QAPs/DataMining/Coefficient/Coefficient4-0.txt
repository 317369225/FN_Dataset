What is the definitive way to calculate viral coefficient for a social game?
The Viral Coefficient is invitation rate * acceptance rate The invitation rate is, as you touch upon, #invites / #installs (users). It denotes the average number of invites sent per user, and can generally only be significantly improved by providing a service people love enough to recommend to their friends. Example: if 1250 users sent in total 2000 invites, the invitation rate is (2000/1250)=1.6. The acceptance rate is #invitee signups / #invites. It is a measure of the success of your invites. Ways to improve this may include better invitation emails, smoother signup process, signup incentives, etc. Example: if out of the 2000 invitees, 580 new users signed up, the acceptance rate is (580/2000)=0.29. From the examples above, the viral coefficient is simply the two results multiplied, or 0.464. In other words, you have some way to go before achieving viral growth. Another important aspect you absolutely should measure is the viral cycle time. This is the average time between receiving an invite and sending an invite (completing one full iteration of the viral loop). Obviously, the shorter this time the better.
