Are the highest correlation coefficient indicators most helpful in prediction?
Thanks for the A2A! The correlation coefficient is a very useful measure of predictive strength, but it is certainly should not be the one and only factor you take into account. Now, if you are only using two-variable models like (Z~X), (Z~Y), etc. Then a case could be made for using the model with the highest correlation coefficient. However, if you are considering models such as (Z~X+Y), then you must also penalize a model for complexity, otherwise you risk overfitting. Overfitting is the phenomenon in which you become worse at predicting new data while becoming better at "explaining" the data in your dataset. For instance, given 100 points, I could construct a polynomial of degree 99 and explain literally all of the variance. However, I would not expect this model to perform better at predicting the 101st point. The distinction between "explaining" your current data and predicting data outside your current example is extremely important - after all, why do statistics if you don't care about the population your sample is from. Also, the correlation coefficient can only be used for linear models, which is why transformations are typically applied to data before the model is considered. For instance, (log(Z)~log(X)+Y) is a linear model, but with Z and X log-transformed.    Embed Quote
