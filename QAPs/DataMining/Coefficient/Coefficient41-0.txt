What is the formula for finding the coefficient in linear regression with four independent variables?
In Excel, you can use the INDEX() function to retrieve the coefficients (and other regression results) from the "invisible" output array of the LINEST() function.  This is very useful if you need your regression calculation to be dynamic, if you want to use your regression output in a formula, or if you want to plot a "predicted" line on a graph to visualize the fitness of your results It's a bit confusing, because the first row of the LINEST() output array contains the coefficients and intercept terms, but in the opposite order of how you'd typically think of the regression equation. So... =INDEX(LINEST(y_values,x1..x4 values,,),1,5) = intercept =INDEX(LINEST(y_values,x1..x4 values,,),1,4) = x1 coefficient =INDEX(LINEST(y_values,x1..x4 values,,),1,3) = x2 coefficient =INDEX(LINEST(y_values,x1..x4 values,,),1,2) = x3 coefficient =INDEX(LINEST(y_values,x1..x4 values,,),1,1) = x4 coefficient For more help, go to LINEST() function and click on "More help on this function" Also, it's a good idea to check your results with a quick and dirty regression using the Data Analysis-Regression tool, but with multiple independent variables your data MUST be in columns. Row-wise data won't work.  Also, the columns containing the independent variables must be adjacent to each other. Hope that helps.    Embed Quote Updated 3 Feb, 2011. 613 views.
