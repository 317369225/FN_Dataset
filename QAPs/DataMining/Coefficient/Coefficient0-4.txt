★How did Mint acquire 1.0m+ users without a high viral coefficient, scalable SEO strategy, or paid customer acquisition channel??
I simply remember as a user reading about Mint in various tech publications, and then also hearing good word of mouth from a couple of other people.  I'd attribute this to the fact that they built a very good and useful product.  When you do that right, people will talk about it.    Embed Quote
