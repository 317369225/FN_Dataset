★What is your average day like of a predictive modeler? What skills and tools are most important in becomming one?
My day is primarily spent listening to business people describing what they think a model is and what it can do for them, then translating/reframing the project into how things actually should be done. Then, I spend nearly half the time of the project just wrangling the data into the format I need, usually getting sidetracked by writing a couple of SQL queries for people who don't have the technical facility... Some time well after lunch, nearly time to go home, I actually run an algorithm or two. If I'm lucky, the models look reasonable and I go home, knowing the next day I'll spend around another hour before I go home tweaking the models, with the rest of the day adding expertise to other people's projects while not having to do any real work (sort of like a professor to the students). This is why data science is the sexiest job on the planet <sarcasm/> In terms of tools used, I use R and Python, though increasingly I'm using Julia just to see if it gives me any magical insight. It rarely does, though it does give answers back much faster than R or Python.    Embed Quote
