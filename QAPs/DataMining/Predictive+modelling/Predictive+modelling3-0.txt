★How is predictive modeling used in logistic regression?
I think the question is better phrased: "How is logistic regression used in predictive modeling?" To answer that question, we first need to look at what logistic regression accomplishes. The first and foremost result of a logistic regression is that for a set of independent variables it can give you a binary 0 or 1 for a single dependent variable. If you are able to get a good fit/model, then you can plug in the independent variable values for a new observation and predict if the dependent value will be 0 or 1. For example, let's say you have a set of data that has independent variables age, gender, state, city. And, for those data points, you also have whether or not those people went to college. Whether or not they went to college is a binary type of data, 0 if they didn't go, 1 if they did. Now, you can fit a logistic regression to this data set. If the fit and diagnostics are all good, you can take in age, gender, state, and city for new students and predict whether or not they go to college. There are additional things you can use logistic regressions for. For example, you can calculate how much each single independent variable contributes towards someone's likelihood to go to college. Or, given someone's values for their independent variables, you can calculate the odds ratios that someone goes to college (which can then be calculated into a probability). I hope this helps.    Embed Quote
