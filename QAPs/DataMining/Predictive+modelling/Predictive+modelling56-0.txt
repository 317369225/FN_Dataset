★Has anyone used predictive modeling to predict hit songs?If so, what was their approach? i.e. There are lots of factors that might influence a songs popularity – the music, the lyrics, the environment, and tons of interactions. I'm interested in whether anyone has built a model that can do a better job predicting whether a song or artist will be a hit (using any quantitative metrics) than expert human judgement.
HIt songs are made, not written. Most of the time, when someone hears a song (almost any song) three times, they start to like it. That's why getting a song into high rotation on radio (and other mediums) is so important, and why getting into high rotation costs so much. Also why a great video can make a bad song into a hit - people will want to watch the video repeatedly, so they hear the song repeatedly.    Embed Quote
