★What are different methods for evaluating a Prediction model in R?
One approach is Cross-validation. Start by randomly assigning observations into either the "train" or "test" set. In R, I do this by adding a new boolean vector to my dataframe. In general, I train on 70% of my data and test on the remaining 30%. When fitting your model, use the "subset" parameter to only fit on the train set. From there you can compare models by seeing how well they can predict the test set. You can also ensure robustness by shuffling which observations are part of the train set and seeing if the results drastically change.    Embed Quote
