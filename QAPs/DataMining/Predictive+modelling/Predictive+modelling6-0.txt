★What is the best book ever written on regression modeling / predictive modeling?
It depends what you want from such a book and what your background is. E.g. do you want proofs and theorems or just practical advice? Have you had calculus? What field are you  going into? etc. However.... Gelman and Hill Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models: Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill: 9780521686891: Amazon.com: Books is good, somewhat technical, somewhat Bayesian and not that mathematically demanding Draper and Smith Applied Regression Analysis (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics): Norman R. Draper, Harry Smith: 9780471170822: Amazon.com: Books gives plenty of background and is a little rigorous Harrell Regression Modeling Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis (Springer Series in Statistics): Frank E. Harrell: 9781441929181: Amazon.com: Books is very good indeed and covers many of the problems with the way some people (quite a lot of people) do regression. It is somewhat R dependent (but that's a good thing). Chatterjee et al. Amazon.com: Regression Analysis by Example (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics) eBook: Samprit Chatterjee, Ali S. Hadi: Books is about as nontechnical as I would recommend and uses lots of examples. Fox Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models: John Fox: 9780761930426: Amazon.com: Books is another good book and he has written a companion volume on implementing regression in R. If you  are going to be using models other than OLS, then Long Regression Models for Categorical and Limited Dependent Variables (Advanced Quantitative Techniques in the Social Sciences): J. (John) Scott Long: 9780803973749: Amazon.com: Books coves a variety of models in an understandable way. And, if you  want formal proofs and theorems with lots of mathematics, then you will have to wait for someone else to answer!    Embed Quote
