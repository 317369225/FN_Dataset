R, SAS, Excel, Rapid-I RapidMiner/RapidAnalytics, Weka / Pentaho, IBM SPSS, Tableau... What are the pros and cons of the software you use in order to analyze data, find the patterns in the data, model and make predictions ?
I use R a lot, but am shifting more and more to using Python (IPython, Pandas, etc.) esp with the Anaconda platform.  Also using Cascalog and Scalding. In terms of Big Data, wow this question is all over the map. I use PMML, which integrates with a wide range of analytics platforms.    Embed Quote
