★What are the best online sources for learning statistics, advanced statistics, predictive modelling, regression analysis, and so on?I've been reading through some lectures posted online by a Columbia U professor, but I was wondering if anyone came across something for those looking to refresh on our stats knowledge - closer to the introductory side.
Here is another nice introductory course by edx- About Stat2.2x which deals with probability theory. Stat 2.1x was closed on 1st April but you can get all the slides from About Stat2.1x or you can read on following things which you might be knowing already Representing data using histogram, stem and leaf plot Mean, median, mode The normal distribution Correlation coefficient Bivariate normal distribution I was a part of Stat2.1x and it was real fun doing that course. I hope Stat2.2x will be even better than that.    Embed Quote
