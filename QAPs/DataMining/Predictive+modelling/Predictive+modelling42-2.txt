★What are methods to make a predictive model more robust to outliers?
Most people deal with outliers choosing between an L1 over an L2 regularization, as noted in other answers You can also deal with this if you use a weighted SVM, and you have estimate of the confidence of the labels (and the outliers would presumably have lower confidence)    Embed Quote
