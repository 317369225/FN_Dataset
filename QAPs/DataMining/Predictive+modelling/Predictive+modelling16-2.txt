★What is the value of getting certified as a SAS Certified Predictive Modeler?I have recently completed my MBA and am looking at a job in Marketing Analytics. I understand multiple regression and its application but don't have any experience in SAS, which seems to be a must to get a job in Analytics. I am considering getting certified as a SAS Certified Predictive Modeler - but am concerned that the benefit will be marginal. What are your thoughts ?
You said that you know regarding multiple regression and it's application but you don't posses any kinda experience in SAS. So if you are hunting an opportunity in marketing Analytics profile, you definitely need to be SAS certified. Once you get SAS certified in your respective domain, the entrance will become broad for you. Check out this brochure  @Page on Epoch    Embed Quote
