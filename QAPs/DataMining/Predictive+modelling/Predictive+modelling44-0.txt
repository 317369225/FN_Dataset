★Does a good predictive model imply a good explanatory model?If the goal is to explain the contribution of individual predictors, does a better preforming model necessarily lead to better insights about the predictors?
In an ideal world, you would be able to have a model that is both highly predictive and explanatory. As Dirk indicated above, this is not always the case. The reason for this is that when you build a model, you usually have one of two goals in mind: to predict the likelihood of something occurring, or to understand why certain outcomes have taken place in the past. Consequently, you won't be looking at the same diagnostics and goodness-of-fit indicators depending on which goal you have in mind. With an explanatory model, the main focus will be on variable selection and making sure that you understand the impact of each variable in great detail. Which is not to say that you don't pay attention to those things with a predictive model, but your focus will be on correctly predicting types of outcomes and ensuring that this is also the case outside of your modeling dataset.    Embed Quote
