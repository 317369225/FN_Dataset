★What are methods to make a predictive model more robust to outliers?
Here are some changes you can make to your model: Use a model that's resistant to outliers. Tree-based models are generally not as affected by outliers, while regression-based models are. If you're performing a statistical test, try a non-parametric test instead of a parametric one. Use a more robust error metric. As Peter Mills mentions in his excellent answer, switching from mean squared error to mean absolute difference (or something like Huber Loss) reduces the influence of outliers. I explain a bit about why this is the case at Why is the median a measure of central tendency? Here are some changes you can make to your data: Winsorize your data. Artificially cap your data at some threshold. See When are some applications of winsorization? Transform your data. If your data has a very pronounced right tail, try a log transformation. Remove the outliers. This works if there are very few of them and you're fairly certain they're anomalies and not worth predicting.    Embed Quote
