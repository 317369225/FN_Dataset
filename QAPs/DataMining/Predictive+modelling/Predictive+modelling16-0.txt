★What is the value of getting certified as a SAS Certified Predictive Modeler?I have recently completed my MBA and am looking at a job in Marketing Analytics. I understand multiple regression and its application but don't have any experience in SAS, which seems to be a must to get a job in Analytics. I am considering getting certified as a SAS Certified Predictive Modeler - but am concerned that the benefit will be marginal. What are your thoughts ?
