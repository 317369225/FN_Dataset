★How accurate are predictive models?How accurate are predictive models? Or is this a question of..how good is the data?
It is very difficult to answer this question in general for all the predictive models. Different predictive models would have different accuracy. This depends largely on the below points 1) Data used to build the model (Good data --> Good model, garbage in--> garbage out) 2) Algorithm used to build the predictive model. 3) Type of the problem (Ex: Predicting stock prices are much more complicated than predicting the price of house based on location and size. So the second model would have better accuracy compared to the first)    Embed Quote
