★What are the good ways to process unstructured data into structured data to build predictive model?
There is no way that I know of that is built-in.  The most efficient way of doing this would be to parse in the MapReduce jobs. If you don't want to parse the text yourself, there you could try to incorporate creative ways of vectorizing the document, maybe using something like opencsv, Lucene or RecordBreaker. Of course the advantage to parsing the data yourself is having the ability to perform stemming, and removal of stopwords. RecordBreaker Opencsv Frequently Asked Questions    Embed Quote
