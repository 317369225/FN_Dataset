★How has predictive modeling revolutionized insurance?
Quote is from... In Who Owns the Future?, Jaron Lanier is interested in how network technologies affect our culture, economy, and collective soul. His point is regarding the side effects of Predictive Modeling. One of his repeated examples is the health insurance industry using big data to predict and decline or screen out the sick & riskiest citizens. This results in only insuring healthy citizens. This means the industry will Effectively no longer accomplish the benefit to society of spreading risk and reducing individual's risk exposure. Cloud computer services that are concentrating wealth and influence in our era. They go by so many names! There are national intelligence agencies, the famous Silicon Valley companies with nursery school names, the stealthy high finance schemes, and others. All these schemes are quite similar. The biggest computers can predictably calculate wealth and clout on a broad, statistical level. For instance, an insurance company might use massive amounts of data to only insure people who are unlikely to get sick. The problem is that the risk and loss that can be avoided by having the biggest computer still exist. Everyone else must pay for the risk and loss that the insurance company can avoid.    Embed Quote
