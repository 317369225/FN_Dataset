★How do I start building an income prediction model?
To start with you need a sample of latest true (or reliable proxy) income data (of reasonable size) - 'reasonable size' will be a function of all the other relevant attributes you have access to... more the potential predictor variables or stronger the differentiating power of the predictors, smaller will be the required minimum size (observations) of the true data. - Often companies acquire true income data through paid surveys or they buy it from 3rd parties who run such surveys and sell this data to other companies. After that it can be something as simple as a linear regression model - target variable will be true income (continuous numeric variable) and predictors will be all the relevant known attributes you have got for these customers ... important to ensure you choose attributes which you are confident you will have access to in future as well and available for the entire population. Some of the useful attributes can be - car or home ownership, type of car/home, neighborhood, credit/debit card usage, bureau/risk score, rent, mortgage repayment, age, type of profession (social classes in UK), affluence segmentation, brands purchased in recent past etc. - more the attributes, stronger will be your final model!    Embed Quote
