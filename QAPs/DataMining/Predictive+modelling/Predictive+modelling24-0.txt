★What are common approaches to combine several  prediction models into one?Assuming I have a couple of prediction models (e.g., for predicting whether someone will follow someone else on Twitter) and each is built on different attributes probabilities (say tweets content vs. mutual  followed people). What are some techniques for combining those models into a single response (recommend/don't)? and how can they be evaluated?
In case you have completely different methods one using tweet content and another using mutually followed people, both of which give you the same output - recommend/don't, ensemble learning is what you are looking for. This is all about learning to integrate estimates/predictions from multiple algorithms. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens... If you simply want to create one algorithm that incorporates different variables/features  based on tweet content or mutually followed people; then you really trying to frame a regression problem such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log...    Embed Quote
