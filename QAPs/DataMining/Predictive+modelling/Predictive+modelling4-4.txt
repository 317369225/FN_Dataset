★What is the best open source software to use for building predictive models?Any advice on techniques to train the model?  Segment the data?
Liblinear is an excellent library but it is released under GPL. you might be interested in TinySVM which is released under LGPL.http://chasen.org/~taku/software.... For logistic regression, you should check out Paul Komarek's LR-TRIRLS library which is extremely fast. It is released under GPL.http://komarix.org/ac/lr/    Embed Quote
