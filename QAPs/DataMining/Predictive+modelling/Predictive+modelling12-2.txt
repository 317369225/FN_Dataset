R, SAS, Excel, Rapid-I RapidMiner/RapidAnalytics, Weka / Pentaho, IBM SPSS, Tableau... What are the pros and cons of the software you use in order to analyze data, find the patterns in the data, model and make predictions ?
I mostly use R, which happens to be too awesome in this field, both for analytics and visualization, the gplot2 package packs a punch. WEKA for is great as a ML software. Google's OpenRefine is just perfect for cleaning and brushing up your data. Then, coming to the visualization part. Tableau is also a great tool when it comes to beautiful visualizations. and when it comes to visualizing Geographical data, QGis is just perfect.    Embed Quote
