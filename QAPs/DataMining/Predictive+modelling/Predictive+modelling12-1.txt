★What Analytics, Big Data, Data mining, Data Science, Predictive Modelling software you use?Which one do you use ? R, SAS, Excel, Rapid-I RapidMiner/RapidAnalytics, Weka / Pentaho, IBM SPSS, Tableau... What are the pros and cons of the software you use in order to analyze data, find the patterns in the data, model and make predictions ?
I mostly use SAS for large corporate enterprise projects, and R for everything else. Tableau is nice for exploratory analysis, and also connects to a lot of data sources, but doesn't have a lot of predictive capabilities, although I hear that's improving.    Embed Quote
