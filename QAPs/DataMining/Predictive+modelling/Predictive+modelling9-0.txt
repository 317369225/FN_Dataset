★What predictive model uses Cortana?
It depends on contextual based learning, where the Cortana has been already trained to learn and understand natural languages. The backend is developed to learn as the user uses Cortana, and it makes Cortana learn and grow according to the user's needs. When you ask Cortana something, it uses the natural language processing capacity to understand your query. The query is handled by Cortana's backend. When the user speaks the same command again or if the user query ends up in a web search, it acknowledges it as a mistake and tries to re-learn the query and give alternate actions. Cortana can also learn and add new words to its vocabulary by learning from the user, it is done by Cortana asking a series of questions to a user to sort the possible answer and understand the new word.
