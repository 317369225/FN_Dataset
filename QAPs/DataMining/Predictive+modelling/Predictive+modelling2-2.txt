★How does predictive modeling determine credit scores?
Addendum : It uses past behaviour to predict future performance, based on the assumption that the past actually predicts the future. All modeling techniques use the exact same assumption. Therefore, a 32 year old make, who lives in Toronto, who has worked for 8 years, who has made 3 inquiries, who has a credit card utilisation of 34%, who has a 30 day delinquency in the past 2 years, who has a debt service ratio of 19% etc. etc. has a probability of not paying back his loan of 1.3%, for example. There are usually between 8-16 variables in a model depending on the product/purpose/data availability etc.    Embed Quote
