★How can I improve sensitivity of a classification predictive model?
1. There is a trade off between Sensitivity and Specificity, as in Precision and Recall. Before you want to make any changes, think for your own use case, which you weigh more. 2. Are you trying to evaluate your randomForest model? Doing cross validation is a standard approach to give precision and recall. 3. If you want to change sensitivity, you may try to change the threshold that each decision uses to label a case as positive. This will affect both False Positives and False Negatives. Your question does not give us more information, like your use case or the software you are using. Adding such information will make this a better question.    Embed Quote
