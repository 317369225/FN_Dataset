★Which programming languages are useful for implementing predictive models (as opposed to performing the analysis)?Many of the questions I've seen on Quora have been very general, about which languages analysts use. I'm not interested in which languages are used to manage and analyze data (i'm already familiar with SQL and SAS), I want to know one or two languages that are good for implementing models...once you have a model, how do our apply it for the end user? How does this process work in practice?
Finding the best way to implement a model for use begins with examining your goals. Ask yourself or your client questions like these: Is the object to use the model output in a totally automated way (such as automated trading) or to inform a person for individual actions (such as providing recommendations for a customer service person)? Do you need to integrate the model with other systems? (Of course you do!) Does the organization have standards that are relevant? What are your speed requirements? What help is available to you? Are business analysts available (desirable!)? How about programmers? Who has to sign off to put an application into use? Asking and answering questions like these will guide you to reasonable choices for model deployment. The choice of language is one of the last issues you should consider.    Embed Quote
