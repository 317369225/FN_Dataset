★How is predictive modeling used in logistic regression?
As Timothy explained, the question should be phrased "how is logistic regression used for predictive modeling". A common problem that is solved using logistic regression is predicting whether a member will churn (stop using the service/product). The outcome of churn is labeled as 1 and not churned is labeled as 0. Building a logistic regression model on this data set will give you an equation that will assigns a churn probability to each member. You can use this equation in the future to predict whether a member is going to churn or not. There you are, I just gave you an example of how logistic regression is used for predictive modeling.    Embed Quote
