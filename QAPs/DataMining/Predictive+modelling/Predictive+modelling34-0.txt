★Which Amazon EC2 instance is recommended for doing predictive modeling competitions?
It depends on the size your data, the local computer you have, and the time you have to dedicate to waiting for each model to return an answer. For example, I use a MacBook Pro at work that's roughly equivalent to an m1.xlarge or m3.xlarge. So when I decide to use an EC2 instance, I know that I'll be using something larger than that. For the effort of building the data environment remotely, I usually end up using cc2.8xlarge as a spot instance for around $0.30/hr. Both scikit-learn for Python and caret for R can make use of all of the CPUs for certain types of ML algorithms. Of course, there are other considerations using spot instances (it can be turned off by Amazon without warning), but it's a great way to use a lot of power for cheap.    Embed Quote
