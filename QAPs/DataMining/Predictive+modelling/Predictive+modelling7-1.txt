★How do I do predictive modeling without domain expertise?
I agree with William Chen. My only caveat is that it depends on how formalized the predictive modelling challenge is. For example, a Kaggle competition provides an extremely clear goal, with a clear target label and a specific loss function you are to be evaluated on. In these straightforward cases, you can rely on ever more powerful learning algorithms without needing much, if any, domain expertise. Out in the wild, you often need to decide what is worth predicting, and how to evaluate your predictions, taking into account your business goals. This does require domain expertise. For example, if I want to predict ad CTR's, I need to know that calibrated probabilities are very important for business reasons, and that I cannot just focus on rank accuracy. Thus, log loss might be a better metric than AUC to evaluate ad CTR predictions. I would also need to define what constitutes a target event in my training data; I'm not interested in clicks from robots.    Embed Quote
