★Predictive Modeling: Where can I find credit score algorithm?Credit score is based on predictive modeling which considers various factors. How does the mathematical algorithm look like?
You are very vague in terms of which credit score you are looking for? There are many different ones. Most of the information is kept secret because it is the backbone of what companies like  FICO make money from. But you can find a lot of info if you sift through patents so I recommend you start there. I can tell you right now you won't find anything on FICO but there is a good chunk of information on other scores available. I should know, I spend a fair amound perusing patents in my free time.    Embed Quote
