★What are common approaches to combine several  prediction models into one?Assuming I have a couple of prediction models (e.g., for predicting whether someone will follow someone else on Twitter) and each is built on different attributes probabilities (say tweets content vs. mutual  followed people). What are some techniques for combining those models into a single response (recommend/don't)? and how can they be evaluated?
You can split up the data into training and validation. First, train both models on the training data, and then do a weighted average of the models to best fit the validation data. Another similar possibility would be cross validation.    Embed Quote
