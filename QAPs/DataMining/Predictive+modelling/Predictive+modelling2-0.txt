★How does predictive modeling determine credit scores?
These algorithms are proprietary, however the methodology goes something like this for credit cards: Determine the "probability of default".  This can be something like no credit card payment within 90 days, or late payment.  If the technique chosen is logistic regression,  This variable becomes 1 or 0 and is the target or dependent variable. The predictive variables can be the number of late payments, number of accounts open, high balance, number of credit inquiries, number of times a person "defaulted". A list of the usual predictors can be found by web searching . The model can be constructed by using logistic regression. Once the model is constructed, the highest probability of defaults get the lowest risk scores, and the best payors get the highest risk score. This is a relative measure, not an individual measure.  You are ranked against everyone else with a credit score and the actual credit score is normalized over a 3 digit numeric scale, say 400-900. Then each of the scores are organized into deciles, with each decile (or percentile) having a different risk profile.  This would be output via the predictive model.    Embed Quote
