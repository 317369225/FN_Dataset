★How can I deal with missing values in a predictive model?
You are in to the messy realm of data imputation my friend.  I'd like to second William Chen's answer with one correction, which is quite significant. In  methodology (a) - that is data deletion, he uses the word randomly in a very loose way. There are two well defined notions of 'random' missing values. The first is what the statisticians call the Missing completely at random (MCAR), which is the strictest notion of random missing. Simply put, the other variables in the dataset and the unobserved values of the variable that is missing, strictly have zero predictive power regarding whether a value will be missing in this model.  As you might fathom, this is a rather strict notion and is used rather sparsely in literature. The more prevalent relaxed nation is that of Missing at random (MAR). In this model, you are allowed to have  other variables in the dataset that can plausibly shape the missingness prior on a given variable. The flagship example is that in sociological surveys such as that on sexual behavior etc, girls may be more likely to decline to answer some questions than boys (i.e., the categorical variable that is gender predicts missingness of a certain response variable). MI (as suggested by Peter Flom) would be the most organic choice ahead. Joseph Schafer at Penn State has a rather neat FAQ page on MI. Take a look. Multiple imputation FAQ page    Embed Quote
