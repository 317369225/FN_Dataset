★How accurate is Goldman Sachs' 2014 FIFA Wold Cup prediction model?http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-...
About a month before the event kicked off, Goldman Sachs came up the report titledThe World Cup and Economic 2014. With the help of stochastic model it predicted the outcome of all the 64 matches of the World Cup. A Statistical Model of the 2014 World Cup I've done some analysis on this. The below table shows predicted and actual outcome of the group stage matches. 50% weightage is given for correctly predicting the outcome (winner / draw). And it turned out that the number of correct “Result Predictions” are only 17 (out of 48 group matches). Then goal difference is taken into consideration. Out of the rest 50% weightage discrepancy in difference in number of goals is given a negative weightage of 10% (i.e. for the difference of 1 goals 10%, 2 goals 20% etc).   Over all Accuracy The above figure plots the goal difference in each game against the actual goal difference. Over all there is a positive relationship (Correlation Coefficient of 0.30) with not particularly tight with the R Square value of 0.094. Knock Out Stage Out of 16 teams which qualified for the 2nd round, only 10 of them were correctly predicted. Quarter Final, Semi-Final and Final stages   Number of matches which correctly predicted (with exact scores) was only 3.                  Algeria vs Russia (1-1)                  Argentina vs Bosnia (2-1)                  Korea vs Russua (1-1) · Costa-Rica had only 7.7 % of probability of reaching quarterfinals. Spain had the probability of 84.8% of reaching Knockout stage. Brazil had the highest probability (48.5 %) of winning the cup, followed by Argentina (14.1%) and Germany (11.4%).
