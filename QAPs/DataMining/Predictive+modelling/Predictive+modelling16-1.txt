★What is the value of getting certified as a SAS Certified Predictive Modeler?I have recently completed my MBA and am looking at a job in Marketing Analytics. I understand multiple regression and its application but don't have any experience in SAS, which seems to be a must to get a job in Analytics. I am considering getting certified as a SAS Certified Predictive Modeler - but am concerned that the benefit will be marginal. What are your thoughts ?
The most efficient way is to find out if it is valuable with minimal investment on your end. You'd be best off looking at job advertisements for the role that you are interested in applying for and understand what the selection criteria is. There's usually a list of these requirements and if certification or similar is listed or highly regarded then it would be relatively more valuable. If I were you I'd contact the recruiter directly and ask them if it'd make any difference. I would find people on LinkedIn who are currently working in that role or similar and check what their credentials/work history are. Even try asking them or friends you know in the industry as to the importance of certification. Also keep in mind that some companies will provide you with the required training and funding to complete certification.    Embed Quote
