★How can I deal with missing values in a predictive model?
I'll add to  William Chen's excellent answer! If you are working with a very high dimensional data where only a few columns have missing values. It may not be a good idea to remove the whole row if only a couple of the entries are missing. The genomics data, for example, is rife with missing data situations. I've used following imputation(fill-in) methods: Impute the missing value by the mean of the respective column. e.g. if the ages of some of the data points is missing. Impute by linear/logistic regression. This can also work for the missing ages if Imputation by K-nearest neighbors. If you have high dimensional data. Again, William Chen stated, you can choose to use a model which can handle missing values. But sometimes you may not have a (immediate) choice of the model e.g. you want to compute principle components by PCA.    Embed Quote
