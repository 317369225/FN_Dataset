★What are predictive modeling analytics?
This questions sounds strange to me. Prediction or predictive analytics is achieved through data modelling. Everything put together sounds weird to me, maybe it's my bad. In a nutshell what is done is to build a model where a number of predictors allows us to estimate the future value of a given variable. As an example we can predict the return on investment of a marketing campaign given the investment, country, etc.    Embed Quote
