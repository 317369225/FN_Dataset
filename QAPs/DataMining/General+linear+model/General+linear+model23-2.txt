★What are the most important undergraduate courses for someone planning to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning?I'm a junior math major and statistics minor, but I'm going to take 3 or 4 CS electives as a senior and I have room for a few other electives from Math and Statistics.
Machine learning, naturally. Programming of some sort if you don't have it. If you can program, learn how to do it better. Convex Optimization (may not be CS department). Take a "data analysis" class or whatever your school may call it; the curriculum should be focused on analyzing real datasets and include both practical points of programming and model validation. Most importantly, take some grad courses or project-oriented courses! These are the best way to learn what research and a PhD are really like. Gaps in your undergraduate knowledge can always be filled later, but if you enter a PhD program with no clue how to formulate and execute a research project, you have a steep learning curve ahead of you (at least in Machine learning, where there's a lot of low-hanging fruit you should be able to identify and pluck) [also, if you apply to programs without professors who can recommend you after having observed you in a research setting, your prospects will be limited even if you have a great GPA in salient classes]    Embed Quote
