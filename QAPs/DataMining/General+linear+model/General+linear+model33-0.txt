★Why can a regression function not handle non-linear relationships? Is there another form of regression that is designed for non-linear relationships?
The linear model can handle a VERY broad range of nonlinear relationships. For instance polynomial regression can deal with nonlinearities, to some degree, though in general penalized splines are much better than polynomial regression. There are other ways to use nonlinear basis functions that are combined in a linear fashion, such as Fourier series. There are other kinds of nonlinearities that the linear model really can't cope with well or at all. A generalized linear model is a nonlinear regression model where the nonlinearity is concentrated in the link function, which is a monotone transformation of the predicted values to the proper space for the expected value. This is necessary to perform regression on binary variables, where the regression (aka predicted probability) is subject to boundedness. Nonlinear regression models are another option.    Embed Quote
