★What are easy to understand examples of all the different types of ANOVAs?
Don't try to think of analysis of variance in these terms. Try to think of it in terms of a general linear model (a regression model). You have some predictors, and you have an outcome. Perhaps your predictor is a single categorical variable (that's one way anova).  Perhaps you have two categorical variables and want their interaction - that means you have two main effect predictor variables and one interaction term predictor variable, so you have three predictor variables.  Also, don't think about what they tell you, think about what you want to know. Then think about how to get it.    Embed Quote
