★How do I deal with normalization of feature vectors when they contain both discrete and continuous valued features?
It depends on your ML algorithms, some methods requires almost no efforts to normalize features or handle both continuous and discrete features, like tree based methods: c4.5, Cart, random Forrest, bagging or boosting. But most of parametric models (generalized linear models, neural network, SVM,etc) or methods using distance metrics (KNN, kernels, etc) will require careful work to achieve good results. Standard approaches including binary all features, 0 mean unit variance all continuous features, etc    Embed Quote
