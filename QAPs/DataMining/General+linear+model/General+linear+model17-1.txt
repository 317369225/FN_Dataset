★What are some great statistics or data science classes to take at Harvard or MIT in Spring 2015?
Professor Joe Blitzstein's answer also carries my top two choices. I'd like to add: Stat 139 (Linear Models): Before you can fit curved lines (Stat 149), you must of course be able to fit straight ones! Fortunately, Stat 139 is being offered (for the first time?) in the spring semester this year, with Kevin Rader (who has been teaching Stat 111, and taught Stat 110 this past semester). It looks to be a fantastic course, with fantastic teaching staff (full disclaimer: I will be serving as a TF for this course ;) Stat 201 (Statistical Graphics): Prof. Andrew Gelman is famous for his presentations and use of graphics, so this may be an interesting seminar to check out. It's pretty clear that most aspiring data scientists (and current ones, too!) can use a refresher on clear communication of data and results. CS 205 (Parallel Computing): With larger and larger data sets, it's often useful to be able to tackle problems on Amazon S3 or other clusters. This year's rendition promises more applications in machine learning according to the teaching staff, rather than in the physical sciences, so it appears to be a solid choice to complement your statistical foundation.    Embed Quote
