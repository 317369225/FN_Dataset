★What are some good books for learning probability and statistics?Which are some of the most famous books on probability and randomness which provides some great intuition about the field. Most of the common textbooks refereed mostly focus on various formulas and theorems. Are their books which emphasize more on intuition rather than formulas. Basically interested in both theoretical paradoxes and interesting inferences from real world statistics.
The list provided by Justin Rising was one of the best compilations of stats books, and thus I'll just add my 2 cents. As mentioned in his list, The Elements of Statistical Learning: data mining, inference, and prediction. 2nd Edition. is a great book but for advanced stats. But there is a newer 'prequel' to this book, Amazon.com: An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics) (9781461471370): Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani: Books published in 2013 which is perfect for hands on understanding for somebody who is just getting started with statistical analysis. It has great explanations and the exercises assist in your learning too.    Embed Quote
