★What are some good books for learning probability and statistics?Which are some of the most famous books on probability and randomness which provides some great intuition about the field. Most of the common textbooks refereed mostly focus on various formulas and theorems. Are their books which emphasize more on intuition rather than formulas. Basically interested in both theoretical paradoxes and interesting inferences from real world statistics.
One of my favorite gems is An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements by Taylor.  In addition to having an awesome cover photo, it offers a lucid and practical introduction to error analysis and is a good stepping stone to more comprehensive works like Wasserman's All of Statistics.    Embed Quote
