★Why can a regression function not handle non-linear relationships? Is there another form of regression that is designed for non-linear relationships?
You can look for certain kinds of non-linear relationships using regression (i.e. if you think you can express things as a polynomial).  For more general problems where you can't even do this you have to use some minimization algorithm and use it to minimize the error (i.e. the difference of the model and the observations).  Using a minimization algorithm on a non-linear problem brings with it a whole host of issues, so you really need to know the mathematics of what is going on.    Embed Quote
