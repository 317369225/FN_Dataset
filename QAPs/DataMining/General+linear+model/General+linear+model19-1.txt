★What are some courses on Coursera (or anything on par with it) which an MBA aspirant can take to make his CV stronger during the PI at B-Schools?
You can sign up on http://Skillacademy.com for free and you'll find a set of programmes for each MBA path you are looking to specialise in i.e. enterpreneurship, strategy, etc. The courses are organised in year 1, 2, 3 and 4 and you can take them by just signing up to each of them and follow the programme. Amongst the MOOC providers are Coursera, NovoEd, Udacity, Udemy, etc. It's all free if you want or just pay for the verified track if you want to...good to study as each course is from reputable universities and form part of their official curriculum though they are provided as non-credit ones...I think that if you are really into building something of value, it's a good way to start and very cheap one!    Embed Quote
