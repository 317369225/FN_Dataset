★What are some good books for learning probability and statistics?Which are some of the most famous books on probability and randomness which provides some great intuition about the field. Most of the common textbooks refereed mostly focus on various formulas and theorems. Are their books which emphasize more on intuition rather than formulas. Basically interested in both theoretical paradoxes and interesting inferences from real world statistics.
A first basic level could be books like Cartoon Guide to Statistics and Head First Statistics After the initial understanding, one might be better off reading through an undergraduate/graduate college statistics book either from library or get an earlier edition of the currently popular book, e.g. http://www.amazon.com/Statistics... Statistics in a Nutshell is another book worth reading After that, one has to start focusing on specific areas as well as learn R - for example Fundamentals of Biostatistics by Rosner is on my reading list, as I am interested in BioInformatics and working towards my degree at JHU. I also own Bayesian Computation with R The best way to learn is to get couple of good books as well as have a hands-on learning with R[Update May 19,2012] Paulo Roberto Araujo suggests "A Treatise on Probability by John Maynard Keynes". Thanks Paulo, Link to the book from Project Gutenberg http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/... Another good book - Introduction to Probability, 2nd Edition by Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis [http://www.amazon.com/Introducti...
