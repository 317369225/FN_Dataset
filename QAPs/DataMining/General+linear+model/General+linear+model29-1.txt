★What are some good models for predicting continuous response variables?Other than multiple linear regression?
Almost all are generalizations of the linear model. There are generalized linear models for continuous responses, such as gamma or inverse Gaussian regression for or beta regression or a Bernoulli quasi-likelihood model for . Nonparametric or semi-parametric approaches like nearest neighbor regression are also possible.    Embed Quote
