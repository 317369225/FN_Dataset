★What are some good books for learning probability and statistics?Which are some of the most famous books on probability and randomness which provides some great intuition about the field. Most of the common textbooks refereed mostly focus on various formulas and theorems. Are their books which emphasize more on intuition rather than formulas. Basically interested in both theoretical paradoxes and interesting inferences from real world statistics.
You shouldn't go for intuition. Statistics is great when you need to get away from intuitive errors... So do try and learn the maths! If you just want to know "about" statistics, read The Signal and the Noise As for books and other materials: - classical statistics: any statistics 101 course (Probability and statistics or You searched for statistics - Academic Earth) - bayesian analysis: Bayesian Computation With R or Doing Bayesian Data Analysis I would strongly recommend R : Online R tutorials and Data Science Courses - DataCamp or Coursera (or others: R - Books)    Embed Quote
