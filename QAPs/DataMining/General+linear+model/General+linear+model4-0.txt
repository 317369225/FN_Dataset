★What is a generalized linear model in layman's terms?
As the name suggests, GLM models are the generalization of the linear regression model. When we speak about this generalization. we mean that rather than forcing a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, it allows the dependent variable to be related with the independent variables through a link function. Here, is the link function through which we are relating the variables. Depending on the problem we can choose the link function to be logit, probit, linear etc. It gives us a lot of freedom in choosing the specification of the model for a given problem.    Embed Quote
