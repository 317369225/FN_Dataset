★What is the best book ever written on regression modeling / predictive modeling?
Peter Flom , I know SAS package for Statistical Analysis, can you recommend one or two books( one for each technique will also do- which means adequate details is provided  ) to cover basic Analytic Techniques like Linear , Logistic , decision trees but with an emphasis on business data (not social sciences n all)   Plus among the books mentioned - Chatterjee is what i would be buying if i dont get any business focussed book with datasets( for regression) - Your recommendation??
