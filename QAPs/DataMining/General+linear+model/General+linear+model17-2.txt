★What are some great statistics or data science classes to take at Harvard or MIT in Spring 2015?
It's not statistics, but I would strongly recommend considering the optimization courses at MIT. The field's breadth is not as strongly emphasized at Harvard, but at MIT you'll find the entire array of linear, discrete, nonlinear, including convex, optimization. It's also a pretty important subject, and not one people most strongly think of when considering data and analytics, although optimization-related methods like gradient descent are used in supervised learning algorithms such as regression.    Embed Quote
