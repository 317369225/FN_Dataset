★What classes should I take at Harvard if I want to become a data scientist?
I like William Chen answer very much, and I have just one topic to add. Miodrag Lovric, a Nobel Prize nominee, did an interesting suggestion in a series of courses which I attended: Double major for anyone on tech professions, including statisticians, CS majors and BScs on pure sciences. As as isolated thing, Data Science has little value - you can scrape data off somewhere and analyze it, but without a subject domain application you will make no money nor anything else out of your analysis. If you have a double major, even if you never actually get a job related to that major, you already have an idea about how to apply your Data Science knowledge outside the "little data scraper" comfort zone.    Embed Quote
