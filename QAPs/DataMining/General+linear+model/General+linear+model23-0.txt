★What are the most important undergraduate courses for someone planning to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning?I'm a junior math major and statistics minor, but I'm going to take 3 or 4 CS electives as a senior and I have room for a few other electives from Math and Statistics.
This is just a course list to answer your immediate question but you should approach preparation how Jacob suggests (find professors to do research with). This also depends on the program you apply to. This list is for stats/applied maths departments. If you are going for CS then it will be different. Most important Linear Algebra (take advanced if you can) Mathematical Statistics I and II Real Analysis Measure Theory After these, it is basically, the more proof-based math courses, the better. Great to have Numerical Analysis Discrete Math/ Combinatorics Stochastic Processes Regression/ General linear models Algorithms Machine Learning Data Mining Operations Research    Embed Quote
