★Why do beta coefficients estimated by hierarchical linear modeling and generalized hierarchical modeling differ almost by the factor of 10?I used binomial dependent variable and three independent varialbes. In HLM estimate for one independent variable was 0.047 and using GHLM it was 0.350. Similar for other variables.
Thanks for the A2A. First, as I said in a comment, you shouldn't be doing linear regression here, since the DV is binomial. That said, what's going on is that properly accounting for the dependence in the data has changed a coefficient. An intuitive way of thinking about this is as a generalization of the difference between an independent sample t-test and a matched t-test. If matching is appropriate, the t-statistic will often be much larger. e.g. Suppose you are testing the effect of a weight loss program: If you weigh 20 people at start and finish, then do both an independent sample t-test and a matched t-test, you will find (almost certainly) that the latter is much larger and more significant.    Embed Quote
