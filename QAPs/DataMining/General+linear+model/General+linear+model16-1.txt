★What classes should I take at Harvard if I want to become a data scientist?
I'd add to Chen's 'Foundation' a course on information management (SQL, noSQL, column-oriented, etc.), e.g. CS 165. Data handling is a big deal when you're dealing with large datasets. Another thing, though: Harvard has all sorts of people doing interesting quantitative work in a variety of fields, including economics, epidemiology, sociology, government, linguistics, biology, etc. etc. It would be very worthwhile to learn about one of these fields in depth and work on applying data science techniques to them.    Embed Quote
