★What are some great statistics or data science classes to take at Harvard or MIT in Spring 2015?
There are a lot of highly relevant Stat and CS courses next semester, but to name two I would suggest Stat 149 and CS 181. Stat 149 delves into generalized linear models, which are a powerful generalization of linear regression, and also introduces some other useful methods and models such as generalized additive models, classification and regression trees, and random forests. These are valuable additions to a data scientist's toolbox. I think there will also be a Kaggle prediction project. By the way, Mark Glickman, who teaches Stat 149, is famous as the inventor of the Glicko rating system, which is widely used to rate players in chess and other sports and games. Glicko was part of the inspiration for the Kaggle competition Chess ratings - Elo versus the Rest of the World. See Lili Jiang's answer to What is like to take CS 181 (Machine Learning) at Harvard? for an up to date review of CS 181. It gives a probabilistic perspective on machine learning and covers a bunch of extremely useful methods and models. Stat 149 uses R and CS 181 uses Python. I recommend learning both.    Embed Quote
