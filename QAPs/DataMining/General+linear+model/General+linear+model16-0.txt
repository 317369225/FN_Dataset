★What classes should I take at Harvard if I want to become a data scientist?
A Data Science bachelors degree doesn't exist at Harvard, but if it did I think these would be some good requirements for it. :) IMHO, BASIC REQUIREMENTS (12 half courses) FOUNDATION (6 courses) Stat 110 - Intro to Probability [fall] Stat 111 - Intro to Inference [spring] CS 109 / Stat 121 - Data Science [fall] CS 181 - Machine Learning [spring] Stat 139 - Linear Models [fall] Stat 183 - Predictive Modeling [spring] BREADTH AND APPLICATION (choose 6) Mathematics Math 21a - Multivariable Calculus (or equivalent) Math 21b - Linear Algebra (or equivalent) AM 121 - Optimization [fall] Programming CS 50 - Intro to CS [fall] CS 51 - Intro to CS [spring] CS 164 - Software Engineering [spring] Data Analysis and Techniques Stat 131 - Time Series Analysis Stat 160 - Survey Analysis Stat 186 - Causal Inference Stat 149 - Generalized Linear Models Stat 135 - Statistical Software Stat 140 - Experimental Design CS 171 - Visualization CS 187 - Natural Language Processing [fall] Theory CS 121 - Theory of Computation [fall] CS 124 - Data Structures and Algorithms [spring] CS 186 - Economics and Computation [spring] Other CS 105 - Privacy and Technology Supervised Study CS 91r - Supervised Study Stat 91r - Supervised Study Advanced Data Science Any 200-level CS or Statistics class (in particular CS 281: Advanced Machine Learning and Stat 220: Bayesian Data Analysis) HONORS REQUIREMENTS (14 half courses and thesis) Requirements above 2 more breadth classes A thesis This should be the best selection of Harvard courses to take in order to prepare for a career in Data Science. Of course, you'll need an actual degree plan to graduate. Statistics and CS would require the least additional classes to add to above (and are fantastic for a future data scientist!)
