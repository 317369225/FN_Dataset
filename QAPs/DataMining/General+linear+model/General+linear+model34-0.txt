★How can a machine learning algorithm be developed ?What is the process of coming up with a new machine learning algorithm? What is the intuition behind?
Very few genuinely new algorithms are developed. Almost all advances are improvements on existing algorithms. Here's some history: Linear Regression. Most obvious algorithm and has essentially been used since the beginning of time. Logistic Regression. Improvement on Linear Regression that allows for some more variation. Generalized Linear Models. Continuing improvements on Linear/Logistic regression to address various weaknesses. Perceptron. Yet another linear model that's also easily calculated. Multilayer Perceptron. Improvement on the perceptron inspired by the structure of the human brain. Neural Network. Generalization of the multilayer perceptron to allow for non-linear, highly varying functions. Deep Learning. Unsupervised training to help reduce variance on NNs. So your best bet is typically to study the existing algorithms, figure out what their weaknesses are, and come up with improvements to fix those weaknesses.    Embed Quote
