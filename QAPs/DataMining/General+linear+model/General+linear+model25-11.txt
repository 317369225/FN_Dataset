★What are some good books for learning probability and statistics?Which are some of the most famous books on probability and randomness which provides some great intuition about the field. Most of the common textbooks refereed mostly focus on various formulas and theorems. Are their books which emphasize more on intuition rather than formulas. Basically interested in both theoretical paradoxes and interesting inferences from real world statistics.
This is a great book for anyone who either: a) needs a refresher on basic statistics b) has a solid understanding of basic statistics but needs to explain their methods to less analytical people I have two other engineering-level statistics books on my shelf from undergrad but I always reach for this first before diving deeper. http://www.amazon.com/Cartoon-Gu...    Embed Quote
