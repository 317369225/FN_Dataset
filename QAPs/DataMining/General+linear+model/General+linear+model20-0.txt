★What are generalized additive models?What is the best intuitive explanation for generalized additive models? How do they differ from linear models?
A generlized additive model (GAM) is much more flexible than a general linear model (GLM - aka Regression/ANOVA). A GAM is of the form and the f and g functions can be just about anything: Parametric, nonparametric, splines, you name it In a GLM the f functions would have to be numbers and the g function doesn't exist. In generalized linear models (confusingly, also called GLM) it's sort of in between - essentially, there is a g function but no f functions.    Embed Quote
