★What is the best book ever written on regression modeling / predictive modeling?
Practical Regression and Anova using R Julian J. Faraway I'm unsure as to whether or not it is the best book ever written on regression modeling, but it's Free Well written and easily digestible Has loads of working examples Everything written in R with libraries Doesn't require previous R knowledge, so it can be used to learn R and regression modeling simultaneously Focused on applied with real, messy data sets Is rigorous enough theoretically to leave one comfortable on intuition and justification Has tons of corresponding guides and coures posted online that make use of it Short If you aren't convinced enough, check out this excerpt from the preface. "The emphasis of this text is on the practice of regression and analysis of variance. The objective is to learn what methods are available and more importantly, when they should be applied. Many examples are presented to clarify the use of the techniques and to demonstrate what conclusions can be made. There is relatively less emphasis on mathematical theory, partly because some prior knowledge is assumed and partly because the issues are better tackled elsewhere. Theory is important because it guides the approach we take. I take a wider view of statistical theory. It is not just the formal theorems. Qualitative statistical concepts are just as important in Statistics because these enable us to actually do it rather than just talk about it. These qualitative principles are harder to learn because they are difﬁcult to state precisely but they guide the successful experienced Statistician. Data analysis cannot be learnt without actually doing it. This means using a statistical computing package. There is a wide choice of such packages. They are designed for different audiences and have different strengths and weaknesses. I have chosen to use R (ref. Ihaka and Gentleman (1996)). Why do I use R ? The are several reasons."    Embed Quote
