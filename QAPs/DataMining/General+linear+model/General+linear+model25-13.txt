★What are some good books for learning probability and statistics?Which are some of the most famous books on probability and randomness which provides some great intuition about the field. Most of the common textbooks refereed mostly focus on various formulas and theorems. Are their books which emphasize more on intuition rather than formulas. Basically interested in both theoretical paradoxes and interesting inferences from real world statistics.
If you want to learn basic probability, and I mean theorems rather than programming libraries, I'd recommend Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes by Papoulis. It's less focused on statistics however.    Embed Quote
