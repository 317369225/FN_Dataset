★How does predict() function in R work?
If, in R, you type ?predict you will get the following predict is a generic function for predictions from the results of various model fitting functions. The function invokes particular methods which depend on the class of the first argument. Now, I am the first to admit that some of the descriptions in R are somewhat opaque, but this one seems pretty clear: predict gives the predictions from a model; exactly how it works depend on what type of model. A little further down on the help page is a list of predict functions, e.g. predict.glm will give predictions (optionally to newdata) from a general linear model - further divided because there are many such models.    Embed Quote
