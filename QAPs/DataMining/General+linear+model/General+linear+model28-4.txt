★What are some good resources for learning about statistical analysis?This is a follow-up on How do I become a data scientist?
Not sure how extensive their statistics videos get, but KhanAcademy.org is an excellent resource for learning anything from statistics to calculus to finance, physics, and medicine. The site has about 4,000 videos on dozens of topics, most of them taught by Salman Khan himself. They are typically around 10 or so minutes long in which Khan talks through the subject matter while writing notes and drawing key illustrations on a digital blackboard. Kinda like what your teacher in an actual classroom would write on the whiteboard at the front of your class. Khan has an informal, cool demeanor and makes clear and concise points. His lessons are universally easy to follow. Again, I'm not sure if they are as complex of lessons as you are looking for. But check it out, definitely worth your time!    Embed Quote
