★What are the most important undergraduate courses for someone planning to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning?I'm a junior math major and statistics minor, but I'm going to take 3 or 4 CS electives as a senior and I have room for a few other electives from Math and Statistics.
From my perspective, definitely take some mathematical courses, such as stochastic process, statistics, numerical optimization, etc. In my opinion, it is very hard to come up with new ideas in this area today. If you take a look at the papers published in ICML recently, you may have a feeling that researchers are playing mathematical tricks. In other words, they make patches to some existing methods so that those methods can have some advantages in certain applications, which are still good. As a new grad student, in order to do such research, you need read a lot (because you need know the background and know the details of previous models so that you can make your own patches). The bar is pretty high. Therefore, when you are undergrad, train yourself to be good at maths, this is the basic thing in this area. And try to read as much as you can, for example, the graphical models by Michael Jordan. Regarding the typical CS courses, I think what you need is the basic ability to write code. Maybe you want to be familiar with Matlab.    Embed Quote
