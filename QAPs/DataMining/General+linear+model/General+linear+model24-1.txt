★What are some general ways to improve multiple linear regression models?i.e. What are some ways to increase the adjusted R^2 of a model?
Before running the regression, I often do exploratory analysis and look at plots of the different explanatory variables vs. the response variable. Sometimes the relationship between x and y isn't necessarily linear, and you might be better off with a transformation like y=log(x), e^x, or x^2. If there are interactions between features, also try using interaction terms to capture this. Stepwise regression is helpful for selecting the optimal subset of features to use in the regression model.    Embed Quote
