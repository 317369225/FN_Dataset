★What classes should I take at Harvard if I want to become a data scientist?
William Chen has a fantastic answer to this question. I really enjoy thinking about these things, so I thought I'd propose a separate set of requirements in case someone wanted a different perspective. BASIC REQUIREMENTS (13-15 half courses) FOUNDATION (10-12 courses) Mathematics (2-4 courses) Math 1a - Single Variable Calculus (optional*) Math 1b - Calculus and Series (optional*) Math 21a - Multivariable Calculus** Math 21b - Linear Algebra and Differential Equations** *Students may place out of one or both of Math 1a and Math 1b **Students may replace Math 21ab with AM 21ab or Math 23ab Statistics (3 courses) Stat 110 - Intro to Probability Stat 111 - Intro to Inference Stat 139 - Linear Models Programming (2 courses) CS 50 - Intro to CS CS51 - Intro to CS Data Science (3 courses) CS 109 / Stat 121 - Data Science CS 181 - Machine Learning Stat 183 - Predictive Modeling BREADTH (3 courses*) Mathematics AM120 or Math 121 - Applied Linear Algebra AM 121 - Optimization Computer Science (1+ courses) CS 91r - Supervised Study CS 124 - Data Structures and Algorithms CS 164 - Software Engineering CS 165 - Data Systems CS 171 - Visualization CS 186 - Economics and Computation CS 187 - Natural Language Processing CS 205 - Computing Foundations CS 207 - Systems Development CS 281 - Advanced Machine Learning CS 282r - Decision-making Under Uncertainty CS 283 - Computer Vision CS 284r - Computation in Networks and Crowds CS 286r - Advanced Economics and Computation CS 287r - Advanced Natural Language Processing CS 288r - Advanced Computer Vision Statistics (1+ courses) Stat 91r - Supervised Study Stat 120 - Intro to Bayesian Inference Stat 131 - Time Series Analysis Stat 135 - Statistical Software Stat 140 - Experimental Design Stat 149 - Generalized Linear Models Stat 160 - Survey Analysis Stat 186 - Causal Inference Stat 201 - Communicating Statistics Stat 220 - Bayesian Data Analysis Stat 210a - Probability Theory Stat 211a - Statistical Inference Stat 221 - Statistical Computing and Learning Stat 230 - Multivariate Statistical Analysis Stat 231 - Time Series Analysis Stat 232r - Missing Data Stat 242 - Resampling and Bootstrapping *Of the three breadth courses, at least one must be taken from the computer science subcategory and at least one from the statistics subcategory Note: I'm not sure that all of the graduate school courses listed are available to undergraduates, but the ones listed I think would be beneficial. HONORS REQUIREMENTS (15-17 half courses) Same requirements as above 2 additional breadth courses To be eligible for high honors, also complete a thesis    Embed Quote
