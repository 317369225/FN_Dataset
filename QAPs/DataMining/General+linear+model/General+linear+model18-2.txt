★What is Least Angle Regression and when should it be used?
It's a neat algorithm for solving Lasso/L1-regularized regression problems.  It should be used when overfitting is a concern, or one wants to have sparse parameter values (most parameter values set to zero). My attempt to explain the algorithm: L1-regularized problems put a penalty weight (call it \beta) on having nonzero parameter values.  Least Angle Regression is a method for starting from \beta=0 parameters (the easy to solve, unregularized version), and increasing \beta till it reaches the desired value.    Embed Quote
