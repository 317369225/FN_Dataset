★What are some good models for predicting continuous response variables?Other than multiple linear regression?
There  are many. One that I think is very underutilized is quantile regression, which models (or predicts) quantiles of the response variable, rather than the mean. This is, I think, often useful. For instance: If you are a credit card company you may be particularly interested in what predicts people who default on large amounts of money. If you are a neonatologist you certainly are interested in predicting very low birth weights, not just the mean Another is spline regression; recently I have been reading about multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and they seem quite cool. Then there are regression trees and their elaborations such as forests. Lots of others too.    Embed Quote
