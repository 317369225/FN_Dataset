★Growth Hacking: How do you find insights like Facebook's "7 friends in 10 days" to grow your product faster?Assuming one tracks core product engagement actions and has data scale, how does one (having SQL chops) uncover tipping points like these for a (generic) Web app?
David Cook's response is a great answer! I thought a stepwise regression might be the best way to approach the process of finding an operational metric. As far as what Facebook's process really was, all I was able to find was this article about last year's Growth Hackers conference: "[Chamath Palihapitiya] said that they looked at cohorts of users that became engaged, and cohorts of users that did not become engaged, and the pattern that emerged was that the engaged cohorts had hit at least 7 friends within 10 days of signing up."  Source: http://www.richardprice.io/post/.... A regression essentially does what Chamath is talking about.  I watched this talk at the conference, and he didn't seem to offer anything more than that-- so absent additional insights, I would try a regression and see if the r-squared you end up with is a high number (I'm thinking that if it's not, you might want to tag some additional 'potentially explanatory' events and gather some more data before trying again.)  Hope to hear from more folks on this.    Embed Quote
