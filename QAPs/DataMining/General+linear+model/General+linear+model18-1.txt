★What is Least Angle Regression and when should it be used?
I will try adding some personal views on the strength and applications of LARS, mostly from my recent experiences of implementing and applying to a real world problem: It is the first Path algorithm which computed the whole regularization path solutions with the same complexity as OLS It is state of art to solve L1 regularized linear regression or logistic regression (with IRLS) before glmnet comes out in 2009. It offers unified explanation of Forward Selection, Stagewise regression (boosting/gbm) and LASSO. Mathematical elegance close to magic. But from the view of computational efficiency, I think that GLMNET was far more superior solution to the similar problem (LASSO or Elastic-Net regularized generalized linear model), GLMNET is: Simpler, Faster, more flexible Easily adapted to Map-Reduce    Embed Quote
