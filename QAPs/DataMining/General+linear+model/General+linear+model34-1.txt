★How can a machine learning algorithm be developed ?What is the process of coming up with a new machine learning algorithm? What is the intuition behind?
Study everything else out there.  Study some things in depth.  Think really hard.  Think some more.  Try out a candidate algorithm.  Think even more.  Make the necessary changes.  Repeat a few times until it works. I think it's very telling that for as many people who are working on the problem of classification, there are still only about ten or so basic algorithms.  Almost everything else is a modification of one of these.    Embed Quote
