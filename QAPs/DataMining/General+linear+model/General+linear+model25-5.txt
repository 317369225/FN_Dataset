★What are some good books for learning probability and statistics?Which are some of the most famous books on probability and randomness which provides some great intuition about the field. Most of the common textbooks refereed mostly focus on various formulas and theorems. Are their books which emphasize more on intuition rather than formulas. Basically interested in both theoretical paradoxes and interesting inferences from real world statistics.
My list is somewhat heterodox, but honestly these are the books I would introduce to myself at a younger age. Julian James Faraway, Applied Linear Models in R Joshua Angrist and Jorn-Steffen Pischke, Mostly Harmless Econometrics Cosma Shalizi, Almost None of the Theory of Stochastic Processes Richard Jeffrey, Subjective Probability: The Real Thing John Kruschke, Doing Bayesian Data Analysis (reviewed by Luis Apiolaza) John W Tukey, Exploratory Data Analysis Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information and Statistical Analysis for Social ScientistsI would add in a book that applies stats/probability to an interest area of yours. For example Brownian motion in finance, statistical mechanics/thermodynamics/cond-mat, machine learning (eg ElemStatLearn), information theory/coding theory, time series (check John Cochrane's notes), philosophy of probability (check out Ian Hacking's book on the history of probability as a concept), random number generation in cryptography ("true randomness"), quantum probability (check out Itamar Pitowsky's book), risk management--whatever fits your interests. A number of people have weighed in on this question on John D Cook's blog: Elementary statistics book recommendation.    Embed Quote
