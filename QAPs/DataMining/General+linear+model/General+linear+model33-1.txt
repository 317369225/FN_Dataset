★Why can a regression function not handle non-linear relationships? Is there another form of regression that is designed for non-linear relationships?
Linear regression can (oddly enough) handle many nonlinear relationships.  Linear regression means that the regression is linear in the parameters. Thus a model such as is linear regression. Linear regression cannot handle this sort of thing: but nonlinear regression can. Then there are even more general models, e.g. Generalized additive models and multvariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). In 2 weeks I will be giving a paper on MARS models and some other spline models at SAS Global Forum.  It's not online yet, but should be up by the end of this month (April, 2015). MARS models are really cool, in my opinion.    Embed Quote
