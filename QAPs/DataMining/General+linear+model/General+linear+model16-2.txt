★What classes should I take at Harvard if I want to become a data scientist?
I think William Chen has it right, but I would also add that it's often more fun and more rewarding to do data science combined with some "domain knowledge." It keeps you from making mistakes of interpretation and can also yield exciting hypotheses for future study. With that in mind, I'd consider adding courses from another field. MCB (my own bias), OEB, psychology, sociology, economics, and even government are choices that immediately come to mind. That said, I think almost any other discipline could be a productive combination. I mean, if you managed to do a data-sciency thesis on systems for data visualization in VES, for instance, that would be extremely baller.    Embed Quote
