★How should I work on statistics required for experimental design and data analysis (neural data/ behavioural data) in first year of grad school?I have studied some statistics in the past, but not in the context of neuroscience research. I have data on cognitive neuroscience projects, for which I need to understand various ways of analysing neural data. Please suggest online resources/ books/papers.
I'd recommend watching lectures on statistics and hypothesis testing at EdX or Coursera. If you have some idea of the kind of data analysis you will be doing in your lab, or during your rotations, you can try to focus on those methods. For spiking data you might want to read up on spike sorting. Knowing about correlations, covariance matrices, correlograms and so on will come in handy. Don't try to read up on the latest fancy techniques until you understand regression, correlation, and generalized linear models. Understaning p values will come in handy too: read up on Student's t test and ANOVA. Even Wikipedia can often be a good starting point, after which you can seek course material that best suits your needs. There are quite a few resources out there for stats, so just google! University course material is your best bet. Not sure about experimental design -- there may be open courseware out there.    Embed Quote
