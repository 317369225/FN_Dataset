★What are some good books for learning probability and statistics?Which are some of the most famous books on probability and randomness which provides some great intuition about the field. Most of the common textbooks refereed mostly focus on various formulas and theorems. Are their books which emphasize more on intuition rather than formulas. Basically interested in both theoretical paradoxes and interesting inferences from real world statistics.
"A First Course in Probability" by Sheldon Ross is a great book to start with. It is one of the most popular textbooks/supplementary textbooks in an university (introductory) level probability course (It was used while I was in Berkeley and It was used as a reference at Stanford). The book is concise and clean when explaining the concepts, and it doesn't go into too much mathematical details. The exercises are well designed and really illuminating. More specifically, the exercises show you how to apply the analytical tools in various setting (although they can be tricky from time to time). http://www.amazon.com/First-Cour...    Embed Quote
