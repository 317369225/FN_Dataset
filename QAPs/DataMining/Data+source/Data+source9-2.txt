Which data sources would survive on Earth for longest time?
I have heard of Genealogy maintained in Haridwar by Priests (called Pandas in Hindi). This consists of registers with information that can help one to chase the roots of their existance. I am not sure though how old they are, but can vouch that they are more than 500 year old. Would be great if someone can throw some light on it.
