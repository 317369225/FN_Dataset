★Where can I find large datasets open to the public?
Since I haven't seen it mentioned yet, and work at one of the main sources of its data: SMOKA, the Subaru-Mitaka-Okayama-Kiso Archive, holds about 15 TB of astronomical data from facilities run by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.  All data becomes publicly available after an embargo period of 12-24 months (to give the original observers time to publish their papers). With over a decade of data from some facilities and instruments, it has now become possible for many researchers to make discoveries just by looking at archived data for something other than what the original observers had in mind. Astrophotographer Robert Gendler has also processed images from the SMOKA archive to create several "NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day" winners.    Embed Quote
