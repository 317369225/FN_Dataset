★What is an intuitive explanation of why kinetic energy is not a linear function of velocity?i.e., Why does it take more energy to accelerate an object from 20 to 21 miles per hour than from 10 to 11 miles per hour?
First, I want to point out an insightful answer to this question on Physics.Stackexchange. It is completely different from this answer, and worth reading. It uses a simple thought experiment hinging on Galilean relativity. http://physics.stackexchange.com... Suppose you throw one ball up at 10 m/s and another at 20 m/s.   How many times higher does the second ball go? Gravity pulls on them the same way, subtracting 10m/s from their velocity.  That means it takes the first ball 1 second to get to the top of its arc, while the second ball takes 2 seconds. In addition, the second ball goes twice as fast.  The first ball goes from 10 m/s to 0, so its average speed is 5m/s.  Meanwhile the average speed of the second ball during its rise is 10 m/s. The second ball is in the air for twice as long and goes twice as fast.  Therefore it goes four times as high.  Since all the kinetic energy gets converted to potential energy in this process, the second ball, though moving twice as fast, had four times as much kinetic energy.    Embed Quote
