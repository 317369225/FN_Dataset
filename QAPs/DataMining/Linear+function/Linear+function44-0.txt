★Can integrals be thought of as inner products on infinite dimensional spaces?
Integrals are linear functionals on (usually) infinite-dimensional spaces. An integral takes one thing (a function) and returns a number, so it's a functional. An inner product takes two things and returns a number. You can get an inner product by setting so now it's the integral of the product of the two inputs. That works, though you want to perform some technical modifications if you want this to be a genuine inner product (you need to work with "almost always" equalities). EDIT: one commenter seemed to think that I think I've just made this up. To clarify, this is a standard definition in harmonic analysis and functional analysis, and a natural generalization of .    Embed Quote
