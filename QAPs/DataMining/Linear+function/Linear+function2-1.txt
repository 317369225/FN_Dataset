★What is an example of a linear function's real life situation?
Mathematically we prefer to deal with linear systems(preferably time invariant) because we have a huge arsenal of mathematical tools to deal with them However. Strictly speaking ...nature tends to be nonlinear because there are many factors that affect our linear models .... as examples take the foolowing : distance=speed ×time + ur initial position.....it seems to be a linear equation but in reality you cannot maintain a constant speed but rather it changes with time because there are other factors that de/accelerate you such as road imperfections, weather,air friction....etc !!!     So strictly speaking generally linearity does not exist in nature ....it is a tool to help us model systems that are approximately linear. however if you extend your reality to the quantum world...you can find exact linearity such as the superposition of states.    Embed Quote
