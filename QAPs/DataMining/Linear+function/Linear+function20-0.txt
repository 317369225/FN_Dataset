★How do I find two linear functions such that f(x) •g(x) =4x^2+23x+15?
The desired product is a polynomial, so the obvious place to start is by trying to factor that polynomial.  If you don't see an easy way to do that, you can always use the quadratic equation to find its roots. In this case the roots are -5 and -3/4, so the polynomial factors as . You can then take that factor of 4 and apply it to either one of the linear functions x+5 and x+3/4 (or divide it among both) for example: It will always be the case that the answer is a family of linear functions, because if has the desired product, then has the same product, and multiplication by a scalar preserves linearity.    Embed Quote
