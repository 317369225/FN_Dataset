★What's the idea behind the integration in pure mathematics? In physics it's obviously mainly about area. But what about pure math? Let's say, number theory?
At the graduate level, the most widely taught theory of integrals is Lebesgue integration, where instead of length, area, volume, you talk about "measure." The Lebesgue theory enlarges the set of integrable functions. Functions not Riemann- or Riemann-Stieltjes-integrable may be Lebesgue-integrable. An important benefit that follows is that it becomes possible to construct important metric spaces of integrable functions that are complete.    Embed Quote
