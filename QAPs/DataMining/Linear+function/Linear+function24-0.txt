★Why are linear functions sometimes used as the output nodes of artificial neural nets, while the hidden nodes are instead non-linear? What is the reason for this difference?
The reason is that often the output might be unbounded, as in regression, and so it doesn't make sense to constrain your outputs to be in an interval.    Embed Quote
