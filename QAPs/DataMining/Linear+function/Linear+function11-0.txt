★What are the names and descriptions of the major types of attractors for linear and non-linear functions?There seems to be zoo of attractor types.  I want to understand the bulk of attractors so I can get a big picture view.
There is no reason to assume that we know all attractors, or even all types of attractors. So you have assigned an impossible task.    Embed Quote
