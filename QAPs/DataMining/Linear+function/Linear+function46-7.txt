Points: 1. Solving and understanding big problems      (On the order of 10k constraints in 100k variables) 2. Approximating solutions in important domains Transportation Finance Machine learning Control theory Governmental planning Economics 3.  A mathematical vocabulary essential to less straightforward subject areas 4. An inspiration for generalizations 5. A nice dropping off place for students who find this math hard.
