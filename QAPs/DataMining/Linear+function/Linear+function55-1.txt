★What is an eigenvector?
An eigenvector is a special sort of vector which only makes sense when you have a transformation. I will try to make it as simple as possible so bear with me. As you know, a vector is simply a representation of direction and a magnitude. Now imagine a roundabout  or circle traffic with many different incoming and outgoing routes. Let's say that every incoming car has to follow a specific rule - which is specific to this roundabout - in order to decide what exit to take. If you think of the speed and direction of cars as their vector , then one way to think of a matrix, is precisely what the roundabout rule is doing in this instance i.e. take every vector, transform it and spit out another vector, or to remain faithful to the example, send every car to its exit. Depending on the transformation rule, you can see that some car - or in fact all cars in an interesting scenario- will continue in their original direction path. And these cars - vectors - that stay in their original course under the transformation are called eigenvectors. or algebraically The extra multiple is not really material, what really matters is that the transformation has some invariants (when you stop caring about the magnitude). (well actually the lambda is very important itself as a counterpart to the eigenvector - surprisingly it is called the eigenvalue of the eigenvector.) The really cool thing about eigenvectors is that when you can get them all they characterise/define/determine the root of what the transformation is doing. The concept is really useful in many parts of sciences & technology. In fact, whenever you can define a transformation process as a change from one state to another within the same domain of possibilities then you potentially have a matrix on your hand (and hopefully a nice enough one that can be characterised by eigenvectors/eigenvalues).    Embed Quote
