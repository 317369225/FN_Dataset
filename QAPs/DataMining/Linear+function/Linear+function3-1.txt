★What is an intuitive explanation of why kinetic energy is not a linear function of velocity?i.e., Why does it take more energy to accelerate an object from 20 to 21 miles per hour than from 10 to 11 miles per hour?
Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity because it is the simplest possible velocity relation that makes sense. Velocity has a direction, whereas energy does not. The simplest way to turn a vector (a quantity with a direction) into a scalar (no spatial direction) is by dotting the quantity with itself . What about speed? Well, if we had , we would still have a non-linear relation for the kinetic energy. Doubling the horizontal velocity of a tennis ball would not necessarily double its kinetic energy. In fact, we have just complicated everything by throwing in a square root.    Embed Quote
