★Why is Linear Algebra a prerequisite behind modern scientific/computational research?
Linear Algebra relates to Matrices. Matrices that are build up through equations. Equations that come out from real world scenarios. Say, predicting the coordinates of a satellite and writing down different set of signals in the form of equations and then trying to solve equations to get real coordinates (or the approximated ones). -When we talk of stuff like social networking , big giants like Facebook , Linkedin are connecting millions to billions of people. Data is huge. Such kind of data has to be stored somewhere and the best data structures linking one node to other will be a Matrix here. Thus this leads to formation of a billion by billion matrix. And thus then we use our conventional or some newbie techniques to solve equations and get the required output. -Machine Learning problem where we declare a hypothesis to solve a regression problem requires projection of a vector onto another vector and thus minimizing the problem through least squares. There also a decomposition technique known as QR factorization is used. -Whereas in the field of Operation research optimizing transportation problems one need to form a matrix to see the flow of goods from a warehouse to another giving the (i,j) element of the matrix - the cost of transportation. Then again one needs a Matrix to solve. Hence Like wise many such fields you mentioned require the knowledge of Linear Algebra.    Embed Quote
