★What is an intuitive explanation of why kinetic energy is not a linear function of velocity?i.e., Why does it take more energy to accelerate an object from 20 to 21 miles per hour than from 10 to 11 miles per hour?
I'll answer along the lines of Harsh's answer. This is not rigorous but as you are looking for an intuitive explanation, here it goes - Let KE = F(v). By simple sign convention and symmetry (since energy is a scalar) F(v) = F(-v). The only 'piecewise' linear function that satisfies this is the c.|v| function. However, |v| is not differentiable at v = 0. Given that it is physically possible to slowly accelerate a body from say -10m/s to 0m/s to 10m/s - there is no reason for us to believe that F(v) should not be differentiable with respect to v. That rules c.|v| out. The next best guess is c.v^2n where n is an integer. Rigorous math may be used to derive the fact that c = 0.5m and n =1. On an intuitive level, any c and n help us believe that kinetic energy is not a linear function of velocity. Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
