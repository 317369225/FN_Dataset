★How do you prove when L is a linear function?
I took your question to mean "how do I prove that a function (any function) is linear?" (if that was not it, the question would be actually meaningless: the properties you listed are the definition of a linear function). It actually depends on the function, but in principle you just have to prove that the "outcome" (that is, the image of the vector through ) of the function satisfies those properties. I think that this is best explained through an example. Let's consider the two vector spaces and (where the two operations in the vector spaces are defined as usual) and a function defined by . Now, you know that for that function to be linear it has to satisfy the properties you listed. Let's check if that function does it. So it satisfies the first property. Let's check the second one: So it does indeed satisfy the second property, thus the function is linear. This was a trivial example, but it should suffice to make you understand what the general principle of the proof is.    Embed Quote
