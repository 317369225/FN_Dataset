★Why is Linear Algebra a prerequisite behind modern scientific/computational research?
Because Linear Algebra is the language for describing linear systems. So why linear systems? 1. Linear systems are well-defined and well understood. (On the other hand, nonlinear systems are not concretely defined. It's like a space of everything.) Simplicity is not the only reason though. Here's the more important one. 2. Any smooth function can be approximated locally by a linear function. In layman terms, most functions, when zoomed in, look like linear functions. Linear approximation is the essence of Newton's method (for nonlinear optimization), finite difference (approximating the derivative of a function), etc.    Embed Quote
