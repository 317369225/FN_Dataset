★Is aging linear or does it follow a step function?
It's hard to DEFINE 'aging.". The increased risk of dying of natural causes with time, is a definition that works for most people. As M. Church says, your chance of dying does increase exponentially with time after puberty (the Gompertz function, named for an 1825 actuary who discovered it). This continues into your late nineties, after which it goes into a phase Gompertz never discovered. We now know that after this, the rate of mortality-increase with age modifies from exponential to a more slowly-increasing value, until risk tops out at almost constant--but high, like 50% risk per year--by age 113. At that point, numbers of living people are too small to say what mortality-risk increase with time, and thus "aging" looks like, but it probably still increases mildly each year, or else there would be more people making it past 120, and only one person has (Jean Calment at 122).    Embed Quote
