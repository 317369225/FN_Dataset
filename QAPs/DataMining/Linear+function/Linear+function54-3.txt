★Are polynomials linear functions?
The term ‘linear function’ is overloaded.  It can mean a polynomial function with terms whose power is limited to 1.  However, it can also mean a function that obeys the principle of superposition.  Note that the linear polynomials obey the principle of superposition, so that definition is a special case.  Therefore, the most general definition of ‘linear function’ is a function that obeys the principle of superposition.  Functions that obey the principle of superposition must satisfy two requirements:         (1)   F(x+y)=F(x)+F(y)         (2)   F(cx) = cF(x)       for constant c Note that some linear functions are not polynomials.  For instance:         F(x) = dx/dt    Embed Quote
