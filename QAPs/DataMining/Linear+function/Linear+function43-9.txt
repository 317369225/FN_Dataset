★Why is Linear Algebra a prerequisite behind modern scientific/computational research?
In some of the fundamental techniques in machine learning, such as linear and logistic regression, linear algebra is essential. The parameters(weights), are held in a vector, and the features are in a matrix. You have to multiply these together to get the output of the hypothesis function. Also, it helps with finding a formula to automatically find parameters, instead of using gradient descent. These are some of many examples of how linear algebra is used in machine learning.    Embed Quote
