★Why is Linear Algebra a prerequisite behind modern scientific/computational research?
Linear algebra finds widespread application because it generally parallelizes extremely well. Further to that most linear algebra operations can be implemented without messaging passing which makes them amenable to MapReduce implementations. Algorithms that rely on message passing are problematic when commodity hardware is used at scale because of the possibility of a worker going down, leaving the system in an undefined state if message passing has been used. In the cases when direct implementation without message passing is not possible e.g. singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, message passing free approximations can still be found that capture the spirit of the original decomposition / operation e.g. random projections. From a CS perspective, matrices have a duality with graphs which allow many graph algorithms to be represented as matrix decompositions.    Embed Quote
