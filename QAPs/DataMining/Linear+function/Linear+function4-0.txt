★What's the difference between affine and linear functions?
The term linear function has two meanings.  It's unfortunate that there are two meanings but they can be kept separate if the first one is always called linear polynomial (or linear polynomial function) and the second is always called linear transformation. As a function it's synonymous with a linear polynomial, that is, it is of the form  where and are constants.  This meaning is also used when is replaced by some other field like As a function between two vector spaces, usually called a linear transformation,   A linear transformation preserves linear combinations, equivalently,   and    for all vectors   and    and all scalars   It follows from those requirements that a linear transformation preserves that is, An affine function, usually called an affine transformation,    on a vector space    is the sum of a linear transformation and a constant vector.  The constant vector is in effect a composition with a translation. Affine transformations can also be defined on Euclidean spaces, where a Euclidean space is defined axiomatically and need not have a coordinate system.  The definition here is that an affine transformation is any function that preserves straight lines.    Embed Quote
