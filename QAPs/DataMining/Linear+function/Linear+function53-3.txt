★What's the idea behind the integration in pure mathematics? In physics it's obviously mainly about area. But what about pure math? Let's say, number theory?
The whole point of integration is to convert the idea of a summation to something that is not discrete, but continuous. In other words, we use integration anytime that we want to add a bunch of things that are infinitely close together. Also, integration over an interval measures the net change of something over a period of time, which often comes up in applications. I use integration in my mirror symmetry, where we integrate over moduli spaces of curves from algebraic geometry, which is definitely considered pure mathematics. Basically from what I understand is that we do this to understand changes of algebraic objects as we continuously deform them. I'm not a number theorist, but I know that in analytic number theory they use advanced calculus to do things like asymptotic expansion. (So I would assume they use integration as part of this field of pure math). Anyway, just some thoughts. A lot of advancements in pure mathematics were inspired by the theory of integration.    Embed Quote
