★Support Vector Machines: How does going to higher dimension help data get linearly separable which was non linearly separable in actual dimension?
Try to solve this question and you will know by yourself -- The answer is [c].  Took if from the final exam of a course http://work.caltech.edu/library/. Though in this case we are not going to a higher dimensional space, even then it is possible to linearly separate in this new Z space what was not linearly separable in the X space. So, transformations do help us separated data better. Addendum : Answering this question baffled me a little because I considered the possibility of being able to fit the data by coming up with a transformation complex enough in the same dimensional space as is done in the question above. But SVM's do that automatically with the power of an almost infinite coefficients in an infinite space that you don't even have to know about. But I would really appreciate someone explaining this issue in more detail. :) Addendum : Here's the answer from the Professor himself. :)    Embed Quote
