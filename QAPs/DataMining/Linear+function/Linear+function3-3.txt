★What is an intuitive explanation of why kinetic energy is not a linear function of velocity?i.e., Why does it take more energy to accelerate an object from 20 to 21 miles per hour than from 10 to 11 miles per hour?
Both cases 20-21 mph and 10-11 mph  in the example require same force  to accelerate  the object ,but more displacement [1]occurs  in the former case as it was moving faster than the latter during the interval of acceleration.[2].Given same force and more displacement ,more work is done in the former case at loss of more Kinetic energy. Now coming to the Square function of velocity. Let's say that the the initial velocity of the object  increases in n terms/steps of Arthematic progression[3] of common difference d and ,that keeps nearly constant for every step: [using notations of physics in regular sense,e.g. t is time taken in step of acceleration]: [linear?no ,] There comes the square .You count by adding d to and you count d by subtracting fromand multiply them everytime you calculate , hence the counting of is not linear. There is anoother explanation: Kinetic energy is used for modelling dynamics of a system of particles to wich can have a zero resultant velocity and momentum [which btw varies linearly with velocity but non zero kinetic energy,square of a negative number is positive [4],which allows arthmatic sum of KEs of particles to be non zero. [1]Assuming straight line motion in one direction. [2I am assuming that the slow accelerate  time in both cases of your example is same,so as the data in the example is sufficent for making the point. [3] which can also be seen as a list.
