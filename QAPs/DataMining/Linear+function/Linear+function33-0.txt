★What is the ability of a single neuron with a non-linear activation function? Can it only classify the input space in two classes?
Logistic regression is basically a single neuron with a logistic activation function (which is a non-linear function). You can classify the inputs only into two classes if you are using just one single neuron model. Multiclass classification can be done by using multiple single neuron models in a one-vs-one or one-vs-rest manner. Despite the non-linear activation function, it's still a linear model and can learn only a linear decision boundary in the input space.    Embed Quote
