★Is aging linear or does it follow a step function?
I don't know of any study of this kind of phenomenon. It's not particularly counterintuitive, though, because there are various defence/repair mechanisms in the body that are triggered only once their target damage exceeds a certain threshold. One would expect that functional decline driven by those types of damage would then exhibit something like a step function even though the causative damage is accumulating at a smooth rate. The same logic works in the case of damage repair mechanisms that become overwhelmed and suddenly cease to work as well as previously.    Embed Quote
