★Are polynomials linear functions?
Consider third order polynomials in one variable with elements . They are clearly not linear in because their graph has curvature, and thus a polynomial is not a Linear function. However, all second-order polynomials can be written in the form , where , a vector of weights. This is a three dimensional vector space and thus linear. You can generalize to higher dimensions. So on that sense polynomials are linear. There are also functions that are linearizable, such as , because taking the natural log gives a linear form. is not linearizable.    Embed Quote
