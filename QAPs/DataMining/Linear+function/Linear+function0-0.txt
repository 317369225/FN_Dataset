★Are polynomials linear functions?
By definition, a polynomial of degree less than or equal to 1 is a linear function.  The degree of a polynomial                              is the exponent   in its leading term. Examples of linear polynomials, also called linear functions.    is a polynomial of degree 1, so it's a linear function.     is a polynomial of degree 0, so it's a constant function, and all constant functions are linear functions. Examples of polynomials that aren't linear functions.   is a polynomial of degree 2.  It's a quadratic polynomial.  is a polynomial of degree 3.  It's a cubic polynomial.    is a polynomial of degree 8.  There's no common name for high degree polynomials.    Embed Quote
