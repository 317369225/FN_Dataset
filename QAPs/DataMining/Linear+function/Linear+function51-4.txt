★Is aging linear or does it follow a step function?
Is a beach curved, or is the curve actually made up of many small and large jumps. Our perception of curvature just an 'average view', seen by standing back.  When we look closer, we see steps, but when we look closer again at those, we see curves again. That's the nature of complexity. The line of a beach is complex. Aging is more complex than the line of a beach.  It has many lines, some of which are linear, some of which are curves, some of which are large steps downwards (like a stroke or heart attack), which might be followed by partial recovery. Some of the large steps are visible and well defined medically, because they are crisis steps, like a heart attack.  Many others are invisible and cumulative, resulting in large drops that we cannot explain in individual cases. These are sometimes followed by repair or healing, when they stimulate action, and sometimes by more rapid aging, when they stimulate despair. Different parts of our body age at different rates.  Different parts of our body repair at different rates. The rates of aging grow faster as you grow older. The rates of repair grow slower as you grow older. A specific person's aging is the sum of all of those changes.  As an average, over time, it is a curve, accelerating downward as time passes, eventually ending in a final 'step', a straight line on your EEG.  to your health, tracy    Embed Quote
