★How does one know that a linear function represents a line in the plane? How can it be proven?
Always slope of a linear function is constant and is independent of the variables of the function (otherwise it will not be a linear function), implies that if slope is same for 'any' two points of a function  and the function is continuous then it (function) will represent a straight line. If slope of two points of a continuous curve is same then it could be a curve (not straight line), but since slope of any two points of a continuous curve is same it will definately be is definitely a straight line, mind my words 'two' and 'any two'.
