★Can integrals be thought of as inner products on infinite dimensional spaces?
As Alon Amit says, integrals are linear functionals and are used as an inner product.  This frequently occurs in partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis, signal processing theory, ergodic theory and many more cases. One common example is from Sturm-Liouville theory which is used in solving differential equations.  There are many situations (particularly in solving partial differential equations) where you have to solve where is a differential operator and this is an eigenvalue equation.  The proportionality constants are called eigenvalues where is the eigenvalue and are the eigenfunctions.  This equation generally doesn't have good solutions for every .  Any function can be expanded as and the form a basis for functions ( square integrable functions). If we write the differential operator, , as then the inner product for this where is the weight function and the eigenfunctions satisfy which means that these eigenfunctions forma n orthonormal basis and we can compute the coefficients for the expansion as . This inner product space is an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.  Sometimes the spectrum of eigenvalues is discrete and other times its continuous and sometimes it is discrete for certain ranges of eigenvalues and continuous for others.    Embed Quote
