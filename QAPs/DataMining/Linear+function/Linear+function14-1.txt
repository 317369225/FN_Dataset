★What scientific evidence exists to prove that global warming would take place as a linear function rather than as a logarithmic function?I find it difficult to believe that the entire global climate system is completely and infinitely vulnerable to the production of greenhouse gasses. Is there nothing whatsoever in the 'homeostasis' of the planet to push back?
There is probably some upper limit. Look at Venus. Is it still getting hotter? Not to my knowledge. But the average temperature there is 864 F/ 462 C    Embed Quote
