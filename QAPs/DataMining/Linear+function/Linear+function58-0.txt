★What are linear functions?
The adjective "linear" in mathematics is overused.  It can be used almost any place where a straight line is involved somehow. There are two different, but related, meanings for the term "linear function". One meaning of linear function is a function    of one variable whose graph    is a straight lines.  Such functions are all of the form    where    and    are constants.  These are precisely the polynomials of one variable of degree 1. This is the meaning of "linear" when applied to equations as well. The term linear function also applies to functions of several variables, and for those, it means polynomial of degree 1 such as  These functions may have a non-zero constant, but frequently you would like to consider only polynomials all of whose terms have the same degree 1.  A polynomial all of whose terms are of the same degree is called a homogeneous polynomial.  So a homogeneous linear function is a linear function with zero constant such as  This narrower concept that includes homogeneity is more important in the subject of linear algebra, so in linear algebra, linear functions are defined to include the restriction of homogeneity. The definition can be made more abstract as well so that the domain and range can be any vector space.  Also, the word transformation is preferred to function in that subject.  Thus, a linear transformation    from one vector space to another is a function that preserves addition and scalar multiplication.  That means that    and    for all vectors    and  and all scalars (i.e., numbers)     Embed Quote
