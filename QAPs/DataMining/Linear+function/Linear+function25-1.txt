★A polynomial of degree 1 with no constant term is an odd linear function, f(x) =ax, a! =0. In case f(x) =0, it is a constant function and the degree is not defined. Why?Can someone explain why degree is not defined?
When talking about a polynomial, it is convenient to know its degree. An expression for the degree of the product of two polynomials whose degrees are known is also helpful. Multiplying two polynomials of degree m and n respectively produces (over a field) a polynomial of degree m+n. For example, multiplying and produces whose degree is 3 = 1+2, ie the sum of degrees of multiplying polynomials. Constant (but-nonzero) polynomials don't change the degree, they have degree 0. The polynomial 0 however creates a problem because 0*f = 0 for all polynomials f. Using our degree formula for this equality, we would have degree(0)+degree(f)=degree(0) which makes no sense, because f was arbitrary. Hence degree(0) is undefined. In some textbooks, degree(0) is simply not defined. Some textbooks assign it a degree of (-infinity) which is convenient as  (-infinity)+any positive integer = (-infinity). This is mostly a matter of convention. Note: -infinity is not a real number. Its a concept which says that whatever you add to this number, the number doesn't change: which is precisely how we want degree(0) to behave.    Embed Quote
