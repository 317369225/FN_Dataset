★Is it possible to vectorize any linear algebra function, for example that would otherwise need a for loop?
Given that a core of a CPU can only process one computation at a time, every vector based function will have to implement a loop at some point in the stack (without getting into Parallel computations across multiple CPU cores, or over clusters). If you go deep enough down the stack, you will have to write a loop to do execute any vector based function. Parallel functions allow you to get away from loops a bit. You might still need a loop if you have vectors larger than the number of computational cores/nodes, but you can unravel your loop to take advantage of multiple cores/nodes. This of course comes with the challenge of writing parallelized code, which is non-trivial. One of the best introductions on parallel programming is Berkely's CS267 IMHO.
