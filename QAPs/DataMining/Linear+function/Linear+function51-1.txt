★Is aging linear or does it follow a step function?
It's exponential. Starting in your 20s, your probability of death doubles every 8 years, as does your probability of getting cancer. Of course, since we're talking about high-impact, low-frequency events, they're governed by a Poisson distribution (i.e. fairly random noise, manifest in "jumpy" changes). But there's no planned step-function behavior. That's the bad news. The good news is that health is somewhat in your control, and people (on average) get happier with age, especially after the child raising years are over.    Embed Quote
