★What is an intuitive explanation of why kinetic energy is not a linear function of velocity?i.e., Why does it take more energy to accelerate an object from 20 to 21 miles per hour than from 10 to 11 miles per hour?
the  kinetic energy must be the same, whether the body is moving  10m/sforward or backward. so intuitively K.E. must depend on square of  velocity or at least even powers of velocity.If we include relativity,  that's what happens in formula for K.E.   it depends on all even powers  of v. but as it is divided by powerrs of speed of light, the higher  powers are not observed.    Embed Quote
