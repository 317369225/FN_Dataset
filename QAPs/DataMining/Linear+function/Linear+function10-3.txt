★How would you find intervals of positive and negative in quadratic, exponential, and linear functions?
Sketching the graph is the best way to know everything about that function;and this is valid for all the functions-quadratic,logarithmic,exponential etc. Firstly check the domain of the function. Then differentiate with respect to x and find out the intervals in which the function is increasing and decreasing. On these critical points find out the value or output of the function. Lastly check the value of the function at the extremities of its domain. You will get a graph depicting almost everything about the function. For better precision you can also check the concavity of the graph through double derivatives.    Embed Quote
