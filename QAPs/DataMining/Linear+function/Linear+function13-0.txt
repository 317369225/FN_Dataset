★Why can the piece-wise linear function (e.g. rectifier) learn nonlinear mapping in artificial neural networks?
Non-linear learning in ANN is achieved because of non-linear nature of multi-layer NN. If you fit NN with a single layer using some linear activation function, you will get a linear separation of the space. If you add some layers, they will make linear separation of these partitions, so the "non-linearity" will be increasing with the kncreasing number of layers, therefore, the NN will be able to fit more complex functions(with a certain risk of overfitting, of course).    Embed Quote
