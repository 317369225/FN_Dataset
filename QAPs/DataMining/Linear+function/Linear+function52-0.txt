★What is linear approximation and linearization?
In calculus, the terms linear approximation, linearization, and tangent line approximation all refer to the same thing. Given a function    and a particular value for  , call it    the linearization of    at    is the function                                 which is the closest linear function to    near    Its graph    is a straight line tangent to the graph    of the function There are other linear approximations used in mathematics besides this one.  For instance, in statistics, regression analysis is used to fit the "best" linear function to a set of data.    Embed Quote
