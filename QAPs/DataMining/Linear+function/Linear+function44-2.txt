★Can integrals be thought of as inner products on infinite dimensional spaces?
If you have an n-dimensional vector space, then you need closure under vector addition & multiplication. Consider an infinite dimensional space to be the set of all functions   that are square integrable (Lebesgue integrable), the space. If you define the inner product as , then integrals performed over all functions in are inner products in the given infinite dimensional space. The space you constructed this way is in fact a complete inner product space, or a Hilbert space, with completeness guaranteed by the space.    Embed Quote
