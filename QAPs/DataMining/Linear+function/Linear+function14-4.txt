★What scientific evidence exists to prove that global warming would take place as a linear function rather than as a logarithmic function?I find it difficult to believe that the entire global climate system is completely and infinitely vulnerable to the production of greenhouse gasses. Is there nothing whatsoever in the 'homeostasis' of the planet to push back?
No one claims it is a linear system. It is in fact logarithmic, which is why climate sensitivity is often described as a constant for a doubling of CO2. This constant takes into account both positive and negative feedbacks, and to take into account slow and fast feedbacks, people talk of transient climate sensitivity and equilibrium climate sensitivity.
