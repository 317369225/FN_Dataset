★Why is Linear Algebra a prerequisite behind modern scientific/computational research?
TO add to Kenneth's answer: Voicing a problem in linear algebraic terms makes almost everything computable. Where knowledge of nonlinear problems is generally ad hoc and very lacking, knowledge of linear problems is extensive. It furthermore allows you to interpret properties coming from your application as properties of a linear system. This means that a stability result you've been dying to prove might just boil down to an eigenvalue computation, saving you the massive mental effort and letting the computer do the work.    Embed Quote
