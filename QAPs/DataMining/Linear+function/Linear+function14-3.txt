★What scientific evidence exists to prove that global warming would take place as a linear function rather than as a logarithmic function?I find it difficult to believe that the entire global climate system is completely and infinitely vulnerable to the production of greenhouse gasses. Is there nothing whatsoever in the 'homeostasis' of the planet to push back?
Plenty of mechanisms to regulate normal changes but nothing that can cope with the very recent abnormally fast change.    Embed Quote
