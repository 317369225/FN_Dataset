★How would you find intervals of positive and negative in quadratic, exponential, and linear functions?
Multiple questions - multiple answers. A linear function is represented by a straight line, so if its gradient is non-zero it will intersect the x-axis in one point and the values will be positive one side of the intersection, and negative the other. For quadratics you need to see if there is a solution to the max/min beong the other side of the x-axis to the long term trend (sign of the squared coefficient). You can check for zero crossings by looking at the discriminant. For expressions imvolving exponentials you are going to need to sketch it out looking for what happens as x tends to + or - infinity.  It may or may not cross.    Embed Quote
