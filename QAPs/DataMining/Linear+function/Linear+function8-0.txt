★How does one know that a linear function represents a line in the plane? How can it be proven?
The two notions are very intertwined, (because they are the same of course). So in order to prove that one is the other, we need to carefully define what we mean when we speak of a Linear Function and a Line. A Linear Function is easy. It's a function that obeys the template Where are constants and is the variable. Finding a definition of a (straight) line is harder, since it's often described in terms on a linear function, or in nonmathmatical terms. In fact, if you read the wikipedia page on lines: Line (geometry). You find that they even mention: "In geometry, it is frequently the case that the concept of line is taken as a primitive." Where Primitives are "terms which are given no definition" If we take  the Definition of Line something like: Straight No thickness Extends to both ends into infinity (lines with cut offs are called line segments) Then it's rather easy to prove. A Linear function has derivative which is constant, so that means that the object that the Linear function presents is straight. (vice versa, a straight line must have derivative zero). You can, probably, show that a Linear Function has no thickness with some kind of argument. Not going to do that here since it should be obvious in the first place. Extends both ends to infinite is of course something that a Linear Function can do. If it does not, it describes a line segment. So since all defining properties we gave to the Linear functions are also properties the line has, every linear function is a line. Since the reverse holds true as well, every line is a linear function. Hence linear functions and lines are the same.    Embed Quote
