â˜…For the Hilbert space of L2 functions over [0,1], while evaluation at a point is a linear functional, is it continuous?
Consider the sequence of functions [math]f_n = 1-|\sin(pix\pi x)|^{(1/n)}[/math]. It is evident that f_n tends to 0 in the sense of square integration, and in fact for all points except for 0 or 1, the image of evaluation at a given point tends to 0 as well. But for evaluation at 0 and evaluation at 1, the image of the sequence is constant -- it is 1. Since the image of 0 under evaluation at a point must be 0 by linearity, this contradicts the continuity of evaluation at a point. Alternatively we could also consider the characteristic function of the rationals, which is zero up to a set of measure zero (for the Lebesgue measure), and hence should be zero for all linear functionals, including evaluation. Of course for a dense set of base points the image under evaluation is one -- this example suggests that the functional in question is not well-defined for irregular subsets of the space. Furthermore, if it were continuous, by the Riesz representation theorem there would exist an L2 function such that when integrated against the argument gave the image, i.e. evaluated the argument at a given point. It is instructive to relate the discontinuity of this functional with the sense that a Dirac mass, which is defined in distribution theory by this functional, is not, in fact, a function.
