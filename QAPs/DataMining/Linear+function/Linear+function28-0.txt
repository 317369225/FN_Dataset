★Which programming languages have native linear algebra functions?So far I can think of Matlab/Octave, Mathematica, R/S, Julia, J (APL?), K, and newLisp. (Maple?)
Matlab and Octave are good for linear algebra, not not general math.  For that, the free Maxima counts, I think, though it's Lisp based.  I'd recommend Mathematica, which is a functionally complete programming language.  See Programming in Mathematica by Roman Maeder.  If you like reading books on a Kindle, as I do,  see Programming in Mathematica-: an Introduction by Paul Wellin.  I have the former, and would like the latter, but it's very expensive for a Kindle book, $43.75, too much for me.    Embed Quote
