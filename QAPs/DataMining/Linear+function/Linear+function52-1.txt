★What is linear approximation and linearization?
I just finished taking Calculus AB last year as a sophomore at Olympian High School, and if I remember correctly, linear approximation is when you use differentials to approximate a certain value that is close to a known value. One example off the top of my head is being asked to approximate ∛26.5. For this question, you must first decide a function that would give you the value of ∛26.5 if you had a table of value for that function. I would chose the function f(x)=∛x, which would follow the above criterion and is also differentiable, which is the most important part of determining which function to use. Next, since you know that if you plug in 27 for x, you'd attain a y-value of 3, which is very easy to manipulate. With this coordinate (27,3) in mind, you must now find the equation of the tangent line when x=2 (this equation will be written in point-slope form).  All you need left to write a complete equation for the above-mentioned tangent line is the slope of f(x) when x=27. To find the slope, you must find the first derivative of f(x) and then plug in 27 as the x-value, and whatever value that emerges will be your slope. f(x)=∛26.5. This can be rewritten as f(x)=x^(1/3), which is more easily differentiated. To find the derivative of this function, you need to multiply f(x) by its exponent (1/3) and then subtract that exponent by 1. Thus, the derivative of  f(x)=x^(1/3) is〖1/3 x〗^((-2)/3), which, when you plug in 27 as the x-value, yields (1/27). This is your slope. Now, with both a coordinate and a slope, you can write the equation of the tangent line as y-3=(1/27)(x-27). With this equation, you can now complete the final step of this exercise: approximating the value of the cube root of 26.5. This is done by simply substituting in 26.5 for the x-value in the tangent line equation. This substitution yields a y-value of approximately 2.98148. This approximation of 2.98148 is remarkably close the actual value of ∛26.5, which is 2.98136.    Embed Quote
