★What's the idea behind the integration in pure mathematics? In physics it's obviously mainly about area. But what about pure math? Let's say, number theory?
One point of view, as in C.J. Bott's answer, is that integration is a generalization of summation to a possibly continuous index set. Another important perspective views integration with respect to a given measure as a linear functional on certain vector space of functions. It's straightforward to show that integration is a linear functional. However  the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem tells us that every linear functional on certain spaces arises as integration with respect to some measure.    Embed Quote
