★I plan to study Algorithms (Princeton courses - 1, 2 and analysis), Linear Algebra (UTx), Functional Programming with Scala (EPFL) and Probability and Statistics this year. What else should I include in this list (for a CS + statistics student)?
The list is considerably extensive for a year, considering that  online courses will only give you a brief glimpse of the subjects. To adequately learn them, you will have to study things on your own also. I suggest you don't make your list any longer and never forget that the sky is the limit of learning irrespective of your academic inclinations.    Embed Quote
