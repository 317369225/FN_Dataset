★If a linear demand function (the amount that can be sold at a given price) yields a demand of 10,000 units when the price is €1, and the demand is 6,000 units when the prices is €1.20, what is the maximum revenue that can be generated?How in the world do I set this up?
Step 1: Find the parameters a and b of the linear demand function: by solving the underlying set of linear equations. Step 2: Maximize the revenue function with respect to p by setting its derivative equal to 0 and by checking second order conditions. Step 1: Set of linear equations: Solve the first equation for a: Substitute the parameter a in the second equation: Solve for b: Find a by using the first equation: Hence, the demand function is Step 2: Revenue equals price times demand: To find the optima of this function, we take its derivative and set it equal to 0: [math]r' = 30000-40000 \cdot p = 0[math] Solving this equation for p gives us Theoretically, we should now check second order conditions to make sure that this is indeed a maximum but for linear demand functions, this step can be omitted. The maximum revenue [math]r^* = r(p^*) = 30000\cdot 0.75-20000\cdot 0.75^2 = 11250[/math].    Embed Quote
