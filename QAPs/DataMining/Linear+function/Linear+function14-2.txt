★What scientific evidence exists to prove that global warming would take place as a linear function rather than as a logarithmic function?I find it difficult to believe that the entire global climate system is completely and infinitely vulnerable to the production of greenhouse gasses. Is there nothing whatsoever in the 'homeostasis' of the planet to push back?
It isn't a linear function and there are numerous positive and negative feedback systems - ocean absorption of CO2 changes in albedo due to CO2 fertilization desertification changes in ice distribution changes in ice albedo changes in water vapor changes in aerosol particle distribution (which changes cloud cover and distribution potentially melting of calthrates and release of methane permafost melt and bog release of methane etc. Climate change feedback There has been substantial negative feedbacks, which is why the dramatic production of CO2 since agriculture and industrialization hasn't had an enormous impact on climate to date.  Most of the CO2 has been absorbed by the oceans. The direct impact of CO2 itself is actually quite minor, it is the feedback of water vapor that causes the most dramatic change in temperature.  The increased temperature from CO2 drives a slight increase in evaporation, the increased evaporation puts more water vapor in the air, the increased water vapor traps more heat resulting in increased evaporation, etc. till a new equilibrium point is reached. The various positive and negative feedbacks have complex interactions which makes the modeling challenging and gives significant error margins to the warming predictions.  Also we could be drastically underestimating the impact of some feedbacks with the risk of 'runaway' warming.    Embed Quote
