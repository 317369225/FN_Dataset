★How do I show that the product of two simple functions is simple and the linear combination of simple linear functions is also a simple function (measure theory)?
Since the two functions are simple, they each have a finite set of reals to which they map the measure space, and the inverse image of each of these sets is measurable. Let me call the functions and . Hence, if the image of is of elements and that of is of elements, then the image of is at most of elements. There might be degeneracies, i.e. each of the reals we get by multiplying one image of to one image of need not be unique.   The definition of 'simple' now requires to prove that the inverse image of each of these at most elements is measurable. We use the properties that the union and intersection of a finite number of measurable sets is measurable, since in the event of no degeneracy; if degenaracies are present we take the union over all degeneracies which is measurable anyway.    Embed Quote
