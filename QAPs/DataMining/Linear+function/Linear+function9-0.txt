★Is the process of forming a friendship a linear function? What are the variables?
This is an interesting question. I don't think things are linear in life, but let's just play the game that way. 1. Physical Proximity: its easier to make/maintain friendship with your neighbors or coworkers than people who are farther away. That is keeping all other variables fixed. 2. Gender: Same gender friendships should be easier to start. 3. Compatibility of interests 4. Compatibility of attitude Other factors? Maybe ethnicity? Country? Let's say we have weights wi for i=1,2,3,4 to denote importance of each of the above factors for friendship. Then a linear relationship would be: S(P1,P2) = Sum wi*xi where xi quantifies the values for variables 1,...,4 S gives a score that can then be used to detect if two people can become good friends. Clearly you don't need compatibility in both 3 and 4  to be good friends. But with both 3 and 4 being strong, two people can become very close friends. If we allow for non-linearity, max(x3,x4) seems a good function to use inside our score S. How does one figure out the weights? If we get some data from people whom are friends on what these variables are/were for them.. We can then use a classification algorithm such as logistic regression to figure the weights out.    Embed Quote
