★What is the point of linear algebra?How can I motivate students to study this? Are there any tangible reasons why students should study linear algebra?
Linear algebra heavily is used in probability and statistics, although much of it students can learn as they use it.  It's a whole lot simpler to do geometry with linear algebra than any other way.  It's not as pretty as the way Euclid did it, but it's faster and works in any dimension.  Likewise, trig is easier with linear algebra.  So it's used in physics, computer graphics, computer modeling, and anywhere else where geometry comes in. And of course, it's used everywhere in mathematics, so you'll find it used wherever math is used, like in cryptography, economics, psychology, linguistics, engineering, management. The trouble with a linear algebra course that there doesn't seem to be much time to look at these applications.  Perhaps students could do a term project  in parallel with the rest of the course.  The project could be an application of linear algebra to some other field. The students could present it at the end of the semester.    Embed Quote
