★Why are consumer hardware improvements constantly linear as a function of time?
They aren't really. Radio development was lumpy and bumpy with a number of discontinuities (the transistor, frequency modulation, digital radio). Television went from black and white to color then tried 3d and generally failed at that. It went from CRTs to projection to plasma to LCD and LED and from analog to digital. But that progress was hardly linear. Portable devices like PDAs were also non-linear and several dead ends and "before their time" approaches were tried. Meanwhile the computation and storage capacities increase exponentially. I really can't think of any sort of consumer electronic device which has a linear path. Perhaps you can give an example?    Embed Quote
