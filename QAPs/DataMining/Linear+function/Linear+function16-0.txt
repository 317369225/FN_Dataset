★Is the vector space of piecewise linear functions (from R to R, over R) infinite dimensional?
Yes, it is infinite-dimensional as Mikael Bengtsson has pointed out. However, it is most definitely separable, since we can classify a PL function by the points of discontinuity in its derivative and the slopes in between the discontinuity points. By considering discontinuities on the rationals, we can write a basis analogous to what Mikael has written (albeit with rational end points instead of integer endpoints). As you might imagine, this space is not complete (its completion is the space , which is the set of continuous functions on . There do exist Schauder bases for the set of PL functions (see basis in functional analysis in nLab, Example 3)    Embed Quote
