★Are polynomials linear functions?
Techniqially no. Kinda like saying "Is meat a steak?" No, but steak is a meat. Polynomials are a summation of terms. So 5x^2-2x-3 is a summation of the terms (5x^2) and (-2x) and (-3). So add those together and you get a trinomial (polynomial with three terms) Linear functions are 1-2 terms. y=5x+5, y=2x, and y=4 are all linear functions. So yes, they are polynomials. Remember: ALL linear functions are polynomials but not ALL polynomials are linear functions.    Embed Quote
