★What scientific evidence exists to prove that global warming would take place as a linear function rather than as a logarithmic function?I find it difficult to believe that the entire global climate system is completely and infinitely vulnerable to the production of greenhouse gasses. Is there nothing whatsoever in the 'homeostasis' of the planet to push back?
I don't think anybody is suggesting it is more than linear. But linear is enough to cause us serious problems. And there are indeed homeostatic systems, which is why we have not, yet, done more damage than we seem to have. But there are multiple stable states, and there is no reason to believe that the one which has been prevalent for the last few hundred is preferred to another a few degrees hotter. The Earth has many feedback mechanisms, and will undoubtedly stabilise itself in another stable state, perhaps a few degrees hotter. The Earth itself is in no trouble - it has been hotter in the past, it has been colder. No problem. A million or two species will go extinct, but in a million years or so they will be replaced. And a billion or two humans will die. What matter? The Earth doesn't care. Only someone who cares about individual human beings will be worried. The human race is in no danger, only an awful lot of individual humans. Flood the major cities of the world? Build a new one uphill. Halve the productivity of the main food crops? A couple of generations of famine will sort that out. Flood out low lying nation? They can fight for land with those who still have it - the fittest will survive. But the Earth doesn't care.    Embed Quote
