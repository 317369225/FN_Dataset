★If f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b) and f is differentiable, what is f'(x)?Let be a continuous function such that , for all . Find the derivative of with respect to .
I'll show you that if is a continuous function with then it's of the form for some constant . In particular i'm going to show that First, if is a natural number then So So the formula is valid for natural numbers. Now because Then we show it's valid for negative integers, if is a negative integer, then is a natural number so Impliying the formula is valid for all integers. Now consider rational, so with and integers. Then = So for all rational , now finally we are going to show it for every real. Take some real number, since the rationals are dense, there exist a succession of rationals numbers with . Since is continuous we have but So we conclude that for all , so it's a differentiable function with derivative Notice that is not neccesary to assume differentiability beforehand, just using continuity you can show the function is differentiable.    Embed Quote
