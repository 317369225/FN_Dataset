★What is an intuitive explanation of why kinetic energy is not a linear function of velocity?i.e., Why does it take more energy to accelerate an object from 20 to 21 miles per hour than from 10 to 11 miles per hour?
You have to run faster while you're pushing it. Obviously, that's a simplification. But it's actually a reasonable one. Work is force times distance, and so the distance "you" travel while "you" are pushing it is relevant. (Even in a car motor, traveling with the car, the pistons are moving faster, so it takes a greater flow of gas to push them with the same constant force.)    Embed Quote
