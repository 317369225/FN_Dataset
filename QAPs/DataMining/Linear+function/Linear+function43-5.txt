★Why is Linear Algebra a prerequisite behind modern scientific/computational research?
Yes, the linear part is useful, so I agree with the other respondents.  I don't think that's the reason that it's a prerequisite. Linear algebra has ways of dealing with systems of equations.  These ways are very computery.  They map pretty well onto things that languages have, like arrays.  A lot of tasks, like the humble for loop, are something like summations in linear algebra. Linear algebra is also good for algorithm proving and getting time and space requirements. There are also a lot of areas where linear algebra is used directly.  Computer graphics, for instance, has transformation matrices (which are really tensors).  Also, there is specialized hardware for doing linear algebra.    Embed Quote
