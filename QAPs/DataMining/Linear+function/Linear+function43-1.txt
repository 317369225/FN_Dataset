★Why is Linear Algebra a prerequisite behind modern scientific/computational research?
Linear algebra almost completely coincides with the mathematics that we can actually perform computationally.  Most of mathematics consists of abstract results that can't (yet) actually be converted into algorithms, at least directly.  Outside a few very specialized areas, almost every known technique for calculating something mathematically essentially comes down to linearizing the problem and then solving the linear problem.  For instance, the entire subject of calculus can succinctly be described this way: the derivative is essentially a tool that resolves a single nonlinear function into a whole bunch of linear ones.    Embed Quote
