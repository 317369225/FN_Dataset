★What are some unsupervised learning approaches for clustering given a matrix of pairwise distances?One approach is to run multidimensional scaling on the distance matrix in order to represent the points in some low-dimensional euclidean space, then apply K-means -- is this a reasonable approach?
You can compute similarity matrix out of the distance matrix by inversion and normalization. There are Clustering algorithms that operate on similarity matrix. You could also consider the similarity matrix as similarity graph and apply graph partitioning techniques. Most popular approach is Spectral clustering. Check Tutorial on spectral Clustering for more details. One another algorithm is CHAMELEON. You need to retain only K-NN points for each point for the Chameleon algorithm. A simpler approach is to threshold the similarity measure and finding the connected components. You can also do Hierarchical clustering. Clustering on similarity matrix data is better than doing on vector space in many instances because : It can detect arbitrary shaped clusters. Traditional K-Means make euclidean assumption and results in spherical clusters. This improves the chances of identifying natural clusters The clustering algorithm is generalized from the distance metric/similarity measure. Constraints can be naturally introduced into this framework. Eg. You can constrain two points to belong to the same cluster.    Embed Quote
