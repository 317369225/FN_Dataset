★Unsupervised Learning: What are some good resources about unsupervised learning in an online context?I'm particularly interested in specific research papers, people in the field of online machine learning to pay attention to, and books to read.
Here are a few papers on online algorithms for some specific unsupervised learning problems. Parameter estimation in latent variable models Online EM algorithms:Cappé and Moulines, 2009: [0712.4273] Online EM Algorithm for Latent Data Models, related to the incremental EM algorithm of Neal and Hinton (1998): Page on toronto.edu. See Online EM for Unsupervised Models by Liang and Klein (2009) for a comparison. Stochastic variational inference:Hoffman et al, 2013 [1206.7051] Stochastic Variational Inference. For LDA in particular: Hoffman et al, 2010 Online learning for Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Matrix factorization, dictionary learning Mairal et al, 2010 [0908.0050] Online Learning for Matrix Factorization and Sparse Coding K-means clustering Online Newton method approach by Bottou and Bengio: Convergence Properties of the K-Means Algorithms Notes by S. Dasgupta on online and streaming algorithms for clustering: Page on ucsd.edu For many other problems that try to minimize an average loss over training examples (e.g. autoencoders), you can usually use stochastic gradient descent for online learning (see, e.g., Bottou, 1998, Online Learning and Stochastic Approximations). For instance, SGD was used in the famous Google paper [1112.6209] Building high-level features using large scale unsupervised learning.    Embed Quote
