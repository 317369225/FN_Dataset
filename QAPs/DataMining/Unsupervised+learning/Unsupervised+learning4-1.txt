★What is unsupervised  learning with example?
1) Let's say you are a garments brand looking for measurements to make t-shirts. As data, you have the shoulder, waist and chest size for males. You want to make 5 different sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL). You will use unsupervised learning to divide your data into five groups. The central points of those five groups will be the shoulder, waist and chest size for each of the different sizes. So, you have just clustered the data into five groups. This is called k-means clustering. Here number of clusters were fixed. 2) Another example, you are studying facebook profiles of students of a class. Your task is to identify the groups in the class. As data, you have the number of times person A tags person B and vice-versa (let's start with a simple example). Let's assume the max number of A<->B tagging, across the class is N. Now, let person X and Y have tagged each other "p" times, (N-p) would be a measure of their distance. Now, put two people in the same group if their (N-p) distance is below a threshold. You end up with groups in the class. This is the concept of strongly connected components. Here the minimum distance between elements of two clusters is fixed.    Embed Quote
