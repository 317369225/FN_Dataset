★Unsupervised Learning: What is most scalable algorithm for K-Means clustering for large dataset?Virtually every paper I have seen so far is evaluated on small scale data. Is there any good algorithm for large scale data set ?   application scenario, K<= 10 , Dataset size= 100 Millions, Dimensionality <=100
You can try an online versión of kmeans it's extremely fast. The idea is to process the points as a stream. First you do a random init on the centroids,then for each point you compute the closest centroid,assign the point to that cluster and increase the count of points for that cluster. Finally you move the centroid towards the point but proportional to the number of points In the cluster. Thus a new point assigned to a big cluster only pulls the centroid a little. You only keep In memory the centroids and a vector with the number of points in each cluster. Each point is processed only once.    Embed Quote
