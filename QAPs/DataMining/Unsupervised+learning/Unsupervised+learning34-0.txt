★Should I go for supervised or unsupervised learning for search query classification? Why?
I don't think either one will work very well. If you look around at web search engines, the only one that tries to classify queries is http://blekko.com and the search app Izik. We use the combination of human curation of websites plus a cut-down version of our index to do the classification -- not the words in the query. The words in the query will only confuse you. What does the query [galaxy ruby wine] mean? "ruby" and "wine" are both programming words, "ruby" and "wine" are wine words. But no, it's one of the choices of  the color of a Samsung tablet. You're not going to ever figure that out looking at 3 words.    Embed Quote
