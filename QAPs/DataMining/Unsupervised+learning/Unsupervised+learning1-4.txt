★Which machine learning algorithms effectively combine supervised and unsupervised learning?What ML algorithms beyond Restricted Boltzmann Machines and similar deep learning effectively combine learning from both labeled and unlabeled data
In the article "Semi-supervised Bayesian ARTMAP" it is shown how a adaptive resonance theory-based network can be used together with the EM algorithm can perform semisupervised learning. This article is definitely a "must read".    Embed Quote
