★What class do Hopfield networks fall into -supervised or unsupervised learning?
This is something I've argued with folks about. Since you actually give the complete answer, I consider them to be totally supervised. Unsupervised is when you have a set of data and then you create something new from it - cluster it, learn a compact representation of it distribution, extract features, etc. But all Hopfield Networks do is remember what you told them (and unfortunately, sometimes lots of things you didn't if you add too many memories). By the way, there is no distinction between input and output in a Hopfield net - what you do after training is give it a partial pattern and the goal is to complete the pattern. But the partial pattern could be on any of the units, and the remaining units (to be "completed") are simply the remaining ones.    Embed Quote
