★What is unsupervised  learning with example?
Unsupervised learning refers to the problem of trying to find hidden structure in unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no explicit target outputs or environmental evaluations associated with each input; rather the unsupervised learner brings to bear prior biases as to what aspects of the structure of the input should be captured in the output. A common unsupervised learning technique is clustering. Say you are given these (x,y) coordinates of points. A(0,0) B(0,1) C(100,100) D(99,101) E(3,4) F(102, 103) You can say that A,B and E are similar to each other. They can be clustered together as Cluster 1. Similarly, C,D and F can be clustered together as Cluster 2. Elements in a cluster are similar to other elements in that cluster and are different from the elements in other clusters. Now, let us look at some applications of clustering. Google News Google News clusters all similar news items together as shown in the snapshot below: Clicking on these links will lead you to different news stories but each of these are related to the topic "NASA captures spectacular eruption from Sun". Another example is.. Social Network Analysis: In a social network, clustering can be used to find users that interact a lot with each other (say, via e-mails). This is shown in the figure below where the users have been clustered into four clusters - A,B,C and D. Hope this helps! :)    Embed Quote
