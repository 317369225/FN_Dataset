★Can regression models be fitted to clusters from unsupervised learning algorithms?For example, suppose I had to classify three groups of consumers: full-paying, non-paying, and paying at a discount. I would like to predict to which group a given consumer belongs, and what discount they might be receiving likely going to receive.
I assume your question is, can you build a predictive model by regressing the cluster membership against the features that were used to generate the clusters. The answer is yes. But, you might have better results with a classifier or multinomial logistic regression.    Embed Quote
