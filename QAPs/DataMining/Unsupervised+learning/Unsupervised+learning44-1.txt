★Is it already possible to learn the rules of a game like Monopoly using unsupervised learning?
Yes, this is already possible. A game of Monopoly can be viewed as a set of sequential choices made by a group of players. These choices have a probabilistic and deterministic component, where, for example, a player's strategy and dice roll are random (probabilistic) and all players must follow the rules of the game (deterministic). To take this as a learning problem Monopoly can be assumed to be an (yet unknown) instance of a Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata (PDFA) [1]. The unsupervised problem here is to learn the Monopoly PDFA from the set of sequential player choices made across one or more games. Once learned, the PDFA expresses the rules of a game exactly like (or at least typically like) Monopoly. For more information, refer to Clark and Thollard [2], where they show that PDFA's are PAC learnable, and a wonderful Ph.D. thesis by Balle Pigem [3] that highlights efficient (including streaming based) PDFA learning techniques.
