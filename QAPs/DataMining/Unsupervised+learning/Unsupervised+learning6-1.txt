★What's the most advanced (or versatile) unsupervised learning algorithm?
New trend for unsupervised learning is Deep Learning. There are tons of different researches going around. But the term is coined by Hinton Home Page of Geoffrey Hinton with Deep Belief Networks. The main idea of deep learning is gathering the unlabeled or semi-labeled data, then by using Auto Encoders or Neural Network, extracting some abstractions from low level features with the notion of having high level abstractions is more meningful to discriminate concepts from each other.
