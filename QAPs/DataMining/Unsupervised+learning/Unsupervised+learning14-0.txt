★Support Vector Machines: Is it possible to use SVMs for unsupervised learning/density estimation?
I think what you are looking for is called One-Class SVM: B. Schölkopf, J. Platt, J. Shawe-Taylor, A. J. Smola, and R. C. Williamson. Estimating the support of a high-dimensional distribution. Neural Computation, 13, 2001, 1443-1471. ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com... It's implemented in libsvm and wrapped in scikit-learn, here is an example of its application to population distribution estimation of 2 South American species according to environmental conditions:     http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.... And another application to artificial dataset (simpler code):    http://scikit-learn.sourceforge....    Embed Quote
