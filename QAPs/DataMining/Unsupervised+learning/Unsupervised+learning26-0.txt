★How can autoencoders in the context of images be used for unsupervised learning tasks?
The question seems a bit vague. But auto encoders are a type of unsupervised learning I thought. Unsupervised learning is simply learning methods that do not require some target value(s) to "guide" the algorithm. People usually talk about clustering when speaking of unsupervised learning, but dimension reduction (such as SVD) is also considered unsupervised learning. Auto encoders reduce the dimension of the data by encoding it into a smaller set of nodes, so it would be considered unsupervised learning.    Embed Quote
