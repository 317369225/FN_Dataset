★What is the best way to make a neural net capable of unsupervised learning, and what are its uses?Is there an API for it
Neural Nets are generally used for Supervised Learning. However there are some approaches to use it for unsupervised learning. Prominent ones include: 1.  Most Autoencoder algorithms are unsupervised, however they are used mostly for feature extraction of supervised tasks in literature . If one can somehow find a way to use them without the final supervised layer which are used in most of the papers, they can be used for LSH (which is a randomized algorithm) like tasks, but in a semantic way. 2. There is a Generative Stochastic Nets approach proposed by LISAlab team. This can be used to learn joint probabilities and hence like PGMs. 3. I have read at least one paper where convolutional neural nets with high number of dimensions in the topmost layer were used for clustering. There are some more papers for doing traditional K Nearest Neighbor type clustering too. One needs to do some literature survey. about API: I am not sure one exists.    Embed Quote
