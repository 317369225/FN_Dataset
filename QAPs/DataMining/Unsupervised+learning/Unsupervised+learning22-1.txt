★To what kind of real-world problems is unsupervised learning applied?
It can be used in fields such as genetics and sales. For example, let us say that I manufacture and sell pants. Assume that I have data from my customers, and I've plotted waist size vs. height in the graphs below. From: K-Means Clustering Simplified While there could be all kinds of combinations, I can't manufacture every possible size. However, I know that I could target most of my customers by making a few specific sizes. Here is where k-means clustering comes in. I can cluster the data using k-means, observe where the clusters are centered, and just manufacture pants in those sizes. That way, I can appeal to most of my customers while using my manufacturing resources most effectively.    Embed Quote
