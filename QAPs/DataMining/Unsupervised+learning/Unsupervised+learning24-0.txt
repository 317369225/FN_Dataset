★What unsupervised learning algorithms can be used to discover human behavior patterns?by human behavior patterns I refer to human body movements or body poses (given that you can obtain body pose data from joints by using motion capture systems or Kinect
You can use Gaussian Mixture Models which is popular approach for generalizing continuous correlated data. In this case, let's say you have a trajectory of skeleton joint positions across several frames, you can then model those patterns by clustering the trajectories. Here I provide two reference papers: 1. http://www.maia.ub.es/~sergio/li... 2. Social human behavior modeling for robot imitation learning    Embed Quote
