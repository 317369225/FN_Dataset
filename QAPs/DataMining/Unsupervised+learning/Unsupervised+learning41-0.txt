★How do I differentiate the tasks of supervised learning and unsupervised learning technique?
The key difference is whether you have labels for the data. Let's take an example. Say you've never seen fruit before. Someone gives you a bowl with 50 fruits in it and says "can you categorize these for me, please." You then sort through the fruit and see some of them are long and yellow, others are round and have dimples, others have furry skin. That's unsupervised learning. Now imagine that someone gives you a bowl of fruits and says: "This is a banana" -- and holds up a long yellow thing. She holds up a small red thing and says "this is an apple." She holds up a big green thing and says: "This is also an apple." Then it's a supervised learning problem. The fruit names are the labels in this case. Sometimes you get the labels (supervised learning) and sometimes you don't (unsupervised learning). There's also semi-supervised learning (when you get some of the labels, but not all of them) and active learning (where you get to ask "what's this fruit called"?)    Embed Quote
