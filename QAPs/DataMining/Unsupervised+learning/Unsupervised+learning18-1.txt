★What are some unsupervised learning approaches for clustering given a matrix of pairwise distances?One approach is to run multidimensional scaling on the distance matrix in order to represent the points in some low-dimensional euclidean space, then apply K-means -- is this a reasonable approach?
The question is very tricky and depends on the requirements at hand. There is no general approach. Once it is established that euclidean distance in some feature space (either the original features themselves or the features obtained as a result of some transformation, which again should be known) is the metric for clustering, then there are very standard algorithms one can use like k-means or more robust versions of the same which are less sensitive to outliers. Again to use all these, some knowledge about the data set might be required like the number of clusters for k-means (but there are again heuristic methods to estimate this as well). From my limited experience, determining which metric to use for clustering is the hardest part. Once that is established, there are enough methods to choose from depending on the requirements. But I think based on the question, a nice method would be application of principal component regression followed by k-means. PCR basically finds those combination of features (or coordinates) which distinguishes the different clusters. These tend to be very low rank compared to original feature size and running k-means on this should be very easy. Again the same problems associated with k-means like convexity of clusters etc would persist in which case you may be required to use some non-linear transformation using some kernel.    Embed Quote
