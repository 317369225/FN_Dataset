★What is the difference between semi-supervised learning and hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning?As far as I know in hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning, cluster the data first then classify the cluster.
Hybrid supervised/unsupervised learning is exactly what the name sounds like. Combining a supervised learning and another unsupervised method to solve a problem. For example in this paper Page on lia.univ-avignon.fr , the author uses a supervised algorithm and an unsupervised algorithm jointly to solve a classification problem. Note that the supervised algorithms in this approach work on data labels and unsupervised algorithm ignores them altogether . Semi-supervised algorithms are midway on supervised/unsupervised spectrum as these algorithms learn on partially labelled and mostly unlabelled data. An example is transductive SVMs which try to  Page on umn.edu put decision boundary obtained based on labelled data in sparse regions (assuming unlabelled data is like its nearest labelled data points mostly)    Embed Quote
