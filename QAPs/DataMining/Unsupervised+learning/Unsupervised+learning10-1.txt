★Is it possible for unsupervised learning algorithms to outperform supervised ones?Assume the same data set. If this has been done, please provide links.
Sure, if there are errors in the label set. It is also possible to combine the two approaches Machine Learning with Missing Labels:  Transductive SVMs and Transductive  / Semi-Supervised Learning will frequently outperform purely Supervised Learning    Embed Quote
