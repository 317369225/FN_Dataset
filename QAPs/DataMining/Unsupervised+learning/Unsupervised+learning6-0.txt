★What's the most advanced (or versatile) unsupervised learning algorithm?
I am not exactly sure about what you mean by 'the most advanced' algorithm. If you mean those which give state-of-the-art results: they are usually the result of complicated algorithms, which are tuned towards a particular application. On the other hand, some of the most versatile algorithms are the ones which are the simplest and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios. Some of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms are also among the most versatile, like k-means or spectral clustering algorithms. Among relatively newer methods, deep learning techniques have enjoyed enormous success in a wide variety of applications, such as, in vision, speech and natural language processing.    Embed Quote
