★What are some unsupervised learning approaches for clustering given a matrix of pairwise distances?One approach is to run multidimensional scaling on the distance matrix in order to represent the points in some low-dimensional euclidean space, then apply K-means -- is this a reasonable approach?
Another approach could be to run some sort of iterative clustering algorithm( maybe the K-means algorithm) and get some good clusters and then give that as an input to a hierarchical clustering algorithm, maybe a CLINK or SLINK algorithm. CLINK and SLINK are computationally optimal in the sense that they take O(n^2) time and O(n) space and produce a 'hierarchy' of clusters so that you dont need to run the algorithm again , if you decide to search for a different number of clusters, it also has the advantage of not having to initialize the k-means and hence prevent those kind of errors from creeping in. All said and done, which algo/approach is the best? Depends on your data-set , it';s best to try as many as you can and compare the results, and evaluate them.
