★What are all the benefits of supervised learning that first goes through unsupervised learning?Is it most the cases it will lead to speedup the training process? Or maybe better prediction? Is it possible to give a rigorous proof of your answer?
If you have a semi-supervised case (900 unlabeled examples, 100 labeled examples), it's good to do unsupervised training first on all examples before doing supervised training on the labeled examples, because the unlabeled examples will help the model generalize. Besides semi-supervised cases, it's algorithm-specific. In deep learning for example, unsupervised layer-wise pre-training speeds up training because it's difficult to train a network's first few layers' weights from backpropagation because of vanishing/exploding gradient. Pre-training initializes weights in the first few layers to close to final values beforehand. That said, some recent results indicate that pre-training is not beneficial anymore for networks with rectified linear activation functions (which doesn't have the vanishing/exploding gradient problem). Very interesting read if you are into deep neural nets - Page on pascal-network.org It is almost never possible to get a rigorous proof from any machine learning system.    Embed Quote
