★What are some unsupervised learning approaches to clustering discrete empirical probability distributions?
Fitting a Dirichlet Process The Dirichlet Process is a stochastic process whose finite-dimensional distributions are defined on the -simplex, . The idea behind a generative model using this process involves that the process draws a random discrete probability distribution from the Dirichlet distribution and then drawing samples from this distribution. The Dirichlet distribution is used (in the form of Latent Dirichlet Allocation) exactly for what you are looking for, although it is hard to assess in terms of convergence. The key mathematical fact that helps one understand how to use the Dirichlet process is the Stick-Breaking construction. Roughly speaking, this allows for a Dirichlet process to be constructed from many simpler processes, namely beta distributions. Recall that the Beta distribution is a family of distributions that parametrizes ways to draw a random Bernoulli distributions.
