★How do you evaluate the performance of an unsupervised learning algorithm?For supervised learning, you can validate on new data. Is there an analogous method for unsupervised problems?
It depends upon what you are trying to do. I've worked with various types of unsupervised algorithms over the years. Visualization, as noted by Jason Kuen, is often useful, but there are other possibilities as well. Clustering can be considered a type of unsupervised learning and one can define cluster quality measures such as the average ratio of the cluster diameter compared to the distance between clusters (appropriately defined). If you are using a generative model such as a Boltzmann machine, the goal is to minimize the difference between the distribution of outputs when the system is "dreaming" compared to the input distribution. Since the method is stochastic, the actual value achieved after a given amount of training may depend upon random seeds. So one can vary these and compare several runs to see if there is significantly different performance. This sort of comparison can be tried with any stochastic algorithm. If your goal is feature discovery, then you might use those features to generate a clustering or reconstruction and evaluate the features that way.    Embed Quote
