★Unsupervised Learning: What is most scalable algorithm for K-Means clustering for large dataset?Virtually every paper I have seen so far is evaluated on small scale data. Is there any good algorithm for large scale data set ?   application scenario, K<= 10 , Dataset size= 100 Millions, Dimensionality <=100
a method related to fuzzy k-means is convex nmf, as formulated in the hogwild system. This is very scalable because it solves convex optimizer and be run in lock-free mode on a shared memory architecture see my blog post on it Advances in Convex NMF: Part 1 Linear Programming and the webpage Scalable Numeric Optimization with an RDBMS update: It appears the latest version of hogwild does not implement this, which is a bummer, but rather implements a non-convex but easier to solve tracenorm optimization problem Scalable Numeric Optimization with an RDBMS for very very large scale, on Hadoop, take a look at the Heigen package from CMU Spectral Analysis for Billion-Scale Graphs: Discoveries and Implementation Page on Cmu it's not exactly kmeans, but the key scalability ides are close ill try to get a blog post out in this soon finally, GraphLab is quite good GraphLab and it integrates with HDFS    Embed Quote
