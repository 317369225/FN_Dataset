★Where can I find a good online course on Unsupervised Learning?I am currently doing the online course "Learning for Data" from Caltech, that focuses on Supervised Learning, I also wish to do a similar level course on Unsupervised Learning.
I am a big fan of OMSCS - Georgia Institute of Technology that has a machine learning track. You can audit it for free or do an MOOC Master's degree. Currently Georgia Tech is ranked 6th in AI, see Artificial Intelligence, so it is the best bang for the buck. Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning is the second course in the sequence.    Embed Quote
