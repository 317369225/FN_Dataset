★Which machine learning algorithms effectively combine supervised and unsupervised learning?What ML algorithms beyond Restricted Boltzmann Machines and similar deep learning effectively combine learning from both labeled and unlabeled data
It is worth mentioning the paper titled "Discriminative Unsupervised Feature Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6909v1... which to the best of my knowledge is one of the top performing methods on the STL-10 dataset which is a classic dataset that often requires a combination of both unsupervised and supervised learning. The dataset contains far more unlabeled images than labeled images (from 10 disjoint classes). The paper above describes how they made use of unlabeled data to learn a set discriminative features that could then be used as inputs into a traditional supervised learning algorithm, they used an SVM. As the title suggests, a CNN was used to learn features. The first step is to select a set of "seed" images or patches from images. The goal is to have a set of seed images that are very diverse. Each image selected is then treated as its own class and new images are added to that class by slightly augmenting the original image using simple transformations ie. translation, rotation, color/contrast adjustment, etc... The CNN is then trained on this classification new problem. The CNN will hopefully learn to recognize the various components that may make up an arbitrary image ie. edges, curves, shapes... Finally, you can remove the top classification layer from the CNN and output instead a feature vector which can then be used in the original classification problem of classifying images into one of 10 labels. Images of the training set can be run through the CNN to extract the learned features and these new features will be used for supervised learning.    Embed Quote
