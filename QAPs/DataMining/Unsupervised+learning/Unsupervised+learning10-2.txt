★Is it possible for unsupervised learning algorithms to outperform supervised ones?Assume the same data set. If this has been done, please provide links.
The answer is no. In supervised learning we know both inputs and outputs, its more akin to training. In unsupervised learning no ouputs are given, ouputs are approximations.    Embed Quote
