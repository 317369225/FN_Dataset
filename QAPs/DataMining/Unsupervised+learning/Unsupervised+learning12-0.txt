★What book is a good introductory text of unsupervised learning?
Check out this old, but evergreen chapter from Zoubin Ghahramani first, its a good introductory read: http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/... These books are all very nice and will cover unsupervised learning in some detail: Bishop: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning: http://research.microsoft.com/en... Barber: Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning [free PDF version available] http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D... Koller and Friedman: Probabilistic Graphical Models: http://pgm.stanford.edu/ Jordan (ed): Learning in Graphical Models: http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/... Also this is still my favourite paper on the topic: http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/...    Embed Quote
