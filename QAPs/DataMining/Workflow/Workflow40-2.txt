★Which DAW has the best workflow for a midi composer?I would be starting first with the melody, getting it down via playing it on a midi keyboard and then adding harmony layers to it. Not EDM music but accoustic instrumentals. There be a lot of midi editing, as the melody will be played in parts and then link up together.
I agree with Dandres Narr's answer. I'd like to add a suggestion along with this. All the DAWs mentioned [Pro Tools, Reason, Logic Pro, Cubase, FL Studio] have potential to help you in making MIDI based tracks. So if you haven't chosen a DAW yet, go through their reviews on youtube, Give a moment and realise which DAW seem most appealing to you because in the end, what matters the most is how effectively and efficiently you use the software. For me Pro Tools & FL Studio have been of great use. Pro Tools has almost everything you need but FL Studio uses less CPU power. But if you're going to add other recordings in your project, go for Pro Tools. Again, see some videos on youtube about these. Many producers upload their 'making of' videos where you can get an idea about the DAW they use. Waiting for your tracks. Have fun! :)    Embed Quote
