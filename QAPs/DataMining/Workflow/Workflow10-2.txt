★What is a good Node js workflow, editor tools & framework?I am looking at switching from Django/Python and want to know what are the good tools and frameworks for web design in Node.js. I want to try on your development shoes and see if they fit.
IDE: Brackets , Sublime Text or Atom  Language:  CoffeeScript. This is one is the must-have and I couldn't imagine programming without it. I love the fat arrow, the class, the syntax, the  existential operator ( if foo?.bar?.object?.string is "Hello world" would be falsy when foo, bar or object are undefined instead of throwing an error) Database: Mongoose ODM is really great Framework: express of course :) Build tool: Grunt is cool, but Gulp is cool as well On Windows, cmder, the best Console Emulator is a must have. Markup Framework Semantic UI  is awesome    Embed Quote
