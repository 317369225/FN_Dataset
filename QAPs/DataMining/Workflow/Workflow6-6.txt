★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
I don't look at Typekit as a cheap way to get a ton of fonts. I use Typekit as a way to extend my design to the web. Meaning I own (or would buy) any fonts that I want to design with and ultimately use on the web.    Embed Quote
