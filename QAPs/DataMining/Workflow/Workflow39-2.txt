★What is the easiest way to create a workflow diagram?I'm looking to build a workflow diagram. Is there some program (esp. in MS Word) that offers a template for this so that I don't have to individually create all the boxes, arrows, logic flows, etc.?
You could use SmartArt in Word 2010 (and 2007 I think) or better yet use Visio which has fairly advanced (but not SharePoint workflow specific) functionality built in. If you have a license for Visio 2010 Premium then it has SharePoint Workflow shapes built in which you can use to layout and design your workflow and then import this diagram into SharePoint Designer 2010 to then configure your workflow actions.    Embed Quote
