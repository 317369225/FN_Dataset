★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
Workflow using Typekit usually has followed options Naz listed, but recently I decided to take the extra step to develop websites locally using http://get-serve.com/. Once you have a (very simple) web server running locally, Typekit responds to the localhost address and you can design with the exact type you're using. Consider the other benefits: Serve lets you extract partials and use different layouts to help make sure a local/static web project doesn't become too cumbersome. You can also deploy to a free Heroku account for live preview, and/or also choose to push to a git repository for version control and collaborators. haml / sass / compass are also at your disposal for prototyping, but are not really in the way if you don't want to use them. Then of course, you can export and transfer to your hosted CMS of choice, or leave it deployed as a web app. I've pulled my hair out as much as the next designer trouble-shooting this kind of supposed-to-be-simple setup, but using Serve has been as simple as it gets and there is decent support from the surrounding users. Not long after reading this post for the first time I took the plunge with Serve and was up and running in 30 minutes with Typekit designing locally.    Embed Quote
