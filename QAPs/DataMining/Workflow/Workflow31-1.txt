★What is the best workflow for creating UX documentation?
For me the best workflow would be documenting the same in a simple presentation. Take screenshots of the current UX. Document the problems/ flow issues/ customer requirements Put forth the thought process of how you are going about tackling the same Then finally put the screenshots where you are putting those recommendations in actionI personally use presentation softwares or browser screenshots for UX documentations. Some of the softwares (mostly trial versions) that I have tried include Balsamiq and Aviary.    Embed Quote
