★Are there any lightweight software products or projects for managing workflows?BPM products seem to be geared towards these complex "enterprisey" processes that cross departmental lines and have large risks involved in failure. Is there something that is drastically simpler and more "human scale" for managing workflows? Something more structured than task management, but nowhere near as complex as BPM. We are building http://tallyfy.com and could use some ideas for other apps.
There's a difference between BPM and workflow solutions. BPM is not just about creating workflows, but being able to execute, manage, and optimise your core business processes across your staff, applications, partners, customers, and so on. This is done through the orchestration of web services, notifications, user input, exception handling etc. It's this enterprise integration layer that separates BPM from workflow solutions. For now, SaaS solutions are mostly workflow solutions. That will change as cloud integration matures.    Embed Quote
