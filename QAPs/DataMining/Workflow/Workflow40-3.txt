★Which DAW has the best workflow for a midi composer?I would be starting first with the melody, getting it down via playing it on a midi keyboard and then adding harmony layers to it. Not EDM music but accoustic instrumentals. There be a lot of midi editing, as the melody will be played in parts and then link up together.
in my own experience. if midi is the thing, then i have to say that fl studio is currently the best, it's piano roll is amazing and the way you can browse plugins is very straightforward and visual. I know there are certain shortcuts etc. that can drive you a bit wiggy, but once you are familiar with them it is a very fluid and quick workflow indeed. that being said, cubase has always been one of the best daws for midi due in large part to a large range  of midi effects available. i started on cubase on an atari a long time ago and i will still use it for midi today. even though i use other daws ( ableton and studio one) none have so far superseded these two. if you want to talk about audio, that's a whole different ballgame... anyway, based on experience those are my choices :)    Embed Quote
