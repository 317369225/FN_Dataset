★What's a good article publishing workflow in WordPress?I'm run a blog on Wordpress with currently with 4 writers publishing two articles a week and I'm looking for examples on article publishing workflows. How do you go about your editing process and what kind of plugins do you use?
I use Google Docs for  the entire writing and reviewing process. It makes collaboration with several contributors a breeze. Then you can use this Google Drive app. It uploads the entire post to WordPress with one click, images included, and adjusts the formatting to fit your WordPress theme.    Embed Quote
