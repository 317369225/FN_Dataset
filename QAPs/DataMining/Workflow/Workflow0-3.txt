★What are the most useful tips on design workflow/tools?
In my experience what is most useful for a designer is not sketching skills or photoshop expertise, or some new tool, but rather it is critical thinking, empathy and curiosity.  These unfortunately are more about who you are as a person and less about teachable technique.   Tools and techniques can make you faster and more efficient (MindNode on the Mac is an extremely powerful tool for conceptual design).  But without the ability to think critically, the capacity to empathize with other people, and without genuine curiosity to drive you, neither tools or techniques will make you a better designer -- and no amount of Smashing Magazine will help. I could not agree more with Justin.  And I think one of the causes behind this problem is that design has too many stylists and too few designers.  While "designer' and "stylist" are synonymous in popular imagination they couldn't be more different in reality. http://www.niblettes.com/blog/20...    Embed Quote
