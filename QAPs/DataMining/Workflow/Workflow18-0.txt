★What is a good workflow for writing longform on an iPad?
I have shifted all my writing to text files using Markdown. Write with any of the many capable Markdown (Daring Fireball: Markdown) tools (Byword, Writing Kit, Textastic, Elements, Daedalus, et al) and save your work to a DropBox folder. That way you can access and create document from any of your devices that can acces Dropbox. I routinely work on documents in Bywork (Mac), Markdown Pro, and other tools on the Mac and continue on my iPad when that's the tool I have with me. Markdown Pro and Byword are particular favorites on the Mac, and Brett Terpstra's NVAlt is also worth a serious look. For those of you using Scrivener, you can write in Markdown in Scrivener and keep the great functionality and tools Scrivener provides.)    Embed Quote
