★What's the best workflow for tackling a thesis?
Melinda W Hohler is absolutely right. Work every single day (except maybe week-ends). Get *something* done every day, no matter how small. Write *a lot* even if it is only rough notes. Write down everything you do... yes, write down "I tried to do X and it failed". Keep a trace. As for talking to your adviser every day... as an adviser myself I think this would be terrible in general. Really, you are supposed to grind through the work on your own... a weekly meeting with your adviser should be enough. If you need a lot of social interaction, go to talks, start a blog, or get some friends in your field.    Embed Quote
