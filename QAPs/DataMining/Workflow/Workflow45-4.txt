★What is the best workflow for PPC keywords processing?I understand that keyword reserach is done in tools like Google keyword tool or Wordtracker. But then what? An application that creates keyword combinations? Where to store the researched keywords in case I want to reuse them again?
To be honest with you ; you need a specialist to run your ppc campaign; depending completely on  Google Keywords tools will cost you a lot ; you will get unwanted clicks and unwanted cost ... a specialist can save lots of your money and time ... hire a ppc specialist    Embed Quote
