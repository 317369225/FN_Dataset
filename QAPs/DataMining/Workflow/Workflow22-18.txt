★Are there any lightweight software products or projects for managing workflows?BPM products seem to be geared towards these complex "enterprisey" processes that cross departmental lines and have large risks involved in failure. Is there something that is drastically simpler and more "human scale" for managing workflows? Something more structured than task management, but nowhere near as complex as BPM. We are building http://tallyfy.com and could use some ideas for other apps.
Let me recommend Yottaflow. http://www.yottaflow.com/solutio... It’s a cloud-based software that allows every level of an organization to quickly and easily automate many of their everyday processes for a fraction of the cost of BPM. Business Process Management software begins by analyzing an individual process and then builds a framework for automation around it.  This is why such software is notoriously complicated, expensive, slow to implement, and requires a lot of resources to maintain.  Because of this, BPM is typically reserved for large, complex, or heavily regulated processes.  Smaller, more common processes simply do not justify the expense and investment.    Embed Quote
