★What are existing software systems for managing workflows?
There are a tonne of different workflow management software systems in the market. Many focus on specific niche markets and I would suggest that you look at implementing a system with a solid understanding of your business. With workflow management software you should be buying into the service and consulting that you will receive as much as the software itself. At http://www.functionpoint.com we focus on creative businesses and we make it our mission to not only provide great software, but work with our clients to set up the best processes for their business.    Embed Quote
