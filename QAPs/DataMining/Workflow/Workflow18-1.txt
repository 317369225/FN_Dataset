★What is a good workflow for writing longform on an iPad?
I used to use WriteRoom on iOS for this kind of work but it has been discontinued by the developer. I now use Editorial, which like WriteRoom syncs with Dropbox and just does plain text.  It can navigate anywhere in Dropbox, unlike some writing apps which are stuck with their own app folder, and cope with a folder structure.  So it may also suit your Scrivener syncing. Editorial for iPad - omz:software It has a huge range of features for an iOS application and is very customisable.   Highly recommend reading Frederico Vittici's overview.
