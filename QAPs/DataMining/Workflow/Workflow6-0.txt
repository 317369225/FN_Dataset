★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
Here are the use cases for us: 1) Typekit provides the best method for having the typeface you need on a project available as HTML text, readable, selectable and friendly. If the typeface is necessary for the project, purchase it and comp with it, either passing that expense on to the client with their blessing or having that cost as part of the studio's expense and as an addition to your own typeface library. 2) Typekit supports your existing library. Typefaces that you already have and are using are now easily available for web use because Typekit has it available so it's an easy sell and transition to use something non-standard and make a design sing. 3) You design around a certain typeface or typefaces that are very close to something that Typekit has — when it comes to building it out, you can substitute these typefaces for the ones available in Typekit. If the client needs to know this, explain it. As for workflow, it depends on which of the use cases you fall into — if you're experimenting or playing around with type on the fly, then you can likely design and build and then substitute the typeface OR in the build phase, add localhost to your kit on Typekit which allows you to use the font locally on the desktop. Otherwise, purchase the font and mock and build locally and then sub with Typekit when you're ready to deploy.    Embed Quote
