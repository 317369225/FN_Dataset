★What is a good workflow for writing longform on an iPad?
These are wonderful times to write in plaintext and Markdown. You already know how to sync from Scribner. Place the folder in Bywords app folder. Close Scribner. Edit away. On Scribner make more sheets than you need. Make one of them a to-do sheet for notes about things you want to do next time you using Scrivener. You may prefer just using one sheet too. Nothing wrong with that. Bywords bass a nice preview, but having Marked alongside is nice.    Embed Quote
