★What's a good article publishing workflow in WordPress?I'm run a blog on Wordpress with currently with 4 writers publishing two articles a week and I'm looking for examples on article publishing workflows. How do you go about your editing process and what kind of plugins do you use?
I manage 20+ freelance writers using Wordpress and have a workflow that seems to work out pretty well for us. Granted, we have a lot more writers than you, so your situation may not apply to how we do things. Through the years we've promoted some writers to have editing privileges, so they are able to help proofread/edit and schedule posts. We have a guide for everyone to follow, where certain posts are free to be published immediately rather than scheduled, and others are scheduled on the hour up until about 6PM. Then the scheduling begins at 8AM the next morning. Or we will hold off certain posts that work better on certain days, or regular columns that go up the same day every week. Other writers are only able to submit a post to pending review status. They can also be helpful and set a date of the post, so the editors have a better idea of when it should go up. Once a post is published, it's only editable by editors. We want to be fully informed of changes at every step, once the post is out in the world. I do a lot of PHP coding, so I've made some plugins that are public and some I've just hacked together for our own purposes. I have a cron job that checks for pending posts and emails the editors every hour to remind them there are posts still in need of editing. Another plugin puts a notification in the admin post list screen if someone's already editing a post, so one doesn't have to click in to check to see if it's being worked on. This also really helps when doing site maintenance, knowing of someone's actively working on a draft. Luckily our crew has gotten the hang of how the flow of things work, and for the most part it's been working out great.    Embed Quote
