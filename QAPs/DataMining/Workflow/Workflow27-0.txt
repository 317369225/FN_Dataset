★What is the workflow of an API in Python?I switched from Java to Python recently. I would like to know how to write an API.
This depends on what kind of webservice you want to create. You have many choices are the most common ones are SOAP, REST-JSON, XML RPC, JSON RPC and others. Here is a link to the Python Wiki with some options you can choose: http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebS... Some highlights are: - SOAP with Python Web Services - XML RPC is built in the standard library - SOAP and JSON WSP with Ladon For creating REST protocols, there are quite a few options as well but Python EVE looks the most promising. http://python-eve.org/    Embed Quote
