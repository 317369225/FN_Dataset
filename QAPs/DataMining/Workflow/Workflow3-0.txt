OK, so I was looking for exactly what you're describing here, and I tried Trello and half a dozen other tools, and it always felt like I was working at it, instead of the tool working for me. Then I came across http://dapulse.com and fell in love. It's something else, it's way more comprehensive, but I've put my entire team on it, and we haven't used email, google doc or trello once since we started. I can clearly see with one look what everyone is working on, whether progress is being made or not, I give feedback and automatically get updates on the things I want to stay on top of. I was so wowed by it, that got in touch with them and am now working with them. I strongly recommend it. daPulse - Transparency tool
