★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
I tend to use fonts that I already have that are also on Typekit so that what I am designing and what I end up using are the same. When I don't own the font, I will do what Naz recommended and work with the closest possible substitution. One thing that no one has mentioned is the work that needs to be done to prepare for your fallback in case Typekit goes down or a user doesnt have javascript enabled, etc. If you do any custom kerning (a la lettering.js) or fancy typographic treatments it will be crucial to know and prepare for the fallback to look as good as it does w/ your webfont.    Embed Quote
