★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
Definitely one of the biggest pitfalls of of Typekit. Although not really practical for tons of use throughout a mockup, I often work that Typekit Preview to it's whit's end and whip out the handy dandy magic wand tool in Photoshop. Or I simply do on long preview word selection and reuse it for mockup purposes. This case really only works in a headline form and is definitely not ideal but the only real workaround I've found.    Embed Quote
