★What are the best Task management tool with workflows?I want a task management tool which i can do; 1-Workflows shared with team or specific emails 2-Automatically send emails when job hasn't done in specific time period 3-Also when tasks finished system send automatic mails to the team
What I like about any task management system that's worth anything is that you don't stop mid-project and say to yourself "I'm not getting what I need here" I personally use Project management software - Team Online Collaboration - Team.Do because it's a no-frills app that's dead simple to learn (around 10 minutes if you're s l o w). Here's a screenshot. As you can see, If you know your way around Gmail it's very similar.    Embed Quote
