★What's the best workflow for tackling a thesis?
As I'm working on this now....writing is a pain. So, I'm directing this question as to the research and not to just the writing. Work. Everyday. Even if you work for 5 or 6 hours. Work. Take the time when you need to take it to see friends, family, and breathe. I'm a huge fan of treating research days as work days, and work 8-10 hour days, but that was because my analysis is long for analytical standards (1hr per analysis) and so I had to structure my days long to allow me to get anything done. Do data analysis along the way, so while your blank is running, finish prepping your solutions. While one solution is running, do the data analysis for the other. So on and so forth. I can't emphasize this next point enough: Take rigorous notes. You won't regret it. You miss these things when you go back to write the paper. Talk to your adviser. Daily if possible. Even if they aren't there, even if it's via email/voicemail, make sure that you get the point across that you got something accomplished everyday. Once you're finally at a point where you can write....get about 2-5 pages written daily. If you can push it to 10-20 (which I'm trying desperately to) do so. Initially just scribble down all your thoughts and processes of going through your project and then go back and add citations, figures, tables. Then, spend the bulk of your time doing edits, and writing your presentation off of what is in the final version of your paper. Do it chapter by chapter and it won't be so daunting. Voila. You're done and a doctor. Seems so easy right? :)    Embed Quote
