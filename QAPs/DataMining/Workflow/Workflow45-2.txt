★What is the best workflow for PPC keywords processing?I understand that keyword reserach is done in tools like Google keyword tool or Wordtracker. But then what? An application that creates keyword combinations? Where to store the researched keywords in case I want to reuse them again?
It sounds like you have a good handle on the initial keyword generation process. For ongoing keyword management, I rely on Search Term reports to understand exactly what terms are being searched, what is converting, and at what price. This is all you need to refine your lists, add negatives, use additional match types, etc. For your initial bucket, definitely rely on broad match modified as your go-to match type for testing. This will bring in all sorts of related queries, and you don't have to babysit too much by creating multiple versions for plurals -- Google will do that for you!    Embed Quote
