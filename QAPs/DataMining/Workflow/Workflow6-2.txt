★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
I know this is kind of old, but I recently ran into it searching for a way to create a PNG from typekit text. I didn't find anything so I made a tool that allows you to do it.

You can convert the canvas element to an image. Load in your typekit and you can write to canvas with your fonts. Here's a link to the rudimentary tool: http://jrf0110.github.com/text-t... There's no text-wrapping, though I could implement this given a couple of hours if there's interest.    Embed Quote
