★What are some recommended tools for data workflow visualization?
Step 1: is to know what questions you need answered. Step 2 is to lay the data into an information model, vs. traditional data modeling. In daa modeling one collects data and not necessarily in tune for information. Step 3: is to establish the value of information as there are tools that can deliver 200 to 300 million records in under 10 seconds and others that can deliver 40 to 50 billion records in under 10 seconds. No wind is a good wind if the captain does not know their destination' So back to step one   Big data itself is a big misnomer. If you are NSA then lets talk Yotabytes. If you are facebook or Google then lets talk Exabytes. If you are a global enterprise then lets talk 20 to 50 billion records or tens of terabytes. A 100 million records would not qualify as big data in most cases.    Embed Quote
