★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
It is a bit frustrating not been able to comp with Typekits fonts in Photoshop, I also have this love and hate affair with Typekit and as of now spend time trying to match fonts when I do cross media (web and print) work. Hopefully now that Typekit has been acquired by Adobe, a solution would surface. I recently installed a demo of Suitcase Fusion 4 because you can load Google fonts directly into Photoshop. As an Adobe Creative Cloud subscriber I would expect for Typekit to be integrated into the Characters panel on all of the CS6 apps, but that just my wish, not sure of the legal implications with the type foundries.    Embed Quote
