http://processmate.net/ (Warning - I'm affiliated with the company) I think might fit your needs. This solution fits especially well the teams of 3+ people working on a number of projects or processes with recurring flows. Advantages - very simple, can be configured in 3 mins without any IT skills. Has task management, attached documents, comments, problem management, etc. Also email notifications for task/process completions and other events, like you specified.    Embed Quote
