★What's a good article publishing workflow in WordPress?I'm run a blog on Wordpress with currently with 4 writers publishing two articles a week and I'm looking for examples on article publishing workflows. How do you go about your editing process and what kind of plugins do you use?
A content team is constantly buried under tools like Google Docs, Spreadsheet, Google Calendar, Basecamp etc, and is constantly switching between them for even basic tasks like comparing different versions of a story, reading guidelines, managing media assets, referring to style sheets etc. A workflow build out of these tools is not even sustainable forget scalable. Check out ContentCloud, a http://www.contentcloudhq.com/that combines task management, time tracking, scheduling with an impressive Idearoom for brainstorming with your team members and a powerful Editorial Calendar. A good content collaboration platform like ContentCloud  will not only help you expand your coverage but will free up time of your editors and core team from time consuming administrative tasks. Your core team should not be strained under non-productive cores which can be automated. Their time should be better utilised in implementing your publication’s content strategy. Disclaimer: I've been a publisher for last 10 years and ContentCloud (Content Collaboration Suite for Editorial Team) is my second startup born with an aim to solve the pain points faced by publishers & content creators.    Embed Quote
