★What is the easiest way to create a workflow diagram?I'm looking to build a workflow diagram. Is there some program (esp. in MS Word) that offers a template for this so that I don't have to individually create all the boxes, arrows, logic flows, etc.?
You may try ConceptDraw PRO Drawing Tools. They have a huge library with plenty of diagram templates. I've got mine from uni with academic discount    Embed Quote
