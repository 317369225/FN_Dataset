★Are there any lightweight software products or projects for managing workflows?BPM products seem to be geared towards these complex "enterprisey" processes that cross departmental lines and have large risks involved in failure. Is there something that is drastically simpler and more "human scale" for managing workflows? Something more structured than task management, but nowhere near as complex as BPM. We are building http://tallyfy.com and could use some ideas for other apps.
BPM doesn't have to be 'complex' as the technology is flexible enough to be used for small, standalone projects as well as departmental workflows. I've seen BPM used for small projects such as six sigma project tracking, and even enterprise level deployments such as account request process automation. With that said, you can look into Bonita Open Solution. It's 'simple' - it's open source and can be downloaded from the homepage of the BonitaSoft website. I should add that I'm an employee at BonitaSoft :) And I agree with Andrew Joyner on the difference between workflow and BPM solutions. Workflow is just one aspect of BPM.    Embed Quote
