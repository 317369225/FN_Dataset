★What are the best workflows for iOS Development?Paper mockups? Wireframe software? Exporting assets?
I always start with selecting the main experiences I would envision for the user to have (user scenarios for the app). For example: Click on application icon --> Splash screen --> Login screen --> Registration --> main page Search for a product --> read review --> see rating --> Add comment -->> buy Add to cart --> insert payment info --> payment received --> confirmation There are many tools to create these screens. Some are offline (such as the ones on http://www.intuito.com/templates, and some online. Then I add interaction, transitions and build the navigation logic between the screes (think about it as the 'state machine' of the app). After I have a running prototype, I share it on the web and mobile devices and collect actionable feedback from my audience. Only then, start development.
