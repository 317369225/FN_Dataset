★Front-end: What's the best workflow?What's your workflow? Gulp, grunt, yeoman, sass, less, stylus, atomic design, jade, Boostrap? Tell me.
JQuery, notepad++, and chrome dev tools give you all you need. Just click on the little mobile icon in dev tools and be amazed at the wonderful tool at you disposal. You can simulate network latency an emulate mobile screens for many device. jQuery let you write JavaScript quickly and easily, optimize later with closure compiler by google.for CSS do whatever you like. I still write all mine from scratch but I have been using Zurb Foundation lately because it has superior grid to bootstrap, which is terrible in my opinion    Embed Quote
