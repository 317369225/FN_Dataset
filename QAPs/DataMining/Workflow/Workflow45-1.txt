★What is the best workflow for PPC keywords processing?I understand that keyword reserach is done in tools like Google keyword tool or Wordtracker. But then what? An application that creates keyword combinations? Where to store the researched keywords in case I want to reuse them again?
Keyword suggestion tools are very useful for suggesting the critical 'large volume' keywords that you should be bidding on. But as you say, this is only the start of the real work. Typically, we use Excel to expand the keywords with appropriate modifiers, such as plurals, specific locations (if appropriate) and adjectives such as 'cheap' or nouns such as 'companies'. So, for example, if Google suggests that there is a lot of traffic on 'toasters', you'd want to bid on 'toaster', 'cheap toasters' (unless your's aren't), 'online toasters', 'toaster stores' etc... If you were a local estate agent in London, you may want to bid on 'estate agents, 'london estate agents', 'estate agents london', 'estate agents in london', 'chelsea estate agents', etc... I would never leave this sort of work to an automated tool - building a 'complete' keyword list is too important to leave to chance. In terms of saving the keyword list, once it's in a spreadsheet, it's not difficult!    Embed Quote
