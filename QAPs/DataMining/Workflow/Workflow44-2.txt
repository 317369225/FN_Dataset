★What git workflow is best for a small company?We are a small company (about 10) developing a webbapp. Currently we are all working against a master whom we deploy after a "feature" sprint. I'm looking for recommendations for git workflows like naming conventions on remote branches, how to divide branches ( for example development, master, test) etc.
We have git, redmine, github & jenkins integrated all together using tools such as gitmine and jenkins-github-autobranch. - master: stable code - staging: what's on the staging server - production: what's on the production server - 123-my-feature: a feature with redmine ticket number 123 You can find more details here: http://www.versapay.com/develope...    Embed Quote
