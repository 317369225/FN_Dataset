★Are there any lightweight software products or projects for managing workflows?BPM products seem to be geared towards these complex "enterprisey" processes that cross departmental lines and have large risks involved in failure. Is there something that is drastically simpler and more "human scale" for managing workflows? Something more structured than task management, but nowhere near as complex as BPM. We are building http://tallyfy.com and could use some ideas for other apps.
Take a look at Tallyfy - the only serious effort at combining task management with BPM, while also doing what BPM fails at - collaboration and conversation about processes.    Embed Quote
