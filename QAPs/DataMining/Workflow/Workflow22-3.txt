★Are there any lightweight software products or projects for managing workflows?BPM products seem to be geared towards these complex "enterprisey" processes that cross departmental lines and have large risks involved in failure. Is there something that is drastically simpler and more "human scale" for managing workflows? Something more structured than task management, but nowhere near as complex as BPM. We are building http://tallyfy.com and could use some ideas for other apps.
BizAgi is lightweight, and has a free modeler. But "drastically simple" may mean a SaaS solution, in which case, runmyprocess.com is maturing quite nicely.    Embed Quote
