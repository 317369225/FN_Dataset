★What is a good Node js workflow, editor tools & framework?I am looking at switching from Django/Python and want to know what are the good tools and frameworks for web design in Node.js. I want to try on your development shoes and see if they fit.
A word against meteor - meteor does not use standard technologies. That is the problem, cause it does not play well with today's existing tools. But is still the great framework to try! (And it incorporates much of the technology stack). Existing distinct toolsIDE - Sublime Text, WebStorm Backend Frameworks - Express.js (and all express-based frameworks, i.e. Sails.js) Database - Mongoose for MongoDB, Sequelize.js for SQL Logging - winston Async workflow - vow (it's much faster than Q) Realtime communications - SockJS (it is a better Websocket implementation than Socket.IO. If you still want socket.io - use engine.io directly!) Authentication - Passport.js UI build tools and automation - Grunt, Yeoman, Brunch UI module systems - RequireJS, browserify, LMD UI library management - Bower UI Frameworks - Backbone.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, Durandal Functional programming - Lo-Dash (tweaked Underscore.js) CSS Preprocessors - Sass/Scss, Stylus Markup frameworks - Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation Existing fullstack toolsMeanStack = MongoDB + Express.js + Angular.js + Node.JS Derby Meteor My personal choiseI'd better stick to MEANish frameworks. Currently I use Intellij IDEA as an IDEA (it is a WebStorm on steroids) and the combination on the above existing distinct tools: Backend: Express + vow + lodash + Passport + winston + pm2 + Sock.js Frontend: Grunt + Require + Bower + Angular + SCSS + Foundation    Embed Quote
