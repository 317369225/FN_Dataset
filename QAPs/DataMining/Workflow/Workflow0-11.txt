★What are the most useful tips on design workflow/tools?
From my practice - keep notes. Practice creating good notes. You probably don't need a formal documentation for everything, but it's good to know why did you make certain decisions few months later. Especially if you work with a team (client, stakeholders,...) and you make decisions during meetings, good notes are crucial. After a week everyone will remember this meeting differently, and every one will remember some decisions made differently. If you can't fix it, everyone will expect something different soon enough. One more things: It's also useful to keep a journal where you can track your own thoughts about a project.    Embed Quote
