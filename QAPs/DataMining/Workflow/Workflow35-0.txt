★What is your daily org-mode workflow?
I have read all of the guides and tutorials about scheduling, calendars, time tracking, habits, agenda views, etc, and I every time I get inspired to create a new, more powerful workflow for myself. That never sticks. I always degenerate to using org-mode as an outline tool only, and it works just fine. I got so caught up in how cool the tool is (I mean, org-mode is awesome), that I forgot I didn't really need a tool that powerful in the first place. Each day, I look at my todo lists and decide to tackle some tasks. As the day goes on, I add items to the appropriate lists and get to them later. I am sure many people will respond to this thread with fantastic workflows, but remember that org-mode is a tool, and sometimes simpler is better with task management. You get more time to focus on the tasks themselves. Of course, I also set it up to publish a blog, export notes to LaTeX, and keep code samples from different languages. I wouldn't consider that part of a "workflow" per se.    Embed Quote
