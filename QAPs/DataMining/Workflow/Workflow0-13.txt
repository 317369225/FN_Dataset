★What are the most useful tips on design workflow/tools?
That brings us to the question of design deliverables. There's a sweet&simple rule here which you could call "define, design and refine". Here's an excerpt about it from  The Guide to UX Design Process & Documentation — by UXPin (free ebook btw) Whether you go low fidelity or high fidelity, the ultimate goal of sketching, wireframing, and prototyping is delivering great product concepts — not deliverables. If you’ve sketched something on scrap paper that looks like an actionable solution, there’s no value in recreating it in a wireframe for the sake of prettiness. And while the design specifications might feel like more paperwork, an extra ounce of sweat in the design phase can save a gallon of blood during development — you just need to be strategic about why you’re documenting. Don’t make deliverables for the sake of it since you have much better things to do, especially as you near the next phase of Implementation.    Embed Quote
