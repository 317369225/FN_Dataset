★What is the workflow for making an infographic?LIST out the ways and workflow for making an infographic.
1. Brainstorm At this stage, I try to generate as many ideas as possible. I'm using my previously saved data and other infographics for inspiration. Then I choose the most appropriate idea/set of data to proceed. 3. Write copy The written copy should be clear, simple and easy to understand. It may vary depending on what kind of infographic you decide to make. 4. Design I usually make only the outline/draft of the infographic and contract the rest to the professional infographic data designer. 5. Revision I edit, cut and polish until the infographic copy and design totally work together. The same for the design - font size, positioning, icons, colors, etc. 6. Publish and promote I have a few ideas before I start an infographic where to publish and promote it. Usually niche blogs, some infographic directories and social media. This is a nice workflow I borrowed from Infographic Cheat Sheet.    Embed Quote
