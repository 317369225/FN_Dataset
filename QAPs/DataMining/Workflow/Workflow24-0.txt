★What is/are the typical workflows for growth teams?I would like to understand the collaboration between the members of a growth team, from identifying key goals or blockers to brainstorming test ideas to executing tests (user testing tools, A/B tools etc) to validating with data and finally how and when the tests are pushed to all users. Would love to get some details around the above process!
1. Defines goals What is important here is the scale of the goal. For example if you want to increase the number of daily active users it's to broad. The appropriate goal here could be increase in content creation x2. 2. Implementing analytics to measure the goals If you don't measuring the results how could you know wether you achieving them or not? What is more a good measure tools will help you to define why you are not performing well (or why you are and continue the actions). 3. Leverage the strengths When you define the actions that bring results you can leverage it. This information is very important because you can be sure that you are not wasting your resources on pointless changes. 4. Experiment Now is time to implement and check whether it brings the results that you planed. Do not get upset by the first results. Continue. Learn from success and failure. 5. Optimise Make A/B tests. Check which option brings better results. Always test only one variable. Optimise everything. 6. Repeat Now it’s time to select a new experiment, or an optimised version of a previous experiment, and move through these steps all over again.    Embed Quote
