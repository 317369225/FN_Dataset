★What is the easiest way to create a workflow diagram?I'm looking to build a workflow diagram. Is there some program (esp. in MS Word) that offers a template for this so that I don't have to individually create all the boxes, arrows, logic flows, etc.?
You should check out Lucidchart. It has a responsive drag-and-drop editor, and it's completely cloud-based, so you can work anywhere. They also offer a lot of time-saving templates. If you create a template that you like, it's easy to save it as a template and then re-use it later. Oh, and Lucidchart has a free version that includes all of their basic flowchart shapes. Should be perfect for a workflow diagram! ETA: Should have mentioned that you can use Lucidchart with Microsoft Word 2013. Learn more here: http://support.lucidchart.com/en...    Embed Quote
