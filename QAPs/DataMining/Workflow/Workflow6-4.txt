★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
Extensis has created a Photoshop plugin for their WebINK collection that lets you preview a comp with the target web font: http://www.extensis.com/en/webfo... The drawback for me was that it installed (and requires) suitcase; I'm a FontExplorer guy. It was annoying to have to remove suitcase and undo all of the conflicts caused by the installer, so watch out! The most annoying fact is, none of the web font hosting services have all of the fonts you may want. I'm a huge fan of Adrian Frutiger, and only fonts.com seems to have his body of work. In general if you're sensitive to type choices fonts.com has the best collection. I personally can't stomach most of the web typeface choices out there.    Embed Quote
