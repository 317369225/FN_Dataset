I usually breakdown workflow into several phases. Writing academic paper is not an easy task and requires a lot of intelectual energy. The first phase is to create the table of content(if not given). After that I create a folder of each subtitle where I start doing research for every particular subtitle. Google it, pdf: keywords related to your research, academic databases provided by universities, Электронная библиотека another source, download the journals books, publication. Second phase is skimming trying to find relevant information related to your topic. Third phase is composition. In this phase it is important the workflow, writing sentence in harmony with each other. References should be put in the end after every subtitle completed.    Embed Quote
