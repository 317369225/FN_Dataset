★What are the most useful tips on design workflow/tools?
Here's a tip for designing on mobile (specifically for the iPhone). You'll need a Dropbox.com account for this tip (it's free, if you're wondering). 1. From Photoshop/Fireworks/etc. create your canvas to match your iPhone's resolution. 640 x 960 for iPhone 4/4S or 320 x 480 for iPhone 3/3GS. 2. Export your files into one of your Dropbox folders. You can also "version" your folders (v1, v2, v3, etc.) so you can keep a history of your designs. 3. Open your Dropbox app from your iPhone. If you don't have the app yet, you can download it for free from the App Store (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/d...). Once you're signed in to Dropbox, you can start viewing the files on your phone. Depending on your Internet connection and number of files, it may take a few seconds or couple of minutes to start viewing the files. 4. Start swiping to show off your designs. I use this tip everyday while working on mobile designs. Hope this helps! P.S. In the past I've used LiveView (http://www.zambetti.com/projects...) but it's not always reliable and not portable.    Embed Quote
