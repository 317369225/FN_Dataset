★What is the easiest way to create a workflow diagram?I'm looking to build a workflow diagram. Is there some program (esp. in MS Word) that offers a template for this so that I don't have to individually create all the boxes, arrows, logic flows, etc.?
PowerPoint is surprisingly powerful in this area -- don't use the SmartArt options and try playing with the various shaeps available within the Flowcharts category. You'll find the connectors withi the Lines category. All these shapes can be found by clicking the Shapes button within the Home or Insert tab of the Ribbon.    Embed Quote
