★What is a good iPhoneography workflow?
The way I look at it, the workflow would be Take great pictures (Shoot) ->Edit them to your harts content (Edit) -> and let the world Aw! (Publicize (share)) Shoot : Use the default camera app or a third party app like Camera+. Edit : There are a lot of awesome apps out there which allow you to edit your pictures. Again this is a personal preference and depends on the subject, theme, your mood and a million other things :) (here are some of my fav apps What are your favorite iPhone apps?  Paid & Free? And Why? ) Publicize : I like publicizing / blogging the picture I have shot right from my phone, saves a lot of time and is very convenient as you can do this while you are walking your dog :). I like posterious, as it allows you to set up a blog fairly quickly and has a great iphone app. The auto post feature is just awesome, you post a picture and posterious does the work of sending it over to twitter, Facebook and other networks / blogs.(Warning! Twitter acquired posterious couple of months ago so really don't know if they will keep or kill this great blogging platform) Alternatively you could use the word press app it isnt as good as the one from posterious but well gets the work done.    Embed Quote
