★What is the best workflow for creating UX documentation?
To me, InDesign hands-down. You can do all that you described and more 1) Presentation purposes (if you want to mimic powerpoint's output) 2) Exploratory/audits/benchmarking - tables, pasting screenshots, etc 3) Sitemaps, concept maps, info graphics 4) Wires/UI/functional specs (using indesign's symbol library) 5) Collaborate with tracking changes 6) Include HTML functionality for prototyping 7) A myriad of options for exporting the list goes on.... And if you prefer, you can also use other applications to do certain jobs and then place the artifacts into InDesign. At the end of the day, InDesign is the most flexible,robust and best suited application if you want to produce professional multi-page documents.    Embed Quote
