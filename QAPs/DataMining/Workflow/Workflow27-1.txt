★What is the workflow of an API in Python?I switched from Java to Python recently. I would like to know how to write an API.
Congratulations on your switch, as you'll find that it's twice as easy to do the job in Python than in Java. I would suggest that you find out about the Flask microframework, and a nifty little extension called Flask-Restful. With these, you'd typically have a class for each endpoint, and you can choose to either keep your application logic within the class, or in a separate module, depending on the complexity of your application. There's still a a bit you'd need to find out regarding deployment and other web application development intricacies with the Flask microframework, but I can assure you that it's a steep learning curve, and you'll get whatever you want in a really short time. Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
