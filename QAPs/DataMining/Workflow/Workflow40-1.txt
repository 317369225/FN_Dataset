★Which DAW has the best workflow for a midi composer?I would be starting first with the melody, getting it down via playing it on a midi keyboard and then adding harmony layers to it. Not EDM music but accoustic instrumentals. There be a lot of midi editing, as the melody will be played in parts and then link up together.
I guess the best is Protools because you can open a window with a score editing (Sibelius) and also the options for export will make easier your relationship with your audio engineer. However there's other one which is better for musician but not the same for the majority of engineers called Logic Pro. Personally I'm very fan of Reason and I see people creating great things with Cubase. Use all of them and you will have the answer! Best vibrations brother! :)    Embed Quote
