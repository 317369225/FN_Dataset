★What is a good workflow for writing longform on an iPad?
I used to use scrivener all the time but i'm finding evernote is great for me. The content is in their cloud. You can mail to it or easily save web and files to it. And tagging curates it for you. Physically i dont like the ipad for long input but am experimenting with the livescribe pen and the nuance scribe software for transcribing.    Embed Quote
