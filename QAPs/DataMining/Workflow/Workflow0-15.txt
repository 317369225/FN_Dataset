★What are the most useful tips on design workflow/tools?
Most of the workflow helps I've discovered have come in my UI design tool of choice, Adobe Illustrator   Placed AI Files for Backgrounds: For the background and elements that are re-used within every screen, I'll design it out in a different Illustrator file, then place that file and copy it for as many different screens as I need. Then, if there's a change to the background color or tools on the top bar etc., you only need to edit one file and have all screens your designing update (huge time saver)   Artboards: For sending out multiple concepts or multiple screens, defining many artboards and exporting them to PNG or one PDF file has been a very fast way to send files for review   Layers: Obvious, but I was not using the layers as effectively as I should have been. Being able to control the locking or visibility for multiple layers, especially useful for pop-ups and other overlaying elements, has been a great help.   Creative Cloud Sharing I have just started to use this in my design flow, but there is a lot of potential though. With Adobe's latest version, you're able to share artboards online and invite people to leave comments on particular pages. These are not only stored online, but also show up in the application which is useful and cool.     Otherwise I'd agree with many of the other answers on here, some great workflow suggestions.    Embed Quote
