★What is/are the typical workflows for growth teams?I would like to understand the collaboration between the members of a growth team, from identifying key goals or blockers to brainstorming test ideas to executing tests (user testing tools, A/B tools etc) to validating with data and finally how and when the tests are pushed to all users. Would love to get some details around the above process!
Here's a workflow that has served my growth team well (the simpler the better): 1. Create a Kanban board with 3 columns: 'To Do', 'In Progress' and 'Done' (Trello is a great product for this). 2. Allow absolutely anyone in your company to add new cards to the 'To Do' column (or get them to send you ideas via email). 3. Have the growth team manager prioritize the 'To Do' cards, adjust goals/scope and set estimates/due dates. 4. Have growth team members pick which high priority cards they're interested in working on. 5. Each growth team member then devises the simplest way to test and measure the growth hack (think lean MVP for growth hacks). If engineering or other stakeholders are required, loop them in at this point and get it done ASAP (days and hours matter with this sort of rapid fail fast growth hacking mentality). 6. Once complete and a conclusion has been made about whether or not the growth hack was effective, the growth team member should review it briefly with the growth team and make a final call as to whether or not the growth hack should become a production feature. One thing missing from this whole process is the Kanban idea of eliminating waste. Even with growth teams that move fast, waste is inevitably created or noticed in other parts of the business. Make sure to allocate enough time for eliminating waste so that your team is able to move even faster and are less frustrated by needless slowdowns.    Embed Quote
