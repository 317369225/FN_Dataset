★What is a good workflow for writing longform on an iPad?
I have written a book about the writers workflow which includes using the iPad. I will give you a pre release copy if you would like. Just let me know. Start using iThoughts mind mapping to begin the process and share out to Cloud Outliner if you need to do some outlining. I prefer to do the outlining visually in iThoughts instead. When you have the outline ready in iThoughts you can send out using markdown to Byword. Byword synchronises great with iCloud and you can get your markdown text into Scrivener easily. Or you can just stay in iThoughts on the iPad and put the long form text into the NOTES section for each Node on your mind map - Use the sync via Dropbox to get it to your Mac and in iThoughtsX you can export out to OPML or Markdown (either works fine) to put into Scrivener.    Embed Quote
