★Are there any lightweight software products or projects for managing workflows?BPM products seem to be geared towards these complex "enterprisey" processes that cross departmental lines and have large risks involved in failure. Is there something that is drastically simpler and more "human scale" for managing workflows? Something more structured than task management, but nowhere near as complex as BPM. We are building http://tallyfy.com and could use some ideas for other apps.
You might want to ask yourself if the processes you want to automate are suitable for the classic BPM approach. Some processes are too messy, unpredictable and infrequently used to benefit from BPM. Ad hoc or unstructured processes are often what we all call "work". We use email, meetings and a spreadsheet or two for good measure. But you try to formalize them, that's when people push back. And with good reason. So, if by "enterprisey" you mean there is no way you are going to get people to buy in, you need another approach. Some organizations I have worked with have used Basecamp. It's very much project based but is you don't have the dreaded workflow to plan and that gives you the flexibility you need. There are other approaches generally under the heading unstructured process management. But try basecamp for a really easy learning curve and user acceptance.    Embed Quote
