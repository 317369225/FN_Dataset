★What are the most useful tips on design workflow/tools?
I can't top Justin Lowery and John Trenouth in terms of overall philosophy and wisdom. In terms of tools: if you're looking to speed up your workflow, I highly recommend: Default Folder X http://www.stclairsoft.com/Defau... and SizeUp http://www.irradiatedsoftware.co... Depending on what your workflow looks like, I'd also recommend trying out a trial of Path Finder 6 (Finder replacement.) http://cocoatech.com/pathfinder/ Full disclosure: I don't work for any of the companies that make these products, however I did receive a free update from PF5 to Path Finder 6 from Cocoatech to review to the members of Raleigh InDesign User Group of which I am co-chapter representative.    Embed Quote
