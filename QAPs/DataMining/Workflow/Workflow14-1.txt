★What's your digital research workflow?This refers to the research tools and methods which are growing in the digital space. What software do you use and how do you use it effectively to streamline your workflow through inception, collaboration, data gathering, organisation, analysis, writing, publishing and beyond?
I search academic papers with Scopus (because that's what my institution subscribes to). I use Zotero to collect references and PDFs. Tiddlywiki or Evernote for note taking. MS Excel and Minitab for data collection and analysis. MS Word or Libre Office Writer for composition.    Embed Quote
