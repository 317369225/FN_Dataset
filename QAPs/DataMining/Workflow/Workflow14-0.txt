★What's your digital research workflow?This refers to the research tools and methods which are growing in the digital space. What software do you use and how do you use it effectively to streamline your workflow through inception, collaboration, data gathering, organisation, analysis, writing, publishing and beyond?
To download academic papers, I use JSTOR, scopus, proquest, Ebscohost, Scirus and Google Scholar. Reading magazine articles or blog posts with ads can be quite irritating at times. So, to help me focus only on the main text and to save articles for reading later, I use Readability.  To collect data, apart from the UN, OECD, IMF, UNESCO, ILO, Eurostat, WorldBank databanks, I use Zanran, which is a data search engine. To manage tasks, I would highly recommend Asana which is also highly effective for research collaboration and time management.   I have been using Microsoft Onenote and Web Research Professional for taking and collecting notes and organising my work and love the experience.  For collecting and analysing data, I use Microsoft Excel. Google drive and Dropbox for storing and backing up my files.  I use MS Word and Onenote for writing and publishing. I love the Outline and the track changes features in Word. What's so effective about Onenote is how it can help you organise your work. I can create a workspace for my research article there, break the topics and convert them into different sections (which look like tabs), and create separate pages as a subcategory (which I rarely use). I love Onenote!    Embed Quote
