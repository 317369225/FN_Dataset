★What git workflow is best for a small company?We are a small company (about 10) developing a webbapp. Currently we are all working against a master whom we deploy after a "feature" sprint. I'm looking for recommendations for git workflows like naming conventions on remote branches, how to divide branches ( for example development, master, test) etc.
We use a pretty simple workflow : - master : production version - develop : pretty stable code that is scheduled for the next release - release-x.x.x : release branch created from develop to freeze code and fix bugs before merging into master - feature-xxx : feature branch, when you work on still unstable code before merging it to develop - hotfix-x.x.x : to fix bugs in production It's basically the workflow used by Nvie. You can check his awesome blog post here : "http://nvie.com/posts/a-successf... Also I believe he created a tool called git flow to make the workflow even easier.
