★What is/are the typical workflows for growth teams?I would like to understand the collaboration between the members of a growth team, from identifying key goals or blockers to brainstorming test ideas to executing tests (user testing tools, A/B tools etc) to validating with data and finally how and when the tests are pushed to all users. Would love to get some details around the above process!
As simple as it may sound, the most important think for a growth team is to start by describing the main KPIs to the decision makers. Make sure the CMO, CEO and CTO validate your KPIs before you start working. During this process you may discover that some of the growth problems are solved magically and others became easier to hack.    Embed Quote
