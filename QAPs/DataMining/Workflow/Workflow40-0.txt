★Which DAW has the best workflow for a midi composer?I would be starting first with the melody, getting it down via playing it on a midi keyboard and then adding harmony layers to it. Not EDM music but accoustic instrumentals. There be a lot of midi editing, as the melody will be played in parts and then link up together.
I teach both Pro Tools and Logic at USC. I'm also facile with most of the other programs mentioned here. It's true that all those programs will work for you and, at least in terms of MIDI, the workflows are similar. Personally I prefer Logic for MIDI, as do most composers today, but what "most composers" use changes regularly (Live seems to be getting hot in Hollywood lately). All that really matters is what you are comfortable with, which will probably be the program you learned first. Despite a long-term relationship with Pro Tools (yes, I'm certified), at USC we have moved our MIDI-oriented classes to Logic Pro, mostly due to its gentle learning curve. We still teach Pro Tools for audio, but Logic for MIDI. YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).    Embed Quote
