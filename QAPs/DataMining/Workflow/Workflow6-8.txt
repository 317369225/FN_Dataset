★Designers: What is your workflow when using Typekit for fonts?You can't download Typekit fonts to use in Photoshop, which makes designing comps extremely difficult. In-browser design is very slow, at least for me.
Not strictly Typekit-related, but one thing worth mentioning is that when you purchase a Web FontFont, they provide you with "comp fonts" you can use to create static prototypes: http://blog.fontshop.com/2011/07... There is an option to host Web FontFonts on Typekit during the purchase process.    Embed Quote
