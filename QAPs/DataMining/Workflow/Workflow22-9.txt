★Are there any lightweight software products or projects for managing workflows?BPM products seem to be geared towards these complex "enterprisey" processes that cross departmental lines and have large risks involved in failure. Is there something that is drastically simpler and more "human scale" for managing workflows? Something more structured than task management, but nowhere near as complex as BPM. We are building http://tallyfy.com and could use some ideas for other apps.
I agree with your points but I think you need to go further than just simple workflow. One of the things that makes BPM so complex is the lack of an 'app' to go with it, you get an inbox and a form but that's all. Apart from simplifying BPM and workflow at Iceberg we also made it a single solution so it does the lot with no integration and the result is a real full featured application and to set it up you're just configuring it and not 'building' a full system from scratch.
