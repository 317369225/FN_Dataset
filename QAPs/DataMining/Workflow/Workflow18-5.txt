★What is a good workflow for writing longform on an iPad?
Firs things first on iPad, for any kind of longer form writing I need to have a physical keyboard. If you want to read my writing workflow for 2015, you can check it out here: Meet Top 10 Tools That Define Bojan's Writing Workflow in 2015 I use the tools like: Drafts Evernote Dropbox Byword Google Drive and Google Spreadsheets (to track daily word count and written words) as well as task management solutions that help me keep track. I get my iPad Air 2 connected to Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard. From there on I use Evernote for my writing. Scrievener doesn't have a good mobile version of the application, so I don't have time to waste on manual synchronization and workflow tweaks. My work has gone mobile, so my tools need to be fully mobile too. Dropbox and text files are very important part of this picture. Think that any person that is writing for digitla publications or for the web in general, could greatly  benefit from markdown: Complete Markdown Guide For Digital Writers And Web Publishers. Markdown is a great syntax language that parses HTML into something that is human readable. Didn't find scrivener as a reliable for markdown, without tweaking it. Even though I have bought the app, it's complexity didn't go in its favor. Evernote does clipping much better, and actually works on all devices. As this is the question about the iPad workflow, I am answering in those terms.    Embed Quote
