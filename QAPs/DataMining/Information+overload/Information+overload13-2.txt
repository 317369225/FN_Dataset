★There is a lot of good information on Quora. How can I deal with the information overload and avoid forgetting the best things?
I second the Diigo suggestion. When what you've found is very valuable, it can also be useful to broadcast it into the minds of other people in your social network, e.g. by tweeting it or blogging about it. Regardless of the tool, try to include meaningful Tagging for future retrieval.    Embed Quote
