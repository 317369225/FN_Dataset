★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
Good answers so far. I have/had the same problem, I mean you can get in and out of it depending on how much reading time you have in a day. Try sorting your information sources. Unsubscribe from everything you are no longer interested in or were never interested in the first place. You only have 24 hours in a day and you need to sleep for at least 6-8 hours. You need to eat peacefully and take a few moments to sit in peace and just be. So, all you can do is divide the remaining time based on your priorities. That is all you can do and nothing more. The sooner you understand this the better. Be sure not to grow your to-do list very long. There should always be a limit on the number of items on the list, to add one more make yourself complete and/or cross off a few. With time you will learn what is important and what is not.
