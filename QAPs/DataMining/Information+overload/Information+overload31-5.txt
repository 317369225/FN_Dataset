★How do I overcome information overload in learning web development?
In my views, getting books and reading is just waste of time for improving yourself. Everyone has his own formulas his own methods. First of all know your problem, you know it - good. In this case, you can't concentrate for more than say 1.5 hours, no problem. Find some other work to do. Solve problems, write a blog of your interests, discuss with partners, get in touch with seniors. You have many options to do. If you are not able to concentrate alone, make it a team work . If you can spend 6-7 hours per day which are effective, that is enough. You can enjoy rest of your time. Hope it helped.    Embed Quote
