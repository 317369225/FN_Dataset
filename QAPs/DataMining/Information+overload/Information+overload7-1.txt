★As a programmer, how do you deal with information overload?
The thing is these days that you simply can't handle the information overload. But yes, I feel your pain. Basically what I do is I read enough of every technology and topic so I understand the basic philosophies behind them and maybe can do something very fundamental with them. Now, since I know the tech exists and I know what it's used for and I know how to start with it. I can quickly recognize the situation when to pull that into my toolbelt when I encounter a real life situation that needs it. And I only take deeper dives on the tech I actually use.    Embed Quote
