★Information Overload: How do I get rid of my habit of saving anything & everything that I find useful, intersting on the internet?
I have realized my own tendency to save links to content I consider valuable or useful tool for an upcoming project, hobby, etc It wasn't obvious to me until I found an app called "Pocket" which allows you to save content for offline reading. Well, within two weeks, I've gathered 526 articles, step by step guides, how to's and the hardest thing is they hardly go down because I'm reluctant to archive them after reading it, just in case I need to relearn it. I just had a realization though, if I do in fact need to find the info again, I am certainly persistent enough to search for my answers as long as I can compose the proper search terms., and that helps me acknowledge that it's not as important to find the precise content I lost when I can find the same value in a different format or site.  There are also apps that let you save a certain part of a we page - kind of like a clipping out of a newspaper. I've never felt the need to download the actual media on my own hard drive or printed and added to my crowded pile of paperwork otherwise referred to as "files"  I think the reason is my knowledge that if I return to a link no longer active, that I sti have the link to remind me of my interest and assist me in searching for a new avenue to revisit the subject. That is probably also the reason I've never felt too concerned with my "online hoarding"habit ... It's tucked away in bookmarks until I choose to confront my guilty pleasure.    Embed Quote
