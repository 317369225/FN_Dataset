★How do you cope with feed and information overload?To stay up to date with things that I'm interested in, I check at least the following daily: email, twitter, facebook, linkedin, instagram, picplz, path, quora, hacker news, nytimes, etc. The problem is worse on mobile because they each have their own app. What do people do to stay sane (besides unplugging..)? Are there startups working on easing this pain?
I used to have this issue not to terribly long ago, I sat down and reviewed everything I was constantly checking and decided most of it was just due to habit and had no real benefit. So I culled those sites/services from my daily stream of information, after that I then streamlined the rest of my information sources, condensed social media sites down into a single service such as Atomkeep or Flock. And THEN at the end of it all, I try to schedule into my day when I am going to check my streams and work to not constantly be checking them.    Embed Quote
