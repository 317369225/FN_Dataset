★Information Overload: Do we have (too) high expectations on the speed of things to change?Nowadays, we all are pretty well informed about what's going on in the world. Do you think it drives us crazy, that things we see every day won't change over night and some people do overreact with their criticisim?
The problem isn't being too informed... it's that there are only 24 hours to a day, and if we invest too many of them in random browsing and consuming information pushed at us, we miss out on using the time to create value through our own self-driven thinking processes. What's needed is balance, and enough uninterrupted time to think and create - and that is a disappearing commodity in today's work (and life) environment!    Embed Quote
