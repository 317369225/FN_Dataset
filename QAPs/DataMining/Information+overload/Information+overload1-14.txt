★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
Ben Fullerton's presentation on  'Designing for Solitude' is the perfect answer to your question:) It's a long haul to manage problems of connection by solutions that require you to connect even more. I've found that taking internet Sabbaths (this means turning off the modem!), playing with my kids, long walks, hatha yoga, a good night's sleep and reading a dead tree book or printed article (printing is a good filter) makes me far more focused and productive about the stuff that really matters. If you're confused about what really matters do a Pareto analysis of the times you were really happy to identify your primary happiness islands and work them daily (five things max)! In my case it's family, spirituality, health, profession and gardening. The world is endlessly fascinating and it's easy to get lost in the minutae. My daily challenge is to remember what really matters to me and how to effectively apply what I already know. And this does not have to come at the cost of my curiosity:)    Embed Quote
