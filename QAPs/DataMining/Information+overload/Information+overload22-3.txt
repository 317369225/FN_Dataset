★What are the best ways to retain what you come across in this era of information overload?With so many news websites and social media around, it is possible to spend a few hours surfing with nothing to show for it in the end. Any suggestions on how to tackle the problem of information overload?
Discovery Vs Search Searching for information you don't know how to term is time consuming. There are millions of webpages, yet entities are always unique. E.g. there are millions of web pages talking about Blade Runner movie, but blade runner movie is unique. One suggestion to tackle the problem of information overload is to consider entities, rather than webpages. Discovery is a complementary need to Search. Search engines are used to obtain webpages, discovery engines to obtain recommendations on knowledge correlations. There are several knowledge recommender systems approaching this problem: Knowledge Graph of Google, Thomson&Reuter, Wolfram|Alpha. XDiscovery is a startup who developed a discovery engine to obtain knowledge recommendations without mining the behavior of users. As outcome, it possible to obtain knowledge recommendations for all entities, even least popular. A portable version of the discovery engine applied to wikipedia is LearnDiscovery : a mobile app that allows to discover meaningful information based on factual knowledge. As example, you can use it to make sense of the crisis in Ukraine by getting a knowledge map of the history of Ukraine and Russia in a few seconds, and then refine your search on the news against topic you want. Primarily time saving. Check out a demo here:    Embed Quote
