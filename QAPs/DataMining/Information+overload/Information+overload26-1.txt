★What is the best way to avoid information overload and prioritize your consumption of media?Watching television or reading certain media outlets seems to be sub-optimal compared to reading books or studying certain topics in depth.
Cable television is candy for your eye balls and it makes your brain fat. Only engage with media that you can completely control.  If it can interrupt you at all ditch it. Surround yourself with interesting passionate people. I haven't watch television in almost 10 years and I don't miss it.  I only read non-fiction and while I game video games, I rarely play them more than 6 hours per week/title.  If anything in the world happens that I need to know about, I hear it from real people and have conversations and usually will follow it up by looking at wikipedia or twitter (depending on how recent it happened). I buy one Wired magazine every time I fly on a plane and I have a number of books downloaded onto my iPhone that I read on the train. At work I don't ever open facebook, skype or msn.  Basically, I avoid channels that try to interrupt me while I'm thinking in favor of ones that I can control.  I love movies and watch streamed TV shows on occasion, but only when they can be paused.    Embed Quote
