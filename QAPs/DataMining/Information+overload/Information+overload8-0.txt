★How do you cope with feed and information overload?To stay up to date with things that I'm interested in, I check at least the following daily: email, twitter, facebook, linkedin, instagram, picplz, path, quora, hacker news, nytimes, etc. The problem is worse on mobile because they each have their own app. What do people do to stay sane (besides unplugging..)? Are there startups working on easing this pain?
I find using instapaper.com a great relief. Instead of reading stuff right away OR having several thousand unread items in my reader, mails in my inbox and way to many tabs open in my browser etc I just put all the interesting stuff that isn't urgent in my instapaper account and read it in the evening or when traveling. Obviously there is a lot of unread stuff in it but I know I can catch up when I have some time and muse to do so. Besides, I figure it is quite important to prioritize and therefore to realize which information is _really_ important and which is just noise that costs my capacity without really adding any benefit. Since I no longer feel the self-made pressure of having to keep up with everything, I can focus a lot better on the important stuff.    Embed Quote
