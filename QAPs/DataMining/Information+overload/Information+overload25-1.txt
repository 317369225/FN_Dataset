★What's the best way to follow general news in an RSS reader without suffering information overload?I currently subscribe to several Google News feeds in Google Reader to accomplish this, but I get a lot of new items every day, and many are irrelevant (e.g., local news from some random city) or are duplicates (e.g., 5 or 6 items for the same news story in a day), and sometimes major stories are missed.
I took a couple of steps a while ago to do exactly this. The first was to clean up my RSS feed subscriptions and make sure, like the first commenter suggested, that I have the news feeds from sources that I will really want to read. Then, the second step was to figure out ways to categorize them into several major groupings and tag them accordingly into folders. These could be political news, international news, business news, etc. The very range of feeds that are offered by, say, the New York Times provides a template for the type of categorization that you can do (http://www.nytimes.com/services/...). After I've taken these two steps, I find that clicking on the folder itself is the most productive way to browse news without being overwhelmed. I can use a mouse scroll wheel to quickly scan the one-line headlines, read what I want to read, and ignore what I don't. I can also star stories to go back to later. Perhaps you'll find this approach helpful as well!    Embed Quote
