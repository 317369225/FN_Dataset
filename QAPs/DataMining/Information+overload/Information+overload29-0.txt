★Information Overload: How do I get rid of my habit of saving anything & everything that I find useful, intersting on the internet?
Well, maybe this tendency ( which I share ) is amusing to us ( hunting and gathering ) and is how we learn - bookmarking is our way of making mental notes. So where is the problem - why do you want to get rid of your hobby ? If its volume, get a bigger hard drive, or start new folders every month and after 6 months delete them !    Embed Quote
