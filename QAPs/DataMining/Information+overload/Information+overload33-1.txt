★How do entrepreneurs make sure they read only a few important books which matter every month and disregard the others due to information overload?
In order to be a successful entrepreneur, you need to learn to prioritize. Prioritize tasks, prioritize features, prioritize customers, prioritize your time. Prioritizing books to read is just part of it. You need to hear other people's opinions, and hear what people are talking about; but also sometimes you have to follow your instincts. Reading a few reviews, and reading samples on Kindle, are some ways to make good decisions too. And if you're reading something and feel that you shouldn't be doing it, maybe you really shouldn't be reading it. If you can't trust your decisions, your guts, then it's hard to become a successful entrepreneur anyway.    Embed Quote
