★Information Overload: What strategy or tools are available for managing a mix of personal and research data?
I think the posture from which to approach this problem is that it ain't information until it's organized. There's nothing wrong with having a collection of raw material that might become information if you can find it in the form you need it. What I came up with was a directory -- Sorting Hat -- with native format files of the unassimilated -- pdf, spreadsheet, word processing, tex files, all into the same heap. To find things, I'd do a brute force search. Once I picked it up, I would tag it and move it over to a directory tree organized by file extension (my memory for what type of file seems to work best). At the same time I'm laboring over an outline. This goes in its own project directory, under version control with automatic back up. Each topic in the outline has associated resources, whether a text note, an URL or a citation. As I fill these in, I add the link (markdown makes this easy) so that my heterogenous stuff starts getting some structure.    Embed Quote
