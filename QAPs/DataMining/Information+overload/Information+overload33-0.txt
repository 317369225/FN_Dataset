★How do entrepreneurs make sure they read only a few important books which matter every month and disregard the others due to information overload?
You don't really get information overload from reading good books as they go straight into your picture of the world. They actually reduce the load on your brain by solving the issues that were bugging you for some time. So start reading a book, and if you feel light, enlightened, if you feel relief and excitement, keep reading. If you feel that the paragraphs you are reading are "loading you with information", it is either a bad book, or you are reading it too early before you accumulated the questions this book can answer. Put it aside. Books represent amazing value, so I would not consider buying a couple of wrong books a major issue. (I am not associated with any bookseller, publisher etc)    Embed Quote
