★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
A friend of mine shared a pretty unique insight with me regarding pursuing any goal.   I'll keep it really simple: write down one BIG goal, then COMPLETE one minor goal every day that will help you reach your big goal. Within one year, you'll have 365 things done toward finishing your goal. And that is a lot. Really, it is. For example, if you'd like to keep a blog--as you said--sit down one day and set it up. Then, another day, make a list of ten topics that you'd like to write about. Then, write one blog post per week. Keep it really simple and fun.  From all the information it sounds like you've been hoarding, you probably would have enough material for a year.   The point is to do it.   So quit reading start getting things finished!    Embed Quote
