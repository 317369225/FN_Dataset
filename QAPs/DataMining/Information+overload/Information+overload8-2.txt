★How do you cope with feed and information overload?To stay up to date with things that I'm interested in, I check at least the following daily: email, twitter, facebook, linkedin, instagram, picplz, path, quora, hacker news, nytimes, etc. The problem is worse on mobile because they each have their own app. What do people do to stay sane (besides unplugging..)? Are there startups working on easing this pain?
Paper.li is cool, but for my iPad I use Flipbook. It is awesome! I can read through my news feeds like a magazine. The pictures show up so I don't have to click a link to see them. I can add them to Instapaper if I want a more detailed reading of something that is shared. Overall it is an awesome tool.    Embed Quote
