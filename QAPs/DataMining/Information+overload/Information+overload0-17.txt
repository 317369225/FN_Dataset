★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
My own strategy is: Identify the Specific FIELDS you are really interested in as you can not follow every subject with the same intensity (do not choose just "StartUps" or "iPad" but something like "Android StartUps based in UK" or "Publishers on iPad") identify the Opinion LEADERS (real individual maximum 3) of each field and sucribe to them (not on all services but just on the one they are more active/interesting. Some will be on Twitter, others on FB and others here on Quora) Identify the Leading MEDIAS of each field (maximum 3). Traditional Media and new ones like blogs have ressources and people to digest news for you. They also have scoops and exclusivities. Assemble these sources in 1 tab/page. I use Netvibes more than GoogleReader because I can put my notes just near the NewsRaders. That way on every specific topic you will have maximum 6 TOP News Sources and that will reduce the MUST READ to just  5 to 20 news per day!    Embed Quote
