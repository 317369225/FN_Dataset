★Information Overload: Do we have (too) high expectations on the speed of things to change?Nowadays, we all are pretty well informed about what's going on in the world. Do you think it drives us crazy, that things we see every day won't change over night and some people do overreact with their criticisim?
Yes it drives people crazy. Mostly because information coming through internet is quite asynchronous i.e. in a casual browsing session you may go through tons of information that was generated in different points in time. Also, since the internet is mostly free, it has evolved to keep us hooked through click-baiting and other such tactics. But at an overall level, it would be amazing if everyone started to expect things to change very soon. Then everyone could work toward that. Unfortunately most of the people are still not comfortable entertaining the idea that things can change drastically (for good) and thus treat the prospect of change as a casual, out of reach dream    Embed Quote
