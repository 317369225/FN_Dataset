★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
Wrong question. It's not that I'm overloaded. It's that to get to the things that make my life magical I have to swim through a ton of crap. I find that I swim through more crap than most anyone because I want to find those magical items before you do. Here's what I mean. On Twitter I am watching 28,000 geeks. So, if one of them tweets something interesting and I'm watching I will know about that a few minutes before, say, MG Siegler at Techcrunch knows about it. Now, for me, that's a competitive advantage. I can trade that information to MG and make a friendship deeper that might be useful later (he might invite me to speak at Techcrunch Disrupt, for instance). But for you there might not be any advantage to knowing about something five minutes before Techcrunch does. So, for most people, the way to deal with information overload is to ignore it completely. For instance, I'll have to go through thousands of tweets to find something before it hits the tech blogs. If you don't care about that, you might just watch Techcrunch and RWW and TheNextWeb, for instance. You'll have to read a LOT less "crap" than I will. But some people think even THAT is reading too much crap. So, they might just read Techmeme, which will have a lot less crap than appears on those three blogs (just the best stuff gets to Techmeme). That's another way. Yet another way, is to totally avoid the tech blogs altogether. Heck, even Oprah talked about the really important things our industry did (she showed off the iPad, for instance, and I'm sure she'll show off the Kinect next year as that gains steam and her staff finds it important enough to talk about). So, the best strategy of dealing with information overload? Ignorance! :-)    Embed Quote
