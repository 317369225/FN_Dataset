★How can I survive Information overload (especially from a security researcher's perspective)?
As a researcher for 25 years you're going to learn to, as Daniel says, "let go". You'll start to develop and eye for what seems more relevant and a gut for where to go for what kind of info. You'll learn which sources you can scan and which source warrant a real look. Research is much less a science than an art. Every project begins with the broadest brush strokes as you paint a background, then as you go on, your brush gets smaller, your strokes finer. Right now you need, time. A lot of hours of staring at a lot of data, until you start to see the patterns.    Embed Quote
