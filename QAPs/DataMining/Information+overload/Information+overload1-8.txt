★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
When the very first time I approach Weavi (https://weavi.com/@/12986), I am surprised how simple it is to reorganize my notes, pictures, and books. I mean I never see any website like this, it is so different. Here is its major characters: 1.Extremely simple. 2.Designed based on an infinite tree structure, it starts from left to right side. You can create new "node" and "sub-node" by tapping "+". 3.Within each node, you can store and edit your personal bookmarks, book notes, blogs, pictures, and other stuff. Uploading by dragging your stuff to the right node. 4.You could change the position of nodes easily.    Embed Quote
