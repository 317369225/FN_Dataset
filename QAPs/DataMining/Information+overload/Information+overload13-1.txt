★There is a lot of good information on Quora. How can I deal with the information overload and avoid forgetting the best things?
There are some useful tools for online bookmarking and Web Annotation that go beyond what your web browser provides. They can be really useful for recording and organising things that you want to come back to later. I particularly like one of the most feature-rich ones, Diigo.com, which allows you to access bookmarks from any computer, to highlight and add private notes to web pages (to remind you which bits you wanted to read), and has a convenient "Read Later" button. It also has tags (which let you organise bookmarks in a flexible way) and social features. A related type of tool, though not exactly the same, is web clipping tools like Clipmarks. Rather than bookmarking things per se, they actually copy parts of pages and put them into a virtual scrapbook, so to speak. I don't recommend Clipmarks though, because they are cautious about copyright law and only allow 1,000 characters to be clipped per web page, which often isn't enough.    Embed Quote
