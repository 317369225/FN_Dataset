★What is the impact of information overload?
The impact has to do with the difference between data and information. Data is any input that you are receiving, whether it's important or not and whether you pay attention to it or not. Information is data that is processed into a form which becomes useful (or actionable.) For example: 00 < \_/ The data is 0 0 < \ _ / The information is "a poorly drawn face smiling." The most general impact of information overload is not information overload. It's data overload. Data Overload Whether it's in business or in your personal life, an overwhelming amount of data is essentially swamping your ability to discriminate or process data into useful information. For example:  You're IMing 4 people while reading your twitter feed and your wife says to you, "How was your day?" You hear the data like the teacher from Charlie Brown, "wah wah WAH wah wah ..." You failed to hear the information conveyed by your wife's body language, tone of voice, and context of the relationship in order to translate the data into the useful information, "I'm determine how strong our relationship is before I decide to sleep with the pool boy." Inability to Learn One of the most significant impacts is that you are no longer able to learn or improve your performance because you are no longer processing any relevant feedback. Without knowing if you are doing better or worse, this prevents the sort of deliberate practice required to become better at anything. This is the same in business when you are flooded with vanity metrics, in relationships, in chess, or anything else. By this definition, there is no such thing as information overload. Only data overload.    Embed Quote
