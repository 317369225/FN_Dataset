★How do entrepreneurs make sure they read only a few important books which matter every month and disregard the others due to information overload?
While your working on a company, you'll get to a phase where you need to learn something thats outside of your realm of experience - example marketing or sales if your a tech guy. When you feel the pain - ie "sheet I dont know what I'm doing here" then its a great time to pick up a well regarded book and start reading on the subject. You should approach reading as if your searching an answer to a question within the book. Ie, dont read it from front to back. Make sure the book has some possibility of answering your question by skimming over chapters and reading parts of it in the order you think might help you solve your problem. I think this is the most efficient way that I know of not reading too many books but still reading enough to keep you learning and executing on your business.    Embed Quote
