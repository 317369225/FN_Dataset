★How do you cope with feed and information overload?To stay up to date with things that I'm interested in, I check at least the following daily: email, twitter, facebook, linkedin, instagram, picplz, path, quora, hacker news, nytimes, etc. The problem is worse on mobile because they each have their own app. What do people do to stay sane (besides unplugging..)? Are there startups working on easing this pain?
Having feeds send you tonnes of information - didn't work for me. Then I created my own paper using paper.li. This way I receive all the latest stories and links being shared from a select few who I follow. This keeps me away from all the information overload. Moreover, I do not end up wasting time flipping through to read what interests me.    Embed Quote
