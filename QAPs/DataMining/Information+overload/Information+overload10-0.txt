★What is the best way to go about gaining knowledge in this age of information overload?
It is quite popularly said that " Experience is what happens when what has been planned, does not happen ". You're experiencing life right now. Here. If something unplanned happens, it's an accident, a serendipity, a specific type of experience. This statement is, unfortunately, factually incorrect. There are millions of books out there but i cant read them all. I suppose there are millions of rice grains out there but I can't eat them all. It's the same with food- you read in a balanced manner that suits your lifestyle and preferences. You may wish to gorge yourself on a banquet, but it's far better to eat in moderation, in a way that nourishes you. I have a lot of road of exploration to cover and look to make it short because we've got just one tiny little life . Haha, life is long. We're living longer than ever, too. I suppose it's mostly a good thing- reading helps you gain some useful tools to aid you along the way (e.g. theoretical applications of real skills, critical thinking, occasional masturbatory fantasies). Like I mentioned above- there is no objective best way, only the way that suits your purposes best. Good luck and thank you!    Embed Quote
