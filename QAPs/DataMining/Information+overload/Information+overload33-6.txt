★How do entrepreneurs make sure they read only a few important books which matter every month and disregard the others due to information overload?
Of course reading books is a way to gain deeper insight on what to and what not to. But it is not a mandatory affair that every entrepreneur should go through. The whole idea here is that you learn from others' experiences and build your own value system. As Thursday Bram has pointed out, there is no guarantee you may find a book useful just because another person found it useful. End of the day, you build your own value system, strong sense of what is right and wrong or intuition, which is very essential as an entrepreneur. So, even though at a very meta level you may be able to screen some books based on the reviews, you would (and should) be able to judge if whatever you're reading would help you in improving (or accentuating) your value system. This does not only include books you read, but to every blog, article, or advice you hear, including this answer of mine.    Embed Quote
