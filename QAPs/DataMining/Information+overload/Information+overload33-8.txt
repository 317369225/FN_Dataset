★How do entrepreneurs make sure they read only a few important books which matter every month and disregard the others due to information overload?
As regards reading books, many of us fall into the trap of trying to read one book at a time, which is rather time-consuming and unnecessary in many cases, as not all the information contained in one book is relevant or of interest in our investigation. Therefore, I have the following suggestions which I practice myself: 1. Define an area that you'd like to read about. 2. Use a library index, online book search, etc. to discover relevant books and read their reviews. 3. According to your priority, select a few books you want to read for the month. 4. When you have them at your desk, skim through the books and locate the most interesting sections. 5. Read these parts carefully and take notes and sort your notes into categories. 6. When you read more, continue to build your notes under each category. (These notes are useful when you want to retrieve anything quickly later.) 7. Use the references, bibliography or reading list of these books to dig deeper in the areas you wish to learn more about. 8. Repeat the cycle with persistence and you'll be surprised by the amount of information you have collected. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.
