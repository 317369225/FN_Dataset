★What's the best way to follow general news in an RSS reader without suffering information overload?I currently subscribe to several Google News feeds in Google Reader to accomplish this, but I get a lot of new items every day, and many are irrelevant (e.g., local news from some random city) or are duplicates (e.g., 5 or 6 items for the same news story in a day), and sometimes major stories are missed.
Perhaps the easiest way to obtain "general news" would be to subscribe to a national or international (or both) general news source like CNN, NYTimes, BBC News, Reuters, etc.  Also, I subscribe to "Top Stories - Google News" which seems to do a decent job at consolidating similar stories into one RSS unit.     Embed Quote
