★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
In order to overcome information overload you could try the following: Only spend one hour or two reading a limited number of articles (10 maximum). You will have to be very selective. OR Block one hour or two every day when you speed-read a limited number of articles. Take some time off the Internet (you could start with one hour every day). It will give you the opportunity to go out and socialise for instance. Accept that you will never be able to hold the world's knowledge. Knowledge regardless of the topic is infinite and there will always be aspects we are unaware of or will find difficult to comprehend. There are many layers of understanding. If you wish to get more done, have S.M.A.R.T targets (cf. SMART criteria). This means that your targets will need to be: Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic Timed For example in your case you could say: Read 10 articles per week -> Read 5 articles a day (duration: 30 min) Take a two hour break every day You can personalise them too: I will read 5 articles per day The most important thing to bear in mind in order to achieve any goal: you must break tasks down. Examples of woolly targets are: Write a blog Read the news You can easily identify why they are woolly now that you know about the S.M.A.R.T criteria. I hope this helps.    Embed Quote
