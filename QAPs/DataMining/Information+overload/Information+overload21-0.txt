★Information Overload: Is RSS part of the solution or part of the problem of information overload?Related Questions What is the impact of information overload? What's the best way to follow general news in an RSS reader without suffering information overload?
Short answer in my opinion no. RSS is tool. An analogy would be asking whether or not cars are the reasons for car accidents. Like a car, RSS is a tool. Both can be used responsibly or irresponsibly. Distracted drives, alcohol and texting are reasons for car accidents. If you take away cars, do you have car accidents?  No. However,  you would have a lot of horse poop to deal with. RSS, Email, Text messaging are all just tools that solve problems. It comes down to how we use those tools. All can be used to SPAM or disseminate information quickly to those who want it.
