★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
I am part of the Contondo team which is trying to tackle this problem (as it pertains to new product sales). It has been my experience that information overload is really about the asymmetry between information insertion (writing/uploading/classifying) and information consumption (browse/search/find/retrieve). Users uploading data (e.g. Product Marketing) rarely think like the users who retrieve the data (e.g. Sales and Sales Engineering), and even if they do, cannot anticipate changing nomenclature and customer requirements. Relevancy of information (which, by definition, cannot mean "overload") is only applicable on the consumption side of the equation, and changes consistently, making the task of the data manager extremely difficult. For example - at my previous employer - we had "information overload" when our IT systems would retrieve datasheets for previous versions of our products, irrelevant use cases for customer scenarios (even though proper use cases did, in fact, exist) and one had to manually winnow lots of data to get to the useful bits. What we are trying to do at Contondo, is solve this asymmetry.    Embed Quote
