★What are good ways to avoid noise caused by all liked Facebook pages and all followed Twitter accounts? And what are good ways to manage the RSS/Facebook/Twitter information overload?
I have to agree with Jeremy about about Fever. It's the best way to make sure that you haven't "missed anything". You can even slide the time scale back to pick up what you may not have noticed in the last month. However, Fever's purpose is to bring to the top and links that have been reposted by pages that you follow which is a measure of how many times that they have been "retweeted" if someone is doing a useful job on Twitter selecting good links for you, then I would continue to follow them. It's all about quality. Don't forget that most mobile Twitter clients allow multiple accounts. I have one personal account, one for IT industry news, and another for a IT security specialists. Mostly I follow people in just one account, but some I follow in all three. You don't have to read all the tweets, but if you want to catch up on one of your accounts you can focus on just that one. Has the benefit of not feeling guilty reading work-only related tweets in the toilet ;-).    Embed Quote
