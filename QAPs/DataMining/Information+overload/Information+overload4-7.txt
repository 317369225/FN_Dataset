★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
I'm a little late but here's my cents. I don't have a cure but I'll tell you what I find helpful. You have to cherry-pick your tasks. What is most important to you? Not what is the most interesting, anything can be interesting. Imagine what your thoughts would be after you complete something that's been on your list. Will you feel satisfied? What is life but a series of distractions? If you're filling your head with ideas you could distract yourself, by doing something. Easier said than done, right? If you can just get yourself to engage in something for a minute you could find yourself in your "flow", riding your tasks all the way to completion. I know it is difficult, but don't be hard on yourself! Give yourself a mental break. You obviously have big ideas and a desire to complete them. The less you focus on regret the more clearly you'll see your own competence and abilities. I may go back to revise but this is what helps me! In fact I think I wrote this post to myself. Oh! I'd recommend the book Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott. It's a short little novel with a great message about doing tasks a piece at a time without focusing on the overwhelming feeling of big tasks.    Embed Quote
