★How do I overcome information overload in learning web development?
To avoid information overload in anything, be it web development or any other task, trick is to abstract away information to such an extent that you must be able to recreate it instantly from the most abstract form to the most concrete. As an example, I am a structural engineer and I analyse and design structures. This requires me to know things starting from simple arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, calculus, mechanics, and structural behaviour. One piece of information is connected to another, in a long chain. Learning involves discovering these interconnections through introspection and reduce them to the simplest and most abstract form you can think of. In this form, they need the least memory and hence are easy and fast to retrieve. This is an entirely personal process, different people may abstract information in their individual ways which they feel most comfortable with. Analogies, similarities between two apparently different things are all tricks of abstraction. This will help you avoid information overload. Being able to discover relationship of something you know with a problem you have not solved before is the next step in becoming a good problem solver.    Embed Quote
