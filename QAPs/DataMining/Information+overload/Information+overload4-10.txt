★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
Ensuring forward progress is a tough one. I think we all battle it and must be honest with ourselves.  It is rare that someone is as honest with themselves as you are though so be proud of it. This is the first part of the battle. In my opinion, the solution lies in modern technology and the concept of "externalization" (note-taking) for the human brain was not made to have a working memory powerful enough to deal with the problem of idea and information overload.    Embed Quote
