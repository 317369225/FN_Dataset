★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
I agree with those above that recommend human filters. My first stop is always my top people in the various services. I also firmly believe in the smart tech out there that helps you filter and find relevant information more quickly. I determine how much time I have to spend to read and learn and tailor my stops accordingly. Don't try to read it all - look for the places that offer the most gold and focus there. If you have more time, then broaden your circle to discovery tools to find new sources you might have previously missed. And then, take a break. ;)    Embed Quote
