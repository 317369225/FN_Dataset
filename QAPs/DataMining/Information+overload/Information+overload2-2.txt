★What is the impact of information overload?
For me my tweets and emails are streaming in. This causes several problems. 1. It gets harder to discern what actually is important. 2. It adds stress to your life. You feel like a rat that always needs to push the button for another pellet. 3. It makes it harder to deal with people around you like family and friends. After all, there's another tweet to read, another email to answer, another Quora question to ponder. 4. It makes taking the time to really ponder questions like these more difficult. 5. Sleep often is lost due to always trying to "keep up." 6. Health suffers because you aren't paying attention to that, or exercising, instead you are paying attention to the stream of info aimed at you.    Embed Quote
