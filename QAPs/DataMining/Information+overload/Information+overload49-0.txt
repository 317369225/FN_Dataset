★What will come after "information overload" as a term for ways the Internet stresses people's ability to use and adapt to technology?
It's not my favorite term in the world, but technostress is one that applies more broadly but is more descriptive in its application. Various researchers have already begun studying it as well. Though the Wikipedia article for it [1] begins by stating it is only a result of new technologies, the second sentence puts it much better: "...[T]echnostress is a result of altered habits of work and collaboration that are being brought about due to the use of modern information technologies at office and home situations." As a simple example, information overload is very commonly experienced as having too many complicated emails to deal with, and as such people will respond to emails at home. This complicates their home/family life, and induces increased stress due to this technological imposition. See work by Ayyagari, Grover, Purvis, Reidl, Davis-Millis for more in-depth research.
