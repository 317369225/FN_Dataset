★How do I overcome information overload in learning web development?
Well, you want to be a web developer. It is ok. But have you considered what your skills are? Maybe there's some other area where you are reasonably good at, which you are probably ignoring, because either you might feel that skill isn't that very attractive or lucrative or because you are getting influenced by your peers or the folks around you who are instilling in you that web development is the way to go. If such is the case, you may want to introspect, analyse what you really like to do and what you can get good at. If you still feel like jumping into web development, well since you can't sit through books,  I can suggest you to start coding right away!! It's not that difficult, you see. Try to figure out which area in web development your interest lies.  Try www.codeacademy.com. This siye gives you badic tips and lets you practise coding side-by-side.  Pick up any area,  go through the couses patiently and see how it works.  You may also to set up your own web server on your computer and try to develop something. Try with simple ideas, like making your personal web page where you can post your personal information, your weekend activities, jokes you like etc. Then you can start building on things based on how your knowledge grows. All the best.    Embed Quote
