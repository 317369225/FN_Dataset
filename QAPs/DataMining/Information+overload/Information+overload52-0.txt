★Information Overload: How do  you digest online media?  cause its overwhelming right nowThere are  some days  that I have to start from zero my email cause there's too much, and in social media there  are some  stuff  that Im not interest ,its spammy and hard to keep up. any suggestions for tools or tips?
Managing information overload has become an art these days, and there are many ways on how to go about. Just to mention two approaches: 1.) You could use news sites which "learn" which stories you are interested in over time (based on which stories you read) so that they become smarter and only send you relevant news going forward. For example, try out www.zite.com 2.) If you know what topics you are specifically interested in (i.e. if you know the keywords) there are a bunch of useful filtering tools out there, such as google alerts, IFTTT and yahoo pipes. I've recently written an article with a short introduction to those tools, have a look: The 3 Best Internet Tracking And Filtering Tools Which Help You to Reduce Information Overload    Embed Quote
