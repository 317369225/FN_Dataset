★How do entrepreneurs make sure they read only a few important books which matter every month and disregard the others due to information overload?
I have found that Spd Rdng (as taught by Jan Cisek and others) gives you tools to filter (and reject) large numbers of unsuitable books when you need to select the most useful books for a required topic. It also gives you a set of tools you can use to process the selected books in around 15 minutes each to get precisely what you need from them.    Embed Quote
