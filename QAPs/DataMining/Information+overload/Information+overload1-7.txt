★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
I'm a part of the Genieo team, which is tackling this problem. We're using the algorithmic approach. I believe one area where our offering is uniquely positioned is that it gets user input and feedback from online behavior all over the web, not just from content consumed inside our app. So we get more data which is critical to help you get to what matters most to you, and you don't have to alter your current usage patterns.    Embed Quote
