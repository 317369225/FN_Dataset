★How can I survive Information overload (especially from a security researcher's perspective)?
Let go. There's no way you're going to be able to take in all the information that is related to your research. You need to accept that you're going to have to skip things. What you need to do is figure out how much time you do have to devote to taking in information and prioritize. Figure out what the the most important and relevant information is given your time budget. One way to do this is to narrow down the topics that are most important to you. You mentioned that you work on mobile security, but you should be able to be more specific than that. Do you work on language-level security? operating system? hardware? What aspect of security are you focused on? Confidentiality, integrity, availability? Even if your answers turns out to be all-of-the-above, that lets you narrow down the information you focus on. If you're interested in all-of-the-above, then look for work that talks about handling all-of-the-above rather than just specific portions.    Embed Quote
