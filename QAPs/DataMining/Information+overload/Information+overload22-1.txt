★What are the best ways to retain what you come across in this era of information overload?With so many news websites and social media around, it is possible to spend a few hours surfing with nothing to show for it in the end. Any suggestions on how to tackle the problem of information overload?
I think one of the ways would be to try to make it useful or use of whatever it is that you feel is valuable. Finding a practical side solidifies the knowledge and makes it easier to recall. Even thinking about potential uses and scenarios helps to remember and recall it later on.    Embed Quote
