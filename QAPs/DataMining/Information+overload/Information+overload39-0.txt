★Information Overload: Do we have (too) high expectations on the speed of things to change?Nowadays, we all are pretty well informed about what's going on in the world. Do you think it drives us crazy, that things we see every day won't change over night and some people do overreact with their criticisim?
Yes.  Our expectations are too high, and here's why. There is a huge mismatch between information and the real world.  Information, presented by media, is something that changes rapidly, while the real world changes at all kinds of different speeds, from instantly to geologically.  This creates a huge cognitive bias and a tremendous (and stressful) cognitive dissonance. As another answer here says, "it drives people crazy".    Embed Quote
