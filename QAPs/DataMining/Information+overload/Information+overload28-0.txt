★Is anyone using mind mapping software to deal with information overload?such as Personal Brain
I use traditional Mind Mapping software such as Xmind. and it helps me in some way when the particular subject is complex. I've tried Personal Brain Software and was enchanted by its funcionality. But I  found it too expensive for using all features and the free version of the software is not very open to export data. I did not developed a deep information mapping in Personal Brain because I was worried in building a dense mapping that would be locked in a software proprietaty format.    Embed Quote
