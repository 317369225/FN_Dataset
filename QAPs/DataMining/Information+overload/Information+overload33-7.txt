★How do entrepreneurs make sure they read only a few important books which matter every month and disregard the others due to information overload?
Reading business books should be a top priority for every entrepreneur. That said, everyone prioritizes time in their own way and this individualization means there is no one best way to approach consuming information from unread books. Others in this thread have offered some good advise, and I'd like to add what has worked for me over the last 20 years. At any given time I have three to five books I am reading with 2/3rd's consisting of business and the rest pleasure. I also use this time to sometimes read reports or white papers I've downloaded but didn't want to spend time reading during a previous business day. I don't read any one book from cover to cover, but rather alternate between books. This allows time for me to think about what I've read in between chapters which I find happens during the business day while I am working or have read something in the press. It sometimes helps further cement the information into my memory. I also find it useful to read new information early before anything happens in my day. I do this by reading for 15-30 minutes immediately following the alarm going off. I usually rise at 5:30am and start coffee and then sit in my favorite chair and click off a chapter or two (depending on length) in one of the books I have chosen to read. This time is quiet and without distraction. This allows me to wake up and I find my mind is open and clear to 'hear' the information. If I'm still tired I'll reverse my routine and go in the garage and have a regular or lite workout and then read as I'm cooling down before a shower. One additional note. I like to 'go back' and read some older books that are not new to the market. In particular I've been re/reading some of the 'classics'. I especially enjoy reading Peter Drucker's earlier works. His insight was/is so prescient.    Embed Quote
