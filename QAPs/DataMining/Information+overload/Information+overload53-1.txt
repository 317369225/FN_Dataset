★Information Overload: Is it like wasting time to try each new technology/language/concept but not actually implementing them?I have been learning all sorts of stuff starting from new languages, hello world programs, new technologies like cloud computing, new concepts everyday, reading a lot about everything but not actually implementing them in projects, is it like wasting time, or could I continue the same and get benefited by it?
I know exactly what this means. I look through a lot of new technologies and libraries and even grasp some good coding patterns by reading some code. Even though I really din't use them then, these minute things that I've learned come back into my head sometimes, when I think about a solution to a problem. One good example I can think of is Design Patterns for any language. You may not make sense of it when you read it, but sometime later, there will arise a situation where u feel that awkward pattern making more sense as a solution to your problem.    Embed Quote
