★What strategies are useful to convert information overload into knowledge?
I remember being frustrated in college with all the information my professors were throwing at me. I was frustrated mostly at myself. Because I have terrible memory, I knew that information was coming in one year and out the other. What a waste. To help make the concepts stick, I threw a bunch of money down to start a business. Suddenly, everything in my communications class became useful. As a business owner, I faced marketing challenges every day, and the class material instantly became relevant. I would sit in class and riff marketing ideas off what the professor was saying. Then I would get out of class and start applying those ideas to my business. By putting myself in a high-stakes situation where the information became useful, I was able to convert a lot of that information into knowledge. I wouldn't say that it's a surefire recipe that works for everyone, but it certainly worked for me.    Embed Quote
