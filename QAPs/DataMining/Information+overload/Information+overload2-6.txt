★What is the impact of information overload?
I spend a lot of time thinking about the impacts of the ways in which we consume info and I wrote a post here Page on Dashbookapp. I think it's interesting to consider if the way in which we are consuming info is sustainable. What are the tools we can use to improve the ways in which we consume information? IE smart, curated feeds, personal assistants, etc.    Embed Quote
