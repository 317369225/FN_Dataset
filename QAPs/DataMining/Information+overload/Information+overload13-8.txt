★There is a lot of good information on Quora. How can I deal with the information overload and avoid forgetting the best things?
I tweeted Quora about this problem that I also have. The solution they provided me was opening a board and savings all the answers there. However I think Clipboard is also an interesting way to save questions. There is no other way. I guess they are going to introduce a bookmark feature on Quora in order to give a sense to all these useful answers.  If you have the iPad App, you can bookmark the question.    Embed Quote
