★What is the estimated annual cost (in dollars) of information overload to U.S. workers?There are some estimates in the web, about 900 and 650 billion US dollars. Not sure if they are reliable and if they are updated.
Research from the research firm Basex put the cost at an estimated $997 billion in the US in 2010, which seems to be the de facto number [1]. Internal research at Intel placed the figure for costs to the company at $1 billion [2]. These numbers seem to correlate well, and come from good sources. [1] - Jonathan Spira, 2011.
