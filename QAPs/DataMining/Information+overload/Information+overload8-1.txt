★How do you cope with feed and information overload?To stay up to date with things that I'm interested in, I check at least the following daily: email, twitter, facebook, linkedin, instagram, picplz, path, quora, hacker news, nytimes, etc. The problem is worse on mobile because they each have their own app. What do people do to stay sane (besides unplugging..)? Are there startups working on easing this pain?
I recently discovered DASHBOOK They're about to launch in beta. Basically, the idea seems to be providing all of the information a particular user cares about from a range of different platforms (twitter, instagram, RSS feeds, weather, bus schedules) on one single screen. Information will be highly personalized so to avoid having to sift through irrelevant data all the time. Will be cool to follow their progress.    Embed Quote
