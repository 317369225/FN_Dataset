★What are good ways to avoid noise caused by all liked Facebook pages and all followed Twitter accounts? And what are good ways to manage the RSS/Facebook/Twitter information overload?
I am not sure there is one answer to these questions, but I can tell you how I do it: - Twitter: first of all, I try to focus on quality rather than quantity. Unfollow all those who tweet 10 times an hour, who retweet more than they tweet, and focus your attention on people who deliver the content you are looking for. Then, build user lists for each one of the subjects you want to monitor. If you combine that with a good Twitter client, such as Tweetdeck or Hootsuite, it should do the trick. - Facebook: User lists once again come to the rescue. Also make sure you use the newsfeed properly: use the Top News view, and filter out the Farmville type application notifications, as well as all the Facebook pages or profiles you do not want to hear from. For better results, I would suggest you give up Facebook monitoring, grab the RSS feeds of the pages you want to follow, and enter them into your RSS feed reader: it is easier to do monitoring from one place than from two. - RSS: Use a clever RSS client; I haven't found better than Fever°, http://feedafever.com/. You will need your own server running PHP and a database, but that's the best way to sort out the news and select what's truly interesting among hundreds of feeds. And to conclude: be careful about the duplicates. If you follow somebody on Twitter and on Facebook, no use to subscribe to their RSS feed as well, you are going to receive three times to same information. Once again, that might not be the best way to do it, but that's my way. :)    Embed Quote
