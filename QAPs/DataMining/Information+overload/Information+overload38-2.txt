★I don't want to learn anything new. I simply want to understand what I've learned better. How is that ever possible in this age of information overload?
Everyone knows a little bit about everything and everything about a little bit. Don't learn to tie your shoe if you already know how to tie your shoe, rather, untie your shoe and learn a new way to tie it. Learn how the shoe is made, then, unlearn and relearn as needed.    Embed Quote
