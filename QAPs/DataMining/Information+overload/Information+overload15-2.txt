★How can I survive Information overload (especially from a security researcher's perspective)?
There is a tendency in graduate research to want to know everything about everything, and that's just not possible. I research Chinese business and economic development, and I have a file of thousands of pages of reports and white papers from the IMF, World Bank, and other agencies I could be reading right now. Nobody is an expert in everything, even in a specific field. You need to figure out what parts of it you need to know everything about, and what parts of it you need to have a general overview of. In terms of academic research, I find it best to think of scholarship as an ongoing conversation between people on related subjects. You don't need to know everything that is said in a conversation, you just need to be able to contextualize a given piece of information in terms of the relevant conversation. Similarly, no lawyer is an expert in "the law". They're experts on criminal law, tax law, etc.. And usually that means having a good understanding of tax law, and an expertise in non-profit funding issues, or corporate tax codes. A criminal lawyer doesn't need to understand the tax code, she just needs to know when she's facing a tax issue; how to find a good tax lawyer to bring it to; and how to explain it to him so he'll be able to give her a useful answer.    Embed Quote
