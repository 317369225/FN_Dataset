★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
We are working on this in FriendBinder. We show the most popular links, tags and people mentioned by your friends. currently that works best when you follow more than 200 people. We also let people seach through the last week of their friends activity for example to se what there friends said about a topic. I think managing overload from social is going to be interesting in the next few years. To me non-personalised news has been solved by techmeme, hacker news, reddit and so on. However, it'll be interesting to see how Digg gets on personalising news. You can find FriendBinder at http://friendbinder.com    Embed Quote
