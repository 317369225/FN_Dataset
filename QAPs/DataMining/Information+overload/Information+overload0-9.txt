★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
Agree with Louis, AJ and Bob but I'll raise you one.  Any thoughts about our "Rewired Brains?" Yes we are all using our RSS readers, our peers via Twitter to filter the noise, etc.  But haven't we additionally re-conditioned our minds  (partially a Nicholas Carr concept although he sees this in a negative light) to be able to skim these sources and make a judgment call as to the validity or importance (to us) of the snippet we are exposed to?  There is no question - I am sure everyone on this board could spend every moment of every day just reading news, new information, blogs, and visiting hyperlinks.  But we've adapted with the changes in technology to be able to handle the quantity of information available and only absorb the amount we have the capacity to handle and, most importantly, the information we need.  Nicholas Carr would argue that we have the information, but not with any depth ("The Shallows")  - but I'm not so sure - I believe if we want to go deeper we do.  Processing information has become a very personalized thing, and we all have our own styles.    Embed Quote
