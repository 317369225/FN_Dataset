★How can I use Quora without getting an information overload — to get the content I want and avoid the content I don't?
I think this is a situation that affects all of us when we want information on a certain topic or topics. The people we follow who have good answers in that area also follow other topics we do not care about. Resulting in information overload.   We sometimes find out more about someone we follow than we do about a specific topic. Maybe there's other solutions, but I can only think of keep scrolling once a topic is identified as something not of interest.    Embed Quote
