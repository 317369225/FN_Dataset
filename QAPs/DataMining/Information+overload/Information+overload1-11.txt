★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
I'm doing something a bit at Refynr (http://refynr.com). Simply create a list of topics/keywords you're interested in. Connect to Twitter and Facebook. Refynr refynes your own streams/feeds for you, based on your Refynr Lists, saves them in case you're on vacation or want to find an old tweet, and therefore keeps your Social Networks "Always on Topic" while you're busy :-)    Embed Quote
