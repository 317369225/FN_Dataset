★Is Google poised to be in the best position to solve the problem of information overload, as they are currently #1 in search quality?
Information overload is a semantic problem, in that its difficult for a machine to decide what information is truly important to the user because it lacks context.  Google's email product offers priority inbox, spam filtering and presentation solutions (ie. labels, filters, previews and more) which demonstrate they're trying to stay on the edge.  Integrating gmail, reader and search in UI that's accessible and intelligent would be the holy grail that I think Google presently has the lead on, but I wouldn't count out Microsoft.  Microsoft has a rich semantic dataset to work with and a top-notch research lab already looking at semantic problems.  Productizing it would be Microsoft's biggest hurdle.    Embed Quote
