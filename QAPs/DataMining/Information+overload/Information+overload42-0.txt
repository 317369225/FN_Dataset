★What companies/product are solving information overload and what angle do they approach it from?I'm overloaded by information.

What products, tools or techniques have helped you solve this problem? Are there companies that aim to help us solve this problem?

I can suggest you take a trawl the information I share in blog posts and articles on my site at http://www.nathanzeldes.com, and at IORG's crowd sourced resource collection at http://informationoverloadresour... (and do add your own pointers to the latter!)    Embed Quote
