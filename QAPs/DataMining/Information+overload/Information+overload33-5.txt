★How do entrepreneurs make sure they read only a few important books which matter every month and disregard the others due to information overload?
There's no guarantee that you're going to get something useful out of every book you read. However, if you make a point to read regularly, you're going to be ahead of the game in getting the information you need to be an entrepreneur. One option to sort through the many options out there is to pick a person or organization that regularly ranks books (such as the NY Times best sellers list) and pick the highest ranking business book as soon as you're ready to read something new. Certain bloggers also offer lists, making it possible to find a series of books in line with your specific areas of interest. I'd be careful about being too focused on only reading 'important' books, though: I've gotten incredibly useful information from books that will never be considered important and don't get shelved with business books. If you can go a little further afield as you read, do so.    Embed Quote
