★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
The previous answers are focused on consumers but what is the impact of information overload and distractions in the enterprise?  Research shows that business users switch context an average 37 times an hour.

This also leads non-technical users to stay away from web 2.0 collaboration tools and to go back their comfort zone: email.
