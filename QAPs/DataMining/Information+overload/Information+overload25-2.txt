★What's the best way to follow general news in an RSS reader without suffering information overload?I currently subscribe to several Google News feeds in Google Reader to accomplish this, but I get a lot of new items every day, and many are irrelevant (e.g., local news from some random city) or are duplicates (e.g., 5 or 6 items for the same news story in a day), and sometimes major stories are missed.
I am not sure if you are still looking for an answer to this question but for the rest, Page on feedsapi.org does exactly this, you can choose which feeds sources you'd like to monitor and create filters, then have the relevant feeds and news delivered to you everywhere (Evernote, Instapaper, Email, Blog....RSS Reader) and so on.    Embed Quote
