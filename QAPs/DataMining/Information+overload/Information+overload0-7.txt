★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
Information overload is hardly new to our era - see http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jou... . Nor is overload something as trite as "filter failure". The primary issue of information overload, for me at least, is one of sustained focus in order to achieve something meaningful. I've listed/diagrammed my method here: http://www.peruguia.com/index.php ...but even that is incomplete as it still relies too heavily on my efforts. I leave enough data trails in my daily interaction with people/information that a system should be able to provide intelligent direction. As PW Anderson stated, "more is different". We don't yet have needed tools and automated methods to help with overload. Sure, we can use tags, aggregation sites such as techmeme, and so on...but these tools generally start without *our* context or without awareness of our history of interacting with certain ideas/concepts. The other aspect of information overload is that a continual stream of information puts us in a position of continual acquisition - we're constantly trying to manage and chase (as Robert details) the next "big thing". Most innovative ideas and concepts, however, are a function of novel relatedness/connections between what already exists. Taking the time to think through concepts and tracing them to potential outcomes helps us to form those novel connections. But this requires discipline - it's far easier (more fun?) to consume information than it is to form novel connections between disparate information elements.    Embed Quote
