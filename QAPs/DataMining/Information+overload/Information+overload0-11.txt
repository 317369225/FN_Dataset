★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
Go deeper. Ask yourself WHY do you need the information?  Answering this question allows you to define your parameters of what really matters to you personally or assists you in your work vs. the noise.  Then, be brutal.  Unfollow and unfriend anyone whose information doesn't fit into your specific parameters of what really matters to you.  And, when you add new folks because your parameters of need have shifted, purge those who are no longer within your new parameters.  From a time-management perspective, schedule your online time and limit it to one hour a day.  Anything of true follow-up importance you can email/dropbox/evernote to yourself and use it for your work or inspiration during non-online hours.    Embed Quote
