About your approach- Read a little and practice more on it. Once you've practiced it enough number of times in different ways, it's something that you'll remember easily and will able to work on it in a flow. Don't try to grasp too much knowledge in one go. One can't fill a glass after reaching the brim of it right? Get in touch with a few web developers. They'll be able to guide you in the right direction.    Embed Quote
