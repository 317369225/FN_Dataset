★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
This could also be termed as Internet Addiction. Download everything you need to be able to learn to program (books, SDKs, video tutorials etc) on a laptop and leave to a remote island without internet for a month. Interact with people on the island, the first week will just be needed to detox yourself from 'all-the-internet' you were 'having'. Talking to people is very important during this time. Just make friends. There is nothing else to do on that island anyway. After the first week, you will get yourself back. Start your work then. When you come back from this month, you will be tempted to go to all these sites and go back to your old behaviour. To that, my suggestion is to think before you read a sentence online. Think if you really need to know what you are about to read. If not, just take a quick decision and close the tab. Just learn to say NO to more information. I think I had what you are describing and I think I overcame it. 'Going-to-the-island-part' really helped.    Embed Quote
