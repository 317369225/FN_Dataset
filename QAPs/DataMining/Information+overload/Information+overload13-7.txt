★There is a lot of good information on Quora. How can I deal with the information overload and avoid forgetting the best things?
I dont think I would be able to make Twitter and Quora and web surfing work without Diigo. While I have been surfing for a long time, I have never fully benefitted from surfing by simply recording links in say Outlook Diigo enables in-context note taking or writing thoughts on the page which is quite different. You can give a title to the link and a description which helps the thought process. Multiple navigable tags are very useful for cross-referencing, in the same way as Quora. This is a great advance from the 'traditional' one-category per entry. I use Evernote quite heavily now too, but would ideally like to have one tool combining the best aspects of Diigo and Evernote. I came to Diigo when there was a scare about Delicious going down subsequent to Yahoo policy changes, but compared Delicisous and Diig with Diigo. Diigo seems less social to me and more research orientated, while Delicious and Diig seem to be about 'simply' sharing links. Its the annotation facilities that make the difference for me. However this is in the context of my interests in researching subjects for writing, blogging and discussion. The 'social aspects' of this are a new exciting element. Twitter has been a revelation and I think Quora will take on an interesting dimension.    Embed Quote
