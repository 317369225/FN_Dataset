★What is the best way to avoid information overload and prioritize your consumption of media?Watching television or reading certain media outlets seems to be sub-optimal compared to reading books or studying certain topics in depth.
We have an upcoming move, one of the things we aren't having installed is TV. Broadband, of course, but not tv itself. Much easier to avoid a time drain such as TV when you don't actually have the option! But Justin is very much correct in giving yourself a time limit. Depending on your tv/cable setup you could probably even set it up so there was only access during certain hours of the day as well. Another thing I do is join the RSS feeds for sites I am interested in as well as Google Alerts on topics I am interested in, it helps to cut down on the amount of mindless web surfing that can occur.    Embed Quote
