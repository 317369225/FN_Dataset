★Who are the thought leaders in dealing with information overload?
While I may not be a thought leader, I spend a lot of time thinking about the implications of information overload and whether or not our current rate of information consumption is sustainable. I wrote a piece here (Page on Dashbookapp) for Dashbook App (a tool that is designed to change the way in which we consume info for the better). Otherwise, I enjoy reading the work by Steve Rosenbaum (Welcome To The Era Of Information Under-Load) & the idea forwarded in this FastCompany article (The Brands Of The Future Will Help You Consume Less). It's an interesting topic. I know more and more people are going into it as topics for their masters, etc.    Embed Quote
