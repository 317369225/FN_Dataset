★How do day traders cope with information overload?
Most successful day traders have an "investment idea" or a sector they are watching -- using key metric filters to reduce the background noise. They do not watch individual trades, but look for trends -- unless they are trying to time a buy or sale. In many cases, what seems overwhelming to the novice is actually quite manageable by the experienced trader. Think about a novice looking at the cockpit of a jet and being overwhelmed by the number of instruments, switches, dials, and lights. Upon close examination, you might find that they are grouped by function, and only those necessary (per the checklist) are likely to be manipulated at any one time. All while the pilot scans the instruments in a habitual trained manner.    Embed Quote
