★What is the best way to go about gaining knowledge in this age of information overload?
Maybe you should be more old fashioned and not try to find what you're looking for. Rather, go through old books and newspapers and devour huge amounts of random information. Its how I keep my sanity. You see. today people are frantically searching for specific answers and their learning ends there. I like to think I have traveled back to 20 years ago, when everyone wasnt so confused.    Embed Quote
