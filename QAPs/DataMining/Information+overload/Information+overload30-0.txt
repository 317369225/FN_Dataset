★How much of  information overload is due to information replication?Examples of information replication include personal contacts replication (different email clients, social networks, phones, etc and the invalidity to properly sync them all) or reposting of content
I don't think this is a major cause of the IO problem in the workplace. It is totally overtaken by (unreplicated) email overload.    Embed Quote
