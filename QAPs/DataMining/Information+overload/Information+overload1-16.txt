★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
There are some innovations (mostly around semantic web, auto-generation of documents, taxonomies/ontologies, document life cycle management, leveraging usage metrics and web 2.0 style feedback) that specifically address the information overload that business-to-business sales people in big enterprises and SMBs face, when they try to prepare for customer meetings and get lost in their own intranet. Given that the time of these individuals is especially expensive and if saved could be directed towards revenue generating activities, a whole new market called Sales Enablement and also some Enterprise 2.0 and Social CRM solutions aim to innovate here. Like for the rest of the population it is all about surfacing the good stuff relevant to the specific situation and not displaying the rest. Given how much time and money is wasted when highly paid sales people search for information / re-create materials that have already been provided by the marketing department or their own peers, there is a great business case to be made to use software to show them the right information at the right time in the right format customized for the specific audience and the specific sales/buying cycle step at the specific customer opportunity.    Embed Quote
