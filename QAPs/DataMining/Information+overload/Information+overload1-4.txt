★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
I'm enjoying using Amplify (http://amplify.com) as not only does it work as a useful dashboard (things can be auto-tweeted, auto-bookmarked, etc.) you can also follow people who are commenting about - and therefore adding value to - the stuff in which you're interested. I'm surprised no-one's mentioned Clay Shirky's notion of it not being 'information overload' but it being 'filter failure'. If you get people who are high-quality filters in place (on Amplify or any other service) then it makes the information you need to process a whole lot easier. :-)    Embed Quote
