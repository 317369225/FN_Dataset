★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
I would ask you two questions... 1. What do you get/avoid through your search for information? 2. What would you get/avoid through applying the best of what you already know? Unless the gain from applying is more than the gain from the perpetual search.... you will keep doing what feels good. Work out your big 'why'. Determine how you will contribute to achieve that purpose... and then you will probably find the motivation to act. If you don't have the big why.... you will probably contiue to waste time.    Embed Quote
