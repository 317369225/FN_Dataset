★How can I use Quora without getting an information overload — to get the content I want and avoid the content I don't?
Big fat update to this answer.... Now you can block topics in the home page feed...this changes everything. See http://blog.quora.com/Introducin... I expect to spend find more good content on the home page feed because of this. For some my old answer, see below: Yup, this is an age old problem that Quora hasn't really addressed. A lot of people have been asking for the ability to block topics from the home page feed forever. One user even created an extension that lets you do that. (See The Quora Topic Silencer Extension by Anirudh Joshi) That may be pretty good for what you want to do. The limitation there is that it can only block words that appear in a question and it can't really block topics fully — yet (It won't block topics if they are not primary topics and otherwise do not appear in the text of the question). To be perfectly honest I don't find as much good content on the home page as I do in other places, and as a consequence, I don't really spend that much time on the home page feed. If Quora wants to grow faster, improving the home page feed is a great place to start because I don't think many people have the patience to do what i do. If I were you, I would browse major topics I were interested in on their topic pages. That way I'd get the best content in those topics. That way I'd cut out the subpar and off topic content. E.G. : This is a feed of stories in the business topic : Business.Someone who was keenly interested in business but less interested in other topics could click on that page periodically. If I really cared about a few niche topics, I'd subscribe to those topics via email and follow all new questions that interested me. They'd have to be specific though. I'd also use Thunderbird or some other RSS reader to subscribe to the rss feed of answers of people in those topics I really respected. This cuts out the noise as you don't see their votes this way, and it brings in content you may not have seen otherwise. I'd also look for a few boards in my topics of interest as boards can highlight real gems from the site. I'd subscribe to those boards via email. Since you're interested in business, here are two boards of mine that I'd recommend : Investing, Economics and Business Developments and Business strategy, entrepreneurship and career related information. Some time I'll pick better names. In that way, I could zoom in on what I wanted. That way if you were to browse the home page feed, it would be sort of a fun diversion, rather than the primary way of getting information from Quora.    Embed Quote
