★How do I overcome information overload in learning web development?
You are in a hurry to comprehend whatever you read. I'm guessing you might be a quick learner. However, when it comes to learning new technologies it takes time. Gather minimal  information-> Read -> Practice -> Comprehend -> Repeat. Do not substitute the vital information that you have by stuffing yourself with nonessential information. Learn and unlearn at the same time.    Embed Quote
