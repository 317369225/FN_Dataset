★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
I don't want a tool that refers me to things based on my browsing habits or even my friend's online behavior. What I need is a tool that will show me something that I've NEVER seen before yet it ends up being something totally awesome that solves a problem I didn't even know I had. I need a tool that will take me far beyond just browsing the internet - I can do that by myself. We only "feel" like we're overloading for 2 reasons: 1. We spent all day online and didn't find what we were looking for 2. Someone else found what we were looking for before us    Embed Quote
