★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
There are a ton of companies in this space. I'm not going to do them all justice, after all, it's Christmas Eve. There are the paginator approaches: Flipboard Paper.li Instapaper The Shared Web LazyScope There are the algorithmic approaches: My6Sense Genieo Ellerdale Project (will show up in Flipboard next year) SkyGrid There are the filtering/sifting approaches: DataSift Research.ly There are the curation approaches: Pearltrees Curated.by Storify The aggregator approaches: Techmeme Google News Huffington Post etc etc And more. Which ones will work best? I'm most excited by a combination of some of each. Take Flipboard on the front end, add in an algorithmic approach (they acquired one), and let humans curate things too, like from Curated.by or Storify. That's what I'm watching for in 2011. One thing is I find that I need different approaches depending on what role I'm in. If I'm just reading for entertainment, then I want something like Flipboard. If I am reading to really get depth then I want a tool like DataSift or Research.ly. Sometimes I just like being overwhelmed with information, by the way. Why? Because I like seeing my own patterns in the noise. Other people will really like something like My6Sense, which learns over time what you like to read and will bring you more of that in the future. Did I miss anything? Probably, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. Next year is gonna be interesting! Or noisy. Or both. :-)    Embed Quote
