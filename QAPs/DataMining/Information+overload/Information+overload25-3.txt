★What's the best way to follow general news in an RSS reader without suffering information overload?I currently subscribe to several Google News feeds in Google Reader to accomplish this, but I get a lot of new items every day, and many are irrelevant (e.g., local news from some random city) or are duplicates (e.g., 5 or 6 items for the same news story in a day), and sometimes major stories are missed.
We're working hard at solving this very problem with a new Social Reader called SwarmIQ. Our approach is as follows: - Clean, uncluttered view of large #s of headlines so you can quickly skim through items before deciding what to read. - Labels to organize your Feed sources. Unlike Folders, multiple Labels can be applied to a feed source - Filters to get just the articles you want. We support setting up rules on title, body, author and tags and these rules can be tied together with OR or AND. We also support inclusion and exclusion of articles that meet the fiter criteria.
