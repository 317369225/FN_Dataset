★What is the best way to go about gaining knowledge in this age of information overload?
Just because information's easier to get, doesn't mean it's any harder to comprehend. In fact, information being readily available makes learning easier as it makes it less difficult to find what you need. Explore what you're interested in. Read up on topics you enjoy. It's not hard to get information, and if you're worried that you're getting "information overload" then whittle down what you're looking at until you've only got what you can handle. If you're feeling overwhelmed it probably means you don't have a solid grasp on the basics of the topic at hand, and so you should take a step back and work on those first. Taking notes and drawing diagrams are the  best way to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Feeling overwhelmed usually happens when you're trying to keep too much information on your mind at once, or you're trying to expand on too many thoughts without solidifying any of them on paper. Once you write it down it usually makes it easier to focus and get your thoughts straightened out because you're freed up to stop trying to think about too many things at once and you can see what you're trying to think about on paper.    Embed Quote
