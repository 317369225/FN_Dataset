★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
Here are my tips and strategies for dealing with information overload: Not knowing something doesn't necessarily equate to ignorance. Knowing what to know is often wisdom. Take a step back and review your online social workflow. Are you using too many social networks/services? Do a cost-benefit ratio, stick to fewer networks, delete your account from the rest. Take a step back and review the amount of time you spend online. If necessary, set targets for time you will spend offline with family and real-life friends. Information Overload is relative - everyone's needs are different. Don't subscribe/follow/consume more just because you see other people do it. Leverage human filters and tools like aggregators and apps that provide you the best content as suggested in other answers here. Do not be afraid to unfollow and unfriend. Quit the social media numbers rat race. Learn to speed-read and skim. Avoid the read-it-later trap as far as possible. Prioritize and compartmentalize sources according to topic. This means using folders in RSS Readers, Lists on Twitter, Friend Lists on Facebook, and so on. This helps you get the info you need and ignore the rest that you may think you need, but really don't. Information overload has real negative effects on the body and mind. Indulge in your choice of stress-relieving behavior - walking, deep breathing, exercising, etc. regularly. If you are feeling overloaded today, work on these tips right away. Because the future is only going to get worse.    Embed Quote
