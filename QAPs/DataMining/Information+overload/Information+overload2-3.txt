★What is the impact of information overload?
Drowning in a deluge of information, our ability to discern what is important and what is not is gradually eroded. The line between the meaningful and the meaningless becomes blurry, and our ability to weave the fabric of our being from the strands of thought which capture our imagination diminishes. We cannot absorb things properly, as novelty takes precedence over deep understanding, shallowness overcoming the depths. We drift aimlessly on the surfaces of information, never fully integrating what we glimpse in each instant with who we are, and therefore forgetting it quickly. Nietzsche said that 'every healthy being is bounded by a horizon', as all action requires a limited analysis. What is not active is passive, and is therefore closer to the dead than to the living. True understanding is active, not passive. There is only so much that we can meaningfully subsume before our minds become fragmented and overwhelmed with that which is wholly other. To make sense of things we must assimilate them. This integration of the understanding takes time, contemplation and thought. Information overload restricts these exact aspects, destroying the possibility (at that moment) of free thought, originality, and integrated thought processes. Some can overcome this to a degree with superior intellect and/or strong self-regulation. Others drown completely.    Embed Quote
