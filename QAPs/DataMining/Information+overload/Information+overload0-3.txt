★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
Information overload is what is felt when the quantity of content outpaces the perceived quality of that content. The first approach is manual. Be alert to what you subscribe to and who you follow on networks that create content. Don't be unafraid to unsubscribe and unfollow if you find the source no longer delivers the level of quality you expect. Rely on human curators or top news sites to help find the best of the rest you don't follow directly. The second approach is to trust smart programs designed to find the best for you. At my6sense (http://www.my6sense.com), we're trying to take on the information stream firehose, learn from your own behavior, in terms of what you read, skip, share and interact with, and find the best mix of content that matches your interests. If done well, the system should be able to look at the massive pile of information that is coming your way and strip out the noise so you can find the best stuff with reduced effort. This is a constant work in progress, and we're learning. Our apps are on Android and iTunes, and we support major streams including RSS (Google Reader), Twitter, Facebook and Google Buzz. Our goal is to take this intelligence and point it at any stream - like this one. Can't wait to rank Quora just for you.    Embed Quote
