★Information Overload: Is it like wasting time to try each new technology/language/concept but not actually implementing them?I have been learning all sorts of stuff starting from new languages, hello world programs, new technologies like cloud computing, new concepts everyday, reading a lot about everything but not actually implementing them in projects, is it like wasting time, or could I continue the same and get benefited by it?
Not at all.. If I am right you are telling about knowledge acquistion.. It's something more like Steve Jobs said.. "You cant connect the dots looking forwards. You can connect the dots only backwards".. I have had similar feelings too, but the extensive learning helps me once in a blue moon and the pay back is great.. Just keep on learning.. There is no necessary to implement everything of what you learn.. Learning something is never a waste of time.. It will surely help you in future..    Embed Quote
