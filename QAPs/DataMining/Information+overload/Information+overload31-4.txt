★How do I overcome information overload in learning web development?
Same thing can be told in 100 words or 1000 words too. Go through "Contents" section of few books that you have and make a list of topics. Search on internet for tutorials on these topics. Look for shorter tutorials or videos. Avoid detailed, verbose tutorials or learning material in the beginning. After learning a topic from few short tutorials, tick-mark it in your list of topics to learn, quickly implement it in a dummy project or website. Make sure you can do that. You can go on learning how to do such components or parts. Then you can mix components i.e. implement what you learned in two or three tutorials together. If you are going to learn first and then apply, get a good grasp on components (as said above, go for short, simple, direct, even crude examples and tutorials. All the sophistication, decoration, cleanliness, grouping, optimization can be applied later; after we have a working prototype). Then you will be able to put these components together as and when required. Or, as some answers mentioned, if you know what to implement, then you can learn how to do those steps individually on the fly. Most of us can't go through too detailed, verbose learning material for more than a few minutes.    Embed Quote
