★I don't want to learn anything new. I simply want to understand what I've learned better. How is that ever possible in this age of information overload?
It's totally based on your applications. If you wish to test the amount of knowledge you've gained... I think the best possible way to do is to teach lessons to young kids and see how well you're able to remember the lessons you've learnt.Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
