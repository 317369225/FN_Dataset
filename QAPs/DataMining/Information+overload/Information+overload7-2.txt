★As a programmer, how do you deal with information overload?
I think it's reasonable to be more targeted. I don't feel like I need to follow everything that's going on in anything related to tech. Doctors specialize. Oncologists should keep up with the latest cancer treatments, but don't need to follow the latest news about foot fungus. For a podiatrist, it's the other way around. The reason they specialize is that there's not enough time to keep up with everything, and if you try you spread yourself too thin.    Embed Quote
