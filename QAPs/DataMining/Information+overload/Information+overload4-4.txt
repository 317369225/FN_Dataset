★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
You need discipline. It's that simple. No offense intended, but you aren't unique and you aren't dysfunctional. This is how most people work. They dream about the destination, and don't care about the journey. They want the results, but they don't have what it takes to get there. Then they mislead themselves by blaming their lack of success on perfectionism, information overload or some such thing. Lots of people have great ideas. Lots of people have grand missions. Very few people will actualize their dreams because that's all they will do is dream. When someone says "I would love to write a book someday", what they really mean is "I would really love to be a published author someday". What they don't mean is "I would really love to toil over a laptop day and night for what could potentially be years because I'm in love with the process of creation". I hope this post doesn't offend you at all - honestly I'm trying to help. Decide what you want to do, make a plan and focus on the next step. Initially, it will take brute force of will to stay focused, but once you get engaged you may discover that the process is actually much better than the result. If you don't get engaged, you're trying to climb the wrong tree and should probably find another that you do enjoy climbing. And for what it's worth, discipline doesn't come overnight. It must be earned. Best of luck.    Embed Quote
