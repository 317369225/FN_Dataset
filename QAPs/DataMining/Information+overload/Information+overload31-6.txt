★How do I overcome information overload in learning web development?
To overcome this issue, I would suggest you to Set goals: long term and short term. Enroll yourself in an online or an offline web development course. Try to look up online on how to learn web development ( try to understand the basic concepts of web development and then move bottom up based on course hierarchy) To study any subject you must try to first have a good grasp over the prerequisites for that subject . Value studying smart over studying hard . The number of hours you study does not matter, only what you do in that duration does.Hope this was helpful    Embed Quote
