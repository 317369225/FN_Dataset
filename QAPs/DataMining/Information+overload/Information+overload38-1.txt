★I don't want to learn anything new. I simply want to understand what I've learned better. How is that ever possible in this age of information overload?
I look at the sources of information that surround me and find that the more mature I grow to be the more I need to question the value of that information and prioritize it so that I can separate the wheat from the chaff. For me, it's not really that I don't want to learn anything new, just that I have a foundation, intellectually and spiritually. I am not starting from scratch every time the TV comes on. I have old books around, the ones I chose not to give away after I read them, and I do go back and re-explore the information there; it's amazing what more I gain when I re-read a book. I am very selective about exposure to television. When I watch, I watch it for a particular program. I have not seen a sitcom in about 20 years. I know it's okay to turn the thing off. The computer is the same. I could be overwhelmed by the access I have to the world through Google, email, FaceBook, and yes, Quora! I try to use it for specific things with specific goals: I record music and videos with it. If I have a thought about something and my memory fails, I will Google it, but I don't keep clicking on links until I am so awash with information that my head is starting to hurt. My Internet Provider "throttles" the connection speed to the level that I am willing to pay for. Similar to that, I find a need to throttle the information I receive by putting a spigot and a filter on it. Prioritize input. Assign values. So I guess the bottom line is, you've got to take control and don't become a victim of information overload. That stream is a tool. Use it to find information that will help you understand more of what you've already learned. ps thx for a2a ;)    Embed Quote
