★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
Sir, I need you to step away from the devices, and hold your hands up and off the keyboard. Then execute for 5 seconds. Another five. Give yourself a Scooby snack. Repeat until you have the attention span of a two year old. Keep going until you can function like an adult. Kidding, of course. Key is to focus on one thing at a time. Sean Green, the ex-baseball player, gave a good talk at TEDx Orange Coast about being in the present and focusing on just one thing. Why? Because you can't change the past or future. You can just affect the here and now, and just your part of it. Procrastination is a common problem. Yours is extreme. You may want to hire a professional.    Embed Quote
