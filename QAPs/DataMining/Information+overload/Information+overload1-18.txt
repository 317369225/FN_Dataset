★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
I agree with many of the other answers and the attempt to provide a meta-level of classification. But over the last few years, it has become apparent to me that solutions that take a undifferentiated stream of text and massage it are not going to be enough. That's the reason that we started working on Bscopes (http://www.bscopes.com). Our key is that anything that will truly help with information overload has to be graphical -- visual -- and not just more text. I'm good at Google Reader and can keep up with many hundreds of RSS feeds a day. But I want... need... to be better. I need to keep up with more in less time. And to do that, I think I need a paradigm shift in the way I consume things. We are very curious to find out if others who feel overloaded are searching for the same thing.    Embed Quote
