★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
I think that we need three clear filters in our minds. What appears erroneous, what is essential and what appears to be generative. We also need to think about what we collide with alongside time - the past, the current and the future. It's a very simple matrix - but I find it helps deal with the torrent. We often stand like bears atop a waterfall, grabbing at salmon for an easy meal - so I find tools to allow me to flick information to useful spaces for later use. For example: Twitter to Diigo with a tag via favorites (generative, future), Mendeley (generative future and past), Evernote (essential, current) etc., Each person has a cognitive capacity, so processes information differently. The point seems to be to actually want to deal with it - rather than collect resources and tidbits like your grandmother collects plastic bags in the kitchen drawer.    Embed Quote
