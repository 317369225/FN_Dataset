★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
limit the content that you are subscribed to. There isn't enough time to read/absorb all the information. use an RSS consolidator & group feeds together (e.g., news, local, travel, etc) Thus you can limit yourself to topics & the consolidator will limit the rest of screen real estate(that normally distracts you). [I prefer Feedly, as I can see a blurb or more per article vs a headline only] same goes with twitter & other social media sources, put people into lists & then use client to look at lists in columns. (I rarely look at the 'all friends' feed) the best advice though is to limit your content, if you read/share less than 1 article per week from a source, drop that source (as they're sharing far too much extra uninteresting content)    Embed Quote
