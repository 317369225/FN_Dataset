★I don't want to learn anything new. I simply want to understand what I've learned better. How is that ever possible in this age of information overload?
That is not how the mind works. Learning is a dynamic process. Sometimes learning new things help you understand much better, something that you already know. Knowledge is not always best gained vertically, sometime a broader base is required to be able to learn better. Answering your question, sadly there is no unlearning. I wish I can ulearn some things that I know. But that knowledge is fixed your mind till your mind chooses to forget it. The best you can do is to consciously start rejecting information that you think do not need. Maybe perhaps your mind in the long run will train itself to reject this data. Stop going on Facebook, Quora and stop watching TV for a start if you are concerned about that. I know many of my colleagues that are like that. They like to live without distraction and concentrate only on their research. It is possible to be that way.    Embed Quote
