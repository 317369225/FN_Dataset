★What innovations are focusing on dealing with information overload?
Here are some thoughts ... Finding more information than noise for people: Take all of your contacts, put them in one place, and then give you news, status updates, and other information prioritized either by "who's most important" -- defined by how often you contact them and in how many places you're connected to them -- or by the lists/tags/groups you specify.  Then, make that information available in the places where you do work (email like Gmail or Outlook, web, or mobile like iPhone or Android.) That's what we do with Gist - http://gist.com. Finding more information than noise for for news in general: This is a harder problem and needs to be tuned to the individual and the particular news you're seeking.  The major blogs (Mashable, Lifehacker, etc.) and news sources (NYT, WSJ, Wired, etc.) will get you basic information about a story but won't often tell you about the background behind the story.  Bloggers and other , newer news platforms will give you their opinion, but won't always research their story and provide you with an even presentation of facts and opinion. Beth Kanter wrote an interesting blog post about this yesterday (http://www.bethkanter.org/networ...) that discusses a "process-based" and a "product-based" method of learning.  I think you need some sort of process (as mentioned in some of the other answers above) that matches to the people and topics you'd like to learn more about.  The products that solve this are still evolving, so I'd love to hear your suggestions and the other products you're using to bridge this information gap.    Embed Quote
