★What the basic ways to be discipline in information overload age?I am moving from technology to another without being able to be a professional in anyone of them
My best advice? Less is more. Pick the essential systems you need to do your work and don't worry about the newest, latest, greatest unless that learning is critical for your job/work. Many people feel that they will "miss out" if they don't try everything, read everything, subscribe to everything, etc. In fact, the more discerning and focused you are, the more competent you will be.    Embed Quote
