★What are some good strategies for dealing with information overload?
The key to managing information is ruthlessness.  If it's boring, move on.  If it's not getting to the point, move on.  If it's repetitive, over-wordy or congested, move on.  Closing a window or deleting boring writing is not a crime.  In summary, if I can't quickly see the value of your content, I move on.  I determine value by scanning.  I will devote my attention to content that is concise, clear and scannable.  Perhaps if there's a stampede on twitter reflecting a really valuable post, I will overlook congested prose and long paragraphs.  In general, though, I like to use images, graphics, H1 & H2 text and emphasized text to understand the structure and main points of the text.  I am also ruthless in deleting newsletters, etc. if the subject line is not informative as to its content.    Embed Quote
