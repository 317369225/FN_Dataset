★How does today's tech-enabled world and the information overload people experience relate to the book Shockwave Rider?
BrunnerJohn Brunner (links to: /John-Brunner-author)'s quartet of novels (the other three are Stand On ZanzibarStand On Zanzibar, The Sheep Look UpThe Sheep Look Up, and The Jagged OrbitThe Jagged Orbit) based on a mix of the Club of Rome report and Alvin TofflerAlvin Toffler (author) (links to: /Alvin-Toffler-author)'s Future Shock Future Shock are well researched works that pull in information from a lot of different sources.Shockwave Rider Shockwave Rider is also strongly influended by the founding of the Claremont CollegesClaremont Colleges (links to: /Claremont-Colleges), the early work of the Point Foundation (home of the Whole Earth CatalogsWhole Earth Catalog), and the PLATO learning system - all of which were strongly influential on the people and technologies that built our current technologies (for example PLATO influenced as diverse a group of people as Ted Nelson and Ray OzzieRay Ozzie (links to: /Ray-Ozzie-1)).   It's perhaps easier to consider them a synthesis of then current futurist thought, and so a set of works that reflect a world that was already highly probable even then in the early 1970s.
