★How can I overcome information overload, shiny object syndrome and stop planning all the time and just execute and 'do'? 787888
Work on your habits instead of making lists of goals and making more plans. What habits are serving you most ? Take it slowly. One habit after the other. Often it helps to get into a routine. Ask yourself how much time you will spend on the net. Maybe every morning for 30 minutes or so. And then do it. You will be amazed how much more easy your life will be. Don't react - act. Step by step. Think about yourself and what you really want to achieve in your life. And then ask yourself what habits you have that serves you or are hindering you. Good Luck !    Embed Quote
