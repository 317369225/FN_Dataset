★What is the applicability of one way ANOVA and what are the demerits?
Analyses of variance allow one to compare differences in >2 group means, as opposed to t-tests, which compare 2 and only 2 means. This allows analysis of factors with 3 or more levels (one-way ANOVA), or analysis of two or more factors (two-way ANOVA). The advantage ANOVAs hold over multiple t-tests is that the risk of type I error is lower, as all levels are being simultaneously compared. One downside is that ANOVAs only return the F-statistic, which merely tell you whether a significant difference exists among your factors; to find out where the difference lies, post-hoc tests must be conducted. Additionally, ANOVAs perform poorly when one's data is non-normal. There are various tests to check for these situations (e.g. Mauchley's sphericity test). Another more subtle point is that ANOVAs are essentially special cases of regression where the factors (IVs, x, etc.) are constrained to particular levels. One can run a regression on the continuous factor, or one can arbitrarily segment the factor into 3 levels at the 33rd and 66th percentile and classify these as 'low,' 'medium,' and 'high,' and run an ANOVA on these. Even if the levels of the independent variable are categorical, the ANOVA is an alternate representation of a regression equation where the IV is dummy-coded to represent the different levels (e.g. male = 0, female = 1). For example, imagine any continuous factor.    Embed Quote
