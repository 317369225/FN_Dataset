★In statistics, is it possible that ANOVA could go obsolete?http://andrewgelman.com/2011/09/...
For unstructured data, as in much of psychology and the social sciences, there is a movement toward alternative models.  But in the agricultural sciences, ANOVAs will never be obsolete.  Agricultural statisticians are among the most conservative statistical communities, but for good reason: 1. They work.  They are simple, people understand them, they have a long history (R.A. Fisher developed ANOVA to analyze agricultural data). 2. Data are explicitly structured.  A split-plot and a block are called those terms because experimental plots are laid out on a field, with blocks.  Not taking into account this structure leads to improper inferences and conclusions. 3. Agricultural data is noisy and continuous.  Which is what ANOVAs were designed for. The shorter answer is that our data fit the assumptions of an ANOVA. [The other issue is how you define ANOVA will affect how this question is answered.]    Embed Quote
