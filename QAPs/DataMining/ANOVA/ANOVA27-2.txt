★Can we use ANOVA if three sets of data meet the normality assumption?
Not an answer to the question per se, but can't help but post this as a comment/question to statisticians here (please don't consider it as a critique, since I understand that everyone sees a problem from their own perspective, using different assumptions, etc.). Anyway, how in the world we, applied researchers, can navigate the ocean of statistics, when three experts (two of which are professional statisticians) don't agree on this relatively simple problem? This is largely a rhetoric question, raised just to emphasize my disappointment of the lack of some clear common framework that would allow applied researchers feel more sure-footed, when approaching various real life situations. I've already expressed  (on Quora and Cross Validated) my slight frustration about statistics looking more like an art than a science and my desire to find or put some efforts toward creating a unified thematic framework. Despite having some people told me that such framework is impossible to come up with, I respectfully disagree and continue my search (I guess, I'm an optimist after all :). Any references in that regard will be appreciated.    Embed Quote
