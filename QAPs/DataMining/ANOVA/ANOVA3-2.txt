★How are ANOVA and regression related to each other?
I said a little about this in this answer to an earlier question of yours:  http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-b... For a more specific example, imagine you are looking at the relationship between eye color and height. You do could (A) do a one-way ANOVA; or you could (B) do a regression with several dummy variables: one variable which is 1 when the subject has blue eyes and 0 otherwise; one variable which is 1 when the subject has brown eyes and 0 otherwise; one variable which is 1 when the subject has green eyes and 0 otherwise, and so on. The relationship you are looking for is that (A) and (B) are actually the same thing. Similarly, more complicated kinds of ANOVA can be carried out as a linear regression with appropriately designed dummy variables.    Embed Quote
