★What is an intuitive explanation of ANOVA and what it's used for?
ANOVA is a linear model like regression analysis and like regression it helps us understand the correlation between a dependent variable and an independent variable. In regression analysis the independent variable is continuous and in ANOVA the independent variable is group membership. I would likely use regression when studying the relationship between parent height and child height.  But when my son watered groups of tomato plants with either water, milk or soda and measured their heights I could have use ANOVA to test various hypotheses against his data.    Embed Quote
