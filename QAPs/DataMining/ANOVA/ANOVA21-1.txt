★How are the f-distribution, chi-square distribution, and ANOVA related to each other?
Here is my intuitive explanation as a novice.  Corrections are welcome: The chi-square distribution is related to the sampling distribution of sample variances.   That is, it describes how the variance of repeated samples of the same size would be distributed, given they are taken from a normally distributed population. The f-distribution describes hows the ratio of two chi-square distributions would be distributed. Anova makes use of the f-distribution to perform a statistical hypothesis test of whether the means of several samples come from the same population or at least one of them comes from a different population with a unique mean.    It makes use of the Central limit theorem to perform the analysis.   The numerator of the ratio represents the variance between the samples, and the denominator represents the variance within the samples. If the ratio of the two exceeds some arbitrary (set by the experimenter) critical value, then it is concluded that at least one of the sample means was taken from a different population.    Embed Quote
