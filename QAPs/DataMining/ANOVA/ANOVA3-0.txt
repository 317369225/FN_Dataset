★How are ANOVA and regression related to each other?
As others have said, regression and ANOVA are mathematically identical; in matrix notation both are . The term ANOVA is usually used when all the independent vvariables are categorical; ANCOVA is sometimes used when some are categorical and some continuous; but all can be handled under regression. One reason for confusion over this is that the output (from most programs, anyway) looks very different. That is because the two methods evolved in different fields. However, if you take any example of an ANOVA and then run the same model as a regression, you can compare the outputs directly and see what is going on.    Embed Quote
