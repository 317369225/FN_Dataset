★What's the basic difference between ANOVA, regression testing, and t-test?I read today that all three were developed independently about the same time period, and perform the same basic function but in different ways.
t Test is used to compare means of two variables (paired and independent t test) or compare mean of a single variable to a benchmark (one tailed t test). Anova on the other hand is used to compare variation within and between two or more variables. Regression is used when we want to fit a line in our data i.e. establish a relationship between the variables and then determine the coefficients and constants in that relationship.    Embed Quote
