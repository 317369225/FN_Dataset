★Is ANOVA a type of factor analysis, or are they completely different things?Factor analysis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fac... ANOVA: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANOVA
They are answering different questions. In ANOVA, we have a "response variable" (for example, height) measured on some subjects who are divided into groups. We want to know how the response variable differs from group to group and whether the groups are different from each other in terms of the average response. (Are people's average heights significantly different by eye color?) In factor analysis, there is no single "response variable." Instead, we have several measurements on each subject, e.g. scores on a battery of tests. We want to know if there is a smaller number of variables (e.g. mathematical ability, verbal ability) which could explain the scores.    Embed Quote
