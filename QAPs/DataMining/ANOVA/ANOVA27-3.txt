★Can we use ANOVA if three sets of data meet the normality assumption?
Of course you can, that is ANOVAs usual application. You can also use linear regression for essentially the same result, and a more powerful method: empirical Bayesian inference. The advantage of this last technique is that with it you can use your prior expert knowledge, of the variables or causal mechanisms, within your calculation of the hypothetical probability.     At all times look closely at your experimental result for clues to causation, statistical assessment of random probabilities are always secondary.    Embed Quote
