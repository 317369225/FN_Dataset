★What is an intuitive explanation of ANOVA and what it's used for?
ANOVA is an inferential statistic that can be used to compare effects of experimental manipulation  Consider an experimental investigation in which the effects of work environment on productivity are examined using a between-subjects design. A large corporation randomly assigns its workers to one of three different work environments; single closed office single open cubby where the worker works alone but can see and hear other workers, shared open cubby where the worker shares the work space with another worker and can see and hear other workers. They then measure each worker’s productivity on a standardized productivity schedule. The independent variable is the type of work environment and it has three levels. The dependent variable is productivity,  The null hypothesis is that work environment has no effect on productivity or that the productivity of all workers will be the same regardless of work environment. These data would be most appropriately analyzed with an ANOVA. http://www.mhhe.com/socscience/i...    Embed Quote
