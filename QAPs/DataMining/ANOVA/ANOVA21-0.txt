★How are the f-distribution, chi-square distribution, and ANOVA related to each other?
I'm not sure how technical an answer you want. The chi-squared distribution with v degrees of freedom is the sum of the squares of v Normal distributions and can be used to make inferences about the variance of a Normal population based on a random sample taken from it. The F-distribution is the ratio of two chi-squared distributions (suitably scaled by their respective degrees of freedom). It can be used to make inferences about the variances of two Normal populations (specifically about the ratio of those variances) based on random samples taken from each. The ANOVA test compares the means of three or more Normal populations (which are assumed to have the same variance) by cleverly comparing two estimates of that variance derived from random samples taken from each population. Since the ANOVA is comparing two variances, the F-distribution is used for the test. It does this by first considering all three populations to be the same population (since we have assumed they have the same variance and, under the null hypothesis, they have the same mean) and an estimate of the population variance is obtained by combining all three random samples. A second estimate of the common population variance is then obtained by looking at the variation in the means of each sample. If the null hypothesis is not true, these means are likely to vary quite a lot, since they come from populations whose means are different. So if these two variance estimates differ significantly, the null hypothesis can be rejected. (For technical reasons, the actual comparison that is made is slightly different to one that I've indicated. But I think it's easier to understand the gist of what's happening by considering my outline of it.)    Embed Quote
