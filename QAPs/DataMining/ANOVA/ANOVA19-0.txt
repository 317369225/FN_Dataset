★Why is homogenous variance important in ANOVA?
The validity of the F test depends on the mean squared error being a good representation of the pooled error variances. If one or more of the cells has markedly different within variance, this will not be true. (Good rule of thumb is a ratio of 4:1.) You will sometimes hear that F is "robust" to violations of heteroscedasticity, but this can be quite wrong when the design is unbalanced, and it affects interactions more that main effects. If you have issues with heteroscedasticity, it's worth switching to a regression estimation of the equivalent ANOVA model and using either robust standard errors or bootstrap.    Embed Quote
