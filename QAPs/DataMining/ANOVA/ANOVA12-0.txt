★In what ways are ANOVA and Regression dependent on the Central Limit Theorem?Some specific examples would be appreciated.
The broad utility of ANOVA and regression are highly dependent on the central limit theorem. Standard ANOVA and regression rely on the assumptions of normality, independence, and equal variances, which apply to the errors.  To be clear, by standard I mean ordinary least squares (OLS).  Also note that ANOVA and regression are the same thing mathematically - usually ANOVA is considered a type of regression, though the inverse isn't incorrect either. Errors are rarely normal, but the estimates of the mean (almost) converge on normality with a large sample size.  Many real life distributions (highly dependent on your field!) are also not too far from normality; i.e. they're bell-shaped and symmetrical.  So even with moderate sample sizes, ANOVA and regression do quite well, because the sample mean will become approximately normal.    Embed Quote
