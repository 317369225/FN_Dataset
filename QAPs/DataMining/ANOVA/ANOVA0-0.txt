★What is ANOVA?
Analysis of variance. That's not a very useful description though.  There are many different levels that this question can be answered on. There's the practical description: It's a statistical test that's used when you have categorical predictor(s) of a continuous outcome variable in order to test for significance of difference of means. There's the historical description: It's the method, devised by Fisher, which allowed people to get least squares estimates of parameters (and their standard errors) with orthogonal and categorical predictor variables, without doing matrix algebra. There's the conceptual description:  If you have three groups of individuals, each of which have a response on a continuous variable, you'll have some variance on that continuous measure.  You can also calculate the variance within each of the groups, and the variance between each of the groups. Analysis of variance compares those variances - specifically, the more variance there is between the groups, relative to the variance within the groups, the larger the differences between the means of the groups, relative to the variance. There's a mathematical description too, but it's too late ... If you elaborate on what you're interested in, I (or someone else) can give a better answer.    Embed Quote
