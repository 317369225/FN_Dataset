★Can we use ANOVA if three sets of data meet the normality assumption?
Since you are looking for the impact of knowledge on practice, the dependent variable is "level of practice" and it is ordinal. Therefore, ANOVA is not appropriate, regardless of the size of the samples. First, given that this is an observational study, you can't really make causal statements. Second, since the dependent variable is ordinal, you probably want ordinal logistic regression - at least that is one good starting place.  You might also want to consider some sort of classification tree. Third, you should surely collect data on covariates that might affect breast feeding practice.  These should include at least demographic information and any medical or physical issues that might affect breast feeding.    Embed Quote
