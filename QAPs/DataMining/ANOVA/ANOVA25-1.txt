★How can I decide when to use ANOVA and when to use T-Test depending upon the data?
First of all, a t-test is basically just a special case of an ANOVA.  The only fundamental difference in application is a t-test can properly do a sided test. You can run this analysis in many different ways, including how you've described it. I would recommend a 2 x 2 factorial.  You can follow this up with linear contrast (t-tests; except it uses more information, specifically the MSE from the ANOVA).  In this manner, you can test any combinations you want to compare, including 1a+1b vs. 2a+2b (i.e. the main effect of the gloves).  Most importantly, you can check if there are interactions.  Even if you aren't interested in the interactions, they will affect your inferences if you don't account for them, assuming they are real. If you have data on other variables, like which specific person performed each observation, you'll probably want to include that.  That's also easier with an ANOVA.    Embed Quote
