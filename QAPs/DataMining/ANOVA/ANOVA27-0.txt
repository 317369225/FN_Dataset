★Can we use ANOVA if three sets of data meet the normality assumption?
Your question doesn't make  a lot of sense.  In the clarifying comments you suggest that you want to explore the level of breastfeeding knowledge across three groups defined by breastfeeding practice (complete, partial and none).   If the distribution of knowledge is normal within each group, then you can use ANOVA, provided that the other assumptions of ANOVA are met such as equality of variance across the groups and independence of the observations (that is one person does not influence another person).  The sample sizes within each group doesn't matter, although if you are doing it by hand the calculation is easier if they are equal.   I wouldn't recommend ANOVA here though, for two reasons.  First this implicity assumes that knowledge depends on practice, whereas it's more realistic to think that practice depends on knowledge.  That isn't a huge concern, you will still be able to test for differences across groups.   More importantly ANOVA ignores the fact that the groups are ordered.  You have three levels where one is the least, one is the middle and one is the highest category.  You might prefer to use a method that takes this into account.   Pearson correlation would take this into account, but it would force the relationship to be considered linear, which perhaps isn't what you want.   If you could draw a box plot of your knowledge variable across the groups we could discuss appropriate tests more confidently.    Embed Quote
