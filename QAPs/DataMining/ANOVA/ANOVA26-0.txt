★Is statistical epidemiology all about logistics, odds ratios, ANOVA and descriptive statistics? Aren't there any data mining/analysis applications?
Beware that Epidemiology is concerned with CAUSAL relationships, not with associations. The world is rich in associations and poor in meaning. Therefore black-box data mining is generally ill-advised unless you have a well formulated causal chain in place and evaluate the results from an epidemiological point of view. See the work of Judea Pearl on Causal Diagrams and for a general view on causality look at the work of Sander Greenland circa late 80s early 90s. You do not want to create an unjustified health scare... there are too many of those around already using simple contingency tables. Nevertheless I remember seeing some work on chaos epidemiology, it has been many years ago so I cannot point you to a source. You may also encounter problems with the data that will hinder the use of complex methods. Epidemiological data (mortality, morbidity) generally refer to rare events, where the possibility of misclassification and biases is great, and it will be very very noisy. Likewise potential predictors of health outcomes (e.g.: virus prevalence, population pressure, poverty, income, some pollutant) are very noisy often aggregated in nature. Even factor analysis may not go down well on such data, if you have a careful look at the diagnostics. Since Epidemiology is, traditionally, a medical science it is a little behind compared to its sisters in the realm of economics and neuroscience etc that were flooded by physicists and mathematicians who introduced more sophisticated techniques. So I guess your input will be much appreciated.    Embed Quote
