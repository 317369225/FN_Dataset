★Is ANOVA a type of factor analysis, or are they completely different things?Factor analysis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fac... ANOVA: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANOVA
Anova and Factor are different statistical functions. Anova is used to compare means of two or more variables. It gives us the variation in the data sets within each group and also between various groups. Factor Analysis on the other hand is a data reduction technique. When we have too many variables to study we might want to limit our analysis to just few factors depending on the correlation between variables and variation between the formed factors. In the Principle Component Analysis method for Factor Analysis,we will use the Anova in order to arrive at what factors are crucial for our data.    Embed Quote
