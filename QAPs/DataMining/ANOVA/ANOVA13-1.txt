★Why is ANOVA called ANOVA when it should be ANOME (analysis of means, because it compares means, not variances?)
Because, unfortunately, a lot of statistical procedures have really stupid names that are focused on the computational details rather than what they're actually about. The variance in question involves the fact that: Total Variance = Between Variance + Within Variance, where  Between involves sums of squares of mean differences and Within is about the residual variance after having accounted for group differences. However, to the novice this is really confusing and misleading. It has the effect of excessively focusing attention on quantities that aren't interpretable, namely sums of squares and F statistics, rather than differences of means. Unfortunately, if John Tukey couldn't get the field to clean up its act about terminology, I'm sure as hell am not going to make any progress.    Embed Quote
