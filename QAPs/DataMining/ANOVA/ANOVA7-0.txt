★What's the basic difference between ANOVA, regression testing, and t-test?I read today that all three were developed independently about the same time period, and perform the same basic function but in different ways.
Roughly speaking: the t-test (comparing two groups) is a special case of ANOVA (comparing several groups) which is a special case of multiple regression (testing the impact of some "predictor" variables on a "response" variable). To get ANOVA from regression, you set up the predictor variables so that they encode which group each observation falls into. Any textbook on regression would explain all this in a lot of detail.    Embed Quote
