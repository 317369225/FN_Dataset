★What is the relationship between Pearson and ANOVA in data analysis?
Both tests are quite different and answer different questions. ANOVA (analysis of variance) is used to determine whether data from disjoint subsets of a data set are distinct - that is if the mean of each subset is far apart compared to the variance of each subset.  The assumption of ANOVA is that the data of each subset has a Gaussian distribution with the same variance and different means and that the samples are independent.  Note that the observations would have to continuous valued (not discrete) for this analysis to apply.  One example would be to look at the distribution of temperatures for each state in the US across a year. The Pearson's chi-squared test is applied to categorical data to determine if a given distribution of the categories (e.g. sides of a dice) match an assumed distribution (e.g. is it a fair dice?) or to test if samples are independent with respect to some factor (e.g. if different colored dice are used does the color effect the outcome?).  The Pearson test also assumes that the samples are independent.    Embed Quote
