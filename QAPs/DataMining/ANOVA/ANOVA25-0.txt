★How can I decide when to use ANOVA and when to use T-Test depending upon the data?
Statistical tests should correspond to scientific hypotheses.  So if, as you say, the comparison between 1a and 1b is meaningless then you shouldn't use an ANOVA. Two t-tests will be more powerful than an ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests, because you are giving information about where specifically you are looking for differences. Another point to consider: If its the same set of people in all four conditions then there is a degree of matching/pairing in your dataset.  Eg a paired t-test will allow you to remove the variance across people from your study and so improve its power.  You can do a similar thing across four groups with a multilevel model but I think I agree that you don't need one if the design and hypotheses are as simple as this. Final question:  would you expect the effect of glove to be simialar in the heavy vs light case?  Are you interested in whether this is the case?    Embed Quote
