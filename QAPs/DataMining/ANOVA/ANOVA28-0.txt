★Does ANOVA with interaction effects do the same thing as hierarchical modeling? If not, what is the difference?
Yes. ANOVA is the same model as regresson. Here it is in matrix form: Y = XB + e where Y is a nx1 vector of responses, X is an nxp matrix of independent variables, B is a px1 vector of parameters to be estimated and e is error. ANOVA, as a term, is used when all the independent variables are categorical. But regression can also be used in that case. In essence, ANOVA is a subset of regression.    Embed Quote
