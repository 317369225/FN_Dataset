Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
“I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” --Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943.   “That virus [HIV] is a pussycat.” --Dr. Peter Duesberg, molecular-biology professor at U.C. Berkeley, 1988, "There will never be a bigger plane built." --A Boeing engineer, after the first flight of the 247, a twin engine plane that holds ten people. "If excessive smoking actually plays a role in the production of lung cancer, it seems to be a minor one." --W.C. Heuper, National Cancer Institute, 1954 "There is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will." -- Albert Einstein, 1932. "The bomb will never go off. I speak as an expert in explosives." -- Admiral William Leahy, U.S. Atomic Bomb Project. These were expert opinion at one point. Does it make any sense now? No. Expert opinion is highly overrated. Facts presented by "experts" is another thing. They know, as they have harnessed this knowledge over a period of time. But, It is randomness which the experts play with. Hence, separating facts from opinions is our job. That's why Critical thinking is essential.  We need to be wise enough to set out a demarcation between such facts and opinions. Life is not always predictable. It is counter-intuitive too.    Embed Quote Updated 27 Mar. 9,665 views.
