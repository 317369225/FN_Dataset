What is a good way to categorize photos?
There are a number of photo-cataloging and editing suites that make organizing your photos easy (iPhoto, PhotoShop Elements, etc). Some now even auto-recognize faces and places. If you want to get creative utilizing metadata, you can use Flickr to map your photo-sets. But probably the simplest way to categorize is by date and keyword. In terms of file structure, MM-DD-YY followed by Event or Subject Name will likely serve you best for fastest recall. Finally, Windows 7 allows you to quickly add and edit tags on image files when viewing in Windows Explorer. For Mac OS, you can quickly add tags under "Get Info" > "Spotlight Comments."    Embed Quote
