Natural Language Processing: What is the best approach for text categorization?
It depends a lot of what sort of category you're looking for. These methods with bag-of-word features work great for topical categories (if there are not too many of them, although works like http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.1284 help mitigate this problem), since they're usually very well predicted by word usage. For authoral identification, polarity detection, opinion analysis, etc, people are still inventing more complex models that work better. If you want an easy document classifier, an averaged perceptron or lightly regularized logistic regression will work very well.    Embed Quote
