Why are preferred stocks categorized as equity instead of debt?
In terms of corporate finance they are different instruments. Preferred stock in a company has certain benefits over common shares (liquidity preference normally) but it is still equity. It entitles the holder to a percentage share of the company's profits. It may sometimes have fixed dividends which could make it feel like a debt obligation, but it still is a different instrument and doesn't have capped upside. Debt is different in that it has a fixed, capped payout (the amount the company owes you and the agreed upon interest). Debt generally has preference over any type of equity, including preferred shares, in the event of the liquidation of the company. I believe the terms are more similar in real estate investing but I don't know as much about that area.
