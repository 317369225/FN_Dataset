Does categorization form the basis of knowledge?
Categorization in itself acts as a synopsis of information and allows for unwieldy chunks to be be broken down in an easier way for the human mind to understand. Say i have a website and the main purpose of the website is to present the user with a great deal of information and allow it to be easily accessible. What makes categorization successful is to what level of detail is used to categorize the information and in what context the categorizations are used. For instance if you had a website that focused solely on presenting the user with some legal information.Categorizing by revision date might be very useful to someone in the legal profession, however for the lay person having it categorized by topic might be more useful. Categorization forms the basis for a person to discard things that are irrelevant and allows them to focus on the things that may be relevant thus reducing the noise that may distract the individual from getting the knowledge that he/she desires.    Embed Quote
