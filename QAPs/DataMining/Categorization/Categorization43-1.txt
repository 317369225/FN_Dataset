Are products like Maggie and Kurkure, which contain egg, be categorized under pure vegetarian?
Neither does kurkure have any eggs in it nor does Maggi have. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India will not allow any product to be labelled with the green dot vegetarian if the source of even any 1 of the ingredients is non veg in nature. ​ The licence can be cancelled in case of any breaking of the rules. I also read in the comments about E635. ​ Yes there is flavor enhancer 635 in Maggi which belongs to a group called inosinates which are made from meat and partly fish. So it should be labelled with the red dot for non veg right? But the reason why that is not the case is because these inosinates are extracted from Genetically modified microbes so they still remain in the category of vegetarian. So the question rises why all this is spread about the products. All these false information have been circulated by the rival companies of these products. In this case rivals of Nestlé and PepsiCo. So it's just falsehood don't worry about it, FSSAI is there as the Watchdog :)    Embed Quote
