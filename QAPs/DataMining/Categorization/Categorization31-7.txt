Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
The answers here??! Wow. But then everyone gets so outraged over being called "a racist." Don't you people understand you are racists if you value whiteness and devalue blackness? That's part of being a racist; this is the type of mindset we are referring to when we describe you as racist. It's deeply-rooted, a part of who you are and how you view the world.    Embed Quote Updated 7 Jul, 2014. 183 views.
