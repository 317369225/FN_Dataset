Why do humans, alone of all the animal species, categorize things as being "cute"?
The Discovery Channel had a documentary about a Gorilla that was raised by a scientist who wanted to study the language skills of the Gorrila by teaching it sign language. The young ape become very capable of conveying it's wishes via sign language. There came a time when by chance the young female gorilla came into contact with a kitten and the film shows it was very fond of the cat and understood it had to be gentle with the cat to avoid hurting it. If they took the Kitten away the Gorilla was at first sad then became stubborn refusing to cooperate until the Kitten was returned. After several months of the Kittens living with the Gorilla it got free one day and was run over by a car. The Scientist decides to show the Gorilla the dead Kitten so it would know what happened. The Gorilla was deeply moved by the death and morned the Kitten for months. The Scintist worked at trying to find out through sign language why the Gorilla felt the way it did. After about a month of teaching new signs and conversing with the young Gorilla the scientist determined that the Gorilla recognized that the kitten was an infant and she thought of herself as a replacement mother. When asked if she wanted another Kitten the Gorilla said yes with one condition that she got to pick the new Kitten. She referred to the one she picked as the cutest, prettiest one of the three presented to her to chose from.    Embed Quote Updated 12 Jun, 2011. 140 views.
