Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
I'm quite certain its all about context. I'm european/asian male born and bred in a predominantly white / western country. I have always been attracted to fair skinned, white women and my first girlfriend, and subsequent partners after were exactly that.  Ive never found asians, african, aboriginal, latino attractive at all. Then I spent a couple of weeks in China, completely away from any inkling of western civilisation, even language. It all went out the window, I actually felt exactly the opposite. Soo many of these Chinese women were georgeous and the thought of the the fair skinned women I had always craved simply had no appeal at all. Now im back again, but im convinced that preference can easilly be conditioned. At least at a superficial level which is all this is anyway. Right?    Embed Quote
