Natural Language Processing: What is the best approach for text categorization?
I would stick with the classic bag of words approach, building the sparse matrix with the document terms (preferably stemmed or lemmatized, and also getting rid of the stop words), Calculated the tdf-idf. And based on that experiment with different clustering algorithms in order to see which groups better the data you are trying to categorize. After that extract one or more of the main keywords that represent each cluster. A great tool for doing this is called cluto http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome..., which already provides all those functionalities, including the possibility of choosing among several clustering methods, and adjusting their parameters.    Embed Quote
