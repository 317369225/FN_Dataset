Progressivism: Are American progressives categorically socialists?
No, I think that's crazy. Typical liberals/progressives are only slightly more socialist than typical conservatives. (At least consciously. At heart, both are much more socialistic than they think they are. That is to say, both groups favor quite a few socialist policies, as long as they don't use the word.) The only group that is really not socialist is the Libertarians. But certain parts of Libertarian ideology is starting to become more popular with right-wingers, so this may change soon (more's the pity).    Embed Quote
