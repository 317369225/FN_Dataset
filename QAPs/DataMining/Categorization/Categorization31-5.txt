Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
Well, Im black woman and I have only dated black men and one hispanic but thats it but I seriously doubt I would date a white guy or asian, they do nothing for me on a personal standpoint but I am open for anything. I like to be surprised.    Embed Quote
