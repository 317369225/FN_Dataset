Do you categorize people into different personality types?
I like to think of people as cookies. There's oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip and peanut butter. Oatmeal raisin cookies are the ones I can just keep eating until I get sick. Sometimes, I'll still keep eating them even after I vomit everywhere, because they're just so darn addictive. These are the people I'd consider to be happy, friendly, easy to talk to, fun, and positive influences. Chocolate chip are the people in my life, or outside of my life, who are normal. They're cool to eat on occasion, however I won't eat them all the time. Then there's peanut butter. The cookie I avoid. The flavor isn't too exciting, and sometimes I feel bad being around them. They usually are a little toxic and draining. Maybe mean or immature. Sometimes though, I just can't resist. A peanut butter cookie will be what I want to eat that day. Sure, it definitely isn't any every day occasion. But once in a blue moon I need my peanut butter cookie. That dirty, disgusting, peanut butter cookie... It brings an evenness to my palate. Well, these are the cookies, I mean, people of my life. I love cookies! Nomnomnomnomnom. What kinda cookie are you!?    Embed Quote
