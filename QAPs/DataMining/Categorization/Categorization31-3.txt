Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
White, 25, Caucasian woman here, I would date Caucasian, "Chinese" Asian (Asian is too broad), middle eastern if not too dark, Latin if not presenting the typical latin features I see in Equadorians residing here (short, thick, with vulgar features) and that is it. I wouldn't date Africans, Afro Americans and anyone who is dark (means more than tanned colour) and reds. It's not racism - I work amazingly with anyone and I travelled the world, race is just like height or voice tone to me and it's a sexual/visual preference.    Embed Quote
