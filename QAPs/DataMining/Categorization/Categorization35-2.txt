Is the question, "Are Mormons Christians?", a normative one or merely one of categorization?
To me, Latter Day Saints are one of the few christian organizations that claim that they are the true religion. That would either tell me to listen to what they have to say, or avoid them like the plague. I'm not a fan of nondenominational church, so any church that claims to be the true church is worth listening to. Mormons, and a few other religious organizations have boldly made that claim. That, in itself, is enough for me to seriously check out the beliefs.    Embed Quote
