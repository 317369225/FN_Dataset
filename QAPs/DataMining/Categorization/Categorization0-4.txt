Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
Quora does this already to a certain extent, with so-called "Recognized Topic Biographies" (see: What topics have Recognized Topic Biographies, and what are the rules about topic-specific bios?); in order to get one, you have to meet certain specific criteria.  But that doesn't restrict anyone from answering a question; the people with recognized topic bios just get their bios highlighted. Anyway, the definition of "expert" is very slippery; there are people out there who would probably not consider me an "expert" at software development, despite having been doing it for over two decades at this point.  And one may be an "expert" at certain things, but have an avocation for other things in which they're not an expert. (Example: I'm a space buff, but I'll never be the Certified Space Badass that Robert Frost is.  That doesn't mean that I can't answer space questions, it's just that, often times, his answers will be better. But that's for the reader to judge.) I would keep in mind one of the sayings we posed on "Da Board!" back at Softool: "A good idea can come from anywhere...even at 2 in the morning from the bottom of a bottle." (The original of that added "Or from..." and then named a certain individual there who was known to be fairly clueless. :-) ) Hat tip: Ketan Kr Giri for the A2A.    Embed Quote
