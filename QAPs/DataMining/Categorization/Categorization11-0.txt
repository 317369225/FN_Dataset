Relative to the smallest and largest objects in the universe, is there a categorically middle-sized object in the universe?
Well, let's try it this way. The largest thing in the universe is the universe. The smallest meaningful length is the Planck length. There are 10^61 Planck lengths in the observable universe. So we'll split the difference and look for something 10^30 or 10^31 Planck lengths. That's about .01 to .1 millimeters. That's on the order of the width of a fog droplet to a human hair. It's a little bigger than a red blood cell, and a little smaller than an ant. So I'd say that if you were looking for a representative of a "medium sized object", I'd nominate the paramecium, about .03mm long: I do think it's notable that human beings are only about 5 orders of magnitude from this. We're not quite the middle of the universe, but there's an awful lot of the universe accessible from where we are.    Embed Quote
