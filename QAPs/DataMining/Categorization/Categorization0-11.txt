Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
No. Not even once. Quora stands for knowledge and experience sharing. Let's suppose a question pops up about a skin infection known as Molluscum Contagiosum. The OP asks a few virologists who are unavailable at the moment. I have had a similar skin condition so I start writing an answer to it despite being a "layman" in this field. Perhaps I can count it as experience sharing. I am no motivational guru. I have not been recognised on a national or international level for motivational talks but I think Quora gave me a platform to promote optimism. I am thankful to Quora for providing the opportunity for laymen like me to help people out. I think Quora is doing just fine. We have an option of downvoting content which seems absurd or fake. I don't think segregating the opinions would be a good idea because experience helps a layman become an expert. Thanks for the A2A.    Embed Quote
