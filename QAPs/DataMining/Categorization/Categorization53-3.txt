How would you categorize this romantic relationship?
If I were her, I'd be hoping you would call. Don't make any assumptions about the terms of your relationship just yet, because that's something you two should talk about in person. But regardless of whether or not she thinks of you as her "boyfriend," she clearly is exclusively interested in you to some degree. Good luck!    Embed Quote
