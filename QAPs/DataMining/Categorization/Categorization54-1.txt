Why do humans, alone of all the animal species, categorize things as being "cute"?
The premise of the question is difficult to accept without further evidence. Some dogs will kill cats outright and other dogs will befriend cats. Who is to say whether the reason is sentimental or rooted in survival? If it's sentimental, how do you define 'cute'? A human might find domesticated sheep to be cute, though the sole purpose of their domestication is the production of goods. Similarly, several varieties of ants have domesticated aphids and use them for milk. How do we define whether some of those ants develop a fondness for the aphids or consider them cute?    Embed Quote
