Are psychopaths categorically incapable of empathy?
Consider that many psychopaths have a grandiose sense of self worth and rarely consider the consequences of their actions. This would help explain why a psychopath would want to go on television and talk about their exploits and why they would be less likely to worry about the ramifications of admitting details of their crimes. Furthermore, psychopaths have been known to express real emotion when they lose manipulative control over a subject and/or know how to fake emotion in order to gain control. Either this possible psychopath is truly troubled by the loss of his perfectly controlled family or he is faking it to be on tv. I would suspect the latter.    Embed Quote
