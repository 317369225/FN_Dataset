What is the best way to track and categorize academic papers that I've read in the course of doing research?
Hey! So when I was doing my M.A. and working on my Thesis I used an application called Archify. Although it does not categorize academic papers it keeps track of every single document you looked at so you will never need to fear of losing the location of an excellent article again. I highly recommend using this. Before I discovered Archify i lost the location of a ton of potentially great resources.    Embed Quote
