Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
Actually, what I find most annoying in Quora is the high proportion of questions that contain a wrong or doubtful assumption. They are often of the type: Why is Obama the worst/best president ever? Why is country X so awful/awesome? Why are atheists/theists so stupid? Even in my own field of applied mathematics, where one can often determine whether propositions are true or false, or in science, there are too many questions of the form: "X is true, so why isn't Y true," in which the solution to the apparent contradiction is that in fact X is not true. In cross examination in a courtroom, a lawyer is not allowed to ask a leading question like "When did you stop beating your wife?" In my opinion, there should be a facility for flagging questions of this type. Also, many of the mathematics questions seem to be high school or college students wanting Quora to do their homework for them.    Embed Quote
