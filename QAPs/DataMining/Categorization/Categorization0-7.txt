Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
I generally agree with Robert Frost's great answer, however, there is one further area where I think answers by people who do not have specific expertise contributes to the question: when there is an example that illustrates the situation that has been overlooked by the answers already made. I am not a lawyer. I have no formal training or education in legal matters, or in government. That said, my answer here illustrates how a non-expert can still contribute useful information: Edward Conway's answer to Should lawyers who represent people accused of murder be banned from practicing law if their clients are found guilty? When there are examples that clearly address the issue, and have not been mentioned, in my view it is perfectly acceptable for non-experts to cite them.    Embed Quote
