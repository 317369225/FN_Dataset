Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
Albert Einstein was no layman but his theories were dismissed by the experts before he became the expert. Many inventions were either "discovered" accidentally (instead of invented purposely) by the experts or invented by the layman. Economists are experts yet their opinions vastly contradict each other and none has figured a way to operate this world effectively. If only the experts' opinions were counted, many great things would have never happened. Speaking as a layman.    Embed Quote
