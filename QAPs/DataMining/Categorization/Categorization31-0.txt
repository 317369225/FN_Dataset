Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
Context: I am a white woman in a relationship with a biracial man. I have dated and been interested in many types of men in the past: burly, skinny, light-haired, dark-hared, white, medium, and dark-skinned, blue eyes, brown eyes, long hair, short hair... none of it defines attractiveness or compatibility. I don't, and haven't, and won't ever categorically refuse to date any one physical type of person, be it because of skin color, hair color, height, weight, lack of limb, etc. It's silly to believe that you will ever find the right person if you choose to get hung up on the most insignificant of details. I always focus on the way someone makes me feel- does he make me laugh, does he inspire me, does he make me feel safe, cared for, respected, loved? Honesty, integrity, intelligence, humor, kindness-- these qualities supersede looks. I can't really understand how anyone could straight up not consider someone because of something as trivial as skin color. I understand having a slight preference, or being mostly around one sort of person, but if you happened to meet someone out of your norm, and they were interesting and interested, why cast them out? There is no logic to it, and I can't condone or take part in such behavior.    Embed Quote
