What is the best way to track and categorize academic papers that I've read in the course of doing research?
There are lots of options, but Mendeley is my favorite. I've only tried three: EndNote, Papers, and Mendeley. EndNote is probably the most established, but also the most expensive (~$300) if you don't have a site license. It's mainly intended to manage citations, and doesn't do as well with PDF libraries. Papers is exclusively for Mac OS, costs a moderate amount ($42), and organizes PDF libraries better than EndNote. Mendeley is relatively new and still has occasional (minor) bugs, but it offers 500MB of free web storage space that allows you to read, search, and annotate your entire PDF library from anywhere. Both Papers and Mendeley have some of the citation functionality of EndNote but are designed primarily to organize PDF libraries, which seems to be what you're looking for. Since Mendeley is free and has most of the useful features of its competitors along with a strong web component, you might want to start there.
