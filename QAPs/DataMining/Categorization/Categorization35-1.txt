Is the question, "Are Mormons Christians?", a normative one or merely one of categorization?
Opposed apologists often seem to be speaking different languages. Because they are. Before dealing with the question "Are Mormons Christians," consider two others: "Who gets to define Christianity?"  Christians tend to answer "We do."  (That would apply to other religions as well.) Next, "How is Christianity defined?"  Mike's post about church tradition highlights some of the problems with defining who and what is Christian.  The early church 'solved' the problem by agreeing that the Nicene Creed would serve as a consensus definition of the 'least common denominator' for reciprocal recognition of Christianity.  (See also the Apostle's Creed for some protestant denominations.)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nic... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apo... Any nominally Christian group that agreed with the entirety of the creed was, however grudgingly, accepted to be Christian.  By this measure many groups that considered themselves Christians - Gnostics, Manicheans, etc. - were rejected by the Roman church. For all their disagreements on doctrinal points, and ignoring the many spats and schisms over the centuries, Catholics, Coptics, Maronites, and later Eastern Orthodox, Lutherans, Baptists, Anabaptists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals,  others profess a certain core belief system summed up by the Creeds. So when Christians talk about whether Mormons are Christians, they are implicitly comparing Mormon beliefs to the Nicene or Apostle's Creed.  When Mormons talk about whether Mormons are Christians, it's my understanding that they are using a different standard.    Embed Quote
