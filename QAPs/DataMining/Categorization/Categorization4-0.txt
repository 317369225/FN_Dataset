What is the next categorization of pancakes?
I suppose if I were creating a website on pancakes, I'd provide the option of dual navigation; by 1) geography and 2) ingredients used. Geographic first level categories might look something like this (image stolen from Wikipedia): Browse by ingredient might look like A  B  C  D etc... Second level pages might look like... Pancakes: A Almond Butter Almond Flour Amish Sourdough Apple Apple Cinnamon Apple Sauce with links to product/recipe/information (detailed pages) Detailed pages would include links to other items in that geographic area. Example: Amish Sourdough (detailed page) would include link to other pancakes in North America.    Embed Quote
