How could you order and categorize the Jewish holidays?
Here's a few options for categories and rankings: By deliciousness of traditional food: Hannukah (latkes + donuts = grease heavan) Rosh Ha Shanah (apples and honey, teighlach, challah with raisins) Passover (demerits for lack of bread, but bonus points for matzah ball soup, brisket, and charoses) Yom Kippur (demerits for fasting, bonus points for gorging on bagels and lox at the end of it) Shabbat (challah + chicken?--maybe just my family) Purim (hamentashn) By ability to get drunk: Purim Simchas Torah By ability to dress in drag: Purim By likelihood of attending synagoge: Yom Kippur Rosh Hashanah Sukkot Shabbat Hannukah Simchas Torah By ability to feel guilty for not calling your mother: 1.
