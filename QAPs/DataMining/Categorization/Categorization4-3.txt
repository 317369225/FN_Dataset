What is the next categorization of pancakes?
Pancakes are, by their nature, cakes cooked in a pan - they have butter, flour, milk and eggs. Other ingredients are then added to the batter: flavourings - sweet, salty, spicy, umami. The ratios and pan heat are changed to give you different texture - crisp or cakelike - or crisp AND cakelike. There are many varities - asian included, made of different kinds of flour (rice flour, buckewheat), different kinds of milk (coconut milk) - and different kinds of sugar (palm sugar). Here are a few: Japanese Dorayaki Chinese: Man Chiang Kueh  (the crispy malaysian kind) Sri Lankan Egg Hoppers - or appams... And of course, my all time favourite, the sweet savoury thai pancakes This doesn't even include savoury paper dosa and others. A good website on pancakes would have a good bunch of recipes - and start from the basic ratios for each kind of pancake - read Michael Ruhlman for that.  French crepes and pancakes are done with a ratio - you have that, you can make any crepe/pancake on earth. After that, you go down the major geographic regions and ingredients.    Embed Quote
