Do you categorize people into different personality types?
Just smart versus average and abnormalities described in the DSM. There is some truth in stereotypes like Briggs-Myers, but I have not found them useful in real world application. In the '80s I had an app named Dr. Shrink that asked some questions about a person, than told what approach to use when talking to them. It was shockingly accurate. I see (via Google) the app is still available, now on smartphones. Try it. You'll be amazed.    Embed Quote
