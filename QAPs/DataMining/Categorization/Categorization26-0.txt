Do you categorize people into different personality types?
I categorize people into two different types: people who suck up my energy and people who don't. If you are negative, bossy, ignorant, rude, whiny, self-absorbed, or intentionally stupid you will probably fall into the first group.  If you are kind, compassionate, funny, open-minded, self-reflective, inquisitive, or an otherwise innocent, cheerful or at least content person, you will most likely be okay by me.    Embed Quote Updated 3 Oct, 2013. 1,052 views.
