Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
I couldn't agree with you more. I'm having a difficult time to look for a white woman to date in NC. From what I observed so far since arriving in '07, a majority of them are happily dating or married to white men. I'll admit it does hurt me a little not to see white women in interracial relationships. As for the question, I refused to sleep with black women PERIOD!    Embed Quote
