Progressivism: Are American progressives categorically socialists?
Socialists or more accurately Communists believe in equal distribution of the final value created by the society. Progressives believe in equal distribution of the opportunity given to an individual to create value across all social strata, but not re-distribution of the value created. Consider an examination. Socialists/Communists would want re-distribution of scores of all students. This means every student gets the class average. Progressives don't want that. However, they do want all students to be asked the same questions and given equal time in answering them. A richer student cannot "buy" extra time with money, nor can he ask for easier questions by paying a higher examination fee. (Disclaimer: By Communists, I am referring to classical Marxist Communists, not any political organizations or their ideologies today)    Embed Quote
