Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
None for me.  I don't choose based on race as there are beautiful people (physical, inside or both) across races. What I try to avoid are people who seem to be closed minded, whether because they haven't tried to get out of their territorial confines or mental confines.  Tend to prefer meeting and dating people who are international and well traveled as they are usually more likely to be open minded.    Embed Quote
