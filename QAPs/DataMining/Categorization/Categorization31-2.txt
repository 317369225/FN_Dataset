Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
White men and women are least likely to be refused because they are the default in media and arbitrators of soft power. (Even in countries where they are not the majority, like Japan.) Sexual attraction is pretty malleable; we don't spring up out of the womb one day and decide who we want to sleep with. tl;dr: racial hegemony lol It's laughable to read the comments here and see the common pattern running throughout--no one wants to date blacks or those who they deem "too dark." I haven't seen anyone rule out someone for being too pale yet. But oh wait, everyone just decided out of the blue that they preferred paler hues; it wasn't as though prejudiced thinking informed it at all. This is the domino effect:  everyone in the same neighborhood puts up green curtains, and then insists that they all just did it because they each liked the color so much. Keep on rolling, guys.    Embed Quote
