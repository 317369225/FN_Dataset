Are psychopaths categorically incapable of empathy?
Some neuroscientists have documented that the brain circuitry involved when viewing empathy-eliciting images or videos is somewhat less functional in psychopaths. It has not been proven that psychopaths are categorically and completely incapable of feeling empathy, however. It is easier to define them by their behavior, because whether they are capable of feeling empathy or not, the defining characteristic of a psychopath is that while they are perfectly capable of detecting emotions in others, they use this ability to exploit other people, rather than connect and/or relate to them. They are more likely to be sizing them up, mimicking the other person's emotions, and attempting to say all the right things to gain control and get what they want.    Embed Quote
