How would you categorize this romantic relationship?
You can't consider her your girlfriend without confirming a commitment from her, but as several people have stated, labeling your relationship isn't important and a commitment not to date others will naturally emerge as you draw closer. Since she's expressing mutual interest in you, just continue spending time with her, and I believe that you should contact her during her absences to demonstrate that you miss her and are looking forward to her return.    Since neither or you have been in a relationship and seem shy, take the lead slightly and let her know that you always enjoy your times together and want to spend time with her in person again as soon as possible.  It couldn't hurt to have something special planned for her return, and you could also see if she would like you to pick her up from the airport. I would slow down slightly in terms of expressing love to her since the two of you don't have much experience dating, but as you spend more time together you can begin sharing how you feel with her as the situation permits.  Enjoy the time and good luck with your relationship!    Embed Quote Updated 28 Jan. 21 views.
