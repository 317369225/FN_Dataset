How would you categorize this romantic relationship?
I think playing games and waiting and all that is unnecessary. You both obviously like each other and since men take longer to mature than women you should be on the same page and you both seem to have the same level of experience with the opposite sex so this looks like a lovely slow paced respectful relationship. When ever I dated, if I went it was someone more than one time I centered all my attention on them. I was picky so not a lot made it past one date, but if they did they had my full attention I don't know when I consider them my boyfriend but I was loyal to them I guess so  it's whatever you're comfortable with    Embed Quote
