How would you categorize this romantic relationship?
Do not try to label this yet, although i understand the pressure in some cultures to determine right away if this is leading to marriage (I suspect because if it is not, you are seen as wasting time finding a wife). You are living in a western culture now, I presume. Here courtship can take a long time and people date without pressure to marry right away. You can use this to your advantage and allow yourself time to enjoy it. I think the worst thing people who enjoy each other's company do is to avoid each other. Not every conversation has to be about the future or about the relationship. Music, cinema, dinner, mutual friendships are good in and of themselves. So call her. Keep it short. Keep it low pressure. Do not interpret her inability to see you tonight as more than it is. Perhaps she really does have another obligation. But don't give her the chance to worry about whether you like her. Clearly you do.    Embed Quote
