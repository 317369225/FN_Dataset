Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
Asian guy here. I wouldn't categorically refuse to date or sleep with women of any race - I am always open to being surprised. However I must say I find Black and Australian aboriginal women very unattractive physically, so it would take a lot for me to go for them.    Embed Quote
