Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
I don’t know. I just finished reading Think Like a Freak: The Authors of Freakonomics Offer to Retrain Your Brain. The authors make a number of excellent points. One is that the three hardest words for most people to utter are “I don’t know.” Another is that experts’ predictions are often about as accurate as monkeys throwing darts. It seems the average expert’s greatest talent is an ability to fool himself and a lack of concern about being proven wrong. Especially if he’s good at rationalizing why he wasn’t actually wrong when he really was. Granted, there’s a lot to be said for experience but even experience has it’s limitations. “I have learned the novice can often see things that the expert overlooks. All that is necessary is not to be afraid of making mistakes or of appearing naive.”  - Abraham Maslow Or, to put it another way, substitute “An expert” for “Science”... “Science is a bit like the joke about the drunk who is looking under a lamppost for a key that he has lost on the other side of the street, because that's where the light is. It has no other choice.” ― Noam Chomsky    Embed Quote
