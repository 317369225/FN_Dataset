Are products like Maggie and Kurkure, which contain egg, be categorized under pure vegetarian?
Since eggs are certainly not in the category of vegetarian food - anything using eggs is not purely vegetarian (I haven't personally checked Kurkure or Maggi's list of ingredients) - but may appeal to those that allow eggs, milk and other animal produce, other than meat as part of their "vegetarian diet".    Embed Quote
