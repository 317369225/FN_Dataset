How do the deal aggregators categorize their deals?
Given the volume of deals that come through (particularly in regions like the US) manual categorisation would be fairly challenging, time consuming and expensive. A term extractor or categoriser makes it possible to analyse the headline and description/highlights of a deal and apply categories or tags as required. A simple online example of this can be seen at http://maui-indexer.appspot.com/ Enter a body of text, select 'Keywords and keyphrases' and run. We're currently using a simple categoriser with a vocabulary tuned for our categories and are enjoying accurate results without the need for any human intervention.    Embed Quote
