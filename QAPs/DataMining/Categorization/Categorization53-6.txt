How would you categorize this romantic relationship?
I think you've rec'd great advice so far! There is definitely a lot of potential there IMO. I think it would be OK to call her, or text/email her if you prefer just to say you're thinking of her. There's nothing wrong with that. When she returns, ask her to spend time with you...a movie, dinner, a visit to a museum or a point of local interest. Doesn't really matter where...just somewhere you can spend time together and can talk more and deepen your acquaintanceship. If that goes well, it's permissible to give her a kiss when it's time to say goodbye. If you have reported things accurately, she will be receptive and will want the kiss. If she pulls back and seems uncomfortable with the advance, I think it's permissible to ask if she doesn't want it, and if not, why? Let her know in a sweet way that you really like her. Don't be overbearing and pushy. Just let her know that you've loved these past few weeks together and the time you've spent together. Tell her it will make you extremely happy to hear that she shares your feelings. If she indicates that she doesn't and likes you as no more than a friend--which I'd be shocked if she says that--you can ask her a few questions about that (such as does she think that might change in the future?), but if she seems firm that she feels no more for you than she does for a friend, accept it politely and bid her goodnight. Then keep your distance from her. If she doesn't reciprocate after all this, you need to get over her, fast. The best way to do that is to stop spending time with her and put your thoughts elsewhere. I'd be really surprised, though, if she says she's not interested. She's given you strong indication that she's enjoying it as much as you are. I wish you the best of luck!    Embed Quote
