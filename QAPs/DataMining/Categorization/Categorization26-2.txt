Do you categorize people into different personality types?
There are many ways in which I categorize people. I am not sure I can list them all there but I will try. based on their energy They are either positive or negative; I stay away from negative ones based on their optimism level Unlike the energy, optimism is the outlook on life and not necessarily the projection of the present or past based on their physical appearance (nothing to do with beauty) No, I am not shallow: based on the proportions of their bodies, it is possible to find out which traumas (emotional) the person has; naturally, I associate myself with the people who are similar to me because I know how to help them based on their smile-to-frown ratio When a person smiles genuinely and sincerely, their whole face smiles (even their eyes), a superficial smile only shows teeth: many people have superficial smiles based on their wit (a certain degree of sarcasm is a must) My policy is "3 strikes and you're out": occasional profanity can be present but if it's an ongoing trend, I would have to bow out based on their perception lens There are 9 types in total, and it defines how people perceive, process and respond; I try to test first to make the communication meaningful    Embed Quote
