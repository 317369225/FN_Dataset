Some more info: Pie is Better chat for work Pie makes a mini-chat room for everything you want to discuss with your team - from bookmarks, to files, questions on ideas or opinions, getting approval on images, to what’s for lunch - so every conversation stays on topic. Unlike traditional chat with broad noisy chatrooms that often veer off-topic, on Pie, every chat is centered around a single, specific item so you can focus on what's important. We're part of the next gen of tools that approach enterprise software like it's consumer software (read: polished and fun). Additional features and product shots: Get the right people talking Pie is very useful for teams, but should you need to get a partner or a client's opinion to drop in a chat - you can get them in really easily as well. #Tags: explore what your team is working on Other than a nice organised stream of your team’s #tags to discover great content and other related chats.
