Relative to the smallest and largest objects in the universe, is there a categorically middle-sized object in the universe?
In order to give a different answer to Joshua's, I'll interpret "object" as meaning something continuous. Therefore the universe itself or a galaxy wouldn't count since they have gaps. The largest continuous object is probably a supergiant star (or maybe a nebula, but I want something a little more tangible than that). Supergiant stars can be up to 10¹²m in radius. The smallest object would be a sub-atomic particle. Modern physics tends to view them as point particles with zero radius, so I'll ignore modern physics and use the "classical electron radius" of about 10^(-15) m. The middle of those (logarithmically, since that's the only way to get a useful answer - if you took the average of the numbers themselves rather than their exponents, you would still be in the realm of supergiant stars) is about 0.1m. There are lots of everyday objects with a size in that order of magnitude, so I will arbitrarily choose a hamster as the middle-sized object. It is interesting that my method and Joshua's get answers only a few orders different. That gives me some confidence that the middle size isn't too sensitive to how exactly you interpret the question, which is nice.    Embed Quote Updated 24 Nov. 2,171 views.
