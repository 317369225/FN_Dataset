Why do humans, alone of all the animal species, categorize things as being "cute"?
If animals don't have a concept of "cute", why do mother birds take care of freakishly outsized cuckoo babies which the cuckoos leave in their nests? I always thought of baby cuckoos as being bird anime: evolved specifically to be hypercute by their standards. This suggests an answer to the (more general) question: why do we respond to cuteness in non-human animals? If mother birds parasitized by cuckoos, who pay a real price and should easily be able to distinguish their children from the giant changelings they're given, can't evolve away their "cute" response, why should we? Basically, it's a side effect of our response to babies of our own species. There's no incentive for evolution to do extra work to make us unresponsive to nonhuman cuteness, especially given the perhaps-smaller-but-much-more-important possibility that we'd then be insufficiently attentive to our own babies. And remember: people, especially, have many ways to harden their hearts if they decide to. We already manage to do many horrible things to cute little rats, and only a few of us object. So to our genes, cooing over kittens (if we decide to let ourselves) might just be a way to show potential mates what good parents we'd make.    Embed Quote
