Are products like Maggie and Kurkure, which contain egg, be categorized under pure vegetarian?
And where did you hear this kind of crap? Don't tell me that religious saints told you. They are not scientists and they have no proof. I've been hearing this kind of stuff since my childhood that every foreign product is non-vegetarian. We leave in a country where there's a system, a shitty one but it does. We have our own food authority which takes care about food adulteration and yes keeping the vegetarian food different from non-vegetarian. The samples are taken frequently and tested in labs. Maggie do have no-veg products such as Chicken Maggie, but it doesn't give anyone grounds to suspect the regular one. Just think logically what they'll gain by putting egg/meat in a veg product? They'll loose customers, face trials and loose billions of dollars. Do you think they'd want that to happen?    Embed Quote
