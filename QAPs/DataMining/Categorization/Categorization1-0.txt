Are psychopaths categorically incapable of empathy?
I'm a psychopath, I'm not a killer or anything but I'm pretty sure that if I were put in a situation where I would have to killed somebody to save myself I wouldnt hesitate at all. I do feel empathy sometimes but I think it's just a way to try to make myself feel normal. I can fake empathy, as with the rest of emotions, specially when I'm around people, I've gotten so used to faking emotions that when I'm around people they come naturally, however I always feel that I'm under control, as if I could cut those emotions immediately if I wanted to. When I'm alone however I dont feel empathy. I'm empty, probably because my natural need to manipulate those around me doesnt trigger since there is nobody around. So I think that psychopaths do feel empathy if they want to, or at least they can fake it pretty well. About the guy crying in the video, he is just deceiving his own brain about into thinking he is sorry. I've done it many times when I have lost people close to me just to seem normal, specially when my father died, I had to fake my sadness, otherwise everybody would had noticed there was something wrong with me. My mother does know I'm a psychopath though.    Embed Quote
