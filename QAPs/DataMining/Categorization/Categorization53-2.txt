How would you categorize this romantic relationship?
Labels are just labels. You can call this relationship whatever you please. No stranger online can tell you what you're going through. None of us have anything to do with it. It's something you should talk about with this woman. But you seem happy, so have fun. Be safe. Communicate. All that jazz. ;-)    Embed Quote
