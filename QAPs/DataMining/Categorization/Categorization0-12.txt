Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
Quora is the closest thing to real democracy you can find on the internet. 1. Laymen and minorities can express their opinion and be respected for good answers without bias. 2. In controversial topics, no answer is absolute or constrained. 3. Answers get upvoted based on how good they are, not based on which expert writes it. 4. Top writers and experts are not a monarchy. They change every year. 5. School children (laymen like me) can dream of one day becoming president (top writer). Just as a democracy should be. Why would anyone want to replace this lucky amalgamation of free sharing volunteers with a totalitarian dictatorship where only experts can make decisions and the common masses sit in their homes reading whatever they are told to read?    Embed Quote
