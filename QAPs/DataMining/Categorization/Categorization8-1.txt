How could you order and categorize the Jewish holidays?
How about: Ordered by impact on other religions? In which categorisation, we have: Tier 1 Jewish Holidays: Shabbat. The use of one day in Seven spilled over to Christianity, became anglicised as 'Sabbath', and influenced the 'working week' for centuries. Passover. The Christian festival of Easter (which among practicing Christians is normally regarded as number 1, trumping even Christmas), is defined in relation to a series of events at are recorded as happening on / around the Passover festival. So the date of Passover determines the date on which Christians celebrate Easter. Tier 2 Jewish Holidays: Hannukah. To what extent is the timing of Christmas (the date chosen for the celebration of Jesus' birth, not as commonly believed, his actual birthday) influenced by Hannukah? The answer to that is lost, Saturnalia may have been a better antecedent... but the possibility means it ranks a bit higher than... Tier 3 Jewish Holidays: All the others, which seem to be only celebrated within the Jewish community, and haven't 'broken out' cross-religions.    Embed Quote
