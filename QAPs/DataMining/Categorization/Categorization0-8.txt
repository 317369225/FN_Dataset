Quora: Should the answers on Quora be categorized into experts' opinion and laymans' opinion?
I would have no problem if a little star or something popped up when an expert answered on a topic, or even if their anwer went to the top of the feed.  I think it would be useful. How someone would be vetted as an expert is another story.  Would we have to send in our CV to Quora?    Embed Quote
