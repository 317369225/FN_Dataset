How would you categorize this romantic relationship?
Not a relationship yet, but it definitely looks like it could turn into one soon -- if you can spend enough time together. This means in the same city and please continue to "keep it casual" while you're at work. And yeah, Ryan P. Long is right. You should probably kiss her. ;) Oh, I almost forgot. If she's gone for a whole week, you might want to text her "Thinking of you" or something else pleasant and brief (not a question of any kind, something that doesn't require a response) in a day or two, but not during office hours because you want to make it clear that this is a personal message, and you think of her when you're not at work. Congratulations and good luck! Thanks for asking me.    Embed Quote
