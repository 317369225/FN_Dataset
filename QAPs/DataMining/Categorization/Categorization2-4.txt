Does categorization form the basis of knowledge?
Categorization is a simplistic representation of the real basis of knowledge, which is directed linking. Directed linking is behind all of the most effective knowledge systems work this way - from the web (html links), to real life networks (I know someone who...), social networks (Twitter, Facebook). Categorization was invented first, because it was easy to build using unsophisticated/manual effort. However, the most effective systems move past categorization to leverage intelligence from directed links. Even for sites like Quora, which is using lots of topical categorization, the way most people discover new categories is because these categories themselves are linked friends or questions they see.    Embed Quote
