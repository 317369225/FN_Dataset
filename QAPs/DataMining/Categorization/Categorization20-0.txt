How are Japanese yokai (ghosts) categorized?
I'm not sure how I would categorize any fictional characters of any genre, Japanese or otherwise.  If the online links others have posted aren't enough for you, please consider reading Laufcadio Hearn's excellent introduction to all sorts of Japanese monsters.  Its title Kaidan (sometimes orthographically given as Kwaidan) is available as a free ebook download from Amazon.com.  The Japanese is rendered 怪談, and Hearn's J name is Koizumi Yakumo 小泉八雲.    Embed Quote
