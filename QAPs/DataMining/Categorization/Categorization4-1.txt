What is the next categorization of pancakes?
The Taxonomy might look like: PANCAKES Characteristic grain used in the batter Cuisines that include pancakes Names of pancake types, specifying the main observable characteristic uses or toppings or accompanying foods recipe This would allow you to categorize all sorts of pancakes, including Chinese bǐng, blini, chocolate chip, crepes, latkes, Indian dosa, Ethiopian injera, etc. I would include an index and cross-reference guide.  As Garrick said, the taxonomy might be insufficiently flexible for people to find what they want.  Your site needs to be flexible enough to approach the data in any of the many ways that people think about pancakes; Note the differences in the answers posted to your question.    Embed Quote
