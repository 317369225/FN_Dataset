What is the best way to track and categorize academic papers that I've read in the course of doing research?
If you're an open source fan, zotero is that way to go. I converted to zotero after being a long time EndNote user.  I actually feel like both products are clunky, but that zotero is improving itself more rapidly. Zotero's $0 pricetag seals the deal.    Embed Quote Updated 21 Feb, 2012. 510 views.
