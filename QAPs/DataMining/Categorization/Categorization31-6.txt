Which race of men or women you categorically refuse to date or have sex with?
My ethnic group (Arab, and religiously Muslim) we tend to date and marry only within our own.  A Muslim man may marry a Christian or Jewish woman, providing the children are raised Muslim, but a Muslim woman may not marry a Jewish or Christian man unless he converts to Islam.   As far as who are we attracted to,  if I were pressed and speaking only for myself, I would say lighter skin women attract me more than darker skin but it has to do with her facial features also more than just skin tone.    Embed Quote
