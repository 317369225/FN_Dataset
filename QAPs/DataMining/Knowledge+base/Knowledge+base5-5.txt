★What is the best help desk and support knowledge base plugin for wordpress?Looking for premium or free plugin to do a simple job on providing ticketing based support and if possible link to self-service support database any ideas and views from the coal face welcome thanks
I would suggest you to use theme instead of plugin as it gives you a better look n feel, and integrating a third-party plugin to add forum functionality to your site could be a bit messy.   Below mention theme is a full on tuned WordPress theme for setting up dedicated forum sites in a minimum of effort. ForumEngine - Forum WordPress Theme Well, if you stick to plugin only I will suggest you to use FormGet Contact form Solution  as this plugin is integrated with a help desk solution along with online form builder.
