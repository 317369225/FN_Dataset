★Is there a service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base?I recall reading about a new service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base. Unfortunately I can't remember the name or the details of this service or where I read about it.
I'’m biased to say FreshdeskFreshdesk (links to: /Freshdesk) [1]. You can build Kbase knowledge bases and Forumsforums. These Kbase knowledge bases can be Agents agents only or Users users & Agentsagents.There'’s also a cool feature called "“Suggest Solution" “ that automatically suggests soln articles to agent, based on the keywords in the ticket subject and description. You can give it a try. we We have a free 30 days trial. . [1] http://www.freshdesk.com/
