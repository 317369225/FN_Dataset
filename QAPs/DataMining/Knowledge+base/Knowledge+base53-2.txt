★Will "knowledge-based programming" languages like Wolfram Alpha be superior to more traditional languages like Java?Or will it make everyone can program and professional programmers lose their jobs?
The Wolfram language doesn't do anything that we couldn't already do before. However, it does seem to make certain tasks considerably easier and more concisely expressed. EDIT: The asker seems to have altered the question. In response to the new version, I'd argue that (1) there isn't enough data to make that call yet, (2) programming languages are far less important than people seem to think they are; understanding how to utilize existing libraries and FOSS is far more valuable, (3) Wolfram seems to have opted for a more proprietary model, which is highly unlikely to overtake an open source one, (4) Wolfram doesn't seem to be targeting generalized software development in the first place, (5) as long as things like http://healthcare.gov happen, there will always be a compelling need for actual software engineers who are able to understand and manage the challenges inherent to building complex applications and systems.    Embed Quote
