★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
I believe in today's scenario, I have discovered a new path which lands exactly at the middle of this two dogmas. Master all the trades beforehand, so that every learnt trade makes you a master and every upcoming trade test you as a jack. A2A :)    Embed Quote
