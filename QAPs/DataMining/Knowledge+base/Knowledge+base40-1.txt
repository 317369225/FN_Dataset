★Are there credible alternatives to Zendesk or Desk.com for a public/private knowledge base?Both products look and amazing and robust, but are overkill. I'm looking for just the knowledge-base searchable FAQ (where you can mark certain items as public and others just for a select group of users) and 'wiki' capabilities.
If you want a read-only knowledge base, go for a wiki implementation. See What wiki software do you recommend for internal use? If you're a small outfit, use google sites. They have appropriate access controls for public / private access of data. If you would like to scale up later with collaboration/ discussion capabilities, try tools like Yammer, Confluence or Socialtext. These tools implement knowledge retention via document, wikis and blogs and have access controls for each object.    Embed Quote
