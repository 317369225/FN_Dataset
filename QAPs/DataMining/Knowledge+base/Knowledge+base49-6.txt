★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
The purpose of trade is livelihood. Livlihood is intended to assist 'Living', not become 'The Life'..!! This is the crucial thing that one must keep in mind always! The life is to be spent in happiness, fulfilment, curiosity, equiry, exploration, and quest! Essentially by embracing the complete vibrancy and potential that 'Living' opens up for one self! It is this vibrancy of living that should motivate whether one becomes a master of one trade or jack of many. One must chose that which creates the most potential of complete living. It becomes a problem when its done the other way round. I.e. when one tries to fit life into a trade, rather than fit the trade into life.    Embed Quote
