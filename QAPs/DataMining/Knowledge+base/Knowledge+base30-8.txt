★What is the best tool to centralize and aggregate all of the information pieces; articles, pdfs, knowledge-resources, that would create your personal knowledge-base for fast/efficient access later?
Evernote for everything, and Papers (by mekentosj) for academic references. I have 15+ Noteboks in Evernote, one for every client or context (blog, academic, to share with my family). I also have half-a-dozen paper notebooks for ideas when I'm far from a keyboard.    Embed Quote
