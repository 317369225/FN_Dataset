★Was a knowledge-based economy a pre- or post-Industrial Revolution order?
Answer is from top of my head, as this phrase is new to me as well. Did you use the word "order" in the sense of chronology? From what I could gather, it's a way of classification  and is quite recently coined, So, it has to be "post industrial" , in that sense. But if you asked in sense of "logical" sense, it needs some thought. I guess any sort of economy has to be based on "knowledge"    Embed Quote
