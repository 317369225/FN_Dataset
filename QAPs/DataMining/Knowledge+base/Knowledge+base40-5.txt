★Are there credible alternatives to Zendesk or Desk.com for a public/private knowledge base?Both products look and amazing and robust, but are overkill. I'm looking for just the knowledge-base searchable FAQ (where you can mark certain items as public and others just for a select group of users) and 'wiki' capabilities.
Try http://www.proprofs.com/knowledg..., ProProfs Knowledge base! You can easily create a set of frequently asked questions complete with useful images, video tutorials and help articles for your customers. You can also create a private FAQ to help your colleague share and find information quickly.    Embed Quote
