★What is the best way to build a knowledge taxonomy to help people navigate a knowledge base?The problem with so many forums and knowledge systems is that conversations on one topic end up scattered into different topics so people who would benefit from talking to each end up in different rooms and much potential group knowledge gets lost.
Look up an activity called card sorting. There are some online tools that can allow you to do it remotely. Basically you get the people who will be using the knowledge base sort it into an order that makes sense to them and suits their context. Group topics into 'piles' and then give those piles a name. You will get a different structure between say users of a system and administrators/support for a system. This is why it is important to get the people who will be using the knowledge base to sort it.    Embed Quote
