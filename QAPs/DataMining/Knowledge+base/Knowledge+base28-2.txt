★Why don't Quora and Wikipedia collaborate to create a more comprehensive knowledge base?I know that Quora and Wikipedia have very different formats. But why don't they try to collaborate by at least cross-referencing related Wikipedia and Quora pages?
Nothing stops Quorans and Wikipedians from collaborating. There is no need for an institutional connection. If you think this is a good idea, start doing it. It will catch on.    Embed Quote
