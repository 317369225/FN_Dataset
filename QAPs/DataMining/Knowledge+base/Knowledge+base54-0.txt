★Does a whitepaper count as a knowledge based article?I'm relatively new to my role, and would love a little bit of help clarify this.
White paper is usually inbetween case study and support document which makes it more informative plus quotes experiences from case study situation. Plus it has more credibility as this speaks about the challenges and the advantages of the product or service you write the white paper about. In my experience I consider them to be more about disclosure and transparency from the combination other wise its a marketing pitch document camouflaged as whitepaper.    Embed Quote
