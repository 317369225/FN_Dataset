There are several great WordPress themes available that works as knowledge base and help desks but there are only few good plugins available. My personal favorite is Heroic Knowledge Base plugin that you can use with any free and premium WordPress theme out there and it will get job done with ease. It already looks nice by default with no styling at all but you can customize it easily to integrate it in your current theme. Here you can read more about this awesome plugin: http://colorlib.com/wp/heroic-kn... Another options is to create a separate WordPress installation for your website and use some WordPress themes that are created as knowledge bases, support pages or even support forums. Here are some of the examples: http://colorlib.com/wp/knowledge...    Embed Quote
