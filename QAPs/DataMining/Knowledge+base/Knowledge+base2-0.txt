★How did Wikipedia start their knowledge base?
Wales and the co-owners of Bomis (a marketing company) got current and ex-employees to contribute content. They also appealed to the members of the Nupedia mailing list to join and help out (Nupedia was the original project, but they decided to try a wiki-style "feeder" site because of difficulties in getting people to contribute content under Nupedia's strict submission standards.) The online community got on it pretty early, which created a lot of organic traffic (and volunteers). - As per: History of Wikipedia. If you want further detail, probably worth sending an A2A to Jimmy Wales himself.    Embed Quote
