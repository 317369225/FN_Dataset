★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
A2A, hence the response. For me Jack of all trades is being street smart.  And I feel in today's world, where survival of the fittest is the mantra,  being street smart is essential. Thanks!    Embed Quote
