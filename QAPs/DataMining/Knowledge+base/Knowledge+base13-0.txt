★What is the best knowledge base app for Google Apps?My company is looking for one unified place for all our faq documentation to live in one place. We are looking for a friendly Wiki - style site that integrates with Google Apps and has a powerful search. Any ideas?
Disclaimer: I'm the founder of http://www.Knowledge base software - Helpjuice -- We're the most powerful knowledge base software that companies use to scale support & share knowledge amongst each other, internally. Helpjuice might be adding support for Google Apps in the future, but we don't have it as of now, so it might not be a fit. Unfortunately, if you take a look at the current listings for 'knowledge base' at the Google Apps directory, you won't see too many results. The results you will see are most likely going to be older apps, that may be a bit outdated. However, like Cameron Crest pointed out, Google sites could be a great choice. The only problem being it's not MEANT to be a knowledge base (internal nor customer-facing), but it's a great way to kick-start it, if you're looking for something right now.    Embed Quote
