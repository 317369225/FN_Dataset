★What is the best tool to centralize and aggregate all of the information pieces; articles, pdfs, knowledge-resources, that would create your personal knowledge-base for fast/efficient access later?
I now use Evernote exclusively. I've got it installed on my iPad, iPhone and desktop.  The iPhone app is incredibly useful for capturing ideas on the move, but also has the ability to capture images as well. Evernote can read text within a captured image, so I'm forever taking snap shots of articles and saving them to a notebook. Recently I've been using the screenshot capture on my iPad to file articles I'm reading behind pay walls.    Embed Quote
