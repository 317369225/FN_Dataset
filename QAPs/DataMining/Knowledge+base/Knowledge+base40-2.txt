★Are there credible alternatives to Zendesk or Desk.com for a public/private knowledge base?Both products look and amazing and robust, but are overkill. I'm looking for just the knowledge-base searchable FAQ (where you can mark certain items as public and others just for a select group of users) and 'wiki' capabilities.
Try HappyFox, itcomes with built in knowledge base where external self-help articles may be indexed by search engines or kept private for selected customer use only. Meanwhile, internal knowledge bases are accessible only to support agents on a 24/7 basis.  For more information visit HappyFox - Review, Pricing, Features, Comparison, Demo & Trial    Embed Quote
