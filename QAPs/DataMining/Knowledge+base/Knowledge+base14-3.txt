★What is the best way to build a knowledge taxonomy to help people navigate a knowledge base?The problem with so many forums and knowledge systems is that conversations on one topic end up scattered into different topics so people who would benefit from talking to each end up in different rooms and much potential group knowledge gets lost.
The approach our application uses (disclaimer: I'm with Bloomfire.com, a knowledge-sharing application) combines user-generated keywords, admin-designated categories, search, and browse to automagically organize piles of knowledge.    Embed Quote
