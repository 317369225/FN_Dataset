★What is the best tool to centralize and aggregate all of the information pieces; articles, pdfs, knowledge-resources, that would create your personal knowledge-base for fast/efficient access later?
i would recommend you to try http://teamgum.com - for 5 reasons 1. it is built naturally to share stuff with a team unlike evernote, etc. which are primarily notes to self. 2.  it is everything on extension including notifications, discussions & the reading list - so eliminates any context switching. 3 integrates with google search & shows relevant results from teams curation. 4. has a mobile version for clutter free reading & offline access 5. Connects with external social media tools - to make it a single point access to post links on twitter/fb. Disclaimer - i am working to make this tool. having said this, we use it in our team & have seen the difference.    Embed Quote
