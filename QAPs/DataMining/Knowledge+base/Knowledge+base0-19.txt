★What are good examples of Knowledge Base software (for customer support)?
Full disclosure: I work for MindTouch. Why not check out MindTouch TCS? It's a completely cloud-based social knowledge base. Its powerful, collaborative functionality allows your customer support teams to easily share knowledge among team members and users which lowers customer support costs, helps juice SEO, creates engaged & loyal customers, increases lead gen, and offers personalization.   Another way that MindTouch TCS directly impacts a customer support reps' daily job is with our recent integration with Zendesk Help Desk software. With this integration, we're able to quickly and easily integrate the MindTouch social knowledge base into a Zendesk help desk support interface. Having product documentation available during support calls and chats provides a wider pool of knowledge to pull from, better arming support agents and accelerating ticket closure.     The widget also allows support agents to create new knowledge base articles – increasing the information made available to customers so that they can locate help on their own as well.
