★Was a knowledge-based economy a pre- or post-Industrial Revolution order?
Knowledge-Based-Economies are  those which are directly based on the production, distribution and use of knowledge and information. I think during renaissance era itself this had started slowly, but then the knowledge mostly limited to rational/scientific reasoning, philosophy,  Socio-cultural, history, wars, art literature etc. But that knowledge had little practical, immediate application to make a profit. But during & after Industrial revolution, this took an exponential growth. Especially after globalization. Here, unlike earlier (where only physical property) intellectual property is also considered as an asset. Which introduced this patent law. So investments on human knowledge development about a subject (Physics/Technology/Innovation) is considered human capital investment. Now human being are not just manual workers (like those who used to be in factories/plantations), rather termed "Knowledge Worker". Of course, one should have other resources in the economy, on which the knowledge can be best utilized. Early Industrial revolution period, where it all started at Europe, those nations were running short of resources in their own territory which eventually led to them colonizing the world. Now, there is a lot of competition for resources than its availability,  knowledge is taking a different meaning & demand for knowledge on efficient way of utilizing limited resources or alternate way of doing stuffs.    Embed Quote
