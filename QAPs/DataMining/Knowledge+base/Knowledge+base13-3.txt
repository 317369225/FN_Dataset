★What is the best knowledge base app for Google Apps?My company is looking for one unified place for all our faq documentation to live in one place. We are looking for a friendly Wiki - style site that integrates with Google Apps and has a powerful search. Any ideas?
As a Google Enterprise Partner, we've been told to go to our GPC portal, but for everyone else, the best sources are for everything google: Google Help and for google apps, Google Apps Help - Cheers!    Embed Quote
