★What is the best way to build a knowledge taxonomy to help people navigate a knowledge base?The problem with so many forums and knowledge systems is that conversations on one topic end up scattered into different topics so people who would benefit from talking to each end up in different rooms and much potential group knowledge gets lost.
You're not talking about a knowledge taxonomy in this question, you're talking about a thesaurus or a cross-walk that is specific to your industry that works across disciplines. Do not build a knowledge taxonomy from scratch. Use an existing taxonomy that suits your industry. If working across multiple disciplines or departments, hire a few taxonomists to create a set of crosswalks for you. Just don't re-invent the wheel. Librarians and information architects have been working on these problems for years. Purchase or use an existing standard as your base taxonomy. It will save you a massive amount of time and aggravation. It will also likely make compliance issues easier because your  base terms will match the industry standards The experience of putting a good crosswalk/thesaurus in place is quite rigorous, so do engage a good consultant to set up the process. It will be a mixture of grassroots and top-down knowledge gathering to get the terms and their definitions exactly right. You also need to budget for updating and regular maintainence for your taxonomy to keep it up to date. If you have a very large user base you may find that a folksonomy (like del.icio.us tags) can be very helpful for creating a flexible, shared vocabulary. If you have more details of the industry and scale of the project I can reach out to my mentor and a few other people I know to recommend a good consultant.    Embed Quote
