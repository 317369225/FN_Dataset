★Is there a service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base?I recall reading about a new service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base. Unfortunately I can't remember the name or the details of this service or where I read about it.
There is no way to automatically build an FAQ or KB. There are just more efficient ways of doing it. At some point somebody has to create the content. You can grab this content from emails and support tickets but someone still had to write it originally. So there may be systems that help you get your knowledge into a KB more quickly, and with less friction, but they can't create it for you. A lot of help desk systems use the approach of making it simple to convert a ticket to a KB article. The idea is that the support agent took the time to answer the question comprehensively so they should add it t the KB and be able to reuse it for future customers. We take a very different approach with ScreenSteps Live (http://bluemangolearning.com/scr...). We don't turn ticket responses into KB articles, we turn KB articles into ticket responses. We have focused on making it so fast and simple to create a KB article with clear visual instructions that our customers regularly respond to support tickets by creating new documentation and then pointing the customer to that documentation. It works great. The KB grows with minimal effort with real answers to real questions. So, while other systems are trying to the optimize the flow of ticket responses to KB publishing we are optimizing the creation of KB content and the flow of that information into ticket responses.    Embed Quote
