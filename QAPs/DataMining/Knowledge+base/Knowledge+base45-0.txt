★Is there a GUI tool for using CouchDB as a technical knowledge base?CouchDB seems like it would be a good internal tool for somewhat structured data. For example: research on a variety of energy efficient lighting equipment. Is there a web GUI tool that would support this usage? From what I've seen of Futon it doesn't seem quite right.
Yes it is, it's called Kanapes IDE, you can read more about it here: http://kanapeside.com/about.aspx Kanapes IDE basically for CouchDB is the same thing like SQL Management Studio for SQL Server, it allows you to deal with your data, design documents, manage attachments, execute functions from your documents and so on. All that headaches that users have at Futon are simply gone now.    Embed Quote
