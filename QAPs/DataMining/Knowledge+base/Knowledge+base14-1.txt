★What is the best way to build a knowledge taxonomy to help people navigate a knowledge base?The problem with so many forums and knowledge systems is that conversations on one topic end up scattered into different topics so people who would benefit from talking to each end up in different rooms and much potential group knowledge gets lost.
From my experience in building a knowledge management system http://dapulse.com we found a very efficient clear way to do it. We've created a Quora like topic structure that is technically called "multi diminutional hierarchy" It's an hierarchy - but each node can have several parents. Every topicholds information relevant to that topic - in our case employees updates - those pieces of information are distributed up the tree as well. for example - This question in Quora has 3 parents "knowledge management", "library Science" & "Taxonomy". My answer will be populated up to those parents. Using our system essentially lets the whole company map it's conversation structure with topics - then later on it's easy to find and also distribute. Example: Marketing Department (1) -> Community & PR team (2) -> Twitter updates (3) Marketing Department -> Community & PR team -> Facebook updates (4) Marketing Department -> Media Buying team (5) -> Weekly Report (6) The "Marketing Department" will show all information from 6 topics (1-6) The "Community & PR team" will show all information from 3 topics (2,3,4) To visualise this structure we created a really cool video from data taken from Wix.com real usage of the system    Embed Quote
