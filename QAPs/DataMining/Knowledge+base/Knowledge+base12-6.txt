★Is there a service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base?I recall reading about a new service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base. Unfortunately I can't remember the name or the details of this service or where I read about it.
Is it really possible to have an already-made FAQ for your company? I agree with one of the guys below, that content has to be created at the end of the day and it is your experience with the product that matter. You may wish to try http://www.proprofs.com/knowledg... (ProProfs).    Embed Quote
