★Is there a service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base?I recall reading about a new service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base. Unfortunately I can't remember the name or the details of this service or where I read about it.
I don't think there are sites that build an FAQ or Knowledge Base Articles for you. There are software out their like Cayzu Help Desk that let you add FAQs, News, and Topics that then can be viewed on your end-user portal (self help tool for your customers). So this might be something you could check out if you are looking for a self help site for your customers.    Embed Quote
