â˜…Is there a service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base?I recall reading about a new service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base. Unfortunately I can't remember the name or the details of this service or where I read about it.
A couple options I know of: HelpJuice http://helpjuice.com/ HelpJuice (links to: /HelpJuice) (made by the always impressive Emil Hajric) FaqMe http://faqme.com/FaqMe (links to: /FaqMe) [1] http://helpjuice.com/ [2] http://faqme.com/
