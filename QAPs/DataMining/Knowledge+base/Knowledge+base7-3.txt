★What are the more knowledge based business books instead of inspirational?
The ones that I read most recently: 1. The Little Black Book of Innovation by Scott D. Anthony - an awesome little book about innovation. It presents the possibility of having a systematic, controlled and repeatable process of innovation. If you actually take your time to research some of the topics / names mentioned in the book you'll get even more "juice" out of it. 2. This is Service Design Thinking by Stickdorn & Schneider - I enjoyed reading this one immensely. It is one of those books (like Business Model Generation) that never leaves my desk and I refer to it quite often.    Embed Quote
