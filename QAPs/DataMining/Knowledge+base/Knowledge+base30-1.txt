★What is the best tool to centralize and aggregate all of the information pieces; articles, pdfs, knowledge-resources, that would create your personal knowledge-base for fast/efficient access later?
I've used many web tools over the years for aggregating information, collating it and later retrieving it. For seven years, my blog has formed the central hub: http://www.jarche.com/2009/08/bl... If something is important, I write a blog post on it, so that it's in my "outboard brain" where I've already tried to make some sense of it through writing. Making this process transparent is quite beneficial as I learn from and with others. Locking up this information, in some private repository, makes no sense to me. Lately, I've started using Evernote and it will likely become part of my networked learning processes. I like being able to take a picture of text with my mobile device and then search for the words once Evernote has processed it, with its OCR-like function.    Embed Quote
