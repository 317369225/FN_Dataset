★Why don't Quora and Wikipedia collaborate to create a more comprehensive knowledge base?I know that Quora and Wikipedia have very different formats. But why don't they try to collaborate by at least cross-referencing related Wikipedia and Quora pages?
It's not just the format ... Quora is a primary source.   Content originates here.   Wikipedia is a tertiary source, it always summarizes and references content elsewhere. Quora is purely 'inclusionary' : any question can be asked.   Wikipedia teeters between 'exclusionary' and 'inclusionary'.   That is, content has to be deemed 'notable' or else it's removed. Wikipedia strives for a single definitive article on any topic, and to resolve disputes within a single body of text.   Quora allows - encourages even - competing opposing answers. Quora leaves content within the control of the author.   I can suggest an edit but not impose one.    Wikipedia allows anyone to edit any content. So these are more than format issues, these are differences in intent and function.    Embed Quote
