★Why don't Quora and Wikipedia collaborate to create a more comprehensive knowledge base?I know that Quora and Wikipedia have very different formats. But why don't they try to collaborate by at least cross-referencing related Wikipedia and Quora pages?
Because Wikipedia is a factual knowledge base with almost 100% neutral content about comparatively generalized topics and issues. While Quora is basically an opinion based platform with more personalized topics and independence of opinion sharing. They are just two completely different places whose combination might create only mess. . And in addition i want to point the pointlessness of your question, it's like asking a DC+Marvel Movie..!    Embed Quote
