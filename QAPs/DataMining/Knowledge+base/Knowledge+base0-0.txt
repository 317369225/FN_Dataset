★What are good examples of Knowledge Base software (for customer support)?
Are you looking to grow a knowledge base with you customer service software? Maybe what you're looking for is something like Helprace Customer Service & Help Desk Software with a Knowledge Base - Basically you get a centralized location within your help desk to publish all kinds of company literature, updates etc. You also get multiple product support (pretty useful if you ask me!)    Embed Quote
