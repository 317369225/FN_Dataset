★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
Well depends on what you want to become, for a managerial post or to become an entrepreneur, its better to be a jack of all trades. But if you want to be great in only one discipline like a particular sport, then master of one is better, but it is very risky.    Embed Quote
