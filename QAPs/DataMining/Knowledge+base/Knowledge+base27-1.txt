★How do companies handle knowledge base transfers before doing a layoff?This is a follow-up question to What was the matter with Zynga in June 2010?.
I can't answer this for any specific company, but generally, a way to make sure knowledge is transfered is to not only document code, but to build up an internal knowledge sharing structure. Along with documentation, tutorials need to be written and pair programming needs to be done to educate every team member. It is important they understand the core problems and patterns, not the code. This is something that very few companies get right.    Embed Quote
