★What is the best tool to centralize and aggregate all of the information pieces; articles, pdfs, knowledge-resources, that would create your personal knowledge-base for fast/efficient access later?
I have recently been trying to solve this problem. I want a system for storing, summarizing, editing, commenting, highlighting, interlinking and sharing PDF files. These files are research papers mostly. Mendeley, Zotero, Evernote and Papers are all way too clunky to do what I want. If one could convert PDF files to wikitext I could do most of what I want to do with a wiki. Wikispaces is a pretty light wiki that is very usable and would be ideal for this. If only it was possible to convert PDF's to wikitext format and retain formatting and images. Does anyone know whether this will ever be possible? And also whether there is another way of achieving what I want? A knowledge management system like this would be incredibly useful.    Embed Quote
