★What is the best way to build a knowledge taxonomy to help people navigate a knowledge base?The problem with so many forums and knowledge systems is that conversations on one topic end up scattered into different topics so people who would benefit from talking to each end up in different rooms and much potential group knowledge gets lost.
That's a great question and a known problem with information tagging. Using different words or topics for what is considerable the same topic could defiantly kill the purpose of knowledge sharing systems both internally and externally. There are different services companies that are providing auto tagging to discussions and questions - by auto tagging the information the problem you mentioned is eliminated. For instance our company SolvePath - The enterprise Questions and Answers exchange platform | Senexx provide such a service of auto - tagging questions to Yammer communities. Another option - you can use knowledge systems that has pre-bulit taxonomies with learning algorithms that can add new terms and topics automatically. Our SolvePath product is one option with more than 500,000 topics, our taxonomy tree has 20 levels trying to map almost every known industry and vertical.    Embed Quote
