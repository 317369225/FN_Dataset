Hi there, adding a company I work for to the basket: LiveAgent (http://www.ladesk.com) -> we meet all your requirements(except mandarin, which can be done in few days) -> we know how important customer support is, that's why all our customers get 24/7 support -> with LiveAgent, you will be able to transform communications from Email, Voice, LiveChat, Facebook, Twitter and Contact forms into tickets. Even combined ! + I'm also attaching a screenshot to show you how the interface looks :) Please feel free to contact me or any other team-member at our website !    Embed Quote
