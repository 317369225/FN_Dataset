★What is the best web app or service for running a team wiki or knowledge base?
You might be interested in using Wrike, a cloud-based social collaboration app. I work for the company, and we use the tool everyday to record and share information in our "Knowledge Base" folder. (And there's no Wiki markup language to learn!) Here's how our knowledge base works: Each piece of knowledge or experience gets loaded into its own task and included in the Knowledge Base folder, and/or one of its subfolders. These tasks are set as backlogged (there's no due dates associated with them), so they're always available when we need to reference them. Anyone you grant permissions to can create a new task or edit an existing task description to add their thoughts and experiences to your Knowledge Base. We organize each item into subfolders for each department and team. Since tasks can live in multiple folders simultaneously, we don't have to try to remember where we placed a task and search every folder for the item we need, or miss out on a helpful piece of information that's buried in another team's folder tree — one task can be found in any folder that makes sense for its content. If you choose to keep information stored in external files, they can be attached directly to tasks from Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or your desktop. And your team can use Wrike's iOS and Android mobile apps to access the knowledge base anywhere and any time they need it. This system works great for us, and hopefully for your team as well!    Embed Quote
