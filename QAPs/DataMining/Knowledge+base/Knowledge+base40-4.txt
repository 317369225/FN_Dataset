★Are there credible alternatives to Zendesk or Desk.com for a public/private knowledge base?Both products look and amazing and robust, but are overkill. I'm looking for just the knowledge-base searchable FAQ (where you can mark certain items as public and others just for a select group of users) and 'wiki' capabilities.
Top alternatives of ZenDesk include - 1. FreshDesk 2. Groove 3. Desk dot com by SalesForce 4. ZOHO Support 5. SupportBee 6. HappyFox 7. HelpScout 8. Kayako. For more detailed reviews on all check - 8 ZenDesk Alternatives And Competitors at SAASMonk    Embed Quote
