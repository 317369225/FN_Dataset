★What are good examples of Knowledge Base software (for customer support)?
How about Casengo? We offer you a straightforward and user-friendly Live Chat application in the cloud, specifically designed for small companies (or startups) with limited manpower and resources. Casengo enables you to handle email, live chat and social media enquiries, all within a single application It doesn't require any knowledge of CRM (like Salesforce does), and integrates with WordPress, Magento, Drupal and Facebook. (The Twitter integration is coming soon.) A 'free' plan is included. Plus, it comes with a comprehensive knowledge base (also free). All you have to do is enter the frequently asked questions - and answers - and connect the knowledge base to your website! The nice thing is: our knowledge base is integrated in our support software. What this means is that you will be able to contact your own knowledge base within Casengo. This integration is also beneficial for chatters. Based on the question, our chat widget will show relevant articles to the chatter, which is very useful if you are currently answering the same questions over and over again.    Embed Quote
