★What is the best tool to centralize and aggregate all of the information pieces; articles, pdfs, knowledge-resources, that would create your personal knowledge-base for fast/efficient access later?
I'm building some knowledge management software that handles this scenario very well.  It's not limited to use as a personal knowledge-base though... in fact, the idea is to be part of a collaborative system for organizational use.  But you can certainly use it for yourself.  I've actually been describing it as "sort of a cross between Reddit, Delicious and Yahoo Pipes."  It has tagging, categories, free-text search, sharing via email and XMPP, etc. It's not finished enough for general use, and I don't know yet if the long-term plan includes hosting it as a service (ala reddit, delicious, etc.) or making it strictly a "download and install locally" thing; but right now I just run a copy on a server and use it for myself.  Part of the "eat your own dogfood" thing, ya know?    Embed Quote
