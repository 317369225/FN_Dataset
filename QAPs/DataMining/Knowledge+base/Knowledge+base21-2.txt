★Was a knowledge-based economy a pre- or post-Industrial Revolution order?
The normal usage says recent.  But the accumulation of knowledge in Europe had begun well before 1760, the normal start date.  Science had accumulated a body of fairly reliable knowledge, freely shared.   James Watt improved the steam engine based on an understanding of heat that Joseph Black.  That sort of thing mattered.   Economists seem ignorant of this.  Black was a close friend of Adam Smith, and both were friends of James Hutton.  Economists who write about the period mostly have not the least idea who Hutton and Black were, nor do they bother to find out.    Embed Quote
