★What is the best tool to centralize and aggregate all of the information pieces; articles, pdfs, knowledge-resources, that would create your personal knowledge-base for fast/efficient access later?
Check out what we're working on at Pie (http://piethis.com). You can use it to create 'boards' to organize all the great stuff you find: We have a Chrome extension (http://bit.ly/post2pie) so you can save everything in a click or two. You can copy-paste links to the interface directly, if you prefer that instead. If 'aggregating information' is what you're after, what sets Pie apart is that we make it easy to set up boards with other people. So let's say youre obsessed with Facebook growth (or Snapchat or WhatsApp or etc) then you can invite people to a shared board, where everyone posts their finds. Notice in the above pic that I'm collecting "Growth hacks" with 2 other people, so we can consolidate and discuss what we find.    Embed Quote
