★What are some open source languages that are "knowledge based" like Wolfram Alpha?Followup to: Chris Jagers' answer to Wolfram Language: What is the significance of the Wolfram Language?
OpenCyc is perhaps one of the world's largest open (I think) structured databases. So could be used as the basis of an open knowledge-based language. Unfortunately, databases have the opposite character from programming languages. Languages are about a little bit of data combined with clever rules to allow a vast range of things to be expressed. A small, clever, dedicated team can build a language that's competitive with anything on the market today, so cheaply that they can afford to give it away. Databases are expensive, need many man-hours of contributions, and don't really get any benefit from the cleverness of the contributors. It's hard to make one of those for free. The honourable exceptions are things like Wikipedia which by their nature aren't formalized enough to be used in a "knowledge based" language. Though I suppose it would be interesting to see what someone could do by trying to use the formal knowledge in Cyc to help analyze and extract further information from Wikipedia.    Embed Quote
