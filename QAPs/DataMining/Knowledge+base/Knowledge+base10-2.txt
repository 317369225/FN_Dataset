★What Helpdesk software has a knowledge base, ticket system, and supports multiple languages?Mandarin, Spanish, German, English, French, etc. This is a follow-up question to What ecommerce software/ platform would you recommend for a small startup?.
I'd add Jitbit HelpDesk Ticketing System to the list (disclaimer: I'm one of the founders). It does have a Knowledge-base, a ticket-system, and supports multiple languages. PS. We offer both a cloud-hosted version (starts at $24 a month) and an on-premise version, both have hundreds of happy customers.    Embed Quote
