★What is a good knowledge base system, both for customers and internal users?Not looking for 2-way customer support functionality-- just a knowledge base to store and update information. Needs to be easy to create and update knowledge base entries Good search functionality
(Disclaimer: I run a company that provides solutions related to this answer) There are a lot of choices here, and it's hard to suggest one in particular without knowing more about what problem you're trying to solve, and what your requirements are.  For some situations, something as simple as an install of MediaWiki may be all you need.  MW is a great piece of software, works well, and many people already know how to use it from editing Wikipedia.  You could do a lot worse than using it. OTOH, if you want automatic semantic concept and entity extraction from unstructured data, and a semantic knowledgebase built on the standard Semantic Web stack, you have a whole different set of possible products to pick from.   A great stack for building these more capable solutions is Apache Jena[1] and Apache Stanbol. If you want an "all in" solution for facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing, transfer and reuse, as well as integrating outside knowledge repositories, business events, Open Data, Internet of Things, and "Big Data" projects / Data Lakes, then the equation changes again.  Now you're looking at an Enterprise Knowledge Network that combines a semantic knowledgebase, information discovery, social networking, etc. to fully integrate knowledge across your entire enterprise, at every level. So yeah, the scope of possible solutions is very broad.  If you need more help, or are interested in a vendor partner to work with you, feel free to give me a shout.  My company specializes in helping firms solve problems related to knowledge management / knowledge transfer / collaboration, and related areas.    Embed Quote
