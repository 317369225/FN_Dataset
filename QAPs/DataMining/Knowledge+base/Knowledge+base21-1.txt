★Was a knowledge-based economy a pre- or post-Industrial Revolution order?
Very much post. We are talking about a "knowledge based economy" here, and not merely "knowledge in the economy".  Different things.  A knowledge based economy is one in which people are paid to produce, sell, and trade knowledge, and knowledge can be bought and sold like a commodity.  Bear in mind, some individuals did become quite wealthy and famous as knowledge workers, but without technology and mass production, their influence was very limited.  Also, information was not regarded as property.  Anything transmitted could be freely copied.  Troubadours never paid royalties.  The designs of cathedrals were plagiarized without a thought.  Copyright didn't come into being until the 18th century- as industrialization was firing up, and - no coincidence - where it was firing up.  England.  Protecting knowledge as property, and as the output of its creator,  just as real as a bushel of wheat or work of art,  is fundamental for having a knowledge economy. So that's the key. Until someone makes a copyright a legal instrument, it makes little sense to trade information.    Embed Quote
