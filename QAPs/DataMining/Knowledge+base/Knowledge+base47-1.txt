★What is the best 3rd party FAQ/ Knowledge Base platform out there?
Disclaimer: I'm the founder of UserDeck. We built Guides to be a better knowledge base, as users we were frustrated with existing solutions that required you to setup a separate support website and then style it to match your main website design for consistency of a brand. What we developed is an embedded knowledge base widget you just copy the javascript code and paste it on a page of your site. You can even embed a single article or category too instead of the entire knowledge base. We took it a step further and added the ability to choose layouts and customize the guide. Once you've done that you can style it with CSS and it also inherits your site's design due to the widget based architecture, the content lives on your site. You can also manage all of your content on your site in the widget as well or using our control panel. We have some popular CMS plugins and an OAuth based APIs as well. We're constantly looking for feedback to improve the product so if you have any you can contact me and talk about it anytime.    Embed Quote
