★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
I would say being the master of one is a better thing to do. Everyone remembers the best. Also, the number of people who know a particular skill is large, however the number of people who have mastered of that skill are very less. Being the master does not mean that you forget about other fields completely. Have the basic knowledge of other related fields too, it is also very helpful. But overall being the master of any trade is always favourable.    Embed Quote
