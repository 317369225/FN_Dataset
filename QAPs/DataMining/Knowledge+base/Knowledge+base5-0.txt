I recommend you LiveAgent - Live chat & Helpdeswk wordpress plugin. It provides ticketing based support. Tickets are created from every chat message, email, phone call or message from other communication channels. If you follow your customer through different channels (Chat, Email, FaceBook...) you nevertheless stay always in the same hybrid ticket.  Installation is fast and easy and no HTML skills are required.    Embed Quote
