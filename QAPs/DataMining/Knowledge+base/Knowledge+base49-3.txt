★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
"Today's world" is too big a domain to be searching the answer to posed question. While some professions expect you to know "something of everything", there are various fields which require very detailed knowledge in particular field. You cannot generalize any more than that. I believe being a jack of all trades always helps as long as you are not compromising on the specifics of your primary role professionally. Just that it's easier said than done. Oh and thanks for the A2A!    Embed Quote
