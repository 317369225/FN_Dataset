★Which is the best and most flexible knowledge base vendor/software?Are there any vendors who give access to source code or have comprehensive APIs for external development of functionality? The front-end presentation of content is important for me and I will need to build several custom templates. I will need to be able to hook the kb directly into an online erp solution. Any kb solutions that accomododate for these needs?
Discalimer: I'm the founder of Helpjuice. I'd really suggest you check us out, Helpjuice.com. We're by far the most hosted powerful knowledge base software. The top reasons our customers actually chose us is, because we're really flexible. We even have a team of juicers (actual helpjuice employees) which are dedicated to help you customize your knowledge base to make sure it fits your needs, and looks terrific. The last thing you want to do is build a knowledge base on your own. It's really painful and can take up a lot of time. I'd suggest you really check out something like Helpjuice, as most knowledge base solutions are pretty flexible with customization!    Embed Quote
