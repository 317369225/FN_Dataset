★Are there AI startups using Quora for a knowledge base?From what I understand, one of the important factors in a great AI product (or machine) is a good knowledge base. Quora seems to be a great place to ask very specific questions and receive answers that get better over time.  Does anyone know of companies, startups, or applications that use Quora as a knowledge base for machine learning and natural language processing?
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but my impression is that the kind of question on Quora are much too specific, and the kind of prose found here is much too complext, for what machine learning can currently cope with. A good knowledge based for AI is something like Freebase or Wikidata. Mining text on Wikipedia may also help, though mining links on Wikipedia is probably more useful. Basically, the problem is this: for Quora to be useful to you, you have to be intelligent and somewhat knowledgable already. I'm waiting for the day that IBM's Watson gets a Quora account and starts asking questions and learning from the replies. I guess Watson could already answer simple factual questions on Quora - already impressive, but not yet very intelligent.    Embed Quote
