★What is the difference between a database and knowledge base?
Building a knowledge base may a good use-case for deploying a database (i.e. a tool to implement it, generally using a database management system). A knowledge base is not necessarily built upon a database: it could just be a bunch of documents in a folder. Not even necessarily using a computer... For instance, I gradually built a large knowledge base about derivatives pricing, readily available for searching. It required thick, varnished oak and painted plaster. Now if you think you need a database system to build a database that would implement a knowledge base, then you must at least sketch some requirements. [I mean, getting a little further than manipulating  buzzwords...] One requirement, for instance could be that the system should be able to draw some conclusions based on elementary facts that are already known (e.g. an automated diagnosis system). In that case, like Greg said, you'll have some use of an A.I, that is, some kind of deductive logics alongside a thorough modelling of facts known to the system. Another requirement could be that the system should provide a search facility among all stored knowledge, possibility provided as unstructured data (e.g. documents). In that case, you may need a text-based search engine plugged to a document database. Etc... Bottom line: hanging around with buzzwords is no engineering. Engineers avoid hollow thinking.  They start with an analysis of what the problem is (requirements) THEN what is the technology to build a solution THEN how to make it cost-effective. This applies to all engineering. IT is no exception. There is no hiding behind cloudish-big-agile-data-inductive-nosql fad. F.    Embed Quote
