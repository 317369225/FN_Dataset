★What are the more knowledge based business books instead of inspirational?
I would recommend Peter Church's book Added Value-the life stories of Indian business leaders. Amazing insight on some truly inspirational people. You should read this book not only because it was fantastically insightful and interesting in relation to the individuals but also gives the reader an incredibly helpful view of the mindset of the business leaders. The book is an excellent primer for anyone seeking to do business. the life stories of Indian Business Leaders eBook: Peter Church: Kindle Store    Embed Quote
