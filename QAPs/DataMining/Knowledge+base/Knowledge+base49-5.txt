★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
It always depends on the individual. I personally, would love to attain expertise in diverse fields. I don't fancy the idea of following the same set of interests throughout my life. The argument that,people who are famous are specialized in a particular field is not always true. Polymaths are rare due to major variations in Intellect and Circumstances. Leonardo Da Vinci was an exceptional painter, a skilled engineer, a biologist and a visionary of his time. Steve Jobs, no matter what people say, was a true creative genius,with skills ranging from electronics, animation, business, marketing and design. Noam Chomsky is a philosopher and cognitive scientist. I loved this quote by  Steve Jobs taken from his biography by Walter Isaacson, "I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics. Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that’s what I wanted to do.” For further reading: POLYMATHS: 20 LIVING EXAMPLES                                       THE LAST DAYS OF THE POLYMATH    Embed Quote
