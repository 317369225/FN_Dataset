★Why don't Quora and Wikipedia collaborate to create a more comprehensive knowledge base?I know that Quora and Wikipedia have very different formats. But why don't they try to collaborate by at least cross-referencing related Wikipedia and Quora pages?
Though both Wikipedia and Quora have the motto of providing free knowledge.... they do so by very different means and ways... Wikipedia is like a machine... it just tells about a thing as it is... While Quora is more about what you feel.. it encourages you present your views and thoughts... For e.g. if I type, say gun, on Wikipedia, it will simply tell what it is, it's types, makes, gun laws it different countries etc... the way of presentation will be neutral...Wikipedia won't say whether keeping a gun is good or bad.. While on Quora if you search the same thing... you will get various responses from people writing about their favorite guns, to telling some interesting encounters with a gun to some opposing it... In both cases you a learnt about a thing but in 2 very different ways... So, a Quora-Wikipedia union is unlikely.    Embed Quote
