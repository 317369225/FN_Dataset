★What is a good knowledge base system, both for customers and internal users?Not looking for 2-way customer support functionality-- just a knowledge base to store and update information. Needs to be easy to create and update knowledge base entries Good search functionality
I think the requirements are pretty broad, and therefore I'm sure both Helpjuice and the others (incl. Helprace and KBPublisher) might fit the need. Helpjuice: Knowledge base software, however, is JUST knowledge base software. That's it. Internal and/or External knowledge bases. That's it – unlike Helprace (which falls under the same category as Zendesk), we're super focused on KBs. For example, with Helpjuice, we obviously own the three basic requirements you mentioned, but also: Have a really simple product (funny I'm leading with this, but a lot of "all-in-one" support platforms are just too feature rich) Our KB can be very customized (a lot of our Enterprise clients, such as Walmart & The US GOV., initially wanted an open-source KB because it's very customizable – however, with Helpjuice, we use a templating language which allows us to achieve the same effect, and have your KB super customized, from a UI & functionality perspective) Have amazing support – This means, when you pick up the phone (or email) support, you'll be talking to someone that not only knows who YOU are, but understands how your company is using Knowledge Bases, and can be more helpful than just providing you with the answer to your question (even I, the CEO, work in support) And a ton of other cool, small details, that have really allowed us to win our base of companies that use us for knowledge bases (over 1500 companies, with a lot of startups) If Helpjuice does sound like something you'd be interested in taking a deeper look, I think it's always best to try it yourself (Helpjuice: Knowledge base software) or have a personalized demo.    Embed Quote
