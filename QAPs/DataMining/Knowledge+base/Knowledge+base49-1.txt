★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
Thanks for A2A. Good is never enough. There is always better than good waiting somewhere under the same sun you live in. You define what is your good and you find your own greatness. Having said that,  "jack of all trades and master of none / master of one and amateurish at other trades" are the lines that belongs to the people of 18th century. Dead people. Here is how i prefer to see it :   " Jack(good jack) of all trades and master of one" With the amount of knowledge that has piled up in the world since renaissance, with the kind of technology that has evolved over the last 100 years, with the likes of role models and leaders the world has seen till date and in this age of information revolution where all disciplines are interconnected, if you arent good at multiple things, let me tell you very clearly - your chances of distinguishing yourself from the bottom 80% of the world's population are .0005% If you aren't good at multiple things it must be because of these three reasons : 1. You are delusional and like to believe that you are getting better at one thing. Truth is, if you are reading this - there is a high probability that you are not. 2. You are ignorant and you dont learn by observing. 3. You dont give a shit a out getting better. Let alone the thought of becoming great. I am not saying that being great at one thing is bad - i am saying that its not enough if you want to be known in the 22nd century. The world has changed and this is the new world order my friend.    Embed Quote
