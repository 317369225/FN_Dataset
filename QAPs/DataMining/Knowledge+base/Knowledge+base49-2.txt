★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
Thanks for the A2A Vidit... I believe, in this contemporary world, being master of one is relatively more better than being the jack of all trades. This is so because a jack of all trades "can" have a broader horizon but at the same time it will be very difficult for them to go on in a particular field/direction and discover it in totality. On the other hand, a master of one will always look to excel in his/her own discipline. Now dealing with today's world: we will agree that nowadays everything/everyone desire to flow parallel to each other, unlike 2 or 3 decades before, and if one really wants to master a field then he/she should be a jack of some, if not all, trades too. However, opposite is not necessary to hold true. One looking to excel in every walk of life may end up with achieving more (when things are summed up) and little (when one particular field is considered)...Indubitably, exceptions are always there!! On the other hand, one looking to master a particular discipline will definitely need, at some point of time, to broaden his/her horizon because I believe one cannot be a master until and unless he/she will be doing good (may not be a master) in all spheres of life. So, one should be focused to what one desires to do and will definitely see the necessity of being a jack of all trades (which will further be accomplished through experiences). To me, this is how legends are made!!    Embed Quote
