★What are the more knowledge based business books instead of inspirational?
In terms of Business Strategy, check out the following books 1) Innovators Solution and Innovators Dilemma by Clayton Christensen, I love these books because they get one focusing on Product LifeCycles and looking on the horizon on which products/technologies could make the current standard obsolete 2) Competitive Strategy by Michael Porter Many core ideas for doing market analysis such as Porter's 5 forces and 3 generic company strategies come from this book 3) Redefining Global Strategy: Crossing Borders in a World Where Differences Still Matter by Pankaj Ghemawat. If one wants to expand their company into new countries, one has to read this book for various solutions, strategies, and methodologies.    Embed Quote
