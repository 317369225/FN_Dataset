★Is there a service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base?I recall reading about a new service that helps you automatically build an FAQ or Knowledge Base. Unfortunately I can't remember the name or the details of this service or where I read about it.
Have you checked out Helprace (http://helprace.com)? You can populate a FAQ knowledge base in your support portal. You can add up to 3 users and content managers for free and start building your own FAQ knowledge base in seconds. As a bonus, you can also add a fully capable ticketing system, a feedback widget and a community. Don't worry, though. If it's not your thing, you can  only establish a knowledge base by itself.    Embed Quote
