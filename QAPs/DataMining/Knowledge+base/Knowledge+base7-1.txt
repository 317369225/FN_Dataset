★What are the more knowledge based business books instead of inspirational?
A great book on operational processes is "The Goal" by Goldratt and Cox. What I like about the book is that the concepts are widely applicable, the authors structure the book so that you can get a good feel about operational process optimization without having to do any hardcore process mapping or mathematical analyses, and the book reads like a story. I have applied concepts in "The Goal" to diagnosing many things from bottlenecks in a sales process or decision making to call center workflows to manufacturing plant analysis. Additionally, I have a reading list here, which is more oriented to management consulting. Although it hasn't been updated in awhile, essentially all of the books are practical. The list is divided out by function, and "The Goal" is one of the books I highly recommend. Maybe the list will be of use to you. http://steveshuconsulting.com/wp...    Embed Quote
