★In today's world, which is better, to be the jack of all trades (interdisciplinary and broader knowledge base) or to be the master of one (expertise/the best at one)? Why?
I am good at Football ,Wimbledon ,Cricket ,Table Tennis ,Rubik's Cube and Carrom. But Lionel Messi is the Best Footballer. Sachin Tendulkar is the Best Cricketer. Felik Zemdegs is the Best Cuber. These people are known worldwide. But I ,who is good in all of these sports is not famous because people only respect and remember the people who are Best. So I think its better to specialise in a particular field rather than being amateur in many of them.    Embed Quote
