★Are there credible alternatives to Zendesk or Desk.com for a public/private knowledge base?Both products look and amazing and robust, but are overkill. I'm looking for just the knowledge-base searchable FAQ (where you can mark certain items as public and others just for a select group of users) and 'wiki' capabilities.
The Helprace knowledge base sounds something that's right up your alley. Why don't you play around in our demo here: Sample demo and see how you like it. What really sets us apart is that your users can engage with your software: they can ask a question, suggest an idea or give praise. Alternatively you can turn these buttons off.    Embed Quote
