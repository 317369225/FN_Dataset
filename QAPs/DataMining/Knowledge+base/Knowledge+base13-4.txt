★What is the best knowledge base app for Google Apps?My company is looking for one unified place for all our faq documentation to live in one place. We are looking for a friendly Wiki - style site that integrates with Google Apps and has a powerful search. Any ideas?
I would use Google Sites.  It's one of the core apps in Google Apps and it's heavily integrated with Docs so you can post documents, spreadsheets, and drawings to pages etc. Set up an easy to remember subdomain like wiki.yourdomainname.com for your google site and then share the site with your domain account members if you need security.  Make it public for clients or just parts of it.  More on Google sites: http://www.google.com/sites/help... You can start creating a Google Site by visiting sites.google.com Or just click the "sites" link above your Google Apps mail inbox.    Embed Quote
