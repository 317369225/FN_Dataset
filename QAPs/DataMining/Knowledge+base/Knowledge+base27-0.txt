★How do companies handle knowledge base transfers before doing a layoff?This is a follow-up question to What was the matter with Zynga in June 2010?.
To "defend" our security against layoffs (which are seldom expected or planned for), we have a policy of lots of documentation always. Be it code (and coding practices), or other aspects of our business, everything is well documented. This definitely reduces flexibility and changeability, but also insures us against layoffs and resignations. Documentation for specific tasks (we call them DDL's - Detailed Duties List), is coupled with training programs - one-month of induction materials, and the following months, part of the time is spent in formal and informal learning.    Embed Quote
