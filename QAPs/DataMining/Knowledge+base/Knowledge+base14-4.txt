★What is the best way to build a knowledge taxonomy to help people navigate a knowledge base?The problem with so many forums and knowledge systems is that conversations on one topic end up scattered into different topics so people who would benefit from talking to each end up in different rooms and much potential group knowledge gets lost.
If I were given this assignment and infinite resources I would devise some sort of entertaining game that helps suss a person's conceptual models, then build dynamic navigation options individualized for each person. Otherwise I would search for best practice and established conventions and follow those guidelines,    Embed Quote
