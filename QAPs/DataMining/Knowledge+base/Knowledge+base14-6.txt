★What is the best way to build a knowledge taxonomy to help people navigate a knowledge base?The problem with so many forums and knowledge systems is that conversations on one topic end up scattered into different topics so people who would benefit from talking to each end up in different rooms and much potential group knowledge gets lost.
We feel collaboration in the form of Question & Answers is powerful. Combined with the power of some efficient filters, quick search & organizing information across groups we are trying to build a small little Q&A platform which companies can use to build great knowledge bases which are more organized and efficient to navigate or browse through.
