★Which predictive analytics tools require the least amount of user sophistication?
Commercial packages like IBM's SPSS Modeler (formerly known as Clementine) and Salford Predictive Miner (SPM) from Salford Systems are significantly more approachable than KNIME, R, RapidMiner, and Weka.  I am not familiar with the other tools.  If you're looking for ease of use, I'd look at SPSS Modeler or SPM, with SPSS Modeler having the lower learning curve. Now for the caution tape around this answer... Have you seen the damage one can do with Excel "without knowing what you're doing"?  Data Mining tools are force multipliers.  They really bring home the message "if you take a bad process and automate it, you only make bad things happen more quickly".  If you don't understand what you're doing with data mining tools, you end up with models that support poor decisions.  As with power tools, be careful.    Embed Quote
