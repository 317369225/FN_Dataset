★Typically, how long does it take for a data scientist to create a predictive analytics model?For example, how long would it take to develop a model for predicting customer lifetime value? What level of accuracy is expected for this kind of model?
There is no set length of time for developing a predictive model.  The length of time is determined by the rate of data acquisition and the nature of the data being measured.  For example, LTV for a subscription-based pricing model will evolve as subscribers move out of the high-churn early months.  You might have a reasonable model of churn and retention after only a few months, although it will become more accurate over time.  Companies with annual recurring sales will obviously not have confirming data for one to two years, and how accurate the model will be will depend on the size of the data set and the variability of the data. That being said, as an example of accuracy, we created a model based on a year's worth of data that predicted 12-24 month up-sell value from an email-based marketing program with a matrix of initial marketing sources and interest groups in the data.  We were able to predict revenues +/- 5% compared to the actual data measured over the following two years.  That doesn't mean it always works that way, but it did in that case.    Embed Quote
