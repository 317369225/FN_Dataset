★Predictive Analytics: In regression modelling, is more sample data always better?
The definition of sampling implies that it is the representative of the entire dataset and by extension, of any other unbiased sample that can be pulled from the given dataset. So, in an ideal world, having a sample dataset of sufficient size (What's a good size sample is a different question altogether) should be as good as having the entire dataset itself. However, pulling samples has its own limitations and you often lose out on smaller intricacies and nitty gritties of data and end up with approximations which perform underpar compare to the model you build on the entire dataset. So, to sum it up, yes, having a bigger sample dataset is always more useful. Having the entire comprehensive dataset is the best. However, due to various limitations (Data availability, RAM size) it is difficult to obtain the complete data, and an unbiased sample dataset is suggested. Of course, bigger the dataset more reliable is your result.    Embed Quote
