★What are the best resources to study and understand predictive analytics?I am exactly looking for a blog/tutorial/pdf book that starts from the scratch, use easy and familiar language and cover all the aspects of the Topic in detail. Any leads will be appreciated.
It is hard to pin-point towards one resource for predictive analytics. Assuming that you're comfortable with basic stats, probabiliy, etc., I would suggest: Explore similar questions here... most of the time, you can find your answer without posting a new question altogether. Explore online courses. I know you asked for books etc., but online courses will help you get introduced about the field Some books for you to get started. They are free to download: Page on usc.edu data mining, inference, and prediction. 2nd Edition. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
