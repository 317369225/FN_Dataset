★Predictive Analytics: In regression modelling, is more sample data always better?
Simply put, the more data, the better outcome holds if data is not correlated. For time series data, however, this is not likely to hold and, if you report an interval estimate, it is likely to be a lot smaller that it should be. Using quarterly data, you may look into if there is quarterly pattern with graphs or adding one or more dummy variables. If you're quite sure that recent records outperform, you may confirm by adding another dummy variable, which is 1 for recent records and 0 otherwise. Note that, however, you've got only 4 to 8 degrees of freedom if recent records are used only and I'm not sure if it is sufficient.    Embed Quote
