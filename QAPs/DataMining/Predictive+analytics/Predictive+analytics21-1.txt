★What are the strongest predictive analytic tools at your company?
Really hard to answer this question but I'd say it depends.  If you are working with small datasets and you are a developer, then 'R' is probably a good solution.  If you studied stats in school and learned SAS or SPS, then you might find those tools comfortable. Another new approach is Alpine Data Labs - the company has a web-based and intuitive software for Advanced Analytics and it's built to interact with Hadoop and MPP DBs like Greenplum natively.  You can find out more at http://www.alpinenow.com    Embed Quote
