★What are the ongoing verticals in predictive analytics?It would be great if you could name the players too....but naming the vertical(s) or niche(s) would be great. You could also point to verticals which haven't been explored much--or perhaps which are next on the horizon.
Check out this report from Gartner.  I highly recommend Page 17 of this report has a quick run down of perhaps 35 or so companies in 11 different verticals--as well as a couple competing in multiple (at the bottom in gray): http://public.brighttalk.com/res... * The report also has some charts about intensity of development by vertical, but I think that page 17 is probably the most useful page in the presentation.    Embed Quote
