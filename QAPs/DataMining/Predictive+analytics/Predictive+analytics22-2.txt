★Which predictive analytics tools require the least amount of user sophistication?
The "Rattle" package for "R" requires no user coding, and has a pretty good menu driven system for data mining (also reads spreadsheets directly).  Are you restricting yourself to open source tools only?  Open source tools are not as user friendly as commercial tools. For example, Rattle uses the RGtk2 GUI package, which can be quirky at times. if that is one of the key criteria, you may be disappointed. Also suggest looking into Tableau Desktop which supports forecasting, and SAS Visual Analytics which supports many predictive capabilities.  Both of these products are very user friendly.    Embed Quote
