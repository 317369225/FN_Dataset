★What would be a roadmap to learning predictive analytics?I am trying to acquire some basic mastery of predictive analytics. What would be a good reading list and road map for self-study for a graduate (first degree) in pure mathematics like me? What prerequisite fields should I learn first?
There are no per-requisites to study Analytics. If you have a passion for Maths and data, you are set to do it. :-) The two institutes I saw which offer courses in Analytics are Online SAS Training & Data Analytics Training International School of Engineering (INSOFE) - Hyderabad You can talk to the people at both these institutes and go for the the one which you like. All the best.    Embed Quote
