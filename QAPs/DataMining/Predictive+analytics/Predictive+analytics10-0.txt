★Could predictive analytics eventually replace exams?If the outcome of decision making exceeds 90% would that be sufficient to estimate a persons chance of passing an exam, and thereby assess them without the need of exams? If so, it might be that it would also eliminate cheating, and revolutionise education.
I knew someone who had a degree in Physics. He ran a restaurant I have a friend who studied languages to be an interpreter She became a film festival organiser I had a friend who trained as a film professing manager She made a living as an antique dealer I have a friend with a degree in Geography He is a scuba diving instructor I am a qualified Able Seaman I - of course - am a film scriptwriter In some cases there is an obvious link in studying one subject and working in a field that seemingly is unrelated. The lady who studied languages worked as a secretary for a Film event organiser, and dealing with the foreign translations needed for the events. She learned enough to run events herself, and still used her language skills The film processing person took photos of antiques and processed them, and then became an expert in the antiques field So, you can learn a subject that you might use most of the time You can learn a subject that will get you into the field of work you want, but not be used very much You can learn a subject that by chance opens the door to a new profession A survey of the Film industry would show a very high proportion of multilingual people working in it On the other hand a survey of the antiques business is unlikely to show a high percentage of ex-photographers There is a great potential for Data mining to see how what one studies opens up opportunities in unrelated fields If the relevant links could be shown then the possibility for creating exams that would be more useful might be created    Embed Quote
