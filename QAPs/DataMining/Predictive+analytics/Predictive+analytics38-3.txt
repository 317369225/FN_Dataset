★Could Azure Machine Learning really disrupt the data science space by making predictive analytics ubiquitous?
I think AzureML is an incredible service for data scientists who want to approach the Web the right way. Creating complex data science workflows can be done in many ways, but as far as I see data scientists are not web developers and will always have problems especially with exposing their results to the real world. AzureML gives them the possibility to painlessly create Web Services to access their models, in a scalable way, in the Cloud. Nevertheless, it allows "normal" developers to approach the world of data science without a deep mathematical background, which actually makes the whole process easier even for experienced programmers. I have personally explored AzureML recently and just published an article, trying to compare it with the current status of the Cloud market (especially AWS), you can find it here: Azure Machine Learning: simplified predictive analytics On the other hand, many "ML as a Service" solutions are appearing on the market and some competition will definitely make it better. I'm going to give Google Prediction API a try very soon and see how these three major Cloud providers behave (I am using an open Human Activity Recognition dataset as benchmark context).    Embed Quote
