★What are the best resources to study and understand predictive analytics?I am exactly looking for a blog/tutorial/pdf book that starts from the scratch, use easy and familiar language and cover all the aspects of the Topic in detail. Any leads will be appreciated.
a2a. Ok..This answer should be ideally a little longer. I cant comment much because of my limited experience but If I were in your shoes I would have done the following: 1) Gone to google and selected at least 10 basic links which give me a decent hang of predictive analytics --which start with word prediction , explain analytics, why it is required , why do organizations do it ? whats the science behind and what does one need to know to do so. Makes sense ? 2) Selected few key words which every site is commonly using --example regression. Ask myself - do i understand regression ? read it..understand the practical applications of it. 3) Visit analytics companies website and read the case studies and take help from google to understand everything about it. 4) Of course, do some MOOCs related to it. 5) read forums..ask questions in quora ( very specific )    Embed Quote
