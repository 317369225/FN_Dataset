★What are the most significant challenges and opportunities in predictive analytics?
There are only a few fundamental algorithm scaling problems if you distill them to their essentials.  There are exactly two companies that I know of who are currently addressing them in a serious way. The massively distributed algorithm problems that are holding back most Big Data advances are: join parallelism (e.g. graph analysis), interval indexing (e.g. geospatial polygons), and constraint processing. You cannot solve these problems with distributed hash tables, it requires a different theoretical model of how you distribute computation. The primary companies with legitimate nascent technologies in this space are IBM Research (minus interval indexing) and SpaceCurve. Both are using novel,  non-Hadoop computer science to parallelize operations like joins. The ability to generalize the scaling of Big Data analytics without using MapReduce is a major advance.    Embed Quote
