★What is the difference between predictive analytics and descriptive analytics?
Simple, practical answer: Descriptive Analytics describe what happened in the past. Predictive Analytics (attempt to) describe what will happen in the future. Descriptive Analytics risk less from over-fit as they are describing what actually happened. Predictive Analytics risk more from over-fit as what happened, exactly, in the past under certain conditions may not happen in exactly the same way in the future as the model may not have included features that change the outcome in very material ways.    Embed Quote
