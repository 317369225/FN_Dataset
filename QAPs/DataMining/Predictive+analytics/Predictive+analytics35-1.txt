★What are the topmost Predictive Analytics companies of 2013 and 2014? What they are predicting?
I would say Google, e-bay,Amazon and probably Samsung also are among top companies who does an excellent Predictive Analytics. This can be observed from the massive revenues which they have earned in previous years. And what they are predicting is simple straight forward for example, Samsung almost correctly predicts their new product's market share most of the time. And what Google predicts we all are experiencing it :)    Embed Quote
