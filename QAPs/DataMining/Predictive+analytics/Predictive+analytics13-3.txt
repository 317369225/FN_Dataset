★What is the typical success rate when using predictive analytics for e-commerce?Any Quora members currently using predictive analytics in e-commerce I'd like to hear about your application and success rates?
Big Data is about making small changes. Generally, it's used to make optimize marketing campaigns rather than make sweeping changes. Although, occasionally, the data gleaned from predictive analytics could be used for strategic decisions. Although, changes are incremental they can provide significant lift to sales, ROI improvement and much better understanding of customers. For example: 1. A Vitamin Manufacturer saw • Overall revenue has gone up by 1.5% • Geo-targeted campaigns increased transactions by 8% • Cluster-targeted new product announcements increased sales by 4% • The number of customers, the average order value, the average transaction value and number of units per shopping cart have all increased 2. Using the predictive insight we provided 100% Pure: • Knew exactly where to open their 7 new stores • Saw 163% revenue lift from direct mail retargeting •Increased average daily sales by 7x using targeted invitations to store grand opening • Saw 20% lift from cross-product incentives based off identifying customer buying behaviors • 200% average sales lift seen with eye cream replenishment campaign 3.
