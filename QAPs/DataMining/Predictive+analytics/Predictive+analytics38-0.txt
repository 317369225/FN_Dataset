★Could Azure Machine Learning really disrupt the data science space by making predictive analytics ubiquitous?
ATA I really want to say 'yes' because it is a great-looking service, which helps cover some of the work of transforming data too, and it just makes so much sense to use services to do the complex business of machine learning. History says this model has not (yet) worked though. There are already some great hosted ML services that have been trying for a while -- Google's Prediction API (https://cloud.google.com/predict...) and BigML (https://bigml.com/) come to mind. One big reason is that many hosted ML services start with uploading your data to the service. This is a bottleneck, cost, and in some cases, something a company can't or won't do for security reasons. Azure ML or Google might avoid this problem because they can of course offer their service directly to users who already have their data in these respective clouds. Another reason is that ML is still a new-ish idea for mainstream businesses. The large, sophisticated companies that really need ML have already hired their own team and built their own tools. The smaller companies that don't have a burning need just aren't going to invest in this yet. So the market for this service is always kind of squeezed from above and below. Another reason -- some orgs have invested optimistically in on-premise clusters and their own hardware. They want to utilize them since they've committed to on-premise data and processing, and again sometimes that's for regulatory reasons.    Embed Quote
