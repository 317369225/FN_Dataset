★How do you become an expert at predictive analytics?
Many people approach predictive analytics by focusing on modeling techniques and coding. They judge models by accuracy. They judge practitioners by the tools and the quantity of data they use. This is all wrong. If you want to your work in predictive analytics to matter, focus on business problems and learn how to use predictive analytics to solve them. Look for solutions that are as simple as possible, easy to use and easy to explain. Don't obsess over subtle details of sophisticated modeling techniques. Instead, Focus on proper use of basic analysis methods. Listen carefully to what your clients tell you, and ask probing questions to help you uncover important issues. Devote time and effort to becoming a clear, concise communicator. Your clients can't use your solutions they don't understand, so help them understand. The most valuable classes you can take to become an expert in predictive analytics are Introduction to Statistics and English Composition. Take classes in business writing and public speaking to sharpen your communication skills. Practice writing and speaking about analytics every day. As for additional statistics classes, choose those that Reinforce your understanding of fundamentals. Introduce you to real applications. Are taught by good teachers.Don't spend time taking sophisticated online classes in machine learning or such topics. That's got little to do with developing expertise that matters to clients. I've said more (a lot more) about predictive analytics in my book, Data Mining for Dummies. It's a book for novices, and every bit of it is relevant for becoming an expert in predictive analytics (not complete, but relevant). Ask your local librarian to get a copy.    Embed Quote
