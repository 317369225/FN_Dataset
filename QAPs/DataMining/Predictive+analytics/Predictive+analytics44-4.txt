★Typically, how long does it take for a data scientist to create a predictive analytics model?For example, how long would it take to develop a model for predicting customer lifetime value? What level of accuracy is expected for this kind of model?
As per my view time period required to design an analytical model is not a major concern. It's effectiveness is certainly an important concern. I am not a analyst but have bought an predictive analytical model from Aureus Analytics: Page on aureusanalytics.com for my business and it helped me much because of deep insights.    Embed Quote
