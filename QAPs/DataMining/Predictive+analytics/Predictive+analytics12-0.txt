★What are the best resources to study and understand predictive analytics?I am exactly looking for a blog/tutorial/pdf book that starts from the scratch, use easy and familiar language and cover all the aspects of the Topic in detail. Any leads will be appreciated.
If I had to stick to one, it would be either datasciencecentral or analyticsvidhya. However, to be fair to such a question - for learning predictive analytics (applied) - a) Learn statistics - whether it is through coursera, several books that are available online, or sites like Home | Statistics.com, I think this is a must. And I am not implying that you need to become a God of Statistics. But fundamental concepts need to be clear. You should not have to do a google search to understanding things like goodness of fit, measures of central tendency, normalization of data, etc. b) Learn analytical programming - Between SAS U/ Online help doc, or R, you are reasonably covered on the platform. There is enough material available online. There are some MOOCs also available. OR, you can join academies like Jigsaw Academy, Edvancer, etc. to take up a course. c) Learn applied predictive modeling - This is tricky. Because there isn't just one kind of modeling. But if you start with the goal of becoming a SAS Certified Predictive Modeler or equivalent, I think you will get your basics in place. For that, again, you should either take up some courses, or download the content present online, and use that as a base. After that, you can download some of the publicly available data or some online competition/ challenge data (like Kaggle) to practice. If you pick competition data,  read the forum comments in good detail. They can make your learning curve much faster (the experts discussing a problem that you're grappling with, suggesting alternate methods, sharing results - if that cannot, few things can). I am assuming that you were looking for a simpler or an easy way out. Unfortunately, there isn't one.    Embed Quote
