★What are the pro's and con's of using PMML as an interchange format for predictive analytics models?Is PMML flexible enough to represent most real-world predictive models? Is there a wide base of tools that support it? Are open source tools among these?  If you implement a model using a machine learning library in a standard programming language, is PMML interchange useful to you? Is PMML's value marketing fluff or real?
At Riskified we use PMML for our predictive model mainly because we want to explore and experiment in R but we want to run the real time environment with a more suitable stack like Java. PMML proved itself great for that requirement, and it allows us to be very quick in research yet very robust in the live environment. The models we use in PMML are "random forest" which work very nicely both in R's Rattle as well as in Java and are doing a great job for our type of problem i.e. fraud detection. So to conclude, if the type of Model you want to run is already implemented across the PMML suite and the supported languages (R, Java & Python) are part of your weapons of choice I think it is a great solution for models lifecycle management as well as a great way to bridge between research and live deployment.    Embed Quote
