★What predictive analytics offerings are most similar to Predixion?
First versions of Predixion were similar to data mining add-ins from Microsoft. Latest versions of Predixion are different from anything else available on the market. All other tools either require you to write code (e.g. R) or drag and drop boxes and lines (e.g. KNIME or RapidMiner). I think that Predixion compares with other advanced analytics tools like Tableau compares to old reporting solutions (I like Tableau :) ) If you have not looked at Predixion Insight 4.0 yet, I strongly recommend you to take a look at it.
