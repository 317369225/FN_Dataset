★Who does predictive analytics for the movie industry?
My company Filmaster (http://filmaster.tv) has a movie analytics product for the studios / producers. It predicts movie revenue based on multiple data points including payroll (cast, screenwriter, other people involved), script and multiple audience reports including real-time data about current trends and expectations. The report we generate includes: Revenue potential with likelihood to exceed certain levels (e.g. make 2x budget, make 10x budget, etc) Similar films that were successes Similar films that were flops Useful tips regarding potential changes (e.g. "replace actor A with actor B", "focus on character C", etc). We have recently started sharing interesting insights regarding historical flops and blockbusters, so feel free to check out Twitter / Search - #movieAnalytics.    Embed Quote
