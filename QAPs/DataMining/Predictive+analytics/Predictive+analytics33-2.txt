★What are some examples of applications of predictive analytics to the media and entertainment industry?Are there companies who are doing interesting things in this space? What could people be doing but aren't?
Two use cases that I am famililar with in media and entertainment industry around using predictive analytics: 1) determine the media spend distribution by channel and geography on movie releases see a competition that comscore organized to predict box office performance http://blog.comscore.com/jweinst... 2) determine optimal time of DVD release http://faculty.som.yale.edu/ksud...    Embed Quote
