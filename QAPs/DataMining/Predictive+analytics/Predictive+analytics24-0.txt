★What companies do predictive analytics in the D.C. metropolitan area?Similar to FiscalNote.
We do! At FiscalNote, we created a real time government analytics platform that can predict with 94% accuracy whether or not a piece of legislation passes in city halls, state legislates, and Congress. Essentially we created legal language parser that we overlay with demographic data, campaign finance data, roll call data, and electoral data to create predictive analytics around legislatures. Using this model, we're expanding our reach to regulations and case law as well.    Embed Quote
