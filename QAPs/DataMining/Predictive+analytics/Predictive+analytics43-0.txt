★How does predictive analytics fit into self service BI?As predictive analytics involves modelling and then consumptions into various BI tools.
If the end goal is to empower business folks, predictive analytics should work as an extension of existing self-service BI tool instead of a standalone tool, serving the same purposes but only in much more intelligent ways. Dashboard experience shall remain fluid and simple - ask not additional inputs for the sake of precision, but use existing features in the data as model inputs. only present actionable results that can be validated by the users, such as approximating a complex model as a decision tree.
