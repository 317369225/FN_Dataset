★What are the pro's and con's of using PMML as an interchange format for predictive analytics models?Is PMML flexible enough to represent most real-world predictive models? Is there a wide base of tools that support it? Are open source tools among these?  If you implement a model using a machine learning library in a standard programming language, is PMML interchange useful to you? Is PMML's value marketing fluff or real?
At BigML, we believe that it is flexible enough to represent most of real-world models.  You can find a list of tools and services that support PMML here: Data Mining Group - PMML Powered.  Weka and Knime that are open source support PMML.  At BigML we build predictive models for our customers using Clojure and use JSON PML (a lightweight version of PMML) to store them. Then we made the models available in a number of programming languages (Python, Ruby, R, etc) and also in PMML.  Basically, you can build them once and run anywhere. Press the download actionable model of this model Check out this predictive model "Kickstarter Project Outcomes" to get the idea. We only see advantages producing or consuming it. However, it's clear that the more PMML producers and the more PMML consumers out there the higher the real value will be.    Embed Quote
