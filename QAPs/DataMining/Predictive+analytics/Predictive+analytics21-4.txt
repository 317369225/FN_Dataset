★What are the strongest predictive analytic tools at your company?
Automatic data gathering tools are a passé! It took us only a little time to realize that. I work for http://www.fashionbi.com which is solely a digital project based on the online analytics in fashion and luxury industry. Initially, we too fell for, for example, sysomos but as the business grew and as we went on to gather analytics and analyze the data, it didn't set right. After carrying a few tools v/s manual tests, we realize that if we need to go in-depth about certain analytics, these so-called "tools" prove absolutely useless and inaccurate! Hence, we switched to the manual data-gathering and inventing our own algorithms and now all the data gathering we do is in-house, a system is set, a standard template is available. Behind every data is a specialist hailing from the fashion and digital sector AND most importantly, thanks to the INTERNATIONAL TEAM scattered all round the world that country-spcific analysis has become an asset of the company! Hence, the relevancy and accuracy of the data is absolutely ASSURED! I proudly welcome you to our platform and would love to hear your opinions on the data, its representation and the UX.    Embed Quote
