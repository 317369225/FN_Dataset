★Whats the diff between Big Data and Predictive Analytics?
Doug Laney summarized the challenges of big data more than a decade ago, with the three words "volume, velocity and variety". That is, big data is a moving target, data that is difficult to manage due to its sheer quantity, the high rate of new data acquisition and the assortment of data forms (text, audio, video...) that must be managed. Fifteen years ago, a terabyte of data hard to manage, now it's not such a big deal. Decades from now, petabytes may not sound like a lot of data. But the term "big data" has had so much attention that it has become popular, and now I hear people using it to describe all sorts of data that doesn't come close to pushing the envelope of current data management methods. Predictive analytics is just what it sounds like: the use of data analysis methods to make estimates of things you don't know. The weather forecast is a form of predictive analytics. When your credit card company calls to check on a charge, they may have used predictive analytics methods to flag charges that are not typical for you. There are thousands of practical applications of mathematics like this. So, "big data" describes the data itself, and the challenge of managing it, while "predictive analytics" describes a class of applications for the data, regardless of quantity.    Embed Quote
