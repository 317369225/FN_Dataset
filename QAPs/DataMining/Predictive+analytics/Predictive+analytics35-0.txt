★What are the topmost Predictive Analytics companies of 2013 and 2014? What they are predicting?
Thank you for the A2A. To be honest, I'm growing a bit suspicious of Predictive Analytics companies. My experience so far (and not a great deal of it I might add) is that companies that offer a machine learning black box algorithm to do some sort of predictive analytics as part of their solution are not more effective, efficient or cheap than people leveraging data to achieve the same results. And maybe I'm part of the 5% outside the confidence interval or my online behaviour produces a bug but apart from Google and Amazon, almost no other company or service delivers me better content through predictive analytics. Naturally my experience is biased by the market I work in and my personal choices while using online services. Today I had a very interesting discussion with an HR consultant of a large consulting company about using predictive analytics on many areas of HR. One of the cases that I found most interesting was in predicting staffing on a large hospital. In the last couple of months I've had other similar discussions in people from software development to aircraft repairs. In a nutshell, I believe (personally, no data, take it with a grain of salt) that predictive analytics are very strong in areas that address business complexity, that are strongly audited and people are accountable. In fast moving and more innovative areas, I see less results but quite more excitement. I think in the end, it depends if you are looking for companies that are more aggressive in their R&D and that in the end either go big or go broke or the 'older' markets, like consulting where you are expected to deliver results.    Embed Quote
