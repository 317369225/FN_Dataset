★What's the relation between manifold learning and semi-supervised learning?
Many semi-supervised learning approaches are based on label propagation, that is, an unlabeled data point is going to inherit the label of points that are "close". However, this depends heavily on the definition of closeness being used, and Euclidian distance isn't always a good measure for this, especially in high dimension where points are mostly very far apart in the Euclidian sense. A better measure of closeness comes from the so-called "manifold assumption", which says that the data lie in a low-dimensional manifold. If you can discover this underlying manifold (this is the goal of manifold learning), you can then look at how close points are to each other using the metric of this manifold, which will be much more relevant to the task than the Euclidian metric. For an example of how to do this is using spectral methods and diffusion kernels on graphs, see, e.g., [1].
