★What's the relation between manifold learning and semi-supervised learning?
We should distinguish between graph propagation and Transductive variations of Semi Supervised Learning I have a couple blog posts on this that I hope are helpful Graph Propagation is related to the Manifold Learning via an Effective Operator transformation https://charlesmartin14.wordpres... Manifold Learning is related to the Transductive variety of Semi Supervised Learning through the theory of the Universum Machine Learning with Missing Labels Part 2:   The UniverSVM The most recent work on manifold learning is an SSL method http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/N... On a side note -- dropout in deep learning is also related to manifold learning : [1307.1493] Dropout Training as Adaptive Regularization    Embed Quote
