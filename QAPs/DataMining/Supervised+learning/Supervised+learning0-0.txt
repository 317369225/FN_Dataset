★What is supervised learning?
Supervised learning means that you have "labels" on your data, or another way to put it is that you know what you're trying to predict. You have predictors and responses (typically expressed as one variable, but not always) in your data and you know which features are which. Classification is the discrete variety (is this digit, as an array of pixel brightnesses, a "1"?) The "is it a 1?" 0/1 variable is the response and the pixel intensities are the predictors. Regression is the continuous problem (what is the predicted high temperature based on weather features X, Y, and Z?) Machine learning requires the ability to evaluate as much as build models and, in supervised learning, you can build a model on 9/10 of your data and then see if it accurately predicts the lables on the other 1/10 (cross-validation). For a contrast, unsupervised learning (say, clustering of observed data based on features) means you don't have labelled data. It's not always clear what, specifically, you're trying to find. You're trying to determine (through some automatic means) what structure lives in the data. There are ways of evaluating unsupervised learning's models, of course-- otherwise it would be useless-- including adaptations of cross validation, but they don't take the form of "how well does it map known predictors to responses?" To be more technical about it, unsupervised learning is about estimating a probability distribution (over all variables) based on the empirical distribution of the data, and supervised learning is about estimating conditional probability distributions on small number (typically one) of features ("labels") given known values of the predictors.    Embed Quote
