★How do I apply supervised learning methods to time series classification?
I can't come to the conclusion that what model you should use, but i can narrow down your search. I prefer these three, 1. Gaussian Processes 2. Hidden Markov model ( Dynamic Bayesian) 3. MLP (Multilayer perceptron)    Embed Quote
