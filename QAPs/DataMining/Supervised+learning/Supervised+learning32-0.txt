★Is it a good idea to write machine learning algorithms (like supervised learning/unsupervised learning) ones in C or FORTRAN?
I would suggest none of these initially. To make development easier and much faster, you could start with algorithm prototype development in Octave/MATLAB and after initial verification that you learning algorithm is working fine, eventually shift to development in Java/C. Initial development in these languages would be difficult and you could have to write tons of lines of code to eventually see that your algorithm doesn't work as expected.    Embed Quote
