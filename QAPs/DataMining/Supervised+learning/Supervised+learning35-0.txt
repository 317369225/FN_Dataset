★What are used more, neural networks with unsupervised learning algorithms or neural networks with supervised learning algorithms?
Supervised learning gives better results on tests for the trained-on properties. If you are building classifiers today then this is likely the way to go. OTOH if you want to create an Artificial Intelligence then using supervised methods would be cheating, since one of the strongest criteria for intelligence is "the ability to determine what matters even in domains where it has no prior experience". Some systems have demonstrated that they can do this, and humans can do this with ease from an early age; but supervised methods are "teaching" methods since they are showing the system the correct answer. We need to shift to systems capable of "learning" on their own, the way humans learn from everything they experience.    Embed Quote
