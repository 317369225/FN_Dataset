★Are there some example applications and/or algorithms where some unsupervised learning technique is initially applied to improve a supervised learning effort?I am not referring to "semi-supervised learning" where you have many data points and relatively fewer labels. I'm asking if there are cases where given sufficiently labelled training data, unsupervised learning principles could be applied.
In Image classification, first unsupervised learning is applied on images then supervised learning to reduce the number of data points in an image.    Embed Quote
