★What is the difference between active learning and semi-supervised learning?
Active Learning is a class of machine learning algorithms where the algorithm is allowed to query the user for the label of a subset of training instances. Semi-Supervised Learning is a wider class of machine learning algorithms where the algorithm augments a small labeled set of training instances with a larger unlabeled set. According to Wikipedia,  Active learning is a special case of semi-supervised learning.  I guess this is technically correct but misses the point: Both methods try to solve the problem of insufficient labeled training data, but they do this in different ways.
