★University of California, Berkeley: Why don't US colleges implement a supervision learning style like the one at Oxford/Cambridge?It seems that using personal supervision/tutorial teaching style will benefit the student so much. It can be very personal and can be very rigorous at the same time so that the student will learn the topics really well. For more explanation about supervision teaching style just click this link: Supervision system
I'm from the US with an engineering degree from a top US research university, but spent an undergraduate year at Cambridge.  The supervisions aren't all they're cracked up to be.  Most of the supervisors aren't professors, they're grad students, and most of the supervisions have three students.  The supervisors are paid by the hour, and aren't going to give you any more time than they're paid for.  I wouldn't quite say that this educational system is bankrupt intellectually, but pretty close.  It's extremely expensive for what it provides educationally, imo.  I got a LOT more out of the lectures than my supervisions, and it wasn't just because I wasn't used to taking advantage of them -- my fellow students who'd gone through their system felt the same way.  Cambridge carries on about how wonderful they are, but at least in Engineering, supervisions aren't very efficient or effective. Give me my US university's model with weekly assignments, office hours as needed, direct access to faculty, etc.  The Cambridge system forces you to learn the material for yourself, which was probably good for me in one way, but I certainly didn't learn as much as I would have with better and more instruction.  I wonder if the supervision system works better in humanities than engineering.  But it's nothing that US universities should be interested in.  The new pedagogical ideas, like the "flipped classroom", are much better.    Embed Quote
