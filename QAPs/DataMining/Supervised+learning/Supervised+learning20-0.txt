★Is Galaxy Zoo an example of supervised learning?
It's more an example crowd sourcing research. The learning is minimal and Galaxy Zoo is mostly frequented by those who already have a basic understanding of cosmological concepts. I've been on it for a couple of years now and yes it does teach me things, but there's no supervision on it. It could be different on its chat forums which I do not frequent.    Embed Quote
