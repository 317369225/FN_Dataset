★What is the formal name of the method used in semi-supervised learning?
This is Semi Supervised Learning with Laplacian Regularization. Essentially, the objective function here is: where L is the laplacian of your matrix G. Ideally I should have written S here instead of L (to conform to the notations from your image), but your S does not seem to be correct. Where did you obtain this image from? Are you sure that S is properly defined? [edit] Yes, the L can be reduced to S, although the alpha won't carry the same meaning. The algorithm given in the image is not wrong. [/edit]    Embed Quote
