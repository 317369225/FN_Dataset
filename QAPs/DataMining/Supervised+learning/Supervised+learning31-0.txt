★What are the best statistical methods for analyzing the performance of a supervised learning algorithm with binary outputs (labels)?Obviously you can produce a confusion matrix and look at the number of true-positives and false-negatives, but what other methods are informative?
How about calculating the mutual information between the actual states (T or F) and the indicated states (T or F)? This is just a function of that 2x2 confusion matrix; the benefit is that it's a one-dimensional figure of merit expressed in bits per symbol. It tells you, essentially, how much information about the true state you are learning by examining the output of the discriminator. Another approach, when your threshold for discriminating T vs. F is a real-valued parameter, is to plot the entire Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (the proportion of true positives vs. false ones for each value of the threshold), instead of just looking at the confusion matrix for a particular setting. Here a common one-dimensional figure of merit is just the area under the whole curve.    Embed Quote
