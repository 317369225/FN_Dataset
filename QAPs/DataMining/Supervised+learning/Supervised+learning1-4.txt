★What are the best supervised learning algorithms for sentiment analysis in text?I want to do text analysis to determine whether a news item is positive or negative for a given subject. What are the best supervised learning algorithms for this?
I did sentiment analysis of tweets classifying them as positive, negative or neutral as part of a college project. Support Vector Machine can be very much effective in sentiment clarification. The key here is not only the algorithm you use, but also the pre-processing required. Removing the noise out of data such as removing stop words (is , am , on....) ,  removing URLs etc improves the quality of text. Feature vector needs to be formed in such a way that it takes most of the words in text into account, and for those words which can be part of text but not present in feature vector, some care has to be taken. For a quick and optimized implementation , one can use NLTK. It is a python library for writing machine learning programs, and can be used to implement a support vector machine quickly.    Embed Quote
