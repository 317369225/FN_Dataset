★What are the best/most common supervised learning classification algorithms for time series data?Supposing your training data is a time series (with one or a few 'reading' values given at each time step), and certain intervals within this series are classified (into, let's say, 3 levels), what algorithm can best find a predictor function to 'recognize' these special intervals and classify them?
Additionally to the very good suggestions of other answerers, you may be interested to have a look at reservoir computing and echo state networks. They can give surprisingly good performance, and the basic idea is very simple and easy to understand. (In fact it is so simple that the first think many ML researchers - including myself, I confess - had when first presented with it is: "Are you kidding me? There is no way something that stupid could give interesting results." And yet it does.)    Embed Quote
