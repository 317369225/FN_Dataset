★How do I apply supervised learning methods to time series classification?
Time series data is tricky to work with, first, time series data tends to be non stationary, which means that is unlikely that two different time series data, although part of the same category, will be similar. Algorithms like SVMs and Logistic regression heavily rely on the fact that the data is stationary. If you want to rely on PlugAndPlay algorithms, you should extract features that make your time series data at least stationary. How problematic is this, let's give you a simple example: Suppose you want to classify sinusoidal signals from different frequencies. Because data usually comes from different sources, your input likely won't be the same even for the same frequency, since the phase might be shifted, even though the signal looks exactly the same, the phase messes everything up. Because of this, you need to extract things that will maintain the stationarity of the signal, for example the Fourier transform and the spectrogram, regardless of the phase would have similar (if not the same) spectra for different inputs, and then you can classify that more easily. You can also window your data and create an artificially larger dataset, you can take the derivative of your data so you can capture tendencies. You could use something like Gaussian Processes, that make a good work at doing this, but you definitely can't rely on plug and play, you need to understand the nature of your data.    Embed Quote
