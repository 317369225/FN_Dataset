★University of California, Berkeley: Why don't US colleges implement a supervision learning style like the one at Oxford/Cambridge?It seems that using personal supervision/tutorial teaching style will benefit the student so much. It can be very personal and can be very rigorous at the same time so that the student will learn the topics really well. For more explanation about supervision teaching style just click this link: Supervision system
At Cam/Oxf the supervisions/tutorials, are additional classes to the lectures which must be attended by all. Hence, even though supervisions comprise of 3-4 students, the lectures basically cover it all. UCB has a different system altogether. It has labs and lectures and students can ask professors questions indicidually. Even though, I find the Oxonian way better for core learning, US schedules are made in such a way to cover up for the loss; lectures are more in number; also, they are pretty long. As it is the convention, most probably they wouldn't change the system.    Embed Quote
