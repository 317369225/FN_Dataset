★Is Autoencoder unsupervised or semi-supervised learning?From this lecture(link below), I saw Professor considers Autoencoder as semi-supervised but to me it  just reconstructs the input and we don't need to have a label on it so it must be unsupervised learning.

Some consider supervised learning to be when you have a separate "teaching signal" (or target value). Since auto encoders DO have a target value (the original inputs), they are considered supervised learning to some degree. However, since that target is not in addition to the input data, it is also considered unsupervised. Since it can kind of be considered both, many call it semisupervised.    Embed Quote
