★What are the best supervised learning algorithms for sentiment analysis in text?I want to do text analysis to determine whether a news item is positive or negative for a given subject. What are the best supervised learning algorithms for this?
1. Naive Bayes Classifier - Naive Bayes classifier uses far less computing power compared to other methods and often is a baseline method for many models. 2. Maximum Entropy Classifier: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pri... is a parameterized method and works by extracting features from the text and combining the features in a linear fashion for classification. This is a member of the log-linear or exponential family of classifiers. 3. Decision Tree: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dec... works by creating a decision tree of root, branches and leaves, creating a decision point at every branch. The decision is taken at the leaf node. 4. TiMBL: http://ilk.uvt.nl/timbl/ is a classifier based on k-nearest neighborhood algorithm. This works based on the principle of solving a problem by leveraging the learnings of previously solved problems. 5. Support Vector Machines: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sup... are treated as classifiers with high accuracy but have their own challenges to deal with skewed nature of datasets and computational complexity.    Embed Quote
