★How do I apply supervised learning methods to time series classification?
Alternatively, you can use descriminative restrictive Boltzmann machine (RBM) to do classification. It model the the joint distribution of label and data. If the data is real-valued, use Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM.    Embed Quote
