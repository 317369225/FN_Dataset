★Unsupervised Learning: Is supervised learning synonymous to classification and unsupervised synonymous to clustering?I am a beginner in machine learning and recently read about supervised and unsupervised machine learning. It looks like supervised learning is synonymous to classification and unsupervised learning is  synonymous to clustering, is it so?
In supervised learning, the "correct" answer is known for each training example. This allows an "error" to be computed for each training example, which is the basis of computing the Cost.  The known answers for each training example can be a classification (for example, a number can be used to represent each color, or each condition), or a real value (for example, the price of a house). In unsupervised learning, there are no "correct" answers known for the training examples. Clustering is one such method.    Embed Quote
