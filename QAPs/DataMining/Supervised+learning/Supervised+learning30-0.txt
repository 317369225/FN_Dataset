★What are different way to select correct hypothesis for supervised learning?In supervised learning algorithm we select hypothesis like h(x) = q + qx1 + qx2 but what make us to decides this hypothesis ? is there any universal way to selecting hypothesis ? is it vary depending on problem and dataset ?
Since it is a supervised learning problem you have a training data set in hand. Finding the right hypothesis is not a one step process where you pick one and it magically fits your training data set. You have to run through several iterations with multiple hypotheses to narrow down to the one that seems most optimal. There are a lot of equations to pick from and see if they yield optimal results but having an idea of the data (in the form of the training data set) helps us to narrow down to a smaller subset of hypotheses to pick from. Say you're predicting increasing oil prices, your training data set will be more or less linear. On the other hand, if you're predicting positions of a planet or an asteroid, a quadratic equation which when plotted gives a parabola makes more sense. The right hypothesis is a result of engaging yourself with the training data set by trying to extract as much information from it. And one would need quite a bit of intuition to pick the right hypothesis and assign weights to each term in the hypothesis.    Embed Quote
