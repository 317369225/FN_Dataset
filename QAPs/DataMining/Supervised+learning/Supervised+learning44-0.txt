★Which publications propose pragmatic solutions for supervised learning and classification of object trajectories (orientation+position)?Say we have a solid 3D object such as a cube and we are able to track it's trajectory over time, it's position in space as well as it's orientation. Now we want to recognise a pattern in the trajectory, that is, label it as an instance of a trajectory in our training data. Do you have some pointers to literature or algorithm that might be able to solve this problem practically?
I don't know for sure but Hidden Markov Models are quite good in mapping the dynamics of such trajectories.    Embed Quote
