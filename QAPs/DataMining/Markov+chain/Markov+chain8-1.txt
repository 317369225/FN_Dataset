â˜…What is the difference between a recurrent markov chain and an absorbing markov chain?
In an absorbing Markov chain the probability mass can get stuck. If stuff gets stuck in state and keeps flowing into (which will happen as long as the system keeps behaving the way it was) and yet never flows out of , then eventually the entire probability mass will collect in . Here's a really bad drawing: In the left picture whatever gets fed into [math]\fbox{1}[/math] stays there. On the right things will "popcorn" back and forth between and . Either way there is no "way back" (notice the arrow heads to not point back to the main cloud). So eventually everything will trickle into or and never leave. Some examples of absorbing states (from which it's possible to escape) could include: death Florida, for old people Chinese fingercuffs learning Santa Claus doesn't exist breaking up for good the door in No Exit algal blooms rain flowing to the bottom of a hill Adam & Eve eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil don't the Elves in Middle Earth eventually sail to some land they can't return from?
