★What is the largest Markov chain ever used?
Especially autoencoders and RBM are kind of Markov chains where each layer only uses the preceding layer to be activated and it conforms a  kind of Markov assumption. So maybe Andrew Ng and Google autoencoder over YouTube images can be deemed as the largest Markov model to my knowledge.    Embed Quote
