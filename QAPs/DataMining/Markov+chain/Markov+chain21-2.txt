★What is the difference between Monte Carlo simulations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)?
Note that your question doesn't quite match your quoted material.  Your question is missing a word:  simple.  To match the quoted material, your question should read:  "What is the difference between MCMC and simple Monte Carlo simulation?" The author you are quoting is using the term "simple Monte Carlo simulation" to refer to a situation where the random variables generated are independent and identically distributed.   As an example, suppose that are independent throws of a fair six sided die, so each is equally likely to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  Then by throwing the die five times and averaging, one could get an unbiased estimate of the average value of the die, which is 3.5. In a Markov chain simulation, the state is started at one number, say for instance 2, and then a random change is made to the state.  So for instance, it could be that the state increases by 1 with probability 1/2, or decreases by 1 with probability 1/2 (unless that move would move the state outside of the state space.  So starting at 2, the five states could be 2, 3, 4, 3, 2 or 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, or 2, 3, 4, 5, 4.  Now if you took enough states in the chain, the final state would look much like a single throw of the die.  However, unlike the independent throws of the die, because the state can only change by at most 1 at each step.  So mathematicians say that the states are correlated.  That correlation has to be compensated for when using such draws to estimate quantities of interest, such as the average of the die value.  It also makes a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm much more interesting from a mathematical perspective!    Embed Quote
