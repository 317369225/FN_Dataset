★Mathematical Modeling: How are Markov chains applied when the transitions may change the structure of the state space?
I don't know this area of Markov chains, or even if this is an area where Markov chain theory has been done.  But, A2A, here are some ideas for how you might start if no one has some deep theory. I see two challenges:  The right transformation function.  It has to accept a variable number of inputs and some parameters associated with each input.  And the transformations have to give a variable number of outputs with associated parameters.  This seems really hard to do in a general mathematical formalism, but fairly straightforward programming.  And it gets even easier if you're working on a specific application, like variable numbers of competitors, suppliers, customers and regulators in an economic model. The right analysis of the results.  Again this seems harder the more abstract you try to keep it.  If it's a specific application (like an economic model) then you probably have analysis metrics in mind before starting (like income inequality).So I'd suggest looking at specific application areas (like economic models) to see if specific Markov chain models have been published.  Then check their references to see if you find any leads to general results from more abstract theory. Good luck!    Embed Quote
