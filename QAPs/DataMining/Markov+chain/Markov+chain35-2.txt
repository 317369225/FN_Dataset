★What is the relationship between Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Gradient Descent?
Your description describes any iterative method, not necessarily GD and MCMC. And in the GD sense, sometimes you can model the space analytically - you just choose not to. GD works with functions as opposed to probability distributions.  GD can always move in the minimum direction (because you've got a function of some kind), but MCMC has to rely on proper sampling in order to move in the right direction. They're both very different. The only thing in common is that they iterate and mostly converge.    Embed Quote
