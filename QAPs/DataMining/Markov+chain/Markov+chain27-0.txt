★How long can the burn in period be for markov chain monte carlo estimation (MCMC)?
Formally, there are no bounds on the burn-in time for general Markov chains and very few means of assessing convergence.  In practice, many simply run for a set number of iterations or monitor trace plots of the chain variables, but these approaches can fail spectacularly in high dimensions.  Even more formal techniques like R-Hat (Gelman and Rubin's convergence diagnostic) can be misleading when sampling from multi-modal distributions.  That said, a careful combination of convergence diagnostics and posterior predictive checking (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/cour...) are often adequate for robust MCMC analyses.  If your goal is to reduce the time until convergence, then a good seed goes a long way.  Because a Markov chain samples points based on probability mass, and not probability density, the ideal seed should be in the typical set (as Geyer is fond of saying, "Any point you don't mind having in a sample is a good starting point.") which is rarely in the neighborhood of the mode of the distribution.  Still, a mode is better than a tail and a reasonable seed if no other information is available.    Embed Quote
