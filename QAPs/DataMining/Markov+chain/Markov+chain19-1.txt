★What is an intuitive explanation of the reversibility condition (aka detailed balance) in a Markov chain?
In physics, this is called detailed balance--- it's the law that in equilibrium, each two states of the system come to equilibrium due to their transitions separately from the rest of the system, because there can be no conspiracy among all the states to maintain equilibrium. The reason it is true is because you will maintain equilibrium between two states even if you artificially perturb the system to get rid of all but two of the states, by suddenly making all the other states have infinite energy, but keeping the transitions between the two states unaltered. If this is violated, then equilibrium is only maintained through a weird  flow of probability around cycles, and this is inconsistent with  modifications of the system which cut off the cycle, and these perturbations could then be  used to violate the second  law of thermodynamics. This states that the total flow of probability from state A to state B is matched to the flow of probability from state B to state A, when both have the equilibrium probability, for each pair of states, without regard to the rest of the system.  In equations P(A) K(A->B) = P(B) K(B->A), this is the reversing condition. Einstein used the principle of detailed balance extensively for inferring quantum statistics, in the A/B coefficients. But it's older, it dates back to the 19th century. Then, people used this law to relate the emissivity and absorptivity of a blackbody.    Embed Quote
