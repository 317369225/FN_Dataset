★What is an intuitive explanation of reducibility in a Markov chain?
Reducibility is about reachability. If you can get to every state from every other state then your Markov chain is said to be 'irreducible'. Consider an a Markov chain with two states, but no transitions between them, where if you start in a state you stay in the state. That fails the irreducibility test. You can show that if your state space is finite, there is always some "communicating class" of states that you ultimately wind up in. Here we have 2 such classes, and just happen to start out in one of them without preamble. On the other hand consider a Markov chain that has infinitely many states, but where you can only move forward from state n to n + 1 but never go backwards. That also fails to be irreducible, but has no communicating classes. If you update the previous chain to also have self-edges from state n to state n, then each state forms a communicating class (you can get from n to itself, and back), but unlike in the finite case, the chain isn't required to end in a recurrent communicating class.    Embed Quote
