★What is a Markov chain?
The simplest example is a drunkard's walk (also called a random walk). The drunk might stumble in any direction, but will move only 1 step from the current position. On average, after n steps, you can expect the drunk to be steps away. That's an example of the sort of interesting property you can exploit in using Markov models of things. For an illustration of the power of this approach, think of music. If instead of a drunk walking on a plane, you think of the "space" of musical notes, and musical "rules" that determine which notes can come after which, you get a Markov chain model of music. You can use it to model individual composers as "black boxes" without knowing anything about their musical ideas. If there are patterns/structures in their thinking, the Markov chain model can capture it by simply listening to their music and updating transition probabilities. You can create artificial Bach-like music this way, for example.    Embed Quote
