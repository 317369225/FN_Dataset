★Could evolution be modelled as a memory-less, Markov-chain process?
Yes, under the assumption that memoryless refers to the Markov property that for a n-order Markov chain the next state depends only on the n previous states. A zero order Markov process is for example a coin toss where chances of H/T occuring in the next state don't depend on the present or any previous states.  Evolution is the result of selection on variants, i.e., variants that are more fit have higher chances of producing offspring. Hence evolution can be modelled as a first order Markov chain.    Embed Quote
