★What is the relationship between Markov chains and Poisson processes?
Let's consider a Poisson process in 1 dimension. As mentioned by Justin Rising, this is a continuous-time Markov process; this is true in both the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous cases (i.e., whether or not the rate of arrivals is constant). Now consider the homogeneous case, with arrival rate . Then the Poisson process is a pure birth Markov process on the state space 0,1,2,..., with birth rate (this is a nice special case of a Birth–death process, where there are no deaths). Then an intuitive way to think about the connection is in terms of the memoryless property. As I described in What is the relationship between Poisson processes and the gamma distribution?, the interarrival times in the Poisson process are i.i.d. Exponential random variables. A wonderful fact about the Exponential distribution is that it is has the memoryless property: if a waiting time is Expo(), then the additional waiting time given that you have already waited minutes is also Expo(). In fact, the Exponential is the only memoryless distribution (for a continuous random variable with support . Now what does this have to do with the Markov property? Markov processes have another form of memorylessness: for predicting the future evolution of the process, what matters is the current state, not the whole history of how the process wandered into that state. These two forms of memorylessness neatly come together in the Poisson process when viewing it also as a Markov process.    Embed Quote
