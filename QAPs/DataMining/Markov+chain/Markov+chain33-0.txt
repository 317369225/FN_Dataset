★What are some sound examples of using Markov Chains in economic research?
Markov chains, both in discrete and continuous time, are used in many contexts in game theory. Here are some examples and resources In evolutionary game theory, continuous time Markov chains can be used to derive a deterministic mean field to describe the change in a population's strategy distribution over time. See William Sandholm's Population Games and Evolutionary Dynamics. Markov chains are also used as a tool to study learning and evolution in finite populations. Additionally, Lorens Imhof and Drew Fudenberg use Markov chain approximations to estimate the stationary distribution in a population in Imitation Processes with Small Mutations (Imitation Processes with Small Mutations). In the theory of repeated games, there is also an equilbrium refinement of subgame perfect equilbria known as Markov perfect equilibria. A strategy in a Markov perfect equilibrium is a mixed strategy that responds to some underlying state of the game, so, in some sense, the player's strategy is a Markov chain. This solution concept is applied to many political examples in Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy by James Robinson and Daron Acemoglu.    Embed Quote
