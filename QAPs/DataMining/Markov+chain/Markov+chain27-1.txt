★How long can the burn in period be for markov chain monte carlo estimation (MCMC)?
If you have large amount of data, then likelihood term is likely to dominate the prior term in the posterior. In such cases, I start from maximum likelihood estimates to make sure that I quickly converge. I think this is a good strategy that can save you a lot of time. Of course calculating maximum likelihood estimates may not be easy in some cases.    Embed Quote
