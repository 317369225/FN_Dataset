★How do you prove that "if X and Y are Markov chains, then X+Y is a Markov chain"?
The claim is false (even if and are independent). Take to be Bernoulli(1/2), , where p is small (e.g. p<1/8). Take i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2). If it is true that forms a Markov chain, then the distribution of conditioned on is the same as that conditioned only on , but this is false. Take , , then won't give you any information about , and follows the same distribution with or without conditioning on . But tells you that , and since p is small, changes slowly, so it is likely that , and unlikely that (the probability is less than 2p). This is an example of Hidden Markov model. The observations in hidden Markov model do not necessarily form a Markov chain.    Embed Quote
