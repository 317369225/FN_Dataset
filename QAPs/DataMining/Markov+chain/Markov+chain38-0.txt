★Is our macro physical world a Markov chain?I.e., does the next state only depends on the most recent state?
How would you define "the macro physical world?" I think that, using any reasonable definition of "the macro physical world," your question has no possibility of being "scientifically" answered. Heisenberg "proved" (for most definitions of "proof") that it was impossible to measure the position and momentum of anything with absolute accuracy, so neither the current state of the "macro physical world," nor its future, state can, or could, be measured. Einstein "proved" (in the same sense) that the concept of simultaneously occurring events was meaningless when discussing the "macro physical world." Taken together, and mixing in quantum processes which (in aggregate) have effects on the "macro physical world," the best Markov process you could have would be a semi-continuous (assuming that, as many do, time is quantized) process mapping a "current state" matrix of probability functions into another "future state" matrix of such functions. (This is, of course, what "Quantum Mechanics," on a micro scale, does.) If no "scientific" answer is possible, your question becomes either philosophical or theological. Most theologies support a belief in "miracles," defined as events occurring without any preceding cause." So, the theological answer is "no." (Note that this is also the "physical" answer if you believe in the existence of the "virtual particles" needed to make sense of the high energy particle collider observations.) The "philosophical" answer is a little more complex. If your philosophy requires the assumption that any "effect" be preceded by some "cause," then your answer would be "yes." But (see the above paragraph) current physical theory has made that assumption fairly untenable. Without that assumption, the answer is, again, "no." Putting that all together, my answer to (my understanding of) your question is: "No."    Embed Quote
