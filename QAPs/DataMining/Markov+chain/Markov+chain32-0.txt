★What are the main/most fundamental theorems regarding Markov chains?
It's possible to write quite a bit on the basic theory of Markov chains, but in the interests of space, I'm going to highlight two basic theorems on finite state Markov chains: If a Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, then it has a limiting distribution that doesn't depend on the starting distribution.  Furthermore, there are efficient algorithms to decide whether a chain is irreducible and aperiodic, and to calculate the limiting distribution if it exists. The empirical transition matrix has the right asymptotics.  The law of large numbers holds pretty much exactly like you'd hope, and there are versions of the central limit theorem too.    Embed Quote
