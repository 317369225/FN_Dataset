★How do I explain Markov chains to a 10-year-old?
UPDATE: I turned this into a video: Previous Answer: First just get the idea across that a markov chain is a way to model reality. Maybe you want to model the weather (say we are building a video game). So how could we figure out a way to model the weather? Let's just say we want to model the "chance" of rain. keep it simple Well pretend from past experience you realize that if it's sunny today (no rain), the chances are "low" that the next day it will rain. If it is rainy today then the chances of rain the next day are "high". So then explain that high chance could be say 80% (make them pick this number) and low chance could be....20% for example. So then setup a little 2 by 2 grid: This little grid is the essence of a markov chain. On the left is "today" on the top is "tomorrow". So to make a "chain" we just feed tomorrows result back into today. Then we can get a long chain like rain rain rain no rain no rain no rain rain rain rain no rain no rain no rain a pattern will emerge that there will be long "chains" of rain or no rain based on how we setup our "chances" or probabilities. _____ Another fun way (if you kid is into music) is to make a markov chain to mimic a simple song like "marry had a little lamb"...if you want details just let me know!    Embed Quote
