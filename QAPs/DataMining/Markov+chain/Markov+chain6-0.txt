★How are artificial neural networks and Markov chains similar?
There is one similarity, and it's their common use case. Both Markov Chains (namely Hidden Markov Models) and ANN are used for speech recognition. You may find these articles useful (be warned, lots of math inside) and compare the approach: HMM: Page on cam.ac.uk Neural Networks: Page on jmlr.org Neural Networks (Deep Learning, Geoffrey Hinton is amazing): Page on googleusercontent.com But in general, they are completely different. Neural network in an universal approximator and HMM is primarily used for modeling the relations in a system.    Embed Quote
