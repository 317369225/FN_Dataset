★Has anyone used Markov Chain Monte-Carlo methods to generate art in the style of particular modern painters?
Let's review the writing problem for a second.  Given a corpus of texts various algorithms can learn the style of an author, which can then be used to generate random text.  As you note, neighboring words appear authentic but without a proper context the entire document is largely gibberish.  Can we do something similar with paintings and other visual media?  Absolutely -- once we can define the visual equivalent of words.  Without the structure of language there's no obvious features from which one can decompose an existing piece of art, at least not in generality.  When analyzing classical paintings, for example, researchers often use strokes as their basic feature [1], but that's hardly appropriate for an artist like Pollock [1]. Once the features have been defined, the artist's style can be learned just as in the writing case.  Given that style a painting could be generated, but I'm not personally aware of anyone who has taken that step.  Note that any generated painting would suffer from the same lack of global context as in the writing case, as well as various artifacts from the approximation of the artist's style with only the chosen features. [1] Nova has a nice segment on the use of stroke analysis to authenticate paintings, http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tec.... [1] Pollock seems to be a favorite of researchers, with the fractal nature of his paintings used as the relevant features.  See, for example, http://www.sciencedirect.com/sci....  Try searching Google Scholar for a publicly available copy.    Embed Quote
