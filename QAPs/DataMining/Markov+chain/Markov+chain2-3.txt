★What should every programmer know about Markov Chains?
Most programmers will go their entire careers without ever once being in a situation where they would even want to use the concept of a Markov chain.  Of those who do, many will be quite familiar with the basic theory and not need a short list of facts. That leaves a few people in the position of occasionally running across a problem where Markov chain theory would be useful and not being familiar with it.  The most important things for them to know is that Markov chains exist, they're defined by the fact that the past and future are conditionally independent given the present, and that it's not all that hard to find people who know much more about Markov chains and are willing to answer questions about how to use them in any given application.    Embed Quote
