★What is the difference between Monte Carlo simulations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)?
"Monte Carlo simulation" is an umbrella term that covers many algorithms that use random number generators to approximate a specific probability distribution. The usual output of such an algorithm is a sequence of values that satisfy some statistical properties and can be proven to be distributed (approximately but with arbitrary precision) according to the expected distribution. Such samples can be independent from each other or can have some dependence. If they are independent, then we can use ideas like the Central Limit Theorem to estimate various quantities. Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or MCMC, is a specific technique used to create such a sample. It builds a Markov Chain that has the target distribution as a stationary distribution and then simulates that MC until you have convergence. It's a cool idea that "unlocks" many distributions that are difficult to sample via other means. However, we lose independence, so we need new ways to study convergence to the correct distribution.    Embed Quote
