★How do I explain Markov chains to a 10-year-old?
Imagine a traffic light with three states: yellow, green, red; however, instead of going Green-> Yellow-> Red at "fixed intervals", it would go at any color at any time.(randomly - Imagine a dice with 3 color and you throw it and decide what color it will be next).   Alternatively, imagine you are in certain color, say green. If you don't allow to be in the same color again, flip a coin. If it is heads go to red, and if tails go to yellow. Imagine a small restaurant with say 5 tables, the restaurant can be in 6 states: empty, one table full, 2 tables full, etc. people arrive at random times and finish their meals in random times. The transition from state to state is a Markov chain. You may change states when a person leaves or a new person comes.    Embed Quote
