★What is an intuitive explanation of the reversibility condition (aka detailed balance) in a Markov chain?
Using world trade as an analogy, reversibility (or detailed balance) means that... There is a perfect balance of trade Here's why... Think of the nodes of the Markov Chain being countries. Think of a link from country A to B as country A exporting goods and services to country B. is the amount of wealth that country   owns. is the percentage of that wealth that the country exports to country . is hence the total amount of wealth exported from country to country . Thus if for all , then exports equals imports between all countries. There is neither trade deficit nor trade surplus - there is a perfect balance of trade. This Markov Chain is reversible since if there's a perfect balance of trade, you can reverse the direction of trade and and nothing has changed in terms of the value of things traded. This also leads nicely to an intuitive explanation of why if a Markov chain is reversible under a distribution , then is stationary. I will use this definition of stationarity. If a Markov chain is in a stationary distribution, then it stays in a stationary distribution in the next step. If there's a perfect balance of trade for a certain wealth distribution , then after a round of trades each country will still have the same amount of wealth. Thus is stationary. (I'd like to credit Professor Sam Kou of the Harvard Stats department for inspiring this explanation!)    Embed Quote
