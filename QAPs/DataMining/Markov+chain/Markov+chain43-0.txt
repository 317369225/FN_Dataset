★If we take a finite state Markov chain and condition on the event that some particular state is never visited, is the resulting process a Markov chain? If so, how is the transition matrix of the new chain related to the old one?
It seems like that's effectively like removing one node from the chain, and all the nodes that feed into that chain would have their outdegree transition probabilities revised so that they are still in proportion to one another but still add up to one. So yes, I think the process would still be a Markov chain, and the matrix would be slashed one dimension each in row and column.    Embed Quote
