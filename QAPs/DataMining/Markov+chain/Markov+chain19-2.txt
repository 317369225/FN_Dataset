★What is an intuitive explanation of the reversibility condition (aka detailed balance) in a Markov chain?
Say that we have a stationary Markov chain .  If we define the process by , then we have another Markov chain.  It's then very natural to ask under what conditions these two process are equal in distribution, and it turns out that's exactly what the reversibility condition is describing. I don't know of any way to extend this to infinite sequences of random variables with the Markov property, and I'm not sure where to look.  If anyone reading this does know a way, please comment.    Embed Quote
