★Could evolution be modelled as a memory-less, Markov-chain process?
Yes. A specific case is known as the Moran process, which is a popular stochastic model commonly used to model evolution in finite -fixed sized- populations. The process is as such: at each step, pick a member uniformly at random, replicate it with probability proportional to fitness, if replication occurs, eliminate a member uniformly at random.  Consider the two allele case of A and B. Lets denote the frequency of A as Alternatively, you can look at this as a state in your chain: population with i As and N-i Bs Now at each state you have a certain probability p of moving to state or with probability q to , this is independent of the previous state you have been at, it only depends on your current state. This continues until you hit an equilibrium or an absorbing state.    Embed Quote
