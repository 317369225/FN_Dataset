★Markov Chain Monte Carlo: What are some real-world applications of MCMC?
Here is an excellent example of MCMC being used in the real world. http://statweb.stanford.edu/~cga... The story is that an officer from a state prison came to the department of statistics in Stanford  for help. the officer found that the prisoners are communicating through coded messages. The messages are composed of a set of symbols that no one understand. The statistician in Stanford suspected that each of these symbols correspond to an English letter. They used MCMC algorithm to find out what each of the symbols correspond to.  They broke the code after several thousands iterations. Basically, the problem was to find  an unknown function f f : {code space} −→ {usual alphabet} First, they downloaded a standard text (e.g., War and Peace) and recorded the firstorder transitions: the proportion of consecutive text symbols from x to y. This gives a matrix M(x, y) of transitions. One may then associate a plausibility to f via Pl(f) = Here is the MCMC algrithm: • Start with a preliminary guess, say f. • Compute Pl(f). • Change to f∗ by making a random transposition of the values f assigns to two symbols. • Compute Pl(f∗); if this is larger than Pl(f), accept f∗. • If not, flip a Pl(f∗)/Pl(f) coin; if it comes up heads, accept f∗. • If the coin toss comes up tails, stay at f. This way, the f gradually move to the "real" f the prisoners use for the coded messages. That example being showed, the MCMC is primarily used in bayesian statistics.    Embed Quote
