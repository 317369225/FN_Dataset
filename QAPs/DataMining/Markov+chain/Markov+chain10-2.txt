★Markov Chain Monte Carlo: What are some real-world applications of MCMC?
There's just a little gap between bayesian and non-bayesian. Any non-bayesian model can be transformed into bayesian and apply mcmc by giving priors of parameters and sampling on parameters. You can try search combinations of the model you know and the term 'bayesian'. for example: bayesian ARMA, bayesian garch, bayesian DSGE The reason why MCMC are less on papers is that the choice of different priors causes biased influence and inconsistent, that's what objective bayesian is struggling.    Embed Quote
