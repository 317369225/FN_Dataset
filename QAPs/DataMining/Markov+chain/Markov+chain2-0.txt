★What should every programmer know about Markov Chains?
1) They generally have a simple two step discrete implementation. 2) You can quickly build a prototype in Excel once you understand the discrete version of the model. 3) Depending on what you are modeling, the results could be reasonably reliable (physical process) to very unreliable (market driven prices). 4) Like all other implementations, there are simple hacks that allow you to speed up process and convergence with modeled phenomenon. 5) To understand the discrete model you don't need a PhD in Quantum Physics. 6) You can build better simulators by calibrating them (their parameters) with real historical data. Ps: Check out Monte Carlo Simulation method in Excel as well as the MC Simulation theoretical review on YouTube.    Embed Quote
