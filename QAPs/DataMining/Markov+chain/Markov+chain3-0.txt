★How are Markov chains used in bioinformatics?
This is an interesting question. HMMER is an implementation of HMMs in bioinformatics. In a nutshell, HMMs are used in sequence similarity searches of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. They allow database searches on the basis of probabilistic inference of sequence similarity. The utility of HMMs in this context is to enable building sequence profiles from alignments and calculating the probability for states of insertions, deletions and gaps in each column of the alignment. This way each column is represented by transition probabilities that reflect the degree of conservation for that column. This HMM profile is then used to search for similar sequences in a large database or genome by assessing the likekihood for finding such sequences based on chance alone. You can guess that such an approach maybe quite computationally intensive. This is correct, HMMs are originally slower than BLAST. However different heuristics facilitate considerable speed gains in HMM based searches such as Viterbi's apprlximations and Dirichlit calculations. A lot of work has been done in improving HMMs in bioinformatics over the years. Pfam , a database of protein profiles extensively uses them in annotating, classifying and searching protein members of any given protein family. Here is a valuable resource to brilliant work done in/for HMMs http://selab.janelia.org/publica... Another similar database search approach in bioinformatics is to use covariance models which are generalization s of HMMs and based on context-free grammars. These models are used in RNA searches for they incorporate sequence and structure profiles of RNAs and offer better results than BLAST in this context.    Embed Quote
