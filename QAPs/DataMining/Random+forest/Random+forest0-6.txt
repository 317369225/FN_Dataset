★Random Forests: How do random forests work in layman's terms?I've read the wikipedia article, and the bioinformatics article on the Random Jungle implementation of random forests is informative, but still doesn't give a decent, less-technical explanation of what RFs are actually doing. So how would you explain random forests to a non-computer scientist? I'm specifically interested in how RFs do regression problems.
Random forests are the collection of machine learning algorithms used in the generation of decision trees. They generate the class that is the mode of the classes given by different decision trees. Random forests are used to optimize the predictive performance of individual statistical classifiers or decision algorithms. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R...    Embed Quote
