★How does one choose the best feature and threshold in a random forest?The features are continuous-valued.
Random forest works well because it not only injects randomness while selecting the data but also in selection of features to split the data at individual nodes. Having said that the performance sometimes could be heavily dependent on selecting the right features. One method is just randomly select them, but has the disadvantage of selecting correlated and uninformative features that may contribute null towards data separation. A good way could be finding the features which are uncorrelated to each other and have high variance, advantage even a small number of such features could give you better classification or clustering, disadvantage it will increase computation cost, but if accuracy is your main aim than this method is definitely good.    Embed Quote
