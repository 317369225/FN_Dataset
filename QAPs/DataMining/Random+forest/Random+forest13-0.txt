★How do I find variable importance in random forest?
A random forest lets you assess how important a variable is by calculating how much out-of-bag performance you lose when you scramble the values of the variable. Calculation is already included in the standard random forest packages. If you're using the sklearn package in Python, you can simply call the feature_importances_ attribute of your model object. If you're using the randomforest package in R, then you can simply use the importance function. See the documentation at 3.2.3.3.1. sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier 3.2.3.3.2. sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor Page on R-project Good luck!    Embed Quote
