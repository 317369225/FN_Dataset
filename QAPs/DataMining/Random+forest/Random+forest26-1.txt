★When and why is  naive bayes classifier a better/worse choice than random forest  classifier?
The main difference between Naive Bayes(NB) and Random Forest (RF) are their model size. This in turn effects the representation abilities and tendency to over fitting of models built by the algorithm. NB model size is low and quite constant with respect to the data. The NB models cannot represent complex behavior (or cases where the NB assumption doesn't hold). However, it won't get into over fitting. RF are the other extreme. The models tend to be very large and if not carefully built,  most of their representation power goes for represent over fitting. The good news are that in many cases you don't have to choose. When possible, you can run NB in order to get a "feel" of the data and then run RF in order to find some interesting insights.    Embed Quote
