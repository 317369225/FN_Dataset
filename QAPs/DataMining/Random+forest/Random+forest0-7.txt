★Random Forests: How do random forests work in layman's terms?I've read the wikipedia article, and the bioinformatics article on the Random Jungle implementation of random forests is informative, but still doesn't give a decent, less-technical explanation of what RFs are actually doing. So how would you explain random forests to a non-computer scientist? I'm specifically interested in how RFs do regression problems.
You can think of Random forests as a collection of (often shallow) randomly generated decision trees. Check out Edwin Chen's great explanation over here: Random Forests: How do random forests work in layman's terms?    Embed Quote
