★Should inputs to random forests be normalized?
Any algorithm based on recursive partitioning, such as decision trees, and regression trees does not require inputs (features) to be normalized, since it is invariant to monotonic transformations of the features (just think about how the splits are done at each node). Since random forests (as well as gbm) are just a collection of trees, there is no need to normalize.    Embed Quote
