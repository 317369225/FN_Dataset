★What are the interesting applications of classification algorithms like neural networks and random forests?
The other common applications are: 1. Internet traffic interception - certain governments (possibly from the middle east) would like to restrict certain categories of web pages. For example, due to religious restrictions, certain movie pages may be restricted/censored. This is a clear application of classification. But a hard problem, given that this must be done in real-time and based on unstructured text content. We have developed a solution for one of our clients. 2. Video classification - as and when you upload a video on youtube, the video has to be classified into appropriate categories and meta-data added to it (annotations). Again a hard problem, given the state-of-the-art video processing and real-time nature of things. 3. Image classification - classic problem in image processing. Is this an image of a dog or a cat? Google recently has come up with a large scale training mechanism for neural networks: Large Scale Distributed Deep Networks. The same could also be used for face recognition. 4. Voice classification: classify and if possible, identify the voice. Very useful in Siri type applications. 5. Alex Smola's book carries an excellent introduction to the same: Books. 6. He lists out a few more applications including email spam filtering, cancer diagnosis (given historical records, can we infer whether a patient is healthy or not), etc.    Embed Quote
