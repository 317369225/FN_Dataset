★When is a random forest a poor choice relative to other algorithms?
Ensembles of decision trees (such as Random Forests, which is a trademarked term for one particular implementation) are very fast to train, but quite slow to create predictions once trained. More accurate ensembles require more trees, which means using the model becomes slower. In most practical situations this approach is fast enough, but there can certainly be situations where run-time performance is important and therefore other approaches would be preferred. Of course, it is important to recognize that it is a predictive modelling tool, not a descriptive tool - if you are looking for a description of the relationships in your data, you should look at other options. Overall, for fast, simple, flexible predictive modelling, ensembles of decision trees are probably the most useful single pragmatic tool available today - but like any method they do have their limitations.    Embed Quote
