★What is setting random forests apart from other ensemble methods in Data Science?
Random forest tries to decorrelate the members of its ensemble i.e. it decorrelates the trees. When building members i.e. decision tree, a subset of p predictors is randomly selected as split candidates from the set of q available predictors. Averaging of these uncorrelated decision trees makes the system less variable and more reliable.    Embed Quote
