★How does one choose the best feature and threshold in a random forest?The features are continuous-valued.
If you're asking about the tree building algorithm itself, then the answer is that you choose a feature to split on randomly at a node. Its possible to use many random features at once too but one is simplest. You pick a threshold for continuous features that essentially splits the data most cleanly into positive and negative cases. You are maximizing information gain. It suffices to try as thresholds all of the actual feature values found in the data set. Or a sample.    Embed Quote
