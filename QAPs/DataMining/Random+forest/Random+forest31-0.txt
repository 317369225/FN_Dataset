★Why did Microsoft decide to use Random Forests in the Kinect?Did they try other algorithms?
You can read about the reasons in the paper they published on the subject in their paper "Real-Time Human Pose Recognition in Parts from Single Depth Images" (http://research.microsoft.com/pu...).  The key thing to remember is that this runs on a per pixel basis, and random forests parallelize very well compared to say conditional random fields. They claim that by using decision trees, they're able to do it an order of magnitude faster and run at 200Hz. They compared it to a nearest neighbor + chamfer matching approach and still got more accurate results, despite this approach being 100x faster; and they compared it to another popular algorithm/dataset and it still ran 10x faster.
