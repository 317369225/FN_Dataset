★How do I tune a random forest?
Chapter 14 of the book "Data Mining Applications with R" by Yangchao Zhao and Yonghua Cen has a nice walk-through of this with code in R that's run in parallel. Essentially you have to vary the number of variables that are sampled randomly at each split (mtry) for models built using a fixed number of trees. You can set the number of samples to something like 1000 and vary try from 1 to sqrt(number of variables). (Update for completeness) The model with the highest accuracy out of all of these contains the best value to use for mtry.    Embed Quote
