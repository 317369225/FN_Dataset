★When is a random forest a poor choice relative to other algorithms?
Random forest does take up time since it builds multiple classifiers, but having said that, it is a highly parallel algorithm , so if you have multiple core or use GPU, you can get a significant speedup.  One of thing I observed it in case of a sparse feature vector (which is the case in most dimensional data) , a random selection of features may not work all the time as uninformative or correlated  features might be selected which might degrade the performance of the classifier. Although random forest is intuitively easy to understand, but its difficult to get an insight as to what the algorithm actually does , the variable importance and so on, although good research has been done in this field.    Embed Quote
