★Apache Mahout: What is a good Java based random forest implementation?How good is apache mahout?
Weka 3 is a very resourceful program for random forest that is based on Java programming and the good news is: it's open-source! (1) There's another program called FastRandomForest (2) that's based on Java but this program's just for the random forest implementation, unlike Weka.
