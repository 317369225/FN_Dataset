★Ensemble Learning: What are some shortcomings of random forests?
Here are two: Most implementations of Random Forests are slow when you have a large number of features (though one important counterexample is FEST, which is supposed to be fast when features are sparse.) On the other hand, algorithms like SVMs can handle large numbers of features quite efficiently. Random Forests aren't good at generalizing to cases with completely new data. For example, if I tell you that 1 chocolate costs $1, 2 chocolates cost $2, and 3 chocolates cost $3, how much do 10 chocolates cost? A linear regression can easily figure this out, while a Random Forest has no way of finding the answer.    Embed Quote
