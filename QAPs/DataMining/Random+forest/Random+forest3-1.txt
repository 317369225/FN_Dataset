★Should inputs to random forests be normalized?
In my experience, there's no need to normalize the input, but the important thing is to normalize "the importance measures". As you can see "the importance measures", play the critical role in random forests, and they're the key points for screening the important variables or predictors, especially in genetics. They're several articles about this topic, and you can check them; They never talk about standardizing the input, but they do like to standardize these criteria!   In another point of view, in genetics, the input variables in random forest are usually categorical, so how can we standardize the categorical variable?   here are some related papers about importance measures: -Random forest Gini importance favours SNPs with large minor allele frequency: impact, sources and recommendations, Boulesteix, Anne-Laure Bender, Andreas Lorenzo Bermejo, JustoStrobl, Carolin, 2011   -Maximal conditional chi-square importance in random forest, Wang, MinghuiChen, Xiang Zhang, Heping,2010.   -Letter to the editor: on the stability and ranking of predictors from random forest variable importance measures, Nicodemus, Kristin K, 2011.    Embed Quote
