★What does "interaction" mean in random forest?Interaction of two or more variables in statistical term is a very important issue, but I can't figure it out, the concept of interaction in random forest. And what's the code of R to compute it?
The base learner in Random Forest is a decision tree, and the decision trees can capture interactions between variables by performing branch-specific splits. This is a non-parametric model so one cannot just calculate a corresponding interaction term coefficient as one would in the case of linear regression (so no R code snippet)    Embed Quote
