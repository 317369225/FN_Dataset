How do I master implementing sorting and searching algorithms?There is a book series by Donald Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming. It is a classic. Volume 3 is dedicated to sorting and searching. The Art of Computer Programming I agree with the answer above, if you can implement each algorithm and test it, you'll become very profficient at it. The thing with implementations of sorting algorithms, is that they are very easy to validate automatically: you can just fill up a large array of random size (1000 elements, for example) with random values, and after sorting it, just check if the values are in ascending order.
