App Store Optimization: How does the AppStore search algorithm work?We've noticed some changes on FEB 12 and FEB 14 in search algorightm -we've spotted this on a couple of apps (rankings wise), so maybe you have some ideas on the possible changes. Especially, this concerns app names - should we prefer keywords rich names?The AppStore is constantly going through changes. Recently, the algorithm changed to put more weight and emphasis on ratings and reviews. It used to be mostly based on number of downloads, and download velocity (if you had a large spike in downloads in a 48 hour period, you would see your ranking rise considerably). However, as I mentioned now there is evidence to suggest that the algorithm has changed to put more weight on ratings and reviews, although downloads and download velocity still play a large role. Also, leveraging your title for certain keywords is very important. First of all, your keyword character count is very limited, so the title gives you a chance to add a few more. These words also seem to be weighted more and have more of an impact on search rankings for than regular keywords. However, like Oliver mentioned, don't spam your title.
