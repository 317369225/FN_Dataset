What should every programmer know about search algorithms?I suppose what you want to ask is what are the properties of a search algorithm that a programmer should keep in mind. Well of the top of my head, I think you should have in your mind: A visual animation of how the algorithm operates The average (and probably the worst) case running time of the said algorithm Whether the said algorithm is in-place [1] or not (DO NOT underestimate this) [1]. In-place algorithm
