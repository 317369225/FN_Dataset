What factors does the search algorithm for the iTunes App Store take into account?Does it place a higher priority on keywords, description, etc?The App Store search algorithm looks for keywords in the following fields: App Name Keywords Publisher Name In-App Purchase Display NameThe priority is the App Name. In this field, having an exact match with the search query will give your app a bonus in the search results, so it's a good idea to play around with your keyphrases looking for the best word order (that makes sense, of course, or the reviewer could judge your app as keyword-stuffed and reject it). The Keywords field don't have this problem. Every word there is considered equality regardless if the order. Words from the App Name, Publisher Name and Keywords field can be combined to create keyphrases. So if you have "Red" in the App Name and "Car" in the Keywords field, your app will appear somewhere in the search results for "red car". IAP Display Names will only be searchable through an exact match. Description is not considered by the search algorithm.
