How does Google measure improvements in their search algorithm?Which factors indicate that the algorithm has improved or become worse?I asked Amit Singhal, Lead of Google Search, about how changes are evaluated, and he answered that they have the entire web in a sandbox that only their engineers can see, and their engineers can take their new algorithm and see it change millions of queries. If it works, they send it to testers, whom they pay, but they don’t tell them what they are testing. Then they take a tiny slice, one per cent of their users, and expose them to this change. They measure things such as where on the page they click, when they click higher – that’s good for them. In my opinion, there are many factors which indicate that the algorithm has improved or become worse, like: Search Exit : The number of searches a visitor made immediately before leaving the site.  Note : (search exit here is like bounce rate in any page) Search Refinement : the number of times a visitors searches again immediately after performing a search. Time After Search Precision : is the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant to the search Recall : is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved. Search Depthand other. You can see more details about that inside Evaluating Search Engines presentation. Evaluating Search Engines
