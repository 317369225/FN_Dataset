Can you explain how Google's search algorithm works in an easy to understand way?Google's search algorithm is quite robust in itself. It uses our own search preferences to sort the results based on keywords. Everytime we surf through any of the search results shown by google, we increase the number of hits for the page. The webpage with maximum number of hits qualifies as the most suitable result for the given set of keywords in the query. The search results may also include advertising webpages.  Thus the search algorithm is adaptive and robust, it keeps improving itself to provide unparalleled results.
