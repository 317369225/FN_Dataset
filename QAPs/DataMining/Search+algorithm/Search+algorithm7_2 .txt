Do search algorithms make us dumber and less creative?该网页不存在附加信息...Yes, search algorithms can make us dumber and less creative because "We Tend to Only Find What We Already Know".  When we type text into a search engine like Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, etc. -- we can only express what we already know. As a result, we invest our own biases in what we are seeking. We view a limited world defined by our own limited understanding of the world. Have you heard?  "Everyone takes the limits of his or her own field of vision as the limits of the world." --Arthur Schopenhauer  But creativity requires diverse thinking. Creativity requires the ability to discover things that are unknown or never considered. Creativity requires information and knowledge that comes from a place not found in our minds, but rather, surprisingly -- outside of our minds.  Creativity requires an eclectic view of the world that is only revealed when we are exposed to things we have never seen or heard before.  So might I suggest...  To optimize your creativity, go out of your way to study things that you've never studied before. Visit websites you have never visited before. If you find yourself communicating the same perceptions every day, you surely need to break the mold of your own limitations.   But Our Search Engines are Becoming "Dumber"  In the past ten years I've noticed Google is returning MUCH less diverse information from my search queries. It's a list of a hundred stories -- all the SAME story duplicated on a hundred different sites. It's absurd.  Ten years ago, Google searches would return a hundred ORIGINAL stories written by a hundred people of every persuasion, from high school students to presidents.  Not anymore. The reason I believe is money. Google is ranking information according to money paid to Google via click count. Optimizing the Google search engine according to cash generation is the abhorrent result. AND WE ALL LOSE.
