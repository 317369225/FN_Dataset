How does LinkedIn's search algorithm work?How does LinkedIn's search algorithm work in terms of keyword placement and repetition? How sophisticated is their search algorithm? I'd like to understand what's "under the hood."It strikes me that the LinkedIn search algorithm is not very robust considering the number of people that visit the website on a daily basis. For example the entire basis of LinkedIn should be company based searches using the search box, yet that sames to be the poorest of all search results. For example a search for "sales" in LinkedIn does not yield Salesforce as a company result, which you would think would be the #1 result and is by far the most popular company starting with that name in the world. Instead it yields an incomplete profile for a company calls "sales". They have a lot of room for improvement here. Many of you can make up a bunch of big words about proprietary ranking, but the sad truth is although LinkedIn's offices are right next to Google's in mountain view, their search technology is miles apart.
