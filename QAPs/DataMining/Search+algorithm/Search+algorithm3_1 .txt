Which is the fastest string searching algorithm?该网页不存在附加信息...Boyer-Moore is the standard for regex matching, which runs in O(n). An O(m) algorithm is not possible since we must always process the string at least once. There are several cool algorithms you can use that take advantage of suffix trees--building one can be done (surprisingly) in linear time. With your question of looking at the maximal pattern match, this is actually something that comes up frequently in bioinformatics. With a suffix tree, you can find a match with up to e errors in O(en) time. There's a whole wealth of various algorithms you can learn about in Gusfield's textbook on string algorithms.
