Can genetic programming produce novel search algorithms?Hello, I'll like to share my experience about this. I have been working in GP and other hyper-heuristics to evolve code since i was studying in College, and Yes, GP can generate novel algorithms, one small team in a SA Country has been creating novel algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems since 2002 (although is not a NP-order problem, one of his most amazing results was to find Dijkstra's Algorithm from simple raw data and simple terminals). The real problem is the implementation, we found a way to get novel algorithms but is still not a fully automated process, but i think that in a couple years we are going to be able to replicate Google's page rank and other state-of-art algorithms just with a black-box input-result method. Create a program to solve a problem with GP is not hard at all, creating a small algorithm that solves a problem from just data is hard and still needs lot of human intervention. Just look for Automatic Generation of Algorithms at any paper bibliography page.
