How do top n search algorithms work?该网页不存在附加信息...You can give good approximate answers by running your algorithms on a relevant subset of the data. You can build indexes so that you reduce the amount of data you have to process as much as possible. For example, in search you can just process the list of documents that contain the least frequent word in the search query instead of processing the list of documents that contain frequent words like "the". You can do stuff in paralel and just send results that pass a certain quality threshold to the merging step. You can filter less interesting data so that all you input has high relevance. In summary: sample, index, parallel, filter.
