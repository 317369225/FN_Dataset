What have been recent development in realtime search algorithms?该网页不存在附加信息...It's not a "recent" development.. but the company I work for, OneRiot, originally led the way for realtime/social search. Broadly speaking, we used people's twitter activity, instead of robotic web crawlers, to guide us in creating an index of the web. The result was that our index was full of content that was socially relevant right now. Said another way, we only indexed web pages that people were tweeting about right now, so the search results for any query returned links that had a current degree of social buzz about them. The ranking algo we used - called PulseRank - included a variety of realtime social signals, such as the rate at which a piece of content was being shared across twitter right now, etc. You can read more about what we did / what the algo was here: http://www.docstoc.com/docs/docu... To complete the story, using the same underlying realtime architecture, we created an ad model to monetize realtime search and the wider realtime web in early 2010. That blew up... and the company is now exclusively focused on this. You can read more about that here: http://www.adexchanger.com/ad-ne...
