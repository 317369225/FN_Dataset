How do Baidu search algorithms work and how do they differ from Google's?该网页不存在附加信息...Baidu matters because we people in China mainland can't even access Google without proxy, connections would be disrupted. Based on my experience, baidu handles only concept search, "what is that" would led to a baidupedia link in first of search result, where contents were mostly copied from Wikipedia and censored. Once you want more, you need Google. Enter keywords of a python encoding question, keywords in foreign language, sensored contents, even pirated videos or books' name wouldn't help if you use baidu. In which sensored contents are more like a whitelist, not black list. Ah, I heard baidu would add promotions(whether ads or phishing sites) before and into search results, I want to know more details if anyone knows.
