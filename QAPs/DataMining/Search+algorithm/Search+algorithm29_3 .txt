What factors does the search algorithm for the iTunes App Store take into account?Does it place a higher priority on keywords, description, etc?Keywords in the title will have the greatest priority, followed by the keywords in the keyword field. The description does not currently factor into keyword selection. Rankings for keywords will primarily be determined by number and velocity of downloads, but other factors like reviews and engagement seem to be taken into account. However nobody knows the exact formula, except the search group at Apple.
