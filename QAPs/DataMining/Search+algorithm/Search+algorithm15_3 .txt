How does LinkedIn's search algorithm work?How does LinkedIn's search algorithm work in terms of keyword placement and repetition? How sophisticated is their search algorithm? I'd like to understand what's "under the hood."LinkedIn uses proprietary (and secret I pressume) algorithms to rank and order the results you get when you search for people on the site. There is no single rank for LinkedIn search. Unlike the standard search engines, a LinkedIn people search generates its relevance score uniquely for each member. As a result, even though a query will return the same results for everyone, the order is determined in part by the profile, activity, and connections of the person searching. Testing a query from a handful of users is not likely to reflect the overall rank any profile has across the millions of queries that LinkedIn has every day. A better measure would be the number of views your profile gets. Check the Who's Viewed Your Profile section on your homepage. Before they return results, they consider the searcher's activity on LinkedIn, the profiles returned by the query, and other members who have run similar searches in determining the sort order. These, along with other factors, combine to provide them with data to improve the overall quality of members' search results. More keywords aren't always better. Linkedin advice would be to only include the keywords, including repeated keywords, in your profile that best reflect your expertise and experience. If you integrate an extended list of keywords into your profile, you are likely showing up in a high number of searches. The question you need to ask yourself, however, is whether members consider your profile relevant to their search. If not, their behavior as a collective group may be influencing the algorithm used to rank you in search results.
