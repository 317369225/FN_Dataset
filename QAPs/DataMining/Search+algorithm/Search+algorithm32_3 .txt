Can you explain how Google's search algorithm works in an easy to understand way?In simple terms.... Google bot crawls a site and collects all the information it can about it. Based on the pages content (the words) it decides what the page is about and stores this information. How it ranks the importance of this content is based on the other people online who have decided to link to it. The more trust worthy sites that link to it, the more important it is. When a user types in a search term, Google looks through its index of pages and and decides which of the pages in it's index matches the search query the closest and offers these pages in a sequential order based on the popularity of that page. It's obviously more complicated then that with several algorithms applied, but thats basically how it works.
