Which Are The Best Fastest And Efficient Searching Algorithm For Searching Through Database in PHP?I am Making one Website which is purely based on php . I have a huge database consisting of the record of project details and i wanted to search through the database for finding out projects using some keywords or search string. I want to know which algorithm would suite best for me for efficient , fast searching.You shouldn't implement a search algorithm yourself, especially not in PHP, for a large data set. Best either use the database's build in full text indexing features (see e.g. MySQL's Full-Text Search Functions) or use a dedicated search engine such as Sphinx or Solr.
