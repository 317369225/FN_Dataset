What is known about the App Store's search algorithms?Understanding App Store's search algorithms is probably the biggest challenge in today's mobile world. They are so dynamic and predictably keep changing. Thanks to ASO tools that help us to test many challenges and find out what works and what doesn't. What I learned by helping many app publishers recently is that there is a clear correlation between having highly searched keyword in the name of an app and boosting your ranking for that difficult keyword. Below you can see what happened after I put the keyword (that has a high search score ) on app name. Secondly,while focusing keywords that are relevant, please keep in mind that you also need to find the sweet spot between search score,chance, length and keyword combinations. I highly recommend to add&track your app via Mobile Action dashboard since it shows you all possible keywords and combinations. Lastly,where you actually rank not just depend on how well your keywords are optimized,it also depends on your app ( positive review & rating) and how many downloads you have. To have an idea, you can check your competitor's ranking for targeted keywords & their weekly download number.
