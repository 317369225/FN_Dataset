App Store Optimization: How does the AppStore search algorithm work?We've noticed some changes on FEB 12 and FEB 14 in search algorightm -we've spotted this on a couple of apps (rankings wise), so maybe you have some ideas on the possible changes. Especially, this concerns app names - should we prefer keywords rich names?Since the acquisition of Chomp, Apple has been pushing out monthly algorithm changes to the app store ranking algorithm. These are usually released in the middle of the month, and often apps jump up (or down) hundred of ranks on their keyword ranking -- something that we keep track of at Sensor Tower. The changes you saw were another iteration of the algorithm change. As far as what effective app names are -- having the searched for keyword (and even more so, phrase) in your title is a huge boon in terms of potential rankings in search. Typically, most of the top apps that you find will either have the keyword in the title. Keep in mind that a spammy name may get rejected by Apple.
