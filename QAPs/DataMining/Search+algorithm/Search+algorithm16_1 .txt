What tool should I use to prototype graph search algorithm?My graph is a tree, where each vertex has a text/word. Each twig is something like a hierarchical description of a subject. On input I have a query containing text/words. I need to find a twigs in my tree, which satisfies a query by matching words from query with vertices in tree. What kind of tool/programming toolkit would you use in my situation?I don't think anything fancy is necessary here. All you need is a comparison between query and node and you've got a straightforward search problem. The only question is whether you need breadth-first or depth-first. Regardless, this is easily coded.
