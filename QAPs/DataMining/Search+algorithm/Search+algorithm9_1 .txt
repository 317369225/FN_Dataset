How do Baidu search algorithms work and how do they differ from Google's?该网页不存在附加信息...During an invited talk on the last CIKM, Kai Yu (on the photo of mine, sorry for poor quality), the deputy managing director of Baidu Institute of Deep Learning, shared that they heavily use deep learning for various search tasks including image search (of course, as Google does), and voice search. Interestingly, to the best of my knowledge, this was the first reported usage of deep learning, which incorporates text for deep learning models, from a major search engine.
