What are the most popular Nearest Neighbor Search algorithms?Follow-up question: Which nearest neighbor search algorithms run in logarithmic time, or which is the fastest NNS algorithm for large 2D data space?LSH Locality sensitive hashing is a good approximation solution that is very efficient. KD Trees and other spatial indexes degrade very badly as the number of dimensions increases they are quickly equal or worst than a linear brute force search. An interesting approximation that is easy to deploy is a greedy walk. You need first to pre-process the points inserting them in a graph, you attach each new point to its k-nearest neighbors. To find the nearest neighbor for a point you start from a random node in the graph and greedly move to the neighbor node that is closest to your target. When the distance can't be improved the current node is the nearest neighbor for the target. Also check this: Page on wwwconference.org
