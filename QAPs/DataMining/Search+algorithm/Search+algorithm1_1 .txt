What is the A* search algorithm?A* is a search algorithm that finds a path between two nodes in a graph. There is plenty of material about A* online (Sahil Juneja linked to a nice article in a comment). I can try to give a high level intuition (at the risk of some scientific imprecision): A* is considered optimal because (for a given heuristic that guides the search) it finds the best path while performing the least amount of work than any other algorithm that guarantees finding the best path . The heuristic function needs to meet certain criteria (be "admissible") for this algorithm to be admissible (optimal). To determine the order in which it scans the graph, A* combines: 1. a heuristic function that estimates distance to destination 2. the distance from the start node I hope it gives an idea.
