What are the most important things to consider when designing a data model for a performant website?
As Donald Knuth said, "premature optimization is the root of all evil". These issues don't matter until you approach scaling bottlenecks.  Computers are so fast these days, that -- unless your site gets really really popular -- you'll be fine throwing everything into a MySQL database.  After that, it's a rich man's problem. What is important is to understand the full stack of your architecture, so that you're able to make changes should you be lucky enough to have to optimize.  And at that point, your issues will be specific enough to get actionable answers. Scaling is not nearly so hard as building something cool enough to require it.    Embed Quote
