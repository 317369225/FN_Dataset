What are the most important things to consider when designing a data model for a performant website?
Laure has asked the right questions and I'll add some more: Are you sure that the DB will be the biggest bottle neck in your application? Are you planning to use it(DB) directly or trough some ORM? Can you use caching to lower the DB/server load? Are you sure you need to optimise it that much?Developing a highly scalable application from the beginning may took too much time and in the same time never to hit market share big enough to need this optimisations. I you are not 100% sure that you will get high load consider to start with relatively simple application and if there is need to optimise it. I'll quote 37 signals - "Scope down. It’s better to make a half product than a half-assed product."    Embed Quote
