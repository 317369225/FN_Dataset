What are good ways to design data model in Cassandra for historical data?
In the case that you have provided, the rowKey would be the customerId. The columns for this row would store the orderIds. The key of the orderId columns would be oid_<Timestamp> (e.g. oid_20120105124530 for Jan 5, 2012 12:45:30 pm). You would then call getSlice(), which takes the rowKey and a range of column names. It's a slice of columns for a "get" command, where "get" takes a single row key. Although Cassandra supports these semantics, Cassandra has issues scaling for long lists. I'm sure they will fix it at some point, but AFAIK, this is memory inefficient.    Embed Quote
