Is there any point in NoSQL data modeling tools since many NoSQL solutions are schema-less?
I would say that if anything, the data model is more important in case of NoSql databases. This is because in most NoSQL stores, data can be efficiently accessed only through keys, so you need to decide on how to keep the keys that will enable efficient retrieval for most of your use cases. This is probably not data-modeling in the traditional RDBMS sense, but still comes under the broader definition of the term. There is a decent explanation of NoSQL data modeling techniques here: http://highlyscalable.wordpress....    Embed Quote Updated 21 Nov. 1,223 views.
