Data Modeling: When should we not use a relational database?
The answer is best given when you look at your typical queries, if 80% of the queries perform better with a noSQL or XML database, it is worth investigating further. The other aspect is how often does your data model change and how flexible do you need it to be - obviously if it needs to flexible noSQL s probably the better approach, but you have to worry about validating data at the application layer and code it yourself. Finally  you may need to consider how important are ACID features: transactional support etc - most noSQL dbs you have to code it yourself, which is hell as they are not designed for that. On the other hand SQL dbs (most of them) support that out of the box. It would help if you gave some details about your particular project - it is much easier to discuss a concrete scenario by providing examples.    Embed Quote
