What are some good "beginner level" data modeling/analytics approaches to kick start a data science/analytics team?
ATA It sounds like you have medium-sized data, good understanding of it, and pretty good data engineering and stats knowledge. That's great, so you can skip past all of the getting your data online and learning the tools. I'd encourage you to next identify an investigative analytics use case. That is, rather than productionize something, focus on refining a model of something that would result in an insight or change you can describe to people. Yes, churn prediction might be a good quick win. It is not necessarily a big-data problem since the training examples are relatively few and coarse. You can probably look at per-user, per-day behavior and do well, and there's not that many. That's good because you can throw R or scikit at the problem. Next I would identify an offline operational analytics problems to solve. Put the static churn model you computed into production, query it at runtime to intervene with an offer or help for "high risk" users. Measure the effect.  Consider implementing a multivariate testing framework or product so you can run experiments and check the effect on behavior after the fact. Last I'd look to implement a real-time operational analytics problem, like a recommender system. That's the canonical example. That's more complex from an engineering perspective for sure.    Embed Quote
