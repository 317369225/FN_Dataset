How do I use clustering to segment customers?
I will try a lower-resolution answer than Alan's. To segment customers using clustering, you need to: a. Represent each customer as a feature vector - a vector of real numbers. b. Run a clustering algorithm. c. Get the assignment of each customer to a cluster. d. Look at each cluster separately - as a possible customer segment. Part a is described in Owen et al.'s "Mahout in Action" in the free sample chapter 8: http://www.manning.com/owen/MiA_... Apache Mahout is another option for clustering a large data set: http://www.ibm.com/developerwork... You can also cluster using Weka, as in this paper: http://www.ibm.com/developerwork... Or you can cluster using one of these: http://www.junauza.com/2010/11/f...    Embed Quote
