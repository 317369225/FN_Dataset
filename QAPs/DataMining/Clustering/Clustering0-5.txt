★What are the use cases for Amazon GPU Cluster?
1) Financial Analysis -  I heard Thomson Reuters is experimenting with it. 2) Video Analysis - GPUs are very suitable for image processing applications. 3) Graphics rendering 4) There are some companies (eg. ParStream) experimenting with using GPUs to offload some computations behind a database. 5) HPC Workloads. GPUs are widely used for dense matrix computations 6) Image processing. Adobe Photo shop uses the GPU. Offline photo processing could leverage it 7) Medical imaging. This follows from (6) but it is become an increasingly widespread field. GPUs are used for processing images from CT scans and CAT scans from 64-Slicers. I think it'd be interesting to see if there are some new ways to leverage GPUs for some big data applications with the actual CUDA kernel and associated tasks like copying data between main memory and GPU memory abstracted out by some library.    Embed Quote Updated 8 Jun, 2011. 909 views.
