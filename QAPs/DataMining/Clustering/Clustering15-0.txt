Are there any clustering algorithms for tagged data?
Some time ago we approached a similar problem by building a graph: nodes represented the tags, edges represented the data instances. The spectral clustering algorithm was used to group the tags. The problem may be stated in your way as well: let the graph nodes represent data instances, while the edges represent tags.
