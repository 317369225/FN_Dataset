What is the difference between Clustering and Classification in Machine Learning?
Classification is supervised learning technique used to assign per-defined tag to instance on the basis of features. So classification algorithm requires training data. Classification model is created from training data, then classification  model is used to classify new instances.   Clustering is unsupervised technique used to group similar instances on the basis of features. Clustering does not require training data. Clustering does not assign per-defined label to each and every group.    Embed Quote
