★What is the state of the art in monitoring Hadoop clusters?
We do all of our monitoring/alerting via some very smart Nagios plug-ins that we wrote.  I think I've got an answer elsewhere that talks about what we actually check for.  [It is likely due for an update.] I think it is worthwhile pointing out that using vendor specific tools has some specific risks, including vendor lock-in and having one-offs that potentially increase operational friction.  Using different tools for different sets of services is a dangerous direction to head and should be done with caution.    Embed Quote Updated 9 Mar, 2012. 945 views.
