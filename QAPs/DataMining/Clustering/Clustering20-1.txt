Can PCA be used for graph clustering or community mining?
This leads into spectral clustering in general which is grand and wonderful, but it can be demonically difficult to phrase some of those algorithms in ways that preserves the sparsity of the original data. Most social and community data is both inherently sparse as well as practically constrained to be sparse.  If sparsity is taken as meaning that the average number of non-zeroes per row is small, then lots of algorithms can be stated in ways that are linear in the number of observations which is a key requirement for scalability. Once you blow that constraint, however, even just storing the data is no longer feasible at scale and it is seriously game over. For small graphs, graph cut is a very useful concept and since you can restate lots of flow problems in terms of eigen-decompositions, you immediately come to spectral clustering.  Spectral clustering is essentially just what you say ... cluster the PCA. One additional wrinkle that is often used is to restate the graph's matrix in some way according to proximity instead of distance.  This is a lot like using a transition matrix instead of distance matrix.    Embed Quote
