What are the best open source tools for unsupervised clustering of text documents?
From all above answers, the most suitable was Yura Koroliov one. Gensim is most about transformation and topic modeling, which are located in unsupervised learning domain, but they are not cluster methods. NLTK has cluster method - cluster_vectorspace, but there is no implementation in the method body (only assertError). I don't see on gate pages nothing about clustering. Graphlab has only kmeans, similar situation is with sofia-ml.   Both Cluto and lingpipe are not open source. The winner is Carrot2 (that is used by Solr), which is the only open source cluster engine, however on Carrot2 FAQ they recomend Apache Mahout to large text collections. The questions are: 1. what cluster algorithm should we use ? 2. what kind of data, shoud we use - tf-idf, lsi, lda ? 3. Gensim, Mallet and few others are topic modeling tools - can we use first n topics to do clusterization ?    Embed Quote
