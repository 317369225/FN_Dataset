★What are the use cases for Amazon GPU Cluster?
GPUs are particularly interesting to compute some machine learning algorithms that are very data parallel such as deep learning algorithms (deep convolutional neural networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, or stacked denoising autoencoders for instance). Implementing such algorithms can be done quite easily with theano [1]: a python mathematical expression optimizer that can compile generic machine learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent to CUDA (or C) source code that is then executed on the GPU (or the CPU) using the CUDA runtime while keeping the seamless python / numpy integration for input / output.
