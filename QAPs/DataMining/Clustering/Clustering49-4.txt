What are the best command-line tools for managing a small Linux cluster?
A new tool to check out, a bit different than the multi-connection SSH type stuff, is Blueprint. Dead simple configuration management and reusable server configs. Blueprint I/O, a complimentary tool, can be used to move configuration files between servers. Hope this helps. https://github.com/devstructure/...
