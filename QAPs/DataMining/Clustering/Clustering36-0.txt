Which is better: Redis cluster or Cassandra?
There are some great benefits of using Cassandra as it is an Apache product and has support for HiveQL (SQL like syntax). Cassandra is columner/tabular oriented database (goes well with the historical RDBMS) and is AP in the CAP analysis. As is mentioned in the following table, when you are writing more than you read, Cassandra is great. It is good for banking and financial industry where you are writing more than you are reading (not necessary for transaction data but other details). Redis is really fast compared to Cassandra as it has disk-backed in memory database. Unlike Cassandra where all the nodes are similar, it has master slave architecture (in line with Hadoop architecture). It is CP in the CAP theorem and is a key-value based database system. It is great to use when you have the rapid changing data and have approx. data size estimate (which can fit in memory). It is good for analytics and real-time data communication. For more detail please visit: Difference between Cassandra and Redis. Which one to use? Coming to your question specifically - 1) You have key-value relationship - Redis wins 2)  Read is more than write - neutral 3) Fault tolerance - Cassandra scores over redis (but not much) 4) Persistence of session data - Redis wins In your scenario, I think Redis is a better solution compared to cassandra. Cassandra is columner database which would not go well with your Key-value relationship (I know you can design table to suit the tabular form but if inherently your data is key-value form, its better to go with Redis). Secondly, you are going to do lot of read/write with the data in the session... meaning consistency is very important for you. As far as fault tolerance is concerned, I think you can replicate the data in redis (master slave architecture as in hadoop). I hope it helps.    Embed Quote
