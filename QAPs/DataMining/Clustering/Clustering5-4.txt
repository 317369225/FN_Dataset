What are the most practical ways to select the "right" number of clusters?
You can inspect various things, like distortion (how far do your points end up from their cluster centers) for the whole dataset, distortion for each cluster, how many points belong to each cluster. If you're getting really low distortion but some of your clusters are fitting relatively few points, you're likely over fitting. If all of your clusters have low distortion except for one cluster which has many more points and high distortion, you probably can break that cluster apart. All in all, what you really care about is the performance on your final task. I am guessing clustering is an intermediate step for you. In that case, you should complete the pipeline and see how your final outcome changes as you vary the number of clusters.    Embed Quote
