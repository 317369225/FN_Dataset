What is an intuitive explanation of Dirichlet Process Clustering?
One of the best tutorial on this matter has been written by Maya Gupta and her coauthors Page on Mayagupta which also included patiently answering my (silly) questions. Let me attempt something based on my understanding and hopefully it should help you too :) 1)Difference between Dirichet Process and Dirichlet Distribution ? Dirichlet Distribution:- To make it simple Dirichlet Distribution is a distribution on probability distributions. Let us say is distributed according to Dirichlet, if the density function , where i.e is a positive real number, and S is the probability simplex which is . I am adding two figures from the density plots similar to Maya Gupta tutorial (Fig 1 c) and d)) Diric Dirichlet Process Dirichlet Process (DP) is a distribution over probability distributions. As in the tutorial points out the Dirichlet distribution is limited that you have finite set of events, and the Dirichlet Process lets you work on infinite set of events. Let us assume a probability distribution G over a measurable space and a DP is a distribution over such distributions. In the tutorial [1] (Section 3.3) the authors show that the DP becomes a DD for any finite sample space. The DP has two important parameters:- 1)Base distribution and 2) A concentration parameter. 2)How Poly's Url or Stick Breaking emphasis Dirichlet Process Polya's urn scheme is a way to generate samples from a DP (section 5.1 [1]) Assuming and what is the posterior distribution of a new item i.e . The physical analogy is that :- 1)start with no balls in urn 2) With prob , draw and add the color to the urn 3)With prob , pick a ball at random from the urn ,record and its color, return the ball in the urn and place a second ball with the same color. This is also a way of realizing the "rich gets richer property" [1] has an excellent summary in Tab;e 3. I have missed many technical stuff and [1] covers most of the stuff. You should also follow some well written notes here [2],[3],[4]. Finally it does help if you play around with some basic MATLAB/Python/R (i particularly played with MATLAB/Python) codes to simulate them.
