What are the most practical ways to select the "right" number of clusters?
Mutual Information MI (or Adjusted Mutual Information AMI) could be a good way to identify the right number of clusters. Here are some details : definition : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mut... MI and AMI : http://128.101.10.22/~iwen/REU/10.pdf Let's say you have N training examples and you want to try your kmeans algorithm for 1..10 clusters with 20 iterations for each cluster (in order to avoid local optimas). A way to evaluate the "stability" of your clustering is to measure the Mutual Information between the 20 clustering for a given number of clusters K (you measure it pair by pair). the number of clusters with the  highest MI should be the "right" one. Data visualization (evaluating clusters on the 2 first principal components plan) or the elbow method can be other ways to proceed.    Embed Quote
