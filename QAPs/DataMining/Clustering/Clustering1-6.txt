★What is the state of the art in monitoring Hadoop clusters?
Both Hortonworks and Cloudera have extremely rich experience in administration of Hadoop clusters, and both are in a position to build an offering that is really useful  in monitoring Hadoop clusters.   When we were looking for Hadoop monitoring solution in early 2012, Ambari was a dead project.   The free edition of Cloudera Manager was of little utility without the support of service monitoring. Ask your Hadoop admin. This is like a free software strategy where Cloudera is building/promoting a good chargeable product, and giving a crappy subset away for free.   So we decided to build one on our own. After having the first version last month (Feb'13), and seeing that Ambari has been revived, we are relooking at our strategy if we want to reinvent the wheel, given that there is a good open-source alternative.   Given the progress made in a less then a year, I would place my bets on Ambari. It however needs lot more work, and I am sure Hortonworks is continuing their focus on Ambari.   Ambari however needs a more diverse group of committers, currently mostly Hortonworks employees.   The enterprise version of Cloudera Manager however looks awesome, from the demo videos that I have seen. The health tests that they add based on their experience/knowledge is what is most helpful for a Hadoop admin, in my opinion.    Embed Quote Updated 9 May, 2013. 502 views.
