★What is the state of the art in monitoring Hadoop clusters?
Apache Ambari: http://incubator.apache.org/ambari/ Ambari relies on open technologies (Ganglia, Nagios, Puppet) and, equally importantly, has features specific to monitoring/debugging to MapReduce, Pig, Hive applications etc. which you won't find in any other option - commercial or not. For e.g. it has built-in support for understanding/debugging Pig/Hive similar to Twitter Ambrose (https://github.com/twitter/ambrose). It then goes further to allow for performance analytics for individual MapReduce jobs too. Finally, it's free, open-source and community driven and has none of the vendor lock-in issues one would face with a proprietary solution. Given it's open nature, Ambari has also been integrated into other solutions like Teradata ViewPoint and similar other products.    Embed Quote
