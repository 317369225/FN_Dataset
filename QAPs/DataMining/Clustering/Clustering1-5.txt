★What is the state of the art in monitoring Hadoop clusters?
Ask your administrators if they have capacity to absorb yet another management and monitoring tool. My hunch is, they will say NO. Then take a look at all these Hadoop-specific m&m tools, and ask the vendors if they will be able to get absorbed into your existing tools. My experience is that, they tell the users: if you use our manager, you have to use our monitor. (Or as Arun has stated above, our partner's monitor.) We recently clinched a deal at a large financial services user, which had their own management and monitoring systems.(of course, who doesn't?) it was a days'  worth of time to hook up our m&m system to theirs. We do not demand that customers' system be "open", or that you *have to install* with our system to monitor with our system. In a curiously open definition of open, we give more choices, and therefore more openness.    Embed Quote
