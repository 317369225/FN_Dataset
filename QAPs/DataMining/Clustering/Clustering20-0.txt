Can PCA be used for graph clustering or community mining?
PCA is the eigen-decomposition of a positive semi-definite covariance matrix, while spectral clustering relates to eigen-decompositions of either graph laplacians or some other map defined on graph structure. The adjacency matrices of graph structures are not positive definite, which is why you don't explicitly encounter PCA in graph clustering. However the Laplacian matrix is. The spectrum of an operator/matrix is given by the eigenvalues. So if your interest is in eigen-decompositions, your best bet is to study the literature for spectral clustering in graphs. There are many different types of graph clustering beyond spectral clustering. This Bach-Jordan paper gives you a great overview of spectral clustering i.e. clustering based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph laplacian. http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2388... Community detection (as in modularity maximization) is nothing but glorified spectral clustering with a correction term.    Embed Quote
