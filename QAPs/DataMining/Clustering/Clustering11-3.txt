What are the best open source tools for unsupervised clustering of text documents?
Python GenSim: http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/   This is a serious implementation for large scale text  clustering and topic discovery.  It runs on shared memory and distributed architectures, and includes both hooks into ARPACK (old school, distributed, parallel Fortran SVD code) as well as their own high performance clustering implementation.   If you known some python, it is very easy to use. GraphLab:  http://graphlab.org/ Not Python specific.  I use this when I code ruby. Includes parallel LDA and a topic modelling toolkit as well as some other clustering algorithms, optimize for large memory, multi-core machines. (and I think distributed, although I have not run it this way myself).  Not specifically for text.  It is a command line program, similar to the famous LibSVM program.  It is relatively easy to build (compared to SciPy), and  takes a 'similar' input.  Used in the Netflix challenge.    Embed Quote Updated 19 Jul, 2012. 1,801 views.
