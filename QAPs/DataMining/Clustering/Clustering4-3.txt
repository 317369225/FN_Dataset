What is an intuitive explanation of Dirichlet Process Clustering?
My answer: I dont know. I  tried this in past. but I knew I didnot know too many thing. I though I  would come back when I am mature enough(never came back). Time has almost come. In past I  wanted the big picture of bayesian framework. I felt I am missing on  too much. Then after sometime I started understanding that bayesian  framework is easy and hard at the same time. I read about bayesian  framework and inference and graphical models(even approximate  inference). Read about GP. after which comes DP. You should first read  about finite mixture models. Now I dont know about DP but in finite  mixture model Dirichilet Dist to DP makes it infinite mixture model. P.S. i learn by myself, didnot take any formal course on the same. u  need to understand Gaussian Process, chinese restraunt process, need to  believe that you can generate data from a distribution(can you really  generate it with an algorithm?? sampling based approximations MC  methods). I recommend you to  understand LDA(latent dirichilet  allocation) which uses dirichilet distribution. If you replace DD with  DP you have infinite topics. What would make you comfortable and mature? Sampling from any distribution(forward,rejection,exact,gibbs,MCMC,hamiltonian). Approximate inference(sampling and variational) Graphical Models Gaussian Process At an abstract setting, you can generate functions from a distribution over functions chinese restraunt process markov chains(is it obvious to sample from transition operator over discrete states?)latent dirichilet  allocation now it will be natural/obvious and easy to read for you. CRP-> Dirichilet process-> DP clustering. I am not answering the question as I dont have an answer. Hope it helps. P.P.S. this is not a path to DP, its a path to get mature. It took me more than 6 months to get an idea of the listed topics algorithmically.    Embed Quote Updated 3 Oct, 2013. 1,522 views.
