Are there any cloud-based APIs for clustering Tweets?
I think you can use Query Classification API | Mashape .  According to their API description: This API can be used to find the topic of a keyword query. The topic for the query will be chosen from over 1500 predefined topics. This works best with query phrases like - "Star Wars", "Dell Inspiron 1420 price" This technology has been provided by Query Dynamics LLC (http://www.querydynamics.com). This technology is being used to categorize tweets at a website called TweetDynamics (Tweet Map and Tweet Directory containing Tweet Topics) To get the class for the query "Star Wars" submit a GET request to - Page on Tweetdynamics The following JSON code will be returned: {"Answer": sci-fi movie} The category of the query is within the by the Answer tag. Some of the uses of this api are to create tools for online query analysis and offline query log analysis.    Embed Quote
