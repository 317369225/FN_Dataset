What is the difference between Clustering and Classification in Machine Learning?
Both classification and clustering split data into groups. With classification the groups (or classes) are specified before hand, with each training data instance belonging to a particular class. It is the association between the instances features and the class they belong to that classification algorithms are supposed to learn. An example of use would be an insurance company trying to assign customers into high risk and low risk categories. With clustering the groups (or clusters) are based on the similarities of data instances to each other. No predefined output class is used in training and the clustering algorithm is supposed to learn the grouping. An example of use would be an online movie company recommending you a movie because other customers who had made similar movie choices as you in the past (i,e. the cluster you fall in) have favorably rated that movie.    Embed Quote
