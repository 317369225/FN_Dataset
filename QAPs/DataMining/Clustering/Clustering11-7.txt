What are the best open source tools for unsupervised clustering of text documents?
Carrot2 is a search snippets clustering engine which can be used to cluster documents into different content-based categories. One can visualize the clusters, and the clusters are automatically labelled too. It also provides REST-ful API's which can be easily used once the clustering engine is running. Currently it supports 2 algorithms (in the open-source version), which are Lingo and Suffix Tree Clustering (STC). It should be able to deal with a modest sized collection of documents which are no larger than a few paragraphs, but if you have to deal with more data, then the Carrot2 page recommends checking out the Mahout page too.    Embed Quote
