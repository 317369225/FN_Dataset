When does redis cluster version release?
Disclosure: I'c Co-Founder and CTO of Garantia Data the company behind the Redis Cloud service. To my knowledge, Redis Cluster will release sometime during 2013. See the latest specs - Redis cluster Specification (work in progress). According to the current spec, the cluster will offer live reconfiguration, fault tolerance and pub/sub. However, it is noted in the spec that "Commands performing complex multi key operations like Set type unions or intersections are not implemented, and in general all the operations where in theory keys are not available in the same node are not implemented." I should mention that at Garantia Data we provide a commercial Redis as a service solution (with a free tier for up to 20MB of data), which includes a working cluster feature - Redis Cluster | Redis Cloud. We support all Redis commands and have made a big effort to simplify cluster operations such as scaling, resharding, replication, working with existing clients, working with smart clients, etc. Nevertheless I'm sure the official Redis Cluster will be a good solution for most use cases and I look forward to seeing the release.    Embed Quote
