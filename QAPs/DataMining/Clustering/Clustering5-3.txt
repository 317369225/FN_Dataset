What are the most practical ways to select the "right" number of clusters?
You can look at within groups sum of squares if you are doing k-means clustering.  You can compute the sum of squares for several different cluster counts, and then plot them.  This will show you the error associated with various cluster counts.  Now is where it gets tricky...too many clusters will likely be overfitting, and will not add any real value.  You have to look at the plot and judge where the optimal sum of squares vs cluster count lies.  Often, you will see a plot with steadily decreasing sum of squares, and then a huge drop.  The optimal number of clusters is sometimes around that drop. You can find good code to accomplish this at  http://www.statmethods.net/advst..., under the Partitioning section under the "Determine number of clusters" comment.  The code is pasted below: # Determine number of clusters     wss <- (nrow(mydata)-1)*sum(apply(mydata,2,var))     for (i in 2:15) wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(mydata, centers=i)$withinss)  plot(1:15, wss, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters",ylab="Within groups sum of squares") If you have to do this on an automated basis, you can use the cluster count that comes before the biggest percentage drop in the within groups sum of squares.    Embed Quote
