★What are the use cases for Amazon GPU Cluster?
Two great use cases in my field (computation biophysics) are running molecular dynamics simulations, which involve simulting the dynamics of proteins or other biomolecules with basically newtonian physics and a discrete time integrator; and high throughput docking studies, which involve some physics-based and statistical analyses of how well potential drugs would bind to proteins. In the first case, the problem simply requires a lot of integration timesteps, and GPUs can be used to accelerate the simulations significantly. In the second case, the problems are typically highly parallel. A drug company may want to "virtually screen" many many thousands of candidate molecules, and so the ability to effortlessly scale out on EC2 is a win. For example, a firm called cycle used EC2 to set up a 50,000 core "virtual cluster" to screen drugs for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [1]. I don't think this specific application was using the GPUs, but you get the idea. [1] http://www.theregister.co.uk/201...    Embed Quote
