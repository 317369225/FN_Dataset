â˜…What is the state of the art in monitoring Hadoop clusters?
At Cloudera (company), we've put a lot of effort into Cloudera Manager [1]. For clusters of less than 50 nodes, it's free to use, and can be downloaded at [4]. For videos on the log management, event management, and alerting capabilities of Cloudera Manager, see [2]. For videos on the service monitoring capabilities of Cloudera Manager, see [5]. These capabilities are most relevant to your question. For more on the service management and configuration capabilities of Cloudera Manager, which may be of interest to you, see [3].
