★What is the preferable way to choose independent variables for a regression analysis?
I like Jeremy's answer, but I will give an answer that assumes you are interested in explanation. First, avoid stepwise, forward and backward selection: The results will be wrong (parameter estimates biased away from zero, standard errors too small, p values too small etc). Second, try to avoid any automated procedure. If you must use one, LASSO and LAR have some nice properties. Third, form several reasonable models and compare using AIC, BIC or something similar. Fourth, use substantive knowledge. Why did you collect data on these variables? There certainly ought to be a reason! Fifth, think of effect size more than significance Fiifth, don't assume that variables that have small effects are unimportant: 1) They might affect the parameter estimates for other variables  2) Finding a small effect where theory predicts a large one is just as interesting as finding a large effect where theory predicts a small one. E.g if you found a population where the difference between male height and female height was very small, that would be huge. Sixth, do lots of plotting.    Embed Quote
