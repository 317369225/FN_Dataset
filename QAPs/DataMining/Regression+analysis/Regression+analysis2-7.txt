★How would linear regression be described and explained in layman's terms?
Linear regression and  Anova are same model, the same information, but presented in different ways.  [1] In the ANOVA, the categorical variable is effect coded, which means that each category’s mean is compared to the grand mean. In the regression, the categorical variable is dummy coded(creates two boolean variables), which means that each category’s intercept is compared to the reference group’s intercept.   Take,for example, a  model with a single categorical independent variable, high school project allocation category, with 3 categories: math, biology and hindi.  The dependent variable is total number of  lectures+labs+tuts attended  during  year, in hours . Since the intercept is defined as the mean value when all other predictors = 0, and there are no other predictors, the three intercepts are just means. Hence both Linear regression and Anova give same result for F & P. The intercept is simply the mean of one of the  reference group.  The coefficients for the other two groups are the differences in the mean between the reference group and the other groups. So an ANOVA reports each mean and a p-value that says at least two are significantly different.  A regression reports only one mean(as an intercept), and the differences between that one and all other means, but the p-values evaluate those specific comparisons.
