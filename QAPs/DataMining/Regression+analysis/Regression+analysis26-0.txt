★Is it advisable to always include time as a variable in multiple regression analysis in order to avoid autocorrelation?My textbook notes that autocorrelation can be treated by including an independent variable that has a time-ordered effect on the dependent variable. What if I just always include time as an independent variable when dealing with time series?
Putting time in the model says that, beneath whatever else is going on, there is a global linear trend up or down in the data. It may be helpful or not to assume this.  You can easily imagine data which has no overall trend but which has other interesting time structure: seasonality, day-of-week effects, and so on. So no, throwing time in as a variable is not always a good idea.    Embed Quote
