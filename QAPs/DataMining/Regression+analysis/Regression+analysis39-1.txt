★Low R Square of Regression Analysis in Cross Sectional Study and the reference to it significance? Please help!I am writing a research paper where my data type is cross sectional. The regression analysis show Adjusted R Square = 14.4%. I have heard that it's fine to have a low R Square value in cross sectional studies. However, I need a reference to this from a published paper or book. Can any help me with this? Thanks!
From the 10 minutes I've spent looking into this, I think you need to remember what represents and why it's okay to have a low for your study. Which means it's looking at the size of the residuals for estimating the error in your model. If you look at this paper, Page on yale.edu (pg20 in the comments), it discusses the implications of the residuals in this model type. Hopefully this helps, but I'm not an expert on this.    Embed Quote
