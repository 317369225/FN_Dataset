★Can we use regression analysis to find Newton's Law of Gravity equation?
You only really need regression in the presence of substantial uncertainty or natural variation.  If your measurements are precise this is just a curve selection exercise, you should find a curve that fits precisely.   Some software has routines to automatically select models that include logs and power transforms of predictor variables (eg the fracpoly routine in Stata).  I'm a bit unclear of what data you would collect but that might do it.   That's not to say Regression 101 could replace Newton; concieving the experiment, figuring out which data to collect, creating the instruments and interpreting the findings would be the hard part.    Embed Quote
