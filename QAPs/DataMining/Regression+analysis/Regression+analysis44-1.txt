★What are the most common mistakes that scientists make in regression analysis when they publish their results?e.g. epidemiologists, biologists, atmospheric scientists. what are the most common mistakes they make?
Take a grain of salt with this one because I haven't had a ton of econometrics, but as a beginner I should be uniquely qualified to cover beginner's mistakes. The most common mistakes that people seem to make when using regression analysis are specification error, running a large amount of regressions, and making decisions based exclusively on goodness-of-fit. Specification error is a fairly big deal, so I'm going to start with that one. When performing econometric regressions, you are expected to justify each independent variable you include in your regression. You should have a theoretical justification of a causal relationship before you regress with any given variable. Which leads me to my second common error: don't run more than the absolute minimum amount of regressions you can, unless you've got a second set of data independent from the first set. Running a ton of regressions on a single set optimizes your regression to fit well for that set. Which is great unless you, y'know, want to predict something or solve some kind of...problem. However, if you run a ton of regressions searching for the best fit over a single dataset and then compare its predictive value across multiple datasets and it works, you should feel very good about yourself, because you've used robust statistics to make your result better. Don't make decisions based exclusively on goodness-of-fit because variance from the predicted value has an underlying random distribution associated with it, so if you make decisions, again, based on the specific data you're observing, you will, again, lose a lot of predictive power when you move to another dataset.    Embed Quote
