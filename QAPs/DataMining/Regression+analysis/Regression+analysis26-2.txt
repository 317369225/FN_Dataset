★Is it advisable to always include time as a variable in multiple regression analysis in order to avoid autocorrelation?My textbook notes that autocorrelation can be treated by including an independent variable that has a time-ordered effect on the dependent variable. What if I just always include time as an independent variable when dealing with time series?
Autocorrelation is very different from dependence on time. In fact you can construct a series which is highly correlated but is completely stationary (i.e. has no dependence on time). This is a simple example: where and all are independent of . For we observe autocorrelation, but the series is stationary and all are normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation 1. So, you cannot capture the autocorrelation by regressing over time. However, if you define the lag operator as , then in the regression model , with enough data you will find significant. For example in the degenerate case , we have for all . Maximum autocorrelation, but is independent of for any arbitrary function    Embed Quote
