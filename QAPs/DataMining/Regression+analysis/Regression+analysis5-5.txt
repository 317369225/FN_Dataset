★In regression analysis, how does one decide what regression line is most appropriate?For instance: when analyzing a particular data set, a linear regression model produces an R² of 0.9567, while a 4th order polynomial produces an R² of 0.9923. Is it overkill to use the polynomial in this case? Given that the linear is still fairly accurate according to R².
Looking at those values, it is likely that not only would the polynomial be overkill, your model is overfit to begin with. 4th-order polynomials should rarely be used, and only if you have extensively cross-validated.    Embed Quote
