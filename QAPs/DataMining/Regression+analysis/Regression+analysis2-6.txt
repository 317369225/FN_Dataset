★How would linear regression be described and explained in layman's terms?
In the most layman terms, regression in general is to predict the outcome in the best possible way given the past data and its corresponding past outcomes. To explain a bit of jargons used in the field, consider this: When you try to kill a mosquito with your hand, what do you exactly do? Lets see this step by step: 1. Observe the mosquito for a while -> this is nothing but collecting the data for regression, so the data here is the time and position of the mosquito. 2. Get your hand close to the mosquito and hit it. This has three outcomes:   a. You caught the poor guy right in the center of your palm, you are happy because you could read this path -> translates to the fact that your prediction was great, in other words a good model   b. You merely caught the smart guy around the sides of your palm or maybe missed out -> translates to a decent model. Please note that here the area of your palm is the Confidence-Interval of your model. Though you did hit the mosquito but yet the error in your prediction was still there.   c. The bastard escapes  now though this clearly means that your prediction was bad; you would now run after it once again and maybe snap out and try to grab him out simply at its current position, this is basically overfitting of your data; or you would once again calmly study the movement and try again -> building a new model. For the sake of simplicity I used only a single outcome, but the goodness of a model is judged on multiple predictions. Other important concepts, theories and various techniques in regression can be build upon this example as well, but this is decent start.    Embed Quote
