★What is the difference between regression analysis and density estimation?
Density estimation is the attempt to make an estimate by first attempting to match the frequency of data, usually with some windowing technique, to a probability density function. The estimate is then made using the probability of occurrence from the function. While I have never tried this with more than one variable, I see no reason this why one could not do this multidimensional ly. A regression is based on assuming a function between two or more variables and then parameterizing that function using, usually, a least squared error method. If estimates are then made, the are made by evaluating the parametrized function.    Embed Quote
