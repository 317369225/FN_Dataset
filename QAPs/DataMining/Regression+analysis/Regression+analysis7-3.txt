★What are some justifications for removing an outlier from linear regression analysis?
Due to the SQUARES basis (l2 family) that linear regressions are based on, outliers can have an overweighted effect on your estimates. To look at it from the other side, robust regression, which addresses outliers, is based on absolute values (medians, l2 family) and outlier effects get washed out instead of overweighted in that case. From a practical standpoint, outliers also tend to be an effect of mistakes (artefacts) or extreme effects that are not accounted for in your model (e.g. for my type of field work...deer, lightning).    Embed Quote
