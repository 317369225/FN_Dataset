★How would linear regression be described and explained in layman's terms?
All of the answers so far are right, but the visual explanations are all limited to a) Simple linear regression and 2) Linear terms, rather than linear parameters. Linear regression means that the formula is linear in the parameters. You are allowed to square the indpendent variables (or cube them or whatever). Then we can draw a plot like any of the many done here and say: Now, generalize this to a hypercube with a line in p dimensions. Another way is to avoid geometry altogether and say "linear regression is a way of finding a relationship between a single, continuous variable called DV or Y and one or more other variables (continuous or not) called IV or X. Also, many here seem to imply that least squares is a necessary part of linear regression; it is not. Quantile regression is linear; so are severalo robust regression methods, including one that uses the absolute deviation.    Embed Quote
