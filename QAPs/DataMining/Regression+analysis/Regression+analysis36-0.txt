★What are some ways in which Monte Carlo methods can be applied to regression analysis?When would one want apply MC techniques in a regression framework? What advantages does doing so offer?
Why Generally speaking, Monte Carlo Methods (most commonly Markov chain Monte Carlo or MCMC) have "revived" centuries old Bayesian statistics and made formally intractable Bayesian modeling methods more widely available MCMC is a general method that simultaneously solves inference of {p(θ|y), p(θi |y), p(˜y|y)} Only requires evaluation of joint distn., p(y, θ) ∝ p(y|θ)p(θ) up to proportionality, pointwise for any θ ∈ Θ Allows modeller to concentrate on modelling. That is, to use models, p(y, θ), that you believe represent the true dependence structures in the data, rather than those that are simple to computeSource: Page on ox.ac.uk Advantages On a high level, accuracy , intuition and flexibility are the top reasons to leverage. Flexible - you can modify your models as much as you want and still effectively fit them. Reliable. It will never get stuck on a local optimum. Great in pulling out uncertainties of all kinds (e.g. in the form of Prediction Intervals). Even though the MCMC procedure is complicated, the inference based on the posterior distributions is very easy and intuitive.Source: Poisson regression fitted by glm(), maximum likelihood, and MCMC When Frankly, MCMC is hard. Whilst its certainly feasible these days, it's difficult to implement, maintain, debug, and most importantly, to apply correctly. They are extremely well equipped to solve complex (multi dimensional integration) modeling problems, hence it's popularity in physics and hardcore engineering (think fluid dynamics). Be reasonable about leveraging the power of these methods. They are expensive for a reason.    Embed Quote
