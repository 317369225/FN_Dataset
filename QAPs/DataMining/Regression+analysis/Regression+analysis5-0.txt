★In regression analysis, how does one decide what regression line is most appropriate?For instance: when analyzing a particular data set, a linear regression model produces an R² of 0.9567, while a 4th order polynomial produces an R² of 0.9923. Is it overkill to use the polynomial in this case? Given that the linear is still fairly accurate according to R².
If you have to use goodness of fit measures, you should take a look at the adjusted for each model, which is a measure of fit that's penalized for the number of predictors in your model.  It's not perfect, but it's certainly better than the simple . On the other hand, if this is a more practical application, then what you're really interested in is how well your model does at out-of-sample prediction.  In that case you want something like cross-validation to get an estimate of the predictive power.    Embed Quote
