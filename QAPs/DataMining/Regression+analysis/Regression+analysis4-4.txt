★Is regression analysis legitimate for time series data?
The topic is broad as mentioned by Justin, and perhaps you could clarify if you're trying to auto-regress a scalar time series (i.e., regress values at each point in time on previous values in time), or instead to regress a dependent variable over one or more independent variables, all being time series data. Questions of stationarity and heteroscedasticity (unformity of the variance of the error) are among the assumptions to scrutinise, along the lines of your initial questioning of the randomness assumption.    Embed Quote
