★Where can I find data to use for a regression analysis project?I have a statistics project over regression analysis and am having trouble finding large data sets that can be used for regression. I need one response variable and at least 3 or 4 variables that could potentially affect it. My main problem is finding a data set with enough observations (more than 30)
R actually has dozens of built in datasets, which you can see here: The R Datasets Package The popular ggplot2 package also has a few built in.    Embed Quote
