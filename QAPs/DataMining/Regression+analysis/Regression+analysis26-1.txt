★Is it advisable to always include time as a variable in multiple regression analysis in order to avoid autocorrelation?My textbook notes that autocorrelation can be treated by including an independent variable that has a time-ordered effect on the dependent variable. What if I just always include time as an independent variable when dealing with time series?
Putting time in the model won't necessarily help. When you have repeated measures, the data are dependent. They may also be autocorrelated. So, regular ordinary least squares regression is rarely, if ever, going to be correct. Longitudinal analysis can be broken into two types: Time series analysis - Here you  have one (or a few, but usually not a great many) variables measured at a large number of time points (typically hundreds, but at least dozens). You may be interested in the effects of time (e.g. trend, seasonality, etc) and you may also be interested in the effects of particular events in time (e.g. the effect of presidential elections on the Dow Jones). TSA is an entire sub-field of statistics, with many traps for the unwary. If you have multiple series (e.g. unemployment rate and interest rate) things can get even trickier. Repeated measures - Typically you have more variables (as in the usual regression) but you  may have fewer time points (even, in some cases, 2, although 3 or more is considerably better). Interest is in questions similar to regression analysis: How is a dependent variable related to a set of independent variables? Within the latter group there are several methods of analysis - multilevel models, generalized estimating equations and so on.    Embed Quote
