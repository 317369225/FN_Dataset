★What is a good tutorial on lasso regression analysis?
Wow first time I've seen someone ask about Lasso on Quora. I'll present my opinion from more of a theoretical perspective: 1.  Element of Statistical Learning by the creator of Lasso is a great start. 2. Peter Buhlmann's book Statistics for High Dimensional Data devotes pretty much the whole book talking about Lasso (highly recommended). 3. The original paper by Tibshirani, then Adaptive Lasso (by his student Hui Zou), and a good overview of the field A Selective Overview of Variable Selection by Jianqing Fan, another super star in statistics. Good luck, and (adaptive) Lasso is awesome.    Embed Quote
