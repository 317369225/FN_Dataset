★What is the purpose of regression analysis?
In simple words: The purpose of regression analysis is to predict an outcome based on a historical data. This historical data is understood using regression analysis and this understanding helps us build a model which to predict an outcome based on this  regression model. Its helps us predict and that is why it is called predictive analysis model. Example: If i want to predict what type of people buy a wine. I would find data on people who buy wine. Their age, height, financial status, etc. So analyzing this data i can build a model to predict whether a person would buy wine or not. So regression analysis is used to predict the behavior of an dependent variable(people who buy a wine) based on the behavior of a few/large no. of independent variables(age, height, financial status).    Embed Quote
