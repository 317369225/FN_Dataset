★In regression analysis, how does one decide what regression line is most appropriate?For instance: when analyzing a particular data set, a linear regression model produces an R² of 0.9567, while a 4th order polynomial produces an R² of 0.9923. Is it overkill to use the polynomial in this case? Given that the linear is still fairly accurate according to R².
If you're using R I recommend the rlm -- robust linear model. It's in the MASS package. Plot all your data and look for outliers first, trim them off, and eyeball the RLM fit. That's my advice. UPDATE: After reading the other answers and re-reading your question I'll just add a few things: You can't tell "the right answer" from . If you use a higher-order polynomial you will always get better fits, with the warning that it may be overfit. You can guard against overfitting by running models on a random subset of data and see if the model does well on a different subset. (Google cross-validation.) It's critical to know what you're after and what kind of answer is good enough. Read Regressions 101: "Significance" for example that you might want a locally valid response function or to broadly get the direction of a nonlinear function. Trim off decimal places. Unless you're doing statistics on laser-tight experiments, that's false precision. For example you could say 95% versus 99% in your question. Advanced statistics covers your question under the headings of Model Selection, Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, regularisation, penalisation, AIC, BIC, Mallows' Cp, and probably more that I'm forgetting about. It's a large theoretical literature to answer your question in general. You can probably do OK by eyeballing, knowing your data well, and knowing your goals for the analysis.    Embed Quote
