★Is regression analysis legitimate for time series data?
"Time series data" can cover a lot of things.  But the problem isn't so much randomness as independence.  In time series data, the value for the previous time period is (almost always) a good predictor of the value for the current period. If you had data for a number of countries and wanted to see if change in GDP was related to some initial condition of the country, then regression would be OK, I think. But usually when people say "time series data" they don't mean that. For your particular case (34 years of data, taken annually) many time series methods might not work very well - 34 is sort of low for TSA - and, depending on the goal of your  analysis, you might want multilevel models    Embed Quote
