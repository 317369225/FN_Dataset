★When economists talk about regression analysis or running a regression, what are they talking about?
I would like to add a few key details to the other answer: When an economist runs a regression she is attempting to estimate a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. She also assumes that the assumptions of the linear regression model are met. A suitable set of regressors and notions of causality are derived from economic theory. Regression will not tell you about causality, also see: Does simple linear regression imply causation?    Embed Quote
