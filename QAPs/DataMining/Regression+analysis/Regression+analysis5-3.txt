★In regression analysis, how does one decide what regression line is most appropriate?For instance: when analyzing a particular data set, a linear regression model produces an R² of 0.9567, while a 4th order polynomial produces an R² of 0.9923. Is it overkill to use the polynomial in this case? Given that the linear is still fairly accurate according to R².
All things being equal, it is  better to go with a simpler model, rather than a complex one.  In fact, in your case, I would tend to discount the R-Square since they are both very high. In real world problems, you rarely see above 95 pct.  And if you do, it either is spurrious, meaningless, purely academic, or would not hold up over time.    Embed Quote
