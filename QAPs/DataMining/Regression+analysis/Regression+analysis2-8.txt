★How would linear regression be described and explained in layman's terms?
Regression analysis is a statistical technique for estimating the relationships among variables.helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Linear regression is an approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables denoted X. For example, in simple linear regression for modeling data points there is one independent variable: , and two parameters, and . The regression equation being straight line: where being the intercept i.e the value of Yi when Xi is 0 and depicts the rate of change in Yi per unit change in Xi.A simple linear regression model looks like this -    Embed Quote
