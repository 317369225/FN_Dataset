★How would linear regression be described and explained in layman's terms?
ok try this provided you know what an x-y graph looks like with points scattered randomly on it...what we call a scatter plot... regression analysis gives the 'line of best fit' utilizing the maximum number of points (since not all points in a scatter plot can be covered by one single straight line)....so coming back, it gives the 'line of best fit' through the max data points the formula for calculating the best fit line is derived as follows  (i won't list the formula though): first lets understand what an 'error' is....it is the vertical distance (downward or upward) that any data point is away from the 'best fit line'. That is the point lies a certain distance either above or below the line and if you were to draw a line from it to the best fit line, then that distance would be considered the 'error' The sum of all such error points when squared and summed and finally minimized (square, sum and the minimization function being mathematical terms) gives us the equation for the line of best fit.... this in a nutshell is regression analysis but because x and y actually are random variables with a certain distribution each and not fixed values, the actual method to arrive at the above is more complex and best learnt from an introductory regression analysis book... in practical terms, regression analysis helps in future modelling and predictive analysis such that what would happen to the value of y if x were to up or down by so much.    Embed Quote
