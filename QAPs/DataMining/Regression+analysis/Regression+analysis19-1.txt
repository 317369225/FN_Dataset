★Where can I find data to use for a regression analysis project?I have a statistics project over regression analysis and am having trouble finding large data sets that can be used for regression. I need one response variable and at least 3 or 4 variables that could potentially affect it. My main problem is finding a data set with enough observations (more than 30)
My go-to data set for simple regression analysis practice is the general social survey (http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website). It's open to public, hundreds of variables to choose from, and definitely have more than 30 observations.    Embed Quote
