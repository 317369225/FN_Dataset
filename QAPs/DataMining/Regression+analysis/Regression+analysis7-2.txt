★What are some justifications for removing an outlier from linear regression analysis?
It is dangerous to exclude outliers in an automatic manner. I will quote a real world example to justify my claim. NASA launched the Nimbus 7 satellite to record atmospheric information. After several years of observation in 1985, the British Antarctic Survey observed a large decrease in atmospheric ozone over the Antarctic. On further examination of the NASA data, it was found that the data processing program automatically discarded observations that were extremely low and assumed to be mistakes. Thus the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole was delayed several years. Perhaps, if this had been known earlier, the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) phaseout would have been agreed upon earlier and the damage could have been limited. Suppose that you find outliers that cannot reasonably be identified as mistakes, but are viewed as naturally occurring. Rather than exclude these points and then use least squares, it is more efficient and reliable to use robust regression. The preference for robust regression becomes stronger when there are multiple outliers.    Embed Quote
