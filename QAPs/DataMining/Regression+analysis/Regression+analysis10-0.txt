★What is regression analysis, and how is it used?
When you say "regression" you usually mean ordinary least squares linear regression. This relates a single, continuous dependent variable (DV) to one or more independent variables (IV). This can be expanded in various ways: If the DV is binary you get logistic regression If the DV is categorical with multiple levels, then multinomial logistic regression is usual If the DV is categorical and ordinal (that is, the levels have an order) then the usual starting place is ordinal logistic regression. If the DV is a time to event (e.g. time until death) you want some form of survival analysis, the most common of which is Cox proportional hazards regression. If the DV is a count (a non-negative integer) some form of count regression should be used, the most common are Poisson and negative binomial. OLS regression assumes that the errors are independent; one way of relaxing this is a multilevel model. OLS regression also assumes linearity in the parameters; one way of relaxing this is spline regression. OLS also assumes that the residuals are normally distributed (technically, that the errors are normally distributed, but they are estimated by the residuals. One way of relaxing this is quantile regression. Finally (at least for this post) if you have more than one DV, you may want multivariate regression. Regression is probably the most widely used statistical technique, it's used in every scientific field, finance, marketing, economics and so on; it's used by businesses and non-profits and so on as well. Any time you are looking at relationships between sets of variables, some form of regression may be useful    Embed Quote
