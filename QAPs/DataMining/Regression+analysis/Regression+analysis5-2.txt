★In regression analysis, how does one decide what regression line is most appropriate?For instance: when analyzing a particular data set, a linear regression model produces an R² of 0.9567, while a 4th order polynomial produces an R² of 0.9923. Is it overkill to use the polynomial in this case? Given that the linear is still fairly accurate according to R².
Which model is "most appropriate" cannot be answered by  statistics alone. Not only not by not by any statistics alone. You can't even come close to a good answer on the information you show here. What are the vairables? What is your N? What does theory suggest? Why did you  try a 4th order polynomial? In many fields, an would be suspiciously high - it would indicate something fishy. 4 digits is almost certainly too many. For "appropriate" models I suggest looking at Robert Abelson's MAGIC criteria, which I wrote about here Page on statisticalanalysisconsulting.com    Embed Quote
