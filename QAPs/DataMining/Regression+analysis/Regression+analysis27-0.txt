★What are the best online sources for learning statistics, advanced statistics, predictive modelling, regression analysis, and so on?I've been reading through some lectures posted online by a Columbia U professor, but I was wondering if anyone came across something for those looking to refresh on our stats knowledge - closer to the introductory side.
Udacity is offering Introduction to Statistics as an MOOC.  That's probably one of the best places to start.  Coursera has some stats classes as well, but you have to catch them on schedule, which can be a little tricky.    Embed Quote
