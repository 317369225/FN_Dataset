★Is hypothesis testing conducted during regression analysis? If so, what is an example?
The coefficient of every regressor as well as the intercept are tested to see whether they are significantly different from zero. Coefficients, standard errors, t-values and p-values are shown in the screenshot below. The F test is used to identify multiple restrictions to the model and to compare the specification to one with just the intercept.    Embed Quote
