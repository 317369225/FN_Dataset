★What does the "regression" term refer to in "regression analysis"?I've been dabbling in setting up some regression models, and trying to wrap my mind around what exactly is regressing or being regressed.
Regression comes from work done by Francis Galton. Galton noticed that tall fathers tended to have shorter sons (on average), and that short fathers tended to have taller sons (on average). Francis Galton was Charles Darwin's (half) cousin, and thought that perhaps this had something to do with evolution - it's better, for some reason, to be average height. He called this "regression toward mediocrity" - nowadays we say regression toward the mean. (The word mediocrity has changed its meaning. [1]) But Galton ran the analysis backwards - he found that tall sons tended to have (on average) shorter fathers. And short sons tended to have (on average) tall fathers.  He realized that this was not a biological fact, rather it was a mathematical artefact. He realized that any time there are two measures which are not perfectly related, there will be regression to the mean. The weaker the relationship, the more regression there will be.  He wanted a way to quantify how much regression to the mean there was going to be - a way to measure the strength of the relationship, because stronger relationships lead to less regression. This led, in a roundabout way, to correlation (Pearson worked with, and was a great admirer of) Galton. Nowadays we think of correlation and regression analysis as being about describing relationships, but the name has stuck.  The r, which is used to represent correlation, stands for regression. [1] It's not the only work that's used in statistics that's changed it's meaning - significant is another.  But that's another answer.    Embed Quote
