★How would homo/heteroskedasticity affect regression analysis?
A simple approach is to use heteroskedasticity-robust inferences after OLS Estimation, including heteroskedasticity-robust standard error, t-statistic, F-statistics, LM tests,etc. This works whether or not heteroskedasticity is present; If you suspect heteroskedasticity, you can also use hypothesis testing to test for heteroskedasticity (e.g. Breusch-pagan Test, White Test); If you know there is heteroskedasticity, you should use weighted/generalized least squares estimation to correct for heteroskedasticity.    Embed Quote
