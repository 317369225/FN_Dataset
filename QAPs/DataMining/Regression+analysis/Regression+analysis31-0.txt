★How do I explain regression analysis to a child?
Why would you want to explain "Regression Analysis" to a child?? Just, remove the term "Regression Analysis" and say that, if he keeps a monthly chart with attributes: 1)Bad Behavior in a Month 2)Good Behavior in a Month 3)Number of Chocolates/Ice-Cream's given. 4)Number of Time-Outs and Scoldings. and sincerely puts the values in it, every month, then in 6/12 months he'll be able to see trends between the variables(..actions). {Higher (1)->Higher(4)} and {Higher(2)->Higher(3)} Regression Analysis are different techniques that can be applied across variables to get a degree of dependence between them. Ie. how a change in 1 of the variable(..action) effects the other variable.    Embed Quote
