★What is the preferable way to choose independent variables for a regression analysis?
This depends in part on the purpose of your regression analysis.  Are you trying to develop a predictive model, which explains what is likely to happen, or a predictive model is trying to explain the reasons for an that something might have happened? Your strategies will be very different in these different cases. I don't like to punt on a question and refer it elsewhere, but this is a complex question and difficult to answer without more context - Chapter 4 of Harrell's book "Regression Modelling Strategies" contains a pretty good (and long) description of various strategies. However, I can tell you what isn't a good way: stepwise.    Embed Quote
