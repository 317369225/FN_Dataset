★In regression analysis, how does one decide what regression line is most appropriate?For instance: when analyzing a particular data set, a linear regression model produces an R² of 0.9567, while a 4th order polynomial produces an R² of 0.9923. Is it overkill to use the polynomial in this case? Given that the linear is still fairly accurate according to R².
As such, alone cannot be used as a meaningful comparison of models with different numbers of independent variables. an value of means that of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the regression equation. The other is unexplained. The t-statistic for the significance of the slope is essentially a test to determine if the regression model (equation) is usable. If the slope is significantly different than zero, then we can use the regression model to predict the dependent variable for any value of the independent variable.
