★What is the most useful software package to learn for time series forecasting/regression analysis?Starting from scratch and including programming languages.  What software or tool has the most comprehensive application for time series and forecast modeling?  Why?
I recommend using R, together with the zoo, xts, and forecast packages (and other packages if needed). This provides an extremely powerful and versatile environment for time series and forecasting (and it's free!). It gives excellent features for manipulating time series data, fitting time series models (both Bayesian and frequentist), creating forecasts, handling seasonality, performing diagnostics, and making various useful graphical displays. CRAN Task View: Time Series Analysis is a useful overview of time series packages for R, including those that I mentioned already (zoo, xts, and forecast) and many others. There are also several recent time series books that use R extensively, such as Introductory Time Series with R (Use R!): Paul S.P. Cowpertwait, Andrew V. Metcalfe: 9780387886978: Amazon.com: Books, Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples (Springer Texts in Statistics): Robert H. Shumway, David S. Stoffer: 9781461427599: Amazon.com: Books, Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics): Jonathan D. Cryer, Kung-Sik Chan: 9780387759586: Amazon.com: Books, and Forecasting: principles and practice (available free online).    Embed Quote
