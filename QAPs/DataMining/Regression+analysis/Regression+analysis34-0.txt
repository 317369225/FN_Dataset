★How can I do a kind of pre-selection of the best independent variables for a regression analysis?Imagine a dataset with 70 variables. How can automatically choose the best independent variables? When I say automatically, I want to say via algorithm. I think is necessary to execute this before to execution the regression.
I would suggest that you use Principal Component Analysis to find such variables. PCA identifies the right linear combination of the variables which explains most of the variability in the data set. There are packages available on most statistical tools. - Principal component analysis Another popular approach is the stepwise regression procedure. It is a much longer procedure than PCA (I think) because it takes variables one by one and checks whether the contribution of that variable is significant enough to be added in that model. - Stepwise regression To give one answer, I think PCA meets your requirement as it gives orthogonal (uncorrelated) new variables.    Embed Quote
