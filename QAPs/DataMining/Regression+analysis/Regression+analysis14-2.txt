★What is the most useful software package to learn for time series forecasting/regression analysis?Starting from scratch and including programming languages.  What software or tool has the most comprehensive application for time series and forecast modeling?  Why?
I use R for everything now, so I second Joe Blitzstein's recommendation; but back in grad school I used RATS for time series. It's still around -- see estima.com -- so if you want a specialized language for time series this may suit your needs better. The author of RATS, Walter Enders, also wrote a popular graduate textbook on the topic, so this might make a compelling pair.    Embed Quote
