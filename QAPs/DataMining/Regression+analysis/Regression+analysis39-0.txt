★Low R Square of Regression Analysis in Cross Sectional Study and the reference to it significance? Please help!I am writing a research paper where my data type is cross sectional. The regression analysis show Adjusted R Square = 14.4%. I have heard that it's fine to have a low R Square value in cross sectional studies. However, I need a reference to this from a published paper or book. Can any help me with this? Thanks!
R^2 only matters if the goal of your paper is to make predictions. For example, if you want to predict how much it will rain tomorrow, an R^2 of 0.1 means that your model is only able to predict 10% of the variation in daily rain. But in most papers, we aren't concerned with prediction. We're concerned instead about making a statement that one variable affects another. In this case, all we should be looking at is the t-statistic on the variable concerned,. We don't really care how much of the variation we're explaining: the R^2 does not matter. Whether or not the data is cross-sectional is of secondary importance. An example frequently given is the regression of pain felt (y variable) upon being hit in the head with a hammer (x variable). If you're interested in predicting when you would feel pain, this is a terrible model because there are so many other causes of pain besides being hit in the head with a hammer - there is a lot of variation in the y-variable that has nothing to do with the x-variable (low R^2). On the other hand, if you're interested in asking: "Does being hit in the head with a hammer lead to pain?", you would find a highly significant effect (high t-statistic). In the latter case you don't care about the R^2.    Embed Quote
