★Is regression analysis legitimate for time series data?
Time series analysis is based on regression models. What you can't assume with it, generally, is that errors are i.i.d., so you need to deal with that violation of the regression assumptions. The biggest problem with ignoring this is that your inferential statistics will be inaccurate, sometimes wildly so. For instance, if there's AR(1) autocorrelation r, the standard errors need to be corrected by a factor This gets very large when r is at all large. There are a lot of approaches that fix up the standard errors for the presence of autocorrelation. A very simple one would be to use "robust" Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors.    Embed Quote
