★How would homo/heteroskedasticity affect regression analysis?
Heteroskedasticity can take on many forms; for example, is a form of heteroskedasticity where the variance grows as the independent variable grows. There can be plenty of other, more complex types of heteroskedasticity. You can see how the fit is really tight early on, but weakens towards the right. Depending on the form, it will invalidate your confidence intervals/error bars, and make regular inference impossible. Under certain circumstances, you can use heteroskedastic robust t-statistics, but if your errors really are homoskedastic this is not efficient. When your regression satisfies the Gauss-Markov assumptions- which includes homoskedasticity, OLS is BLUE (Gauss–Markov theorem). Otherwise, there are other estimators that are more efficient, and you may want to perform WLS or FGLS. There are a number of tests that others have mentioned to see if there is statistically significant heteroskedasticity- for example, the Breusch-Pagan test. It goes something along the lines of running a regression on the errors as a function of your covariates, and if the regression coefficients in this regression are different from zero, then there is heteroskedasticity. There are more tests, but I don't want to make this answer unreasonably long winded. If you want a book that will teach you more about this kind of stuff, you should pick up Mostly Harmless Econometrics, or if you want the full picture built from the ground up in a textbook, Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach is good.    Embed Quote
