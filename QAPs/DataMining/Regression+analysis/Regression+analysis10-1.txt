★What is regression analysis, and how is it used?
Regression analysis is a statistical method that is used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (this also be extended in many different ways). Regression analysis is most commonly used in forecasting or predicting how a set of conditions will impact an outcome. For example, you had a set of data on high students that told you their GPA, gender, age, and SAT scores, you could build a simple linear regression model where GPA, gender, ethnicity, and age are your dependent variables and SAT scores are your independent variables. Then, once you have the model, and provided it is a good fit, you can use the model to predict what new students will score on the SAT based on the other four variables.    Embed Quote
