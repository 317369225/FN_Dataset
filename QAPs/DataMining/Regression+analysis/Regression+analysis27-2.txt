★What are the best online sources for learning statistics, advanced statistics, predictive modelling, regression analysis, and so on?I've been reading through some lectures posted online by a Columbia U professor, but I was wondering if anyone came across something for those looking to refresh on our stats knowledge - closer to the introductory side.
As Justin Rising said, Coursera have statistics classes and luckily one of them has started less than one week ago. Here's the link: https://www.coursera.org/course/... See if it's in your level and whether you feel you can catch up.    Embed Quote
