★When do I use regression analysis?
Regression analysis is a broad set of tools for analyzing the relationship between one (or, in multivariate regression, more than one)  dependent variable and one or more independent variables. When people say "regression analysis" they often mean ordinary least squares regression, which is appropriate when there is one dependent variable that is continuous and when certain assumptions are met. But there are also count regressions, logistic regression, multinomial logistic, ordinal logistic, quantile, multivariate and other types.    Embed Quote
