★How do you run a regression analysis in Excel with multiple dummy variables?
In Excel, running a linear regression with multiple dummies is the same as if you just had many independent variables. After converting your variables to 0s and 1s, you need to download the Analysis ToolPak to run the regression. This should be under Tools > Data Analysis (or in 2007 it appears on the Data Tab and Analysis Group).  You can find step-by-step advice on how to run the actual regression here (the latter has pictures): http://www.ehow.com/how_5768074_..., or here http://cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu/... Also be weary of results (multicollinearity, etc.) and how you coded the dummies. A lot of people forget to check for such simple things and misinterpret the data as a result. Quick suggestion -- If you're going to be running many of these regressions, please don't use Excel (try out Stata, Matlab, R, etc.). This is not an elitist thing; it's a how-to-stay-sane thing. You'll literally be able to run this much, much faster.    Embed Quote
