★Where can I find data to use for a regression analysis project?I have a statistics project over regression analysis and am having trouble finding large data sets that can be used for regression. I need one response variable and at least 3 or 4 variables that could potentially affect it. My main problem is finding a data set with enough observations (more than 30)
Try UCI Machine Learning Repository: Data Sets (I already ran the query for datasets suitable for regression). And the much wider range in the answers to: Where can I find large datasets open to the public?    Embed Quote
