★Doesn't a moderating term in regression analysis violate the assumption that all terms in the linear model are univariate, normal distributions?A general moderating linear model looks like this:  ~ Assuming  and  are normal random predictors, the moderating term can not be considered normal in general. Doesn't this violate the assumptions of least squares regression?
Adding to Justin Rising 's answer: 1. Regression also doesn't assume that the dependent variable is normally distributed, although it must be continuous or nearly so. 2. The errors are unobservable so they are estimated by the residuals. Various plots of the residuals are part of model checking.    Embed Quote
