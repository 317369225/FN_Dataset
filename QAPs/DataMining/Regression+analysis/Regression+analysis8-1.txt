★What is the advantage of gravity models over regression analysis?Specifically relating to studying cross-border economic effects, e.g. international trade.
Gravity models are specific functional forms that can be estimated with regression models by taking logs of all variables. The general functional form has been reinvented many times in many areas, such as the Bradley-Terry-Luce model for choice data or the Cobb-Douglas production function, which is a slight variation. I'm sure it shows up in other  areas. The real issue is that a linear regression specification is highly unfocused and uninformative in many circumstances. A targeted model with a theoretical rationale will usually beat one out and be much more parsimonious when the theory lines up with reality.    Embed Quote
