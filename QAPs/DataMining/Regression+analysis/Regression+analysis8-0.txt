★What is the advantage of gravity models over regression analysis?Specifically relating to studying cross-border economic effects, e.g. international trade.
Gravity models posit a specific theoretical structure to the variables under consideration, usually in the form: where F_ij is trade flow from country i to j, G is a constant, M_i is the mass of country i, and D_ij is the distance between country i and j. This theoretical structure has certain justifications in the literature, most based on the importance of friction costs between two countries due to the distance between them. This theoretically based and justified model has the advantage of having greater credibility over ad hoc 'reduced form' regression models by explaining HOW these variables interact. Regression models that just throw covariates on the right hand side and run OLS approximate the dependent variable with a linear combination of the covariates. However, there is no reason why a linear combination is superior to a linear combination of the logs of the variables, or the squares, or the nth powers. The theory used to justify the gravity model removes this ambiguity in specifications by imposing a particular functional form.    Embed Quote
