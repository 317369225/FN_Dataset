★When in regression analysis, what does it mean "controlling for X"?
This statement normally means that all important factors were included in the regression. Let's say you want to predict lifespan based on profession. While profession maybe interesting we need to control for diets, habits, exercise, ect from personal choices of individuals within these professions. These must be included in the model and held constant in order to determine the impact only their profession has on the dependent variable (lifespan). If these are not included it is considered  an omitted-variable bias. Source1 http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adv... Source 2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con...    Embed Quote
