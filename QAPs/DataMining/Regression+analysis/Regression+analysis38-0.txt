★Some questions on regression analysis. In the absence of significant correlations between the predictors and outcome variables, can you still proceed to regression analysis?
Yes. First if all 'significance' is defined based on your threshold. There are a ton of problems with p-valued, which is the same problem with significance. Most of it comes down to the fact that the significance level is arbitrary, dependent on the circumstances, and/or dependent on experience (prior knowledge). Two examples: In agriculture, we have noisy data. It's not uncommon to use alphas (for LSDs) of 0.3 or 0.2. This would be ludicrous in other fields. Many of the best predictive models (where the goal is to predict a response) just fit ALL variables with no consideration of variable significance. These regularly outperform models that have undergone variable selection.    Embed Quote
