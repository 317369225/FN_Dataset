★Where can I find data to use for a regression analysis project?I have a statistics project over regression analysis and am having trouble finding large data sets that can be used for regression. I need one response variable and at least 3 or 4 variables that could potentially affect it. My main problem is finding a data set with enough observations (more than 30)
Have you google datasets.xls.??! Try to search some xls files.. You will get the data.... Even if you don't get it then mail me. My mail is kasturems@yahoo.com    Embed Quote
