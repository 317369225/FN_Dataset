★Where can I find data to use for a regression analysis project?I have a statistics project over regression analysis and am having trouble finding large data sets that can be used for regression. I need one response variable and at least 3 or 4 variables that could potentially affect it. My main problem is finding a data set with enough observations (more than 30)
If you don't mind using regression functions more exotic than a*x+b, I really enjoyed working with the Combined Cycle Power Plant data set from the UCI repository that Yuval mentioned. Otherwise it depends on your subjects of interest.    Embed Quote
