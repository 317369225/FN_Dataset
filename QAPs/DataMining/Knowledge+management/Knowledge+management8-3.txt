★What are the best knowledge management software for employees?I'm looking for knowledge managment software for employees. I need solution where I can add user restrictions to some main categories (pages where user can't access). I was trying to use mediawiki but I think it's too complicated for me. Thanks in advance for help!
Senexx is a good example of KM software for employees. It allows you to send instant messages, emails, ask questions in a facebook style interface, and find experts within your company. When you ask a question tags are created which notify the experts in those fields. It is very simple and easy to use. They are currently working on creating groups which would allow you to set restrictions so specific categories. It all runs on a cloud server so there's no installation required.
