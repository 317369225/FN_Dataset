★What are the best knowledge management software for employees?I'm looking for knowledge managment software for employees. I need solution where I can add user restrictions to some main categories (pages where user can't access). I was trying to use mediawiki but I think it's too complicated for me. Thanks in advance for help!
Your choice of KM software must depend on how majority of the knowledge is shared in your organization, and the KM culture among the workforce. What kind of platform are they most comfortable with when it comes to sharing knowledge? Do they prefer writing documents and sharing them? Do you want to have a review workflow before the documents become available for public consumption? If it is primarily document management, you can try out open source solutions like Alfresco (http://www.alfresco.com/) and Drupal (http://drupal.org/). Alfresco also has good collaboration features, and has a support model. Microsoft SharePoint (http://office.microsoft.com/Shar...) is obviously another option here, if you are willing to spend some dollars. They all have good support for the access control mechanism you are looking for. Do you feel the employees might collaborate better by coming together? Foswiki (http://foswiki.org/) is a free wiki software that can give you great control over access restrictions. Again, this is open source too. If people are more comfortable asking questions and getting answers, then you can look at open source forum software such as phpBB (https://www.phpbb.com/) or OSQA (http://www.osqa.net/), the engine that runs StackOverflow and all those StackExchange sites. PhpBB is well known for the easy setting up of access restricted sub-forums. If your workforce can benefit better through enterprise micro-blogging as the main tool for knowledge sharing, then you can have a look at Jive (http://www.jivesoftware.com/), Yammer (https://www.yammer.com/ which has been acquired by Microsoft) and the new kid on the block, Bloomfire (http://www.bloomfire.com/). They all support most avenues of sharing knowledge and expertise, like developing documents and articles through collaboration, sharing videos, and conducting discussions for open queries and documentation purposes.    Embed Quote
