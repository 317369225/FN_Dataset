★What is the best internal knowledge management solution?Hi, I'm seeking advice on different knowledge management systems for a contact centre. It needs to be able to be searched by client, and have the ability for agents to add questions to be answered and add more knowledge. Cloud solution would be ideal?
The solution you are seeking could very well be GoGemba. It's unfortunately not launched yet, but runs in private beta. (You may get an invite though). It will solve the exact needs your have. I suggest that you pay the blog a visit, and perhaps signup to receive news: GoGemba - Knowledge sharing. Simplified. There is also a short sneak peek video available: GoGemba - Sneak Peek    Embed Quote
