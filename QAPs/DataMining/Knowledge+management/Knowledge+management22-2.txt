★How does your development team(s) handle knowledge management?
The folklore answer by Dimiter is pretty funny. But funnies aside, our product Indexedmind - http://indexedmind.com provides a way to capture the "folklore". So, no more talking to 50 people to track down who knows what in your Organization. Finding the people who have knowledge becomes as easy as "Google Instant Search". We are free to use for as long as we stay in Beta. Home: http://indexedmind.com Tour: http://indexedmind.com/home/prod...    Embed Quote
