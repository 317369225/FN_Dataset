★What is the difference between information management and knowledge management?
Purely subjective on my part but I think that information is data and statistics while knowledge is about ideas and thinking.  Information management involves simple mechanical systems and processes for the storage and retrieval of data.  Knowledge management involves complex methods for capturing, evolving and sharing ideas and thoughts in ways that facilitate reshuffling to create opportunities and the possibillities of unexpected connections and new perspectives.    Embed Quote
