★Knowledge Management: What can CEO do to enhance know-how transfer？
You should develop a knowledge transfer culture where the information which is with your senior employee passes on to the Juniors. This you can do for your current projects After retirement you can have your old stalwarts as mentors or advisors to guide the new generation further. The thing is that company has to evolve with time so people come and go, it goes on but if the experience is documented well with analysis as well it will help you. Focus more and more on documentation of all the work done by the senior employees    Embed Quote
