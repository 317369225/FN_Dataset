★Are there some good personal knowledge management tools?
I like John's answer - definitely check out Harold Jarche's website, he just recently wrote a great post on PKM in 34 pieces. Other great experts to follow on Twitter or the Blogosphere are Nick Milton, Brad Abbott, David Gurteen. Here is another great source of information on the top 100 Knowledge Management influencers in the world: 2013 Top 100 Influencers in #KM - Knowledge Management.
