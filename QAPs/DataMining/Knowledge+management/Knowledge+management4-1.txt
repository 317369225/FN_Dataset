★What are the top 5 barriers to Knowledge Management?
KM is a buzz-term and, in the form that it is communicated within consulting businesses and universities, it does not deliver value. Top 5 barriers: KM is an umbrella term which is not clearly defined/understood KM is a term that is vendor driven There is no clear link between KM and the 'bottom line' KM is generally sold as a technology solution KM tools are hard to use for the majority of users What KM really needs is to have business stakeholders gain more of an understanding of the need for it.  I don't think that the problem has been defined clearly enough within the scope of a business context. The role of IT is therefore to educate others in the business about the problem and to be a participant in identifying potential solutions for them. My opinion is that, today, the people who tend push/promote "KM" the most are generally those who stand to gain something financial from it.  E.g. vendors. To be ultimately successful, tools would have to exist which allow all users (not just empowered users) to self serve information.  They would have to structure "knowledge" in such a way so that it was also easily consumed by other tools and machines.    Embed Quote
