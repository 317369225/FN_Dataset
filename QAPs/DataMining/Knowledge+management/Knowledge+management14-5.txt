★What are the best practices in knowledge management for IT Service management (ITSM)?
Deciding to actually engage in knowledge management, regardless of topical area, is a very good starting place. Once that is behind you, there had better be some mapping between what the perceived value of the information is to the organization. Why? 1. It takes time, money and raw effort to capture and manage knowledge throughout its lifecycle. 2. There will be some sort of utility to those in various roles throughout the organization (who) In other words, let's see that we determine what is worth doing and see that for all of the knowledge under management we are able to answer some of the key questions about it: Who - is using it? needs it? What - is it used for? value does it represent? does it take to maintain? cost? When - is it needed? How readily available should it be? Where - is it accessed? can we keep it at a reasonable cost? Why - should we pay attention to this knowledge? These are just a few of the things we need to pay attention to, in order to be successful with our attempts to engage in knowledge management.    Embed Quote
