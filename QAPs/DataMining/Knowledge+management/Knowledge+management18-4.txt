★What are some recommended knowledge management tools for an enterprise?
We at Indexedmind are trying to solve the Knowledge Management problem by adding metadata to the knowledge that Enterprises are already collecting. Traditional wikis and knowledge bases are just a searchable dump of keywords without any context. Anybody who has worked with them long enough will realize that searching such KBs and Wikis is an exercise in futility after a while. Indexedmind doesn't promise to replace all your existing wikis and yammers and sharepoints. We are augmenting what is missing with all these systems. We just help you discover who knows what in your organization. Once you find the right person, things just fall in place effortlessly. Here is a cool example. Organizations document knowledge...let us say a building architect documents the process of constructing a building. 2 years later when you want to repeat it, can you give this documentation to a plumber and expect him to re-create it? Or would you rather find the person who holds the "tacit" and tangible knowledge to do it (even if he is reading his own documentation to refresh his memory)? We are in private beta and invite all Companies to use our product for free in return for constructive feedback. Home: Search your Company's Brain Power !
