You have to choose the tool that fits your needs. Lot of these tools have overlaps with each other but each one has its own core philosophy. Indexedmind (Search your Company's Brain Power !) is a great tool for finding out who knows what in your Company. It is a Project Manager's best friend. Think of it as a LinkedIn + Quora for Companies. You can keep track of people, skills, talent and most importantly knowledge. And everything is searchable at the click of a button. Indexedmind augments your existing systems instead of claiming to replace any one of them. You can store your documentation and wikis in sharepoint and link to them from Indexedmind.
