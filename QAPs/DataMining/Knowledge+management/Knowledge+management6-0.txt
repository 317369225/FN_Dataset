★What is the best internal knowledge management solution?Hi, I'm seeking advice on different knowledge management systems for a contact centre. It needs to be able to be searched by client, and have the ability for agents to add questions to be answered and add more knowledge. Cloud solution would be ideal?
When thinking about implementing a knowledge management solution within your organization, what a company should not do is try and justify hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars of expense in implementing an enterprise-wide product for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of employees for which there is no immediate need or application. That’s a very hard justification to support. What they should do is start small, with an approachable, affordable, scalable tool which then is allowed to grow organically, showing success along the way, and then the justification takes care of itself.    Embed Quote
