★Would Quora be useful for internal knowledge management for companies? Why or why not?Instead of providing a simple wiki or blog for internal knowledge management, a type of Quora application could leverage knowledge based on simple, direct questions. Wikis and blogs rely on pretty much posting random knowledge and guessing that it would be useful to co-workers. This would turn the push communication of classical knowledge management tools into a type of pull communication.
Yes, but I think it would need to work with another back end like a wiki, blog, social network (for instance Ning) or another collaborative platform (Enterprise 2.0, etc..) to aggregate the content in a user friendly manner. Here is my answer to a previous question which speaks to this issue.  There are five distinct advantages for Quora-like Q and A for internal communication : Boundary Spanning:  Organizational communications often falter when it comes to organizational boundaries.  Quora and similar collaborative platforms can solve this communications gap. On-boarding:  New people learning new things or getting upgraded to new positions.  Perhaps with a wiki or blog as the centralizing feature (ie an index or table of contents or FAQ).  This on-boarding process is critical, because it makes or breaks the first 6 months for the employees as well  as the overall hiring process which is pretty expensive. Organizational Learning: Sharing info about product, customer, market, trends, etc..  Its better than email in this regard in that it can serve as an asset over time vs. email which isn't organized in a linear or helpful fashion (even if it is a learning asset) Feedback Loop: It can help identify people who need information as well as those who have information. Virtual Meetings: It can be a way to have meetings which potentially save time.  Or a way to re-crystalize what occurred during a meeting.    Embed Quote
