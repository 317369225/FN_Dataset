★Could Quora be integrated with Yammer to create enterprise knowledge management?
While both Quora and Yammer are promising tools to enhance knowledge sharing I think there is a lot more to enterprise knowledge management than that. Quora looks promising because it can tap into a large diverse network of expertise. If you try to do something similar within the enterprise you would not have the same breadth to draw on, but at the same time you probably need more depth of expertise and exchange that quora seems to offer. Other tools are also needed for effective KM such as communities of practice, documenting and sharing of good practices, content management systems, taxonomy, expertise rosters, peer assists etc.    Embed Quote
