★What is the best way to start a Knowledge Management project?
When thinking about implementing a knowledge management solution within your organization, what a company should not do is try and justify hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars of expense in implementing an enterprise-wide solution for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of employees for which there is no immediate need or application. That’s a very hard justification to support. What they should do is start small, with an approachable, affordable, scalable tool, which then is allowed to grow organically, showing success along the way, and then the justification takes care of itself.    Embed Quote
