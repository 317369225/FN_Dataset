★What is the most all-inclusive internally-focused social media/intranet/collaboration and knowledge management platform on the market today?
In light of full disclosure, I'm director of product marketing at Jive. I also carry the bias that Gil Yehuda suggests we vendors have =o)   That being the case, don't take it from me: you can hear from a bunch of Jive customers that use Jive for their social intranet, social media, collaboration, knowledge management, and more – plus you can try it for yourself – all at jiveon.com. Hope that helps.    Embed Quote
