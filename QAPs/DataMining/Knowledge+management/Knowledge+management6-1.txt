★What is the best internal knowledge management solution?Hi, I'm seeking advice on different knowledge management systems for a contact centre. It needs to be able to be searched by client, and have the ability for agents to add questions to be answered and add more knowledge. Cloud solution would be ideal?
Try Crowdbase, it is a cloud based solution. All knowledge stored in Crowdbase is indexed and can be easily be searched by keyword, question, topic, file and link. We keep all information private and secure of course. You can post questions to your group or directly to an expert within your organization. Anyone of your colleagues in a group can "like" your answers and Admins can control what is the "best answer." With Crowdbase you build your own FAQ database over time as more users contribute. It does not stop there - Prior to joining Crowdbase some clients in contact centres were having to share links or articles by email and they weren't being widely distributed or stored centrally for universal access. With Crowdbase, their users can add, view & share: RSS feeds, track Twitter links and keyword web searches, without ever leaving the Crowdbase window. Everything in Crowdbase can be searched, and you can even add comments or annotations. There are lots of other features including the Crowdbase mobile apps, for easy access on the go. Check out Crowdbase website, it is free for up to five users, and free trials are also available.    Embed Quote
