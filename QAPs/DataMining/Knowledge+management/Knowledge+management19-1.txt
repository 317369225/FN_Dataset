★Who are the thought leaders of knowledge management?
Hi there, I spent most of my career in the learning space. I was the WW readiness manager for all services roles at Microsoft and the head of one of the largest social learning / knowledge sharing programs in the world, called Microsoft Academy with 85,000 unique users. I formed my own company since then. If I can be of any help, let me know. Michael    Embed Quote
