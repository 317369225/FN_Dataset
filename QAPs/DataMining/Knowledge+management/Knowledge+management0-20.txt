★What is knowledge management?
Knowledge Management (KM) knowledge management is a management approach that is portrayed in the business literature as an innovation with the intention to affect the whole of the organisation's business, especially its processes and information systems 'safeguard of infomation' (Coates,2001) . It is the ability to acquire informantion whether useful and not useful and use it effeciently as a knowlegde manager. It  involves having information about something very important and having the ability to keep it private and confidential. For example, those who work in the country's National Security, they have valuable, private information that contains the country's protection system. Moreover, too much information is never good as much as it increases your wisdom. Therefore, knowledge management is essential and required to address such problems.    Embed Quote
