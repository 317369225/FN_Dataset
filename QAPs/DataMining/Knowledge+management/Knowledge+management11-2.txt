★What is the best way to achieve Knowledge Management in the workplace?How to tap and share institutional knowledge?
We have are experimenting with a completely different answer to this problem. Our product - Tallyfy is currently piloting with large companies. Your question was about how to best achieve knowledge management in the workplace. Our view is that process is what work actually is, and knowledge is used within processes to create output. With this in mind, a way to simplify, organise and track a process is also about knowledge. In fact, when people do "checklists on steroids" on Tallyfy, we have a field called "Rationale" for each step, where a manager can explain "why" that step is being done. Beyond immediate knowledge to do the task at hand, our system can link and integrate into other systems, run IFTTT (if this then that) rules, collect information (like the web app Wufoo) and also manage distributed tasks with permissions. In other words, everything you needed a complex BPM for is removed, it just works. Plus it's a knowledge base and a process tracker. We think we are onto something very exciting, judging from the feedback via private demos we're doing - so hope to write more about this merger between KM and work - which are really the same thing.    Embed Quote
