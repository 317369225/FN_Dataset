★What is a good, simple and easy-to-use knowledge management tool that can keep track of business processes?Preferably an online (cloud based) Knownledge Base tool that once can integrate with Basecamp or offers APIs for customization and is small business owner friendly.
I founded http://daPulse.com We've had the same problem of creating good business processes at wix.com On one side We wanted a system that will both allow for unstructured updates - allow people to report, add files and have a discussion on it. On the other side We wanted the system to create a structure - a process everyone will understand - be able to follow and create a knoledge base that is searchable and allows people to discover things. We ended up with a simple system everyone can use - it pushed the right data to the people who want it and It has a great email integration so it super easy to adopt. While simple, it holds huge amounts of information and updates. Processes around weekly reporting, problem solving, customer feedback loops, and project communication has evolved around it. and today it's the backbone of all communication in the company. See how the wix.com usage grew over time - from real data. because you can follow one node and get notified on the whole sub tree, this produces a very organised, simple to follow structure (and it's completely user generated - many flows are created by managers but everyone participate in understanding the company conversation)    Embed Quote
