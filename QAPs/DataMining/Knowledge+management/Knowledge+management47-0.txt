★What are the best knowledge management definitions?
Not sure if this is 'the best' but this is my explanation of how knowledge is managed: Knowledge management has been defined in literature in many different ways that have varied in both scope and focus. Concerning scope, many authors describe it as an organisational competence to preserve or improve performance based on experience and knowledge. In terms of focus, various definitions emphasise organisational procedures and practices, performance development results, networking and collaborating procedures, practices used for storing, protecting and the distribution of knowledge and tools, systems and methods used to store data. Knowledge management consists of two basic, and hopefully interacting, strategies, which are the codification strategy and the personalisation strategy. The codification strategy focuses on the actual codifying of knowledge and storing it in databases from where the knowledge can be accessed. Knowledge in the personalisation strategy is coupled with individuals who develop the knowledge and share it by means of personal interaction.Check out my blog for more on the theory of knowledge management: http://inspiredprocess.quora.com/Understanding-the-Theory-of-Knowledge-Management    Embed Quote
