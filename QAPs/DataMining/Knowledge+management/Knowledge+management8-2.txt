http://dapulse.com - I founded has a super simple hierarchy of topics that lets you manage your information. Along with wiki style notes on each topic - it also has a wall you can create discussions on - making it a super powerful way - not only for a document storage but as a real time conversation that turns to knowledge.    Embed Quote
