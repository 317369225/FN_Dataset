★What are the "must read" books or articles about Knowledge Management?Working on revising an existing course in KM. What do you want potential employees to have read?
Knowledge Management "classics" I'd recommend are "Learning to fly" by Collison and Parcell which is very practical and easy to read. And Working Knowledge by Davenport and Prusak which really kicked this field off. That said KM is a very diverse field and is continually changing so probably the best thing to do would be to read a few good KM blogs on a regular basis. Among my favourites: Knoco stories from Nick Milton - Knoco stories All of us are smarter than any of us... from Chris Collison The Obvious? by Euan Semple conversation matters by Nancy Dixon sense-making for the connected workplace by Harold Jarche E L S U A ~ A KM Blog Thinking Outside The Inbox by Luis Suarez And excellent, but not for the faint of heart: Cognitive Edge Network Blog by Dave Snowden Of course I'll also put in a plug for my own KM blog (but it's nowhere near as good as the ones above!)
