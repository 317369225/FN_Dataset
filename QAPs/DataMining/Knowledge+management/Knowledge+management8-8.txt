★What are the best knowledge management software for employees?I'm looking for knowledge managment software for employees. I need solution where I can add user restrictions to some main categories (pages where user can't access). I was trying to use mediawiki but I think it's too complicated for me. Thanks in advance for help!
Instead of making a solution work, first consider what is it that you want to do? Knowledge Management is a very broad subject encompassing different aspects under its banner. Venkatesh has very neatly suggested different solutions for different needs - so map your requirement to a solution. Access restriction is a feature available in most software nowadays.    Embed Quote
