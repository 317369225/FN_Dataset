★Could Quora be integrated with Yammer to create enterprise knowledge management?
I agree with Ian Thorpe and I kind of disagree all at the same time. While on one hand, KM needs more structure(taxonomy) a lot of KM gets over engineered and then no one participates. Simpler structures like Quora and Yammer encourage participation but still lack the structure. The answer is somewhere in the middle. Tagging helps....IF someone tags the knowledge. A system that could put SOME optional and lite structure around Yammer or Quora would go a long way to help pull the use of these tools closer to a KM solution.    Embed Quote
