★What are the best ways to incentivize people to use "Enterprise 2.0" knowledge management / collaboration tools in an organizaton?Some of the newer "Enterprise 2.0" tools can be very powerful ways to help people share, locate and collaborate around, knowledge in an organization.  But not everyone is interested in using such tools, and some people may even be actively hostile to them.  What are the best ways to encourage their broad utilization?
In enterprise collaboration the 20/80 rules works. Identify and get these 20% people who hold the information (owner of content) to work actively on the platform, and from there other 80% people will follow to discover, comment and share back. Usually the mistake is to focus on everyone together. Like any other enterprise tools, the same need to be driven by key people and adoption will happen. In my opinion, it's not about incentivizing, but doing a successful shift to a new place to work and share - and when people see that movement to a new place, they will follow.    Embed Quote
