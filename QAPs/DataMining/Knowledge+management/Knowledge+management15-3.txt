★What is the difference between information management and knowledge management?
I think knowledge acts as a general toolkit, essential for a healthy business environment. Once you have raw data, it can be structured in a meaningful way in that it becomes information. Information can potentially be more powerful than just knowledge on its own. Information management promotes innovation by improving the innovator’s ability to collaborate with one another and search for relevant information and knowledge.
