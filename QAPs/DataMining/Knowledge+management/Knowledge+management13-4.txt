★What influences adoption and utilization of knowledge management tools?I'm sure the actual rates vary based on the organization and other factors. Insight into what those factors are is appreciated.
Some more thoughts....rephrased to fit into my thought-process. 1. How obvious is its overall need, benefit and value? 2. How has it been positioned, sold and perceived? 3. How much does the leadership promote and rave about it? 4. Who are the role models, what do they use it for and how do they use it? 5. What are the early adopters saying about the specific benefits? (stories) 6. How easy is it to comprehend and use? (technical features, design) 7. Is there no alternative but to use it? (For example: Mandates to provide Lessons Learnt after a project is wound up) 8. What are the consequences of using it or not using it? - Does it make me popular? Does it give me visibility? Does it keep me up-to-date? Does it give me a better chance for promotion? 9. Does it fill a critical gap? - For example, Teams spread across too many time-zones cannot arrange for frequent telephone calls and need to adopt other methods such as workspaces. 10. How much ownership, interest, time and energy do I have to step away from my current - primitive - tools and explore something new and learn to use it?    Embed Quote
