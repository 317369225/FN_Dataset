Knowen.org is a web-based wiki-style software that was designed with scientists in minds, but may be of more general use. The main feature is that it promotes building knowledge hierarchies, which can be easily extended and rewired. There is also a set of convenient collaboration tools - tracking nodes and trees, commenting, voting, ratings. You can have public kb or a private trees only visible to the collaborators you invite. The service is free and will remain free for personal use indefinitely.    Embed Quote
