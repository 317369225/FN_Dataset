★What is the best way to start a Knowledge Management project?
Identify what type of knowledge you will start with. Identify who your core initial contributors will be. Identify a standard of quality. This is just your initial scope. It doesn't mean that the scope will not expand, but doing so will help in your project to socialize knowledge across an organization. It will allow you to answer the skeptics in the organization when they ask you why they should use it.    Embed Quote
