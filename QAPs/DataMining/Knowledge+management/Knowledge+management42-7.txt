I am the founder of Indexedmind - a tool for finding People, Talent, Skills and Knowledge inside Organizations. One of the features that Indexedmind offers is documenting who are the SMEs for processes in your company. Examples: "Who knows about offshore recruiting?" "Who knows about procurement?" "Who knows about Facebook advertising?"These things are made extremely simple if you use indexedmind. Finding people is as simple as "Google Instant".
