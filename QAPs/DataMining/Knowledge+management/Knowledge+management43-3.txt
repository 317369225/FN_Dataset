★What is the most all-inclusive internally-focused social media/intranet/collaboration and knowledge management platform on the market today?
I think Gil Yehuda has done a great job framing the challenge you're looking to solve Mark Attew. The only thing I would add is that to best tie multiple products together, I really wish more standardization was in place for at a minimum: authentication/authorization/profile-information. Every large (and even my current small startup company) I have ever worked for has had an LDAP service setup. Not all of them used LDAP as the primary provider, but they at least had it synced up with whatever primary role service they had in place. That being said, if each product opened up their implementations just enough to plugin an LDAP service from within your enterprise/network, and allowed for LDAP to control authentication, authorization and basic profile information, then using multiple products would not be as disconnected as it is today. I'm pointing this out because I feel that the best shoe in most cases is one pair of sandals, one pair of running shoes, one pair of work boots, one pair of rain boots, one pair of high-tops, and a pair of tap shoes! I want all of my fellow employees to be able to switch between shoes just as easily as Mr. Rogers could switch from loafers to tennis shoes. Gee... I hope that metaphoric rant makes sense.    Embed Quote
