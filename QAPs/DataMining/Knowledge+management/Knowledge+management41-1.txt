★What is the link between knowledge management and profitability for law firms?Using KM systems to add value for clients while increasing profitability for law firms in a "win-win" scenario
I would say the links are both operational and sales based. Building upon shared knowledge to seek wisdom. KM tends to address the functional relationships between Data, Information, Knowledge, and occassionally Wisdom. Wisdom is more than just 'really great knowledge'. Like the legal system itself... Wisdom is about changing behavior. Data by itself has no meaning. Information is created by people examining the data resulting in work products. Knowledge is the actionable information they find.  It has personal context, therefore it can be encouraged but not stored. It can be used for good or evil, innovation or stagnation and it tends to have a fairly short shelf life. Km Systems can link to corporate profits by using the information collected for improving controls and using achievements, status, cross situational leaderboards, etc. to build on the experience of the veterans or carefully ‘onboard’ newbies into complex environments. Wisdom can neither be stored nor managed. It is behavioral, sustainable and includes both personal context and community context. Wisdom is socially aware. For better operations, advanced KM systems can combine the performance information of a firm's top talent with a constantly growing social network to change behavior. From a sales perspective, corporations need to demonstrate ongoing programs for training employees to work ethically and within local laws.  This is needed because global economies have made the rules harder to learn and global competition has raised the perceived rewards of pushing the ethical boundaries.    Embed Quote
