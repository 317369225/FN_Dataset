★What are the top 5 barriers to Knowledge Management?
I would say the single biggest barrier is the name itself. It implies control, conscious direction, and regulation. Good KM is about enabling and augmentation. The coffee shop in the seventeenth century is a workable analogy. KM should provide a backbone and common space. Capture and IT processing should be secondary (though important) goals. Speaking of capture, this seems to be a very hard nut to crack. Automated, substantial, correct, and meaningful/salient knowledge capture is what will make the difference between KM either plateauing as just one of many standard business tools, or really taking off into a new frontier, a sort of 'amplifier' for BI.    Embed Quote
