★What is the most all-inclusive internally-focused social media/intranet/collaboration and knowledge management platform on the market today?
I've had good experiences with 37signals and Campfire. I've had poor experiences with Sharepoint, but mostly due to user error and implementation error. I'm intrigued by the potential of Asana, which has a few employees on Quora. See me putting big, flashing, red neon lights around Gil Yehuda's answer and Rachel Barry's answer? Two short, very pointed sets of advice. The software is the least important part of this decision. Defining your objectives, defining the framework for policies and procedures and community development are all far more important. Buy the tool to fit the problem. Get an expert consultant, who is hired by you and is not pushing their own solution. Vet them well, and pay them well. Roll out the tools incrementally. Think Unix-like for all business software projects. Redundant, loosely coupled, configurable tools based on standards are superior in every way to monolithic, all in one solutions. You can create the illusion of unity through effective web development while respecting the strengths and weaknesses of different tools. Make sure you don't already have a system that can accomplish your goal before purchasing anything new.    Embed Quote
