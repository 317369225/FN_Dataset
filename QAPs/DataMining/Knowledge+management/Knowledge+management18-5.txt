★What are some recommended knowledge management tools for an enterprise?
Am not sure which is the best - but my approach to find it will be to see which tool is more likely to be a habit forming tool. Reason why i would it to be habit forming is i want it to widely adopted & used. (You can check Nir Eyal's working on find more about the checklist of habit forming products) There can be two instances where the role of KM ticks in: a. you need to add to the KM (here the self driven user is likely to take the pain and add to KM) b. for looking/digging into past knowledge to solve a current question or a problem. The latter is likely to happen to almost every knowledge worker in your organisation. this is one area where if a tool is well designed it can make it a great tool as it has a chance of building a habit    Embed Quote
