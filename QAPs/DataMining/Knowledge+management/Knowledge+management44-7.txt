★What are the best ways to incentivize people to use "Enterprise 2.0" knowledge management / collaboration tools in an organizaton?Some of the newer "Enterprise 2.0" tools can be very powerful ways to help people share, locate and collaborate around, knowledge in an organization.  But not everyone is interested in using such tools, and some people may even be actively hostile to them.  What are the best ways to encourage their broad utilization?
After seeing this problem in real-life for over 5 years, doing real social networking deployments in the largest companies in the world - the simple answer is that collaboration is not tied to processes, and day-to-day work. We then found a unique way to structure a process and moved away from E2.0/KM/collaboration and focused on processes only. The result at Checklists that run all your business processes - was grant-funded by the Chilean and US governments. Current pilot results are pretty spectacular, and we believe this eliminates the huge 1% participation problem that is common with enterprise social networks.    Embed Quote
