★How does collaboration, communication and content fit into the larger picture of knowledge management?
If you want to manage knowledge, or maybe better phrased, record the current state of knowledge within you organization it is nowadays a rather difficult task. We used to think that by just having a knowledge manager or a group of knowledge managers we would be able to maintain a certain level of quality. These managers were reviewing the content and decided if something should or should not be listed in the knowledge repository. The big downside of this is that there a few people who are deciding or the complete what assets are useful and that you need to have any assets in the first place. The knowledge that wasn’t shared in assets or wasn’t approved by the knowledge manager simply evaporated and was in best case just not listed in the repository but in worst case the information was lost. If you want to prevent knowledge leaking like I just described it is most likely you will need three components: A repository A social networking platform A social collaboration platformThese three components are tightly linked and enables a continuous process of knowledge recording. There is no small group that is deciding for everybody what is useful. It is everybody that decides what is useful for everybody: in some cases explicitly as in uploading and rating assets in the repository and other cases much more passive by just having a conversation on the social networking platform.
