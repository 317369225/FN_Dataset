★What is a good, simple and easy-to-use knowledge management tool that can keep track of business processes?Preferably an online (cloud based) Knownledge Base tool that once can integrate with Basecamp or offers APIs for customization and is small business owner friendly.
Try http://oogwave.com and you may not even need to integrate with basecamp. It allows the external collaboration and is SMB user friendly too. But with very little customization option.    Embed Quote
