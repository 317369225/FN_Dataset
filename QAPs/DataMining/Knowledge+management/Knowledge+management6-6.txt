★What is the best internal knowledge management solution?Hi, I'm seeking advice on different knowledge management systems for a contact centre. It needs to be able to be searched by client, and have the ability for agents to add questions to be answered and add more knowledge. Cloud solution would be ideal?
Indexedmind is a great tool for finding out who knows what in your Company (a.k.a Knowledge). It is a Project Manager's best friend. Think of it as a LinkedIn + Quora for Companies. You can keep track of people, skills, talent and most importantly knowledge. And everything is searchable at the click of a button. Indexedmind augments your existing systems instead of claiming to replace any one of them. You can store your documentation and wikis in sharepoint and link to them from Indexedmind.
