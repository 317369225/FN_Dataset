★What are the implications of Quora in corporate knowledge management?
Strategy consultants are hired to research and answer tough questions about technology, markets, competition, and more. Many of the tough questions are already answered in great detail on Quora. Initially this will make research easier, but it may lead to Quora being hailed as a sort of strategic resource for corporate types looking to confirm their ideas and compare with others. For example, a large company could post a question about themselves, post an answer to a question about them, or post both just to hype something. Clearly startups have done this already.    Embed Quote
