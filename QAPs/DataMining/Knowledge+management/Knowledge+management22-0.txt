★How does your development team(s) handle knowledge management?
Most companies I know, use so called 'folklore' approach to knowledge management. It sounds like that: "Steven wrote this code in first place. Call him via the phone and he will explain" Since Steven may not be available the backup option is to rotate programmers - everybody should do tasks in different project areas so after some time, everybody knows all the code. Thus the programmers become equal and replaceable. About documentation - it is the code itself. The so called 'self-documenting code'. The tight schedule does not allow to write long fancy documents. If a new programmer come to the project he will ask the other and learn by doing. I know, I just described few anti-patterns, but I observe this practice again and again.    Embed Quote
