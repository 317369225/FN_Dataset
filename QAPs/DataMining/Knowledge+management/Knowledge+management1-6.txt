★What is the best open source software for knowledge management?
We are currently developing a solution for this issue. Our vision is much broader than pure personal knowledge management and we have some interesting knowledge automation engines and avatars we are working on. However for now we are testing a beta release of an online tool to be able to capture and store the noise in your daily life. Its only MVP beta and a functional list as long as my arm that we are working on, however this is a great group to get some feedback on the pieces that might be missing from your current experience. This might allow us to make a product that is more in line with your expectations for the future. Its free for now with a virtual currency in place for some of the more secure and private aspects. Have a play at TribalMind.  Feedback welcome.    Embed Quote
