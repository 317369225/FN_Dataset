Google Docs/Google Drive can be useful for knowledge management. It allows you to: quickly create and share documents with colleagues to capture ideas keep a list of your teams most recently updated files easy place to store and share files Google Drive can be useful within any organization for knowledge management. One element that could be improved is the collaboration layer around files stored in Drive. We built Siasto (http://siasto.com) for exactly this reason, we help users share and edit files in Drive from within Siasto, and attach tasks to them, comment, and divide them into projects and folders.    Embed Quote
