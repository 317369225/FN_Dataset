★What are the best knowledge management software for employees?I'm looking for knowledge managment software for employees. I need solution where I can add user restrictions to some main categories (pages where user can't access). I was trying to use mediawiki but I think it's too complicated for me. Thanks in advance for help!
The killer knowledge management system over time has many needs: fluid minimal structure articles (like a wiki page or note) physical docs (PDFs, Word, etc) that may or may not be "formally" structured - but done, and don't want (have time) to recreate in another medium helpdesk system that can spawn ticket information/conversations issue tracker information content voting, ideally integrations of the various systems search, search, search! May I suggest a combination of systems integrated together, with a central entry point, for the uber knowledge management system? Atlassian Confluence wiki for #1 Alfresco (or Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, SharePoint, SkyDrive, or other) for document management for #2 Parature Customer Service Software for #3 Atlassian JIRA issure tracking software (integrated with Confluence) for #4 Content Voting plugin, Adaptavist for #5 Various for #6*, including: -- Alfresco in Confluence packaged integration, by AppFusions (includes cross-system search, from Confluence; other flavors also supported) -- Parature for Confluence packaged integration plugin, by AppFusions (real-time helpdesk feeds and cross-system search, from Confluence) Search included with Confluence and integrations. * Other flavor integrations ot theme enhancements, available upon request (info@appfusions.com). Disclaimer: I am co-founder of AppFusions, but still - this is a very viable mixed application use case for the power deployment.    Embed Quote
