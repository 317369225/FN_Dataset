Also, identify the objectives for this effort in tangible terms.  How will you know if you're successful?  Could there be a way to measure it?  If so, put those guidelines in the place at the start of the projects.  example:  customer service agent needs to solve customer problem.  KM allows him/her to find answer in 30 seconds rather than churning for 30 minutes.  Success!    Embed Quote
