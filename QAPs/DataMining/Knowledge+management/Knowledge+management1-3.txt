★What is the best open source software for knowledge management?
I think Warren Allen is right on the money about Evernote (product). It's a great personal information manager. However I think the complete answer is that there isn't any good open source software for personal knowledge management because there isn't any such thing as software for personal knowledge management. Knowledge management is an exercise in developing, sharing, and curating the knowledge within a group of people. I use Evernote in conjunction with Pinboard and Instapaper (as well as dead tree journals) to curate my own collection of information and data, but when it comes to my knowledge, that's based on how I understand these facts and data. So my personal knowledge management tool is my much abused brain. To understand why this point is relevant, think about two examples: a bee hive and a team of people working on a complex project for a company. Bees are incredibly stupid (Snookie on the Jersey Shore (TV series) is smarter than a bee), but through a process of sharing information that individuals have gleaned and weighing simple assessments the hive as a whole gains knowledge about the best location for their next nesting site. The individuals on the aforementioned project have all gained a great deal of knowledge about their aspect of the project. However they don't know much about each other's. They can't gain from taking their team members' knowledge and applying it to what their doing, and they're in a real bind if that team member leaves. So knowledge management tools (and methods) are useful for solving this problem. As an individual I use additional resources to help me remember things and their context, but at the personal, individual level we don't have a conceptual problem of knowledge management.    Embed Quote
