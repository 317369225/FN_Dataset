★Would Quora be useful for internal knowledge management for companies? Why or why not?Instead of providing a simple wiki or blog for internal knowledge management, a type of Quora application could leverage knowledge based on simple, direct questions. Wikis and blogs rely on pretty much posting random knowledge and guessing that it would be useful to co-workers. This would turn the push communication of classical knowledge management tools into a type of pull communication.
This is a topic I've been pondering as well.  My friend, Doug Cornelius, has just written about this: http://www.compliancebuilding.co... For some reason, I have a negative take on whether it could work.  One of the concerns I have with internal versions of Q&A is that there isn't a critical mass of people who might be participating in the answers side of things.  At least for smaller companies, many of the answers aren't actually known internally - they come from the outside.  And there is always the question of people having availability, time and interest in participating.  On the external web, people are participating because they truly desire to share what they know.  Inside companies, we start getting stuck on things like "is it part of my job?" On a positive perspective, I know that people have a strong tendency to help one another.  If you have a question, and ask it in the right context, people will fall all over themselves in trying to help one another.    Embed Quote
