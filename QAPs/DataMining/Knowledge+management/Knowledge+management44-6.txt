★What are the best ways to incentivize people to use "Enterprise 2.0" knowledge management / collaboration tools in an organizaton?Some of the newer "Enterprise 2.0" tools can be very powerful ways to help people share, locate and collaborate around, knowledge in an organization.  But not everyone is interested in using such tools, and some people may even be actively hostile to them.  What are the best ways to encourage their broad utilization?
Nothing gets people going like a little friendly competition. An Initial launch contest where you reward a small chotchky for logging in and a larger prize like gift cards, rockstar parking, happy hour, etc. for those who are the most active and helpful will lead to broad utilization quicker than just creating the technology and hoping people will discover the benefits themselves.    Embed Quote
