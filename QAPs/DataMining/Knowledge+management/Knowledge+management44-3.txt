★What are the best ways to incentivize people to use "Enterprise 2.0" knowledge management / collaboration tools in an organizaton?Some of the newer "Enterprise 2.0" tools can be very powerful ways to help people share, locate and collaborate around, knowledge in an organization.  But not everyone is interested in using such tools, and some people may even be actively hostile to them.  What are the best ways to encourage their broad utilization?
There are many ways to boost employee participation in Enterprise and collaboration tools. Adapting to new methods of working and new pieces of software, when employees are used to basic Email or IM can be daunting. There are many reasons why management and employees are reluctant to say yes to these pieces of software, like the reliability, security or the fact they have never used them before. Various methods and tools which could vastly help are Gamification, making sure you choose the right software for your needs and ease of use, leading by example; the senior members of the team need to be using it to encourage employees and the content has to be there along with ease of use. I work for a collaborative (and enterprise) company, called Clinked- we've just published a blog post and infographic on this very subject, here:http://clinked.com/site/2013/09/30/boost-employee-participation-collaboration/ If there is anything else you would like to know, I'm happy to help.    Embed Quote
