★What are some recommended knowledge management tools for an enterprise?
The biggest problem with knowledge management (merging into) collaboration tools at present is that people don't just collaborate, share or converse out of thin air. They need a context, a "thing" to collaborate "about". Hence, most approaches that just stick a Facebook-clone into a large company almost always fail - and adoption, if any - is restricted to just a few active participants, a well known problem: 1% rule (Internet culture) I will keep to collaborative approaches to KM (since it's a wide area that has a lot more involved) and we won't go into the problems here - but they are real, because platforms don't solve them - and never will. They also create a collaboration paradox. Hence - without considering these, your entire collaboration platform is guaranteed to fail, and along with it - all your crowd-sourcing/knowledge sharing initiatives. Our take on this entire industry is that unstructured social/collaboration needs to map into structured processes. I wrote about that here: FreePint Blog: Structure, Visibility & Measurement: Linking Social to Business Processes This is the full version of that article, which I was paid to write (and you need to pay to subscribe): Bridging the Gap Between Business Processes & the Social Enterprise All this thinking led to us building our product - Tallyfy, which was grant-funded by the Chilean and US governments, check it out: http://tallyfy.com Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
