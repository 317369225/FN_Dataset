★What are the top 5 barriers to Knowledge Management?
I agree with Timothy's response, but and I would offer this useful article from Knowledge Management World: Cultural resistance to KM persists Also I would add that it depends on how your company makes money. I'm an employee owner at a professional service firm in the AEC industry. We are similar to Lawyers in that we bill labor, so high billability is most very important. Almost all activities are focused on creating billable value for our clients. When I worked in manufacturing in the UK, KM would just have being part of the Lean/Kaizen system in place as part of the basic business operating system. Daily improvement was necessary to reduce operating cost, and eliminate waste. I also think we have to change the language of how we speak about KM. People like people who are like themselves. A clear value proposition for KM is necessary to engage sponsors, so its crystal clear why pursuit of KM is a must.    Embed Quote
