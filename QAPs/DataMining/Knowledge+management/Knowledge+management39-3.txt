★Would Quora be useful for internal knowledge management for companies? Why or why not?Instead of providing a simple wiki or blog for internal knowledge management, a type of Quora application could leverage knowledge based on simple, direct questions. Wikis and blogs rely on pretty much posting random knowledge and guessing that it would be useful to co-workers. This would turn the push communication of classical knowledge management tools into a type of pull communication.
While I know where Tom Floodeen is coming from I do believe it is time for KM in the traditional support centers to change and something LIKE Quora could work in my opinion. While we all know that KM is the holy grail, not a lot of companies have been able to really make it stick...KCS or not. There are many reasons for this but I believe that one of them is that there are too many roadblocks to creating the knowledge. While Quora is a little bit of the Wild West where true answers are concerned, there IS activity and participation...something missing from most KM solutions inside support centers.    Embed Quote
