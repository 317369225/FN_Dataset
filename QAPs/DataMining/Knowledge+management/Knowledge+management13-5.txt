★What influences adoption and utilization of knowledge management tools?I'm sure the actual rates vary based on the organization and other factors. Insight into what those factors are is appreciated.
Until KM takes care of the Culture and the level of preparedness of the organization, adoption and utilization would be very low. To prepare for above a free and incentive driven community of the interested target group should be designed with all kinds of interesting topics of the interest group being monitored by Subject matter experts. While all others should be encouraged to react, participate and share knowledge through focused and planned online activities (contests, quiz), events (webinars, conf, papers) and updates (newsletters/blogs). The most important contribution of influence actually comes from how much of the Knowledge activities are actually undertaken by the organisation in real world and the workplace.    Embed Quote
