★What are some recommended knowledge management tools for an enterprise?
The question cannot be simply answered without the proper analysis of the corporate tools already in use and the audience skills.  Also the "knowledge" you're going to manage can be of different nature: documents and files, articles and tweets etc... There can be different approaches for each case. Some specific suggestions: * If your company's toolset is Microsoft-oriented, consider using Sharepoint (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mic...). This is also a good choice for document-oriented knowledge base * If you're going to create a semantically linked, article-oriented knowlege base, Atlassian Confluence is a better choice (http://www.atlassian.com/softwar...)    Embed Quote
