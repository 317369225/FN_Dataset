★What are the best knowledge management software for employees?I'm looking for knowledge managment software for employees. I need solution where I can add user restrictions to some main categories (pages where user can't access). I was trying to use mediawiki but I think it's too complicated for me. Thanks in advance for help!
My research for an internal and external kb ended when I came across Atlassian Confluence.  It had a great mix of social, plugins and user friendly features. I contracted Stepstone technologies to aid with their Zen add on which made our client knowledgebase branding match our goals.  Mindtouch was a close second in my research.  I do agree at knowing your goal - what features are a must and which can be sacrificed.  The only other aspect I would recommend considering is Integration with existing support tools - case systems - smart phone/tablet apps.    Embed Quote
