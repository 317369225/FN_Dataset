★What is the most all-inclusive internally-focused social media/intranet/collaboration and knowledge management platform on the market today?
Igloo Software is a great knowledge management solution (and intranet solution). Take a look at the Digital Opportunity Trust case study and scroll down to look at screenshots of their intranet + knowledge library: http://www.igloosoftware.com/customers/casestudies/dot Within each knowledge library, you could : - search within that library - share resources (docs, wikis, etc) - see who is the manager or who owns that library, and contact them - ask a question and find answers using a forum - share updates - see recent changes made within that library - like content - follow content - auto-notify selected groups of people whenever important content is updated - comment on resources - and much more.    Embed Quote
