★What are the top 5 barriers to Knowledge Management?
I founded http://dapulse.com - and from the many companies using us I learned - The major barrier to knowledge bleeding is using tools that are really bad at keeping data. Knowledge Bleeding Email, Skype, Chats don't save the data and make it accessible, information is lost, not shared among the people that need it and employees that leave / change position bleed information that hurts the organisation and slow it down. Solution is simple Move conversations you normally have in email and skype to a tool that keeps history and makes it searchable and accessible.    Embed Quote
