★What are NASA's knowledge management strategies for retaining and transferring technical knowledge?I.e. from earlier programs like Apollo and shuttle, to unforeseen programs in the distant future?
NASA has some excellent practices for KM, but I talked to the NASA KM director about five years ago, and she was lamenting that each lab of NASA was working on this in dispersed order. The budget cuts had also affected their KM programs, and the people who were leaving because entire programs were closed down were not sharing all their tacit knowledge before leaving. So there were huge gaps in their strategy.    Embed Quote
