★What is the best way to achieve Knowledge Management in the workplace?How to tap and share institutional knowledge?
We feel that sharing knowledge in the form of Question & Answers is  powerful. That's a fundamental way of how people learn or clarify their  doubts to refine their knowledge or learn new things but sometimes in a  company structure or a hierarchy where the people who are more  experienced are the ones who usually are looked upon as the best  information source by team mates or colleagues at a lower level in the  hierarchy. Being more experienced and at a much higher position in the hierarchy these  people are usually busy with their work and have less time to answer  each question which keeps people waiting and thus effecting the overall  productivity. We are trying to solve this problem with http://assistwindow.com and if you feel you have the same problem and want to organize tasks by sharing knowledge efficiently at your workplace, do give us a try! We would love to have your feedback...    Embed Quote
