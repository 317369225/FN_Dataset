★How does collaboration, communication and content fit into the larger picture of knowledge management?
Amazing question. I have been thinking about the same thing in my own amateurish way. Since communication and collaboration are so closely related, they should be managed through a unified system, which should capture all the content generated, and somehow have a way to retrieve that information, and distinguish important content from less important content (voting maybe?) (intelligent algorithms?)    Embed Quote
