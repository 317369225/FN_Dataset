★What is knowledge management?
Think about subscribing to the value that 'knowledge' and 'action' are the same thing, that 'knowledge is the beginning of action and action, the completion of knowledge.' Adoption of this holistic viewpoint eliminates the dissection of 'every blade of grass', encouraging instead, the identification of principles. For example, in the editing of a monochrome photograph, there are simple principles that are the foundation of the process: Managing exposure as the first principle. Editing in full tonal range - 1-10. Capturing a 'mood' that best 'tell the story you wish to tell'.My suggestion is to filter the knowledge you have, or are exposed to, on a single principle - whether that knowledge has practical value, now and no more than five years hence. Eliminate or 'file' knowledge that, for you, has no obvious or potential practical value, no potential for action that has social value.    Embed Quote
