★What's the best free/cheap knowledge management (a.k.a Quora clone) software?Ideally, I would like a private Quora instance for our startup. Since Quora don't offer such a service ... what are some alternatives I could use to manage our knowledge base? A solution that I don't have to host myself is preferable, of course.
The best tools I know right now are: Trello for managing lists (we also use it as project management) A wiki / Google Docs / Evernote for documents Dropbox for files A Shapado or OSQA instance for Q&A YouTrack for issue tracking None of the above integrates everything beautifully like Quora does (well, it doesn't have an issue tracker, but that's really a minor point).    Embed Quote
