Indexedmind (Search your Company's Brain Power !) is a great tool for finding out who knows what in your Company (a.k.a Knowledge). It is a Project Manager's best friend. Think of it as a LinkedIn + Quora for Companies. You can keep track of people, skills, talent and most importantly knowledge. And everything is searchable at the click of a button. Indexedmind augments your existing systems instead of claiming to replace any one of them. You can store your documentation and wikis in sharepoint and link to them from Indexedmind.
