I need solution where I can add user restrictions to some main categories (pages where user can't access). I was trying to use mediawiki but I think it's too complicated for me. Thanks in advance for help!
Depending on how much you would like to invest and how big ypur company is, Microsoft SharePoint is one of the best solutions that are available and I am aware of. You may find it an expensive Investment though if you are considering only a few employees. An alternative is Opentext Livellink, however same applies here too.    Embed Quote
