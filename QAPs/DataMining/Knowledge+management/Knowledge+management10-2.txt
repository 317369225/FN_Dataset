★How does collaboration, communication and content fit into the larger picture of knowledge management?
What comes to mind here, particularly when I'm looking at the interesting graphics, is how to define or assess content quality? I think this is not done often enough in KM, and that's really necessary because the impact of Big Data is already here. Hundreds of millions of Terabytes of data. So, what content are we talking about ? What is meaningful and what is not ? If you just google any topic, try to see when relevance gets low on the results page. Sometimes it's the third or fifth website ! So we are facing a pile of rubbish, and we need to select only what is floating at the surface. Therefore in my view good KM should really include quality assessment. This is what Pankaj was suggesting in a way. Because even in organizations the content quality can be really, really poor. I like to see this as entropy, where all elements are scattered randomly, and some combinations of some elements create sense. So create/learn/share, yes, but I would really add "rank by quality"... Because productivity cannot be maximized when knowledge is of poor quality.    Embed Quote
