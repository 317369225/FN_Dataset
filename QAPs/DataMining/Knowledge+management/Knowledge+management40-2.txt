★What are the implications of Quora in corporate knowledge management?
I am not qualified to talk about implications, but I would like to talk about scope of Quora in this domain. "Q" is not asking any profiles, not in the business of working as a network tool to get employment, but it is becoming a kind of major knowledge base - it is in the hands of the user how he can get profit from it, advantage from it, educated from it. Few groups need to be rearranged and new areas to be included. "Corporate" has to be fully opened and several sub headings will come under this heading.    Embed Quote
