★Could Quora be integrated with Yammer to create enterprise knowledge management?
I created a Yammer - Quora like tool. I think there is a lot of be said to the knowledge organisation and information flow Quora has and to the ease of microblogging to store and share information. http://daPulse.com is a company I founded that does just that. The system is based on Topics that creates context for updates. The topics are connected in a Quora like structure - making information on sub-topics populate up to the relevant parents. The results with companies we work with are amazing in terms of keeping data, each update is found on it's topic (Context) which makes organisation very easy. but it's also populated up and distributed to the people that follow the different super topics (just like Quora) The system is used by thousands of users - you can try it out free here - http://dapulse.com    Embed Quote
