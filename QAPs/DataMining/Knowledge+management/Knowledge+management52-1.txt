★What Lean Six Sigma methodologies and Knowledge Management approach have in common?
Lean Six Sigma (and other process improvement methodologies) rely heavily on the concepts of standard work and the control phase.  Knowledge Mgmt systems can be part of the solution set for both.  With standard work, the key is this information needs to be readily accessible,  visual, and easy to find to the end user. In the control phase of any project, sustainability is a concern for any process improvement that makes its way into the production environment.  Knowledge Mgmt could enable changes to stick as this info is structured and made widely available to the organization.    Embed Quote
