★What is the best open source software for knowledge management?
Tinderbox looks like a mind mapping tool, not sure if it's relevant, but I do have a few apps, iOS and desktop that work really well. The one I like is mind node - http://mindnode.com/ - and it's available as a desktop app from the app store. Enjoy.    Embed Quote
