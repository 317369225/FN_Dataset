★What Lean Six Sigma methodologies and Knowledge Management approach have in common?
A fusion of Lean and Six Sigma methods enable organizations to reduce lead time in processes, cost and effort in processes and attain excellence in organizational process quality and consistency. Knowledge management is a framework which may be central to organizations whose primary functions are innovation, ideation, finding solutions using data and in organizations where knowledge about products, processes and resources are available widely and leveraged by executives from easy-to-access systems. Since executives using Lean and Six Sigma make intensive use of process and product data and rely subsequently on statistical process improvement methods to arrive at solutions, it is key to integrate knowledge management systems in organizations at some level with the Lean Six Sigma initiatives in those organizations, if any. This way, the knowledge latent in the processes can be used for Lean Six Sigma projects and result in business success. At a fundamental level, both KM and LSS methods rely on collecting and categorising information. Consider the example of a product structure management tool that may be used in manufacturing organizations. This tool will essentially collect data from different products and processes and come up with ontologies which help store product knowledge. This product knowledge will also be collected in the course of an LSS project which aims to make either the manufacturing costs of this product lower or improve the consistency of the processes that create this product.    Embed Quote
