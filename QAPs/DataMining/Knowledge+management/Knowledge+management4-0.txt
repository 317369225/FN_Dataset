★What are the top 5 barriers to Knowledge Management?
Lack of a clear ROI Although you can find papers over the web that will tell you "KM will lower time spent searching for stuff by 9.33%", actual ROI depends on many variables and it is very hard to measure, therefore hard to sell to management. Resistance to change Depending on where you are now regarding KM, properly managing knowledge may require small changes (like getting a tool to support it) to changing the culture. Overcoming resistance to change can be a painfull and lenghty process. Great tips here: How to introduce a new tool in the workplace (part 1) Tendency to transform KM into IT projects A culture of sharing what matters to your organization won't be "achieved" by a project manager with 500k$ budget and a 6 months schedule for servers and software development. I've seen many companies doing great KM-wise only by having a proper folders/files naming convention and by doing frequent meetups. Allowing employees to take time to discuss various subjects and getting higher mangement to be more transparent is a good way to show a desire to change the culture. Buying computers is meaningless. Ruining KM with a bad tool You're seeing great progress towards a culture of sharing important content, sharing critical information and learning. As more people share more and more stuff, you might want to make easier to share and find information by introducing a tool. Involve people in the selection process to ease adoption and try to not go on with 1998 stuff that nobody wants to use. Outdated tools are great to hold outdated knowledge. Look for tools that can be deployed easily, with great UI/UX, and easy to use (ex: Crowdbase or dapulse). Lack of Accessibility Knowledge management is useful (and thus helps with the ROI) when knowledge is available when needed. Make knowledge accessible (web, mobile, chat, etc.)    Embed Quote
