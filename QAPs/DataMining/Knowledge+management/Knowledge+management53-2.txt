★What's the best free/cheap knowledge management (a.k.a Quora clone) software?Ideally, I would like a private Quora instance for our startup. Since Quora don't offer such a service ... what are some alternatives I could use to manage our knowledge base? A solution that I don't have to host myself is preferable, of course.
I suggest you take a look at our product, http://Answerbase.com. It's a highly customizable hosting platform that you can integrate seamlessly with your own website or intranet. You can make it private or public and use the extensive API and widgets to integrate as you wish.    Embed Quote
