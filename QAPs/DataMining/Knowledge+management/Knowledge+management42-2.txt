★What is a good, simple and easy-to-use knowledge management tool that can keep track of business processes?Preferably an online (cloud based) Knownledge Base tool that once can integrate with Basecamp or offers APIs for customization and is small business owner friendly.
Check out www.tabillo.com, i'm being partial but we created this tool for 1 reason and 1 reason only - help SME's simplify information access. I would say it is for users who just cannot capture all information & knowledge in web tools like Freshbooks, Basecamp. There will certainly be an API going forward & the 1st client on Tabillo is a government entity in Toronto with 25 users.    Embed Quote
