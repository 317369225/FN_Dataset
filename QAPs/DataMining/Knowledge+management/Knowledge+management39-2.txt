★Would Quora be useful for internal knowledge management for companies? Why or why not?Instead of providing a simple wiki or blog for internal knowledge management, a type of Quora application could leverage knowledge based on simple, direct questions. Wikis and blogs rely on pretty much posting random knowledge and guessing that it would be useful to co-workers. This would turn the push communication of classical knowledge management tools into a type of pull communication.
I think it depends on how good the search is at finding questions that have already been asked.  Another problem is how do you determine if the answers are on target?  If you were using this as your company knowledge site, I think it would be difficult to know how many customers are using it and if they were successful.  It is difficult to improve on something you can not measure. If you are looking at knowledge management to deflect case load, you need some way to determining if knowledge management is working.    Embed Quote
