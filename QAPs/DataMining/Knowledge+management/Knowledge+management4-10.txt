★What are the top 5 barriers to Knowledge Management?
1. Unnecessary jargon - it turns people off. 2. Lack of new philosophies - a fairly large number of practitioners recycle quotes from 50+ years ago, that simply aren't relevant anymore. 3. Unnecessary infighting within the community over KM vs IM vs Big Data vs Whatever - KM at the core is understanding what any given organization knows, and then determining how to use that knowledge to best support organizational goals. 4. Manipulation of employees - organizations push knowledge transfer systems on employees, but fail to follow up and really reward them for participating. This is a very human problem, not a software or hardware problem. Humans love to share with one another when they feel rewarded. If management siphons the best ideals off of whatever social business platform is in use, and then never rewards the originators of the ideas, employees will respond accordingly. 5. Most organizations lack any kind of mentor / apprentice program. What used to get passed on through formal training now gets pushed off on computer based training, HR videos, emails from the boss, etc. There are countless organizations without a formal KM program that do just fine. They excel at using technology well, they are flexible, they have a culture of sharing and camaraderie, arrogance and insular thinking isn't tolerated, employees are rewarded for working together, and management takes a servant leader approach.    Embed Quote
