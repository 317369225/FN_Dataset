★What are the best ways to incentivize people to use "Enterprise 2.0" knowledge management / collaboration tools in an organizaton?Some of the newer "Enterprise 2.0" tools can be very powerful ways to help people share, locate and collaborate around, knowledge in an organization.  But not everyone is interested in using such tools, and some people may even be actively hostile to them.  What are the best ways to encourage their broad utilization?
I know little about how to make E20 things work, but in our company we have had great examples on how to make them fail, and I share with you: have C-level push (not just encourage) people to use the E20 tools to the point of punishing those who do not use them have C-level "follow" or "like" little to zero users/posts and never comment on other users posts/comments (getting publicly angry when no one comment on their own posts helps too) have a pool of unrelated E20 tools (blogs/microblogging/video-sharing) with little or no integration in the pool to the point that the same user can have different out-of-sync identities in any tool of the pool activate users with a top down approach unknown to users, not on a voluntary basis, in an uncoordinated fashion so that in the same department some users have an account while others do not (if they share the desk the better) implement the E20 tools with an incremental approach (if they come we will add money and feature), so that the first iterations lacks even the basic features (adding a few nasty bugs will help) release E20 tools that are not user centered (ie having a fixed, non customizable, home page for all the users) never make any of the tools related to any business process, not even with examples have C-levels declare vague goals about the E20 tools Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
