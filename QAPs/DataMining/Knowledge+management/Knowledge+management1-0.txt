★What is the best open source software for knowledge management?
So, this is strictly about personal knowledge management, right? Do you have any other requirements/desires? I use Evernote for this sort of thing. I'm a Ph.D. candidate and I use it a lot for storing things I've foraged around the Web for professional and personal purposes. I tried a few others (Catch, Google, OneNote) and they all have their foibles. For my money, Evernote. But as you asked for open source + Windows, you might try: KeyNote NF: http://code.google.com/p/keynote... KeepNote: http://keepnote.org/ TomBoy: http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/    Embed Quote
