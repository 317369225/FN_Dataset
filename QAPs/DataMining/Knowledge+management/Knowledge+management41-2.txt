★What is the link between knowledge management and profitability for law firms?Using KM systems to add value for clients while increasing profitability for law firms in a "win-win" scenario
You may be interested in a research report we have just produced. We commissioned OMC Partners to conduct in-depth research into how law firms are using knowledge management to increase efficiency and profitability. A range of practices emerged. At worst, haphazard or complacent approaches were hampering fee-earners in their day-to-day role. At best, firms have been able to significantly reduce the overall costs of creating knowledge and matter delivery consistently across all practice areas. The research amounted to 50 hours of interviews. This report distils from these: The main client pressures and their implications for knowledge. Six knowledge best practices. Typical barriers to these. The successful outcomes firms have achieved. If you'd like to view the report you can get a free copy here: http://uk.practicallaw.com/about...    Embed Quote
