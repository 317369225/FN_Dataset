★What are the "must read" books or articles about Knowledge Management?Working on revising an existing course in KM. What do you want potential employees to have read?
The term Knowledge Management has undergone a significant and thorny history of scrutiny. It means different things to different people.  Let me share some books that might help, in order of what I perceive might be relevant. Sharing Hidden Know-How: How Managers Solve Thorny Problems With the Knowledge Jam by Katrina Pugh http://www.amazon.com/Sharing-Hi... The Collaborative Organization: A Strategic Guide to Solving Your Internal Business Challenges Using Emerging Social and Collaborative Tools by Jacob Morgan (was just published, I wrote the foreword) http://www.amazon.com/The-Collab... Enterprise 2.0: New Collaborative Tools for Your Organization's Toughest Challenges by Andrew McAfee http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise... Mobilizing Minds: Creating Wealth From Talent in the 21st Century Organization by Lowell Bryan and Claudia Joyce of McKinsey & Company http://www.amazon.com/Mobilizing... Empowered: Unleash Your Employees, Energize Your Customers, and Transform Your Business by Josh Bernoff and Ted Schadler (Forrester Research) http://www.amazon.com/Empowered-... Working Knowledge by Thomas Davenport and Larry Prusak http://www.amazon.com/Working-Kn... The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom by Yochai Benkler http://www.amazon.com/The-Wealth... There are others that are similar in topic and focus, but these in particular are all very worth reading and written by people I respect and in most cases know personally as being experts in their field. These lean toward the more current views of KM related to social collaboration, but the Pugh book also deals with the more traditional Knowledge Engineering processes that were what KM was about in the earlier days of KM -- but her approach is quite refreshed, methodical, and proven in the field.    Embed Quote
