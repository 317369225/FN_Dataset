★What is the hottest topic in knowledge management?
Social network style inhouse information sharing allows companies to save time and money. This is probably one of the hottest topics in 2013. My guess would be that 2014 will be the year of connecting the inhouse sharing of information with the marketing related sharing of information to clients and potential customers (For inbound marketing and content marketing reasons). My company is actually active in both spaces - exploreB2B offers an inhouse knowledge management and information sharing solution.    Embed Quote
