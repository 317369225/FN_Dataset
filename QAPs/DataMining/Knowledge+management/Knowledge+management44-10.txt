★What are the best ways to incentivize people to use "Enterprise 2.0" knowledge management / collaboration tools in an organizaton?Some of the newer "Enterprise 2.0" tools can be very powerful ways to help people share, locate and collaborate around, knowledge in an organization.  But not everyone is interested in using such tools, and some people may even be actively hostile to them.  What are the best ways to encourage their broad utilization?
I recently used a collaborative knowledge management tool, http://www.TeamGum.com for one of my team research projects. And I realized  that the biggest incentive for adoption of such tools could be the ease of usability and less complicated features of the tool itself. While, many a times we focus on finding solutions to motivate employees extrinsically by reward systems etc. for internalizing an Enterprise 2.0, we miss out on understanding that why employees do not get excited to use such tools. I feel that the layers of complexities associated with these tools could hamper someone within a team to see its real value.  He will only consider to use it until no one from the top management pushes it back to employees to use it. Simple features with an ease of usability of a knowledge management tool can intrinsically motivate employees to adopt it.  This is the  tool which I used for my research project helped me to share the hidden gems which I found while surfing the web in a less complicated way with my team mates.  This improved our ability to collaborate and discuss on real time basis resulting in improved efficiencies.    Embed Quote
