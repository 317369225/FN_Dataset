★What is knowledge management?
All in all one would define knowledge as information one has for a particular subject at hand. For organisational purposes, knowledge management is key as it provides for intellect and organisational needs. Knowledge management can be tacit or expilict in the sense that we all use what knowledge we have for a particular topic at hand.
