★What is a good distribution to use for simulating a training set for supervised classification?
I'd say that generating a data set with a mixture of multivariate normals is fair game but as Olivier has mentioned this may yield a data set which is linearly separable. I don't believe that there would be an "optimal" choice of model for the data since the support vector machine nor neural network presupposes that data were generated according to a probabilistic process. Hence, I don't believe that choosing a specific distribution to draw the covariance matrices or whether they differ from class to class matter significantly. To overcome the non-seperability, you could try a mixture of multivariate normals in some space and use a kernel (warping function) to warp the data. If I remember correctly, there are some commonly used kernels here: Learning From Data MOOC including Radial Basis Functions mentioned previously.    Embed Quote
