★Logit Regression: What's the purpose of testing sets and training sets?I was looking at a logistic regression video and its talking about making a testing set and training set. I don't know what their purposes are. Its a logit regression vid using health data, but does this happen often in economics or any other field?
The standard strategy for honest assessment of generalization is splitting data into:   Training Data set: The portion used for fitting the model. The remainder is used for empirical validation. Validation Data set: is used for monitoring and tuning the model to improve its generalization. The tuning process usually involves selecting among models of different types and complexities. The tuning process optimizes the selected model on the validation data. Consequently, a further holdout sample is needed for a final, unbiased assessment. Test Data set:has only one use: to give a final honest estimate of generalization. Consequently, cases in the test set must be treated just as new data would be treated. They cannot be involved in the determination of the fitted prediction model.    Embed Quote
