★What are the different sampling methods to generate subsamples from a large training set to be able to  capture the correct correlation between features(a.k.a learn a model)? To add on, Is MCMC better than random sampling to generate this subsample ? If so, how big should the random sample be? I have used MCMC for parameter estimation, my question relates to using it for sample generation for learning models like for e.g regression.I am aware of online algorithms which is one way to solve the problem. I am looking for a sampling method which will allow me to evaluate accuracy of my system within some confidence interval.
Yes, I think this is over-thinking it. The extra estimation involved in MCMC and sampling from that estimate can hurt. Random sampling is fine. It sounds like you are just trying to separate a training set and validation/test set, and again that is typically done randomly.    Embed Quote
