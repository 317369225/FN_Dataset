★Will Naive Bayes give a good result if the training set is much smaller than the no. of features in a machine learning classifier?Training set is of the size = 1000 and no. of features are reaching close 100,000. Will Naive Bayes give a good result or should I look into any other algorithm to build a multi-class classifier?
Naive Bayes is probably one of the best classifiers for this type of problem (many text classification tasks have the same character: the features are the presence or absence of words -- and Naive Bayes has been shown to perform very well on text classification tasks). While the Naive Bayes representation isn't as expressive as others, it's very good at making the most use of small number of samples. Both decision tree based and nearest neighbor approaches are going to struggle with this type of data -- nearest neighbor will struggle because in 100,000 dimensions nothing's close to anything; and decision trees will struggle because they'll overfit with 100,000 attributes. Neural networks will have the same issues, because there's just way too many parameters to train. The only other classifier that might do well with this type of data will be the support vector machine -- especially if you can find a domain-specific kernel.    Embed Quote
