★When training and testing data sets, is it possible to test a complete different data set from the training set?
One way this problem gets approached is if you can find a subset of the training data that follows close to the same distribution as your test data.  You see this problem in alternative augmentative communication (AAC), where there is no public training corpus that really works.  Vertanen and Kristensson generated a small data set using mechanical turk workers that they thought would be similar to the test data set, but was too small to train and get good results using that alone.  They then used some information theory methods to select sentences from a much larger data set that were similar to the turk data set, and used this subset of the large data set to train their model. Another thing you can do is if your training data set is not "completely" different so that it is useful for predicting the test data set but not ideal, use some kind of online learning to update parameters with your test data set.    Embed Quote
