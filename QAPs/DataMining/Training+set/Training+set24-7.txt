★How can one improve a classifier (random forest), when there is no overfitting + optimal parameter selection but performance on the test set is much lower than on the training set?
When you said "performance on test set is much lower than training set" that says that by definition there is overfitting. Did you try other methods like a regularized SVM or logistic regression?    Embed Quote
