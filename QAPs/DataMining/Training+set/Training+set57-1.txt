★I am getting a 100% accurate result on randomForest model in R for loan default data even when my training set and test set are completely non-overlapping. I am using abt 8 parameters/features for training the model. The model gives me ntree=1 and mtry=1. Is there anything wrong with 100% accuracy?
This is suspicious. How many instances in train and test? Are you sure there is no overlap between train and test? Are there duplicates of train in test? Have you tried a different train/test split?    Embed Quote
