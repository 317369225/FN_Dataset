★Is the training set for spam detection universal across users for major e-mail clients?For instance, if I mark a message as spam, does that get added to a training corpus that classifies other users' emails? Or does each user have an individual training corpus?
It depends. Different spam filters work differently. Generally speaking, more sophisticated filters learn how reliable a particular user's spam reports are. The more reliable users' reports tend to weight more heavily when filtering spam for other users. Also, your question implies that content analysis is the be-all-and-end-all of spam filtering. In fact, only a small fraction of spam is filtered this way. The vast majority is filtered using connection management techniques, such as reputation, greylisting, etc. However, reports can feed in to reputation databases, as well as statistical content filter corpora.    Embed Quote
