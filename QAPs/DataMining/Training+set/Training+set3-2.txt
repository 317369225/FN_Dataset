★What are ways to prevent over fitting your training set data?Is it possible to "test" if you have done so?
As Rajan Rajan said, some uncertainty is inherited. You can cope with that in the following way. The data set is of a certain size, d. Your model is of a certain size, m. If you get a prediction level p and m is significantly small than d then, p is quite accurate estimation of your prediction level and you didn't over fit. The reason is that if the model is smaller than the data it cannot store it without compressing the data - learning it. The problem is how to define and measure d,m, p a and "significantly smaller". There are plenty of ways of doing that, each one leads to different bounds. In most cases, "hand waving the formula" will work: if m is clearly less than d, your prediction level is close to the one you get on the test set.    Embed Quote
