★What are 'Train Sets' and how do they function?During the Indian Railway Budget speech, the Rail Minisiter has said ".....it is proposed to introduce a very modern train system called train sets. These are similar to bullet trains in design and can run on existing tracks without an engine to haul them...". What are these train sets and how do they function.?
Trainsets. Do you know about DEMUs/MEMUs? You gotta search about them too. Basically trainsets are called so because they actually are a single 'set'. The locomotive is not changed as you must have observed in other trains run in India, but the locomotion is obtained from a coach in that particular 'set' only. This will help, perhaps - InterCity 125 - one of the trainsets used in United Kingdom And this one too - Diesel multiple unit    Embed Quote
