★Machine Learning: Is it ok to pre-process the training set or accumulate features over time?
What are you trying to predict? Are you trying to predict future behaviors? There are many predictive algorithms for time-series data (the easiest one I can think of is probably HMMs). As for a non time-series approach, the new feature you mentioned sounds fine. Just make sure to normalize it somehow (probably by some unit of time). It's also common practice to use a rolling window approach. For example, you can aggregate Jan-Nov to predict Dec. Another realistic measure of how well your algorithm works is to always use the "current" data to predict the future, so use Jan for Feb, Jan + Feb for Mar, etc etc. This gives you an idea of how much your classifier will improve as you collect more data.
