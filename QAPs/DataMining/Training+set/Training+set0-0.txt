★In classification, how do you handle an unbalanced training set?In some cases, you have a lot more examples of one class than of the others. How do you tackle this problem? What are some gotchas to be aware of in this situation?
This was also discussed in What's a good approach to binary classification when the target rate is minimal? where Charles H Martin and myself both recommended resampling the unbalanced training set into not one balanced set, but several. Running an ensemble of classifiers on these sets could produce a much better result than one classifier alone.    Embed Quote
