★How can one improve a classifier (random forest), when there is no overfitting + optimal parameter selection but performance on the test set is much lower than on the training set?
A few comments a. no overfitting = no variance which NEVER happens. b. optimal parameter = overfitting of hyper-parameters To improve error (on validation set test set should only be used for unbiased estimate of the error not for model selection) try. 1. Understand the data, get more relevant features. checkout misclassified examples and devise a good feature to distinguish them. 2. boosting has better performance than random forest try gradient boosted decision trees instead 3. try model ensembles  stacking of svm and Random Forest and boosting    Embed Quote
