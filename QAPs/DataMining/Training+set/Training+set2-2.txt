★Can the validation set be larger than the training set?For example, if size(test data) is known and fixed, and size(test data) >> size(training data), then having a large validation set will better mimic the testing scenario.
Sure.  Training datasets can be selected with a minimum number of observations if that is your belief that it represents the makeup of the population.  This can also happen if you perform dimension reduction on your sample and it may be preferable. You could also manual create additional observations and alter their value if you think some of the training data is missing some events.  I would consider this really to be more of a Bayesian approach to training data, having the larger training sample is more of the norm.    Embed Quote
