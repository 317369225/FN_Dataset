★When I model logistic regression on my train set it works, but when I do it on the test it fails. The variables are the same. What is the problem?
Based on the answers here I'll write something that might help you. Do the following to process your data: First remove the variable you are trying to predict (put it in a vector) Also remove IDs put them in another vector. Combine training and test sets (rbind in R). Do all the processing you need in the combining set, convert to factors, calculations, add features, drop features, etc. Once you are done split the set in train and test as you know how many rows you had in each from start. Then use the train set to create your model and you should be able to predict the test set without any problems. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
