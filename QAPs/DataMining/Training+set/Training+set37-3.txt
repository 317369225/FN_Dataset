★When training and testing data sets, is it possible to test a complete different data set from the training set?
Well it depends on what you mean by completely different. Most models expect that all your data has the same number of features (ideally they should be the SAME features). However, as long as there are the same number of features, you can throw whatever data you want into it. Just don't be surprised to get random/horrible results. If you mean something like the same type of data that belongs to another set, then that might be good to validate your model to see how well it generalizes. But if this is the case, I suggest you make your training set a combination of subsets: one from each. This is more likely to produce a better model.    Embed Quote
