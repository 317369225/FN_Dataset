★Why should PCA only be fit on the training set and not the test set?
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique which finds "important directions" (basis vectors which capture most variation of the data) inherent in the dataset. It projects data points into these basis vectors to obtain a low dimensional representation of the data points. Now, if you use test data also to find these basis vectors, and then project training data over these vectors and learn some classifier, you'll be using test data also to learn a representation for the training data, which is not the common practice. Also, such an approach won't have any real world application (unless you use Online PCA and some semisupervised online classifier)as in real world application you won't have test data beforehand.    Embed Quote
