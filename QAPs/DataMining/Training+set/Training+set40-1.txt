★Do you have a model train set around your Christmas tree? If so, what gauge are you running?
I started out with a Lionel O-27 set, a "Seaboard Express" with a C&O 4-4-2 atlantic steam engine and ome other Chessie rolling stock.  I then added a double track HO scale loop to that,  which usually hosts an Acela or some other commuter train, and  a Conrail freight of some kind.   the smaller trains have  wider diameter  than the O scale set,  even using O-36 curves. One year, I even built a "branch line"  along the well to a mini christmas town terminal,  and used an NJ Transit U34CH and push-pull coaches to handle that traffic.    It was a lot of fun!    Embed Quote
