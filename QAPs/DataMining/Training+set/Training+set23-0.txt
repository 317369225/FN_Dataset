★What are good ways to decide hypothesis function for NN having non-linear training set?
I separate the answer to two parts. As for the error, it should represent the meaning of the error in your domain. In classification the error is Boolean. in regression the distance from the actual value is important. As for the extraction of the weights, your network structure is not clear. Do you have a single node all inputs directly connect to it? In many cases, when the structure of the function is simple you can derive the values using math (e.g., as done in linear regression). The weights will be more accurate and you'll now for sure that the weight you got are the most suitable for the function you choose.    Embed Quote
