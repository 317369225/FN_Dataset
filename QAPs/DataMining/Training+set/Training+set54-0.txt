★Assuming a sufficient amount of training set data, memory, and processing speed, what are some examples of situations where the "magic predictive box" idea of neural networks fails?
When you have an input space where similar inputs can have very different outputs. For example, predicting where a double-rod pendulum will end up at specific points in time. Most problems can be solved using neural networks given sufficient amount of training data, memory, and processing speed, but for many problems, that could be a few trillion training examples, exabytes of memory, and 10 CPU-centuries on the fastest CPU we have now. That makes them not a good candidate for neural networks, when other techniques can solve them using a tiny fraction of those resources.    Embed Quote
