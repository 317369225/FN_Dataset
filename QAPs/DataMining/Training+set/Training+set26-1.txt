★How can I optimize parameters of SVM (gamma and cost) for prediction on multiple training sets build from a parent set?
Use Grid Search along with Cross Validation to optimize the parameters for the best model. For a K-Fold cross validation your entire training set will be divided into K equal parts. Once for each part, it will be treated as validation set and the remaining (K-1) parts combined as the training set and with the range of values specified for your grid search, it will try to find the best model out of the possible models it creates . In R , you can use tune.svm for finding the best model : tune.svm(training, as.factor(training.classes), kernel="radial",                      gamma=seq(0.1, 0.9, len=9), cost=seq(20, 50, len=5), probability = TRUE, tunecontrol=tune.control(cross=5)) gamma will be kept in the range of 0.1 to 0.9 and cost will be kept in the range of 20 to 50 while 5-Fold CV is performed to find the best model out of the possible models.    Embed Quote
