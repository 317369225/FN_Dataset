★Why should PCA only be fit on the training set and not the test set?
I dont see a problem if you have enough data. PCA is not a classifier but in some setting learning on full data may produce some biasness. Firstly, we are not seeing the labels. Secondly, we could even include data outside of the train or test set. What I really want to focus on here is that if I see it as a feature learning process, i would learn features on random data. But atleast for PCA we cannot do that as training on random data does have some problem in representation related to alignemnt. But in general feature representation paradigm i would/could use random data. Which would mean other random data might even be from different or same distribution which may or maynot be test data.    Embed Quote
