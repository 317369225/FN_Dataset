★When I model logistic regression on my train set it works, but when I do it on the test it fails. The variables are the same. What is the problem?
You don't give much detail, so it's hard to say. First, it isn't clear what you mean by "fail".  If you mean the code doesn't run, then there is some problem in the code.  If you mean that results that were significant in the training data are not significant in the test data, then the most likely possibility is that you overfit the data - that is, you have too many variables for the size of the data set. To get more helpful advice, please specify things such as what your data are, the sample size, the number and type of variables, and so on.
