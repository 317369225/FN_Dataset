★What are some useful ways to combine text and numerical features in a training set for a machine learning algorithm?e.g. if you have numerical ratings as well as text reviews for movies. How can one create a recommender system which combines text and numerical rating ?
This question reminded me of D. Blei's paper:Page on Princeton There is a similar case: movies reviews and their (numerical) ratings are a learning dataset. However, there is a different purpose, because you ask about recommender system, while in the paper the authors concentrate on rating prediction.  But still, this is a way of combining text with numerical features and what's more you can find a code for that here: CRAN - Package lda    Embed Quote
