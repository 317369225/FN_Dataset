★In a support vector machine, the number of support vectors can be much smaller than the training set. How can this feature be useful?
This is useful in the practical sense that during prediction you need to do fewer computations. Contrast this with a naive implementation of k-nearest neighbors algorithm - you need to compute similarities with all points in the dataset for a prediction. So if you training dataset has 10k points, you are looking at 10k computations. With a sparser output, you don't have this problem with SVMs.    Embed Quote
