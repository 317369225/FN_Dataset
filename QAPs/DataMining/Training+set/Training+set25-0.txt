★Do you dedupe training data when building an NLP training set for text categorization?
I generally would not dedup because that is where you are obtaining the evidence weight to place them in one category or another. You may not have enough training data to be able to separate the practice from the non-practice area because of the way the data is coming in.  You might be able to sample what you are given so that at least you are starting with a 50/50 practice/non-practice split.   I see what you are trying to do, but unless you have some way to compensate for weighting in your algorithm, you will end up with a skewed classfication.    Embed Quote
