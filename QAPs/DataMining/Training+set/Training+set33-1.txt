★Will Naive Bayes give a good result if the training set is much smaller than the no. of features in a machine learning classifier?Training set is of the size = 1000 and no. of features are reaching close 100,000. Will Naive Bayes give a good result or should I look into any other algorithm to build a multi-class classifier?
Yes, it might work. Make sure the following is true before you use Naive Bayes: 1. The fields are all Nominal. Ordered and Numeric Data do not work with Naive Bayes. 2. One might find many zero values of probability if the sample is small, make sure there is a default value for zero probabilities. You might need to modify the priors if the classes are not balanced. Other methods I would suggest to try: 1. Apply a classification algorithm after a dimensionality reduction algorithm if possible. So first do a PCA and then apply SVM/ Neural Nets/ Random Forest.  2. Use a domain specific kernal in SVM as suggested in some other kernel. It has the same effects of doing dimensionality reduction and then classification.    Embed Quote
