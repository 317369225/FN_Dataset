★Is the training set for spam detection universal across users for major e-mail clients?For instance, if I mark a message as spam, does that get added to a training corpus that classifies other users' emails? Or does each user have an individual training corpus?
User feedback -- e.g. the "Mark as Spam" button -- is one of the most powerful signals for driving an anti-spam system, but suffers the key shortcomings that 1) it is unreliable, 2) it is sparse, and 3) it is late.  1) As Richie points out, some users are much more reliable judges of "spam" than others. The reasons for the flakiness are manifold, from users not understanding what constitutes "spam" ("that e-bill notice from American Express is so expensive so I'll call it spam!"), to users clicking the wrong button, to users intentionally gaming the system (e.g. punishing a competitor). Given that, a vote from an individual user must be weighted appropriately before a generalized conclusion can be made. 2) It is sparse: The vast vast vast majority of messages receive no label data either way. As a system cannot rely solely upon the user votes and must extrapolate beyond that, any given vote may be counted a little or a lot in the global classification. 3) It is late: Because of this very reason, spammers will often attempt to deliver their messages in one big burst. This means that, by the time the first user votes, thousands of messages may already have been delivered. Large-scale players like Yahoo may be able to retroactively remove these offensive messages, but for many users the damage will be already done. That said, many systems (Yahoo included) will maintain an individual-level block list, so that even if your vote is contrary to the global classification, at least within your account a subsequent message should be handled appropriately.    Embed Quote
