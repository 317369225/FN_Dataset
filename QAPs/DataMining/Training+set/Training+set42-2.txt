★In machine learning, is it better to train your model iteratively across several training/validation sets or is it better to just include all the data in your training set the first time and feed that through the model and why?
I can't speak for everyone, but this is how the process goes for good NLP work: Have three sets of data: A training set - make your model A development set - tune your model A test set - try your model on it. DONT go back to the first step once you've tried it on your test set or you risk significant bias. These data sets should be distinct and as large as you can make them. There are methods in ML used in NLP that use iterative methods in developing the model (MCMC), but you should still have an independent test set to try your model on to see if it's good once it's developed.    Embed Quote
