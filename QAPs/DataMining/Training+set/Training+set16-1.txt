Started doing German Volume Training recently after 4 years of lifting, and the pumps are insane. I often raise the difficulty and will superset two exercises hitting the muscle from different angle doing 10x10 on both. Insane pumps, especially love it on my back day doing wide grip pulldowns supersetted with reverse narrow grip pulldowns. Haven't been that sore in a while, a great alternative after doing typical 3x10 training with high volume for a while. Not sure on the mass gains as I'm looking to maintain at the moment.    Embed Quote
