★What is the best way to create a training set for machine learning?Traditionally it is assumed that there is a training set that someone would use for machine learning. I'm interested in a methodology or design techniques for the construction of training sets. How can I quantify that the training set is good?
The training data should be as close as possible to the actual data that you expect to see. You should avoid using a biased subset of possible training examples because then your trained classifier will probably perform poorly on the rest of the input space. The amount of data you need depends on the complexity of the concept that the machine is trying to learn.  Ideally, use a large, pre-labeled set of data.  For example, if you were trying to predict weather, using historical training data that was already labeled would be great. You can also find a wide variety of labeled data sets here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/da... If this is not possible, the next best approach would be to label data by hand. For handwriting classification, for example, you could take many samples of handwritten text and have a human label them. The downside of this approach is that it is time consuming.  You could  outsource this to a Mechanical Turk-like service or build a game that produces labeled training examples, if it is worth the effort. If the algorithm interacts with users, you could collect user feedback (e.g. was the machine-learned 'recommendation' accepted or rejected?) to further build up your training data set, if your privacy policy allows you to do so.It's difficult to go more into specifics because I don't know exactly what kind of data you are trying to collect.  Can you elaborate on the situation?    Embed Quote
