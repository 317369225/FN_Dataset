★In classification, how do you handle an unbalanced training set?In some cases, you have a lot more examples of one class than of the others. How do you tackle this problem? What are some gotchas to be aware of in this situation?
If you are looking to use a Support Vector Machine for classification, you may consider using the Twin SVM which is suited to unbalanced datasets. @Twin Support Vector Machines for Pattern Classification The objective is two find two separating hyperplanes, each of which is closer to points of one class and far from points of the other. Predictions on test points are computed based on the distance from the two hyperplanes.    Embed Quote
