★Could all the sentences from a single book be used as a training set for machine learning or a neural network?What could be fed into it?  And, what would you get out of it?  Would the sentences need to be enriched with metadata, if so what?
It has been done before. But as Matthew Lai has pointed out you need categories. I tend to believe more is needed than just categories. Categories can give a general understanding but experience will actually let you understand what and how things work in the real world. Some keywords and names in the field of  Cognitive Linguistics are frame semantics, categorisation theory, framenet, wordnet, Charles Fillmore, Eleanor Rosch.    Embed Quote
