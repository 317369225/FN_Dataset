★I am getting a 100% accurate result on randomForest model in R for loan default data even when my training set and test set are completely non-overlapping. I am using abt 8 parameters/features for training the model. The model gives me ntree=1 and mtry=1. Is there anything wrong with 100% accuracy?
Sounds suspicious to me. Is it real data or simulated? If simulated then the simulation is too simple. To investigate further I'd try: 1) Use a simple tree based model e.g. tree. Is this also very accurate? Look at the tree generated to see how it made predictions. Any variables highly predictive? 2) Examine the variable importance reported by the random forest. Which variables does it rank highest? Plot these against the column you are predicting. Let us know how it goes! Andy    Embed Quote
