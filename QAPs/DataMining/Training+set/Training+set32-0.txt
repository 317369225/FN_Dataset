★Could all the sentences from a single book be used as a training set for machine learning or a neural network?What could be fed into it?  And, what would you get out of it?  Would the sentences need to be enriched with metadata, if so what?
It could be fed in, but you have to decide the purpose of feeding it in before you feed it in to any algorithm. What are some things you could do? Build a system that generates sentences similar to the one in the book (see, for example, Mark V Shaney). Build a classifier that tells if a new sentence is by the same author or not (this can be made easier by feeding in books not from this author as well). If the book has different section/speakers/authors and label the metadata, you could learn to classify them apart. If you add metadata about particular sentences being suspenseful or emotional or angry or touching, you can characterize each of these in terms of characteristics of each sentence.    Embed Quote
