★Why does the predict function in the OpenCV CVSVM classifier not work 100% on the same training-set?
Because such is the nature of the problem. To elaborate, say you have some data where the variable you wish to predict depends on some other variables. But there is some noise in the way this relationship manifests itself or the relationship is such that the data is not separable by whatever "surface" your hypothesis generates. An example would be if you would imagine a square with red dots on side of the diagonal and blue dots on the other. Now I introduce an element of error by stating that for every blue dot produced in the blue region, I produce one red dot.(and do the same in the red region). You see that the best you can do on this problem is with a 10% error (unless you somehow grossly overfit). This minimum error is the Bayes error rate and can be produced by a classifier that is a straight line across the diagonal of that square. Anything else would be overfitting.    Embed Quote
