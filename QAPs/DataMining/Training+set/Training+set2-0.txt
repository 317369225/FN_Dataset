★Can the validation set be larger than the training set?For example, if size(test data) is known and fixed, and size(test data) >> size(training data), then having a large validation set will better mimic the testing scenario.
Yes it can be, however you will incur larger bias when fitting your models on the training data. This may or may not be an issue depending on how large your feature set is. The larger your feature set, the more training samples you may need to fit your models with low bias. However, if your dataset is highly variable, you may wish to increase the size of the validation set.    Embed Quote
