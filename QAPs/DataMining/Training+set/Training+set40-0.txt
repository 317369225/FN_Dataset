★Do you have a model train set around your Christmas tree? If so, what gauge are you running?
I'm sure that will look fantastic Joseph! I just purchased one for my nephew! I think he is going to love it. 30-4218-1 O MTH RailKing 4-6-0 Steam Passenger R-T-R Train Set w/Proto-Sound 3.0-Christmas Hopefully he will treasure it for years to come! I think its time that we bring back all the good simple fun traditions that once were! :)    Embed Quote
