★Are there any good composition algorithms that directly work on waveforms of songs as the training set?
The most feasible way would be to first extract midi data from the audio signal. Recognise chords using one of the following methods: This is probably the state of the art approach - a Recurrent Neural Network is use to extract chord information from audio signals. A close second is using a HMM to do automatic chord recognition. This is code another approach using a Deep Belief Network. Here are more approaches from MIREX 2014 Audio Chord Estimation ResultsYou can also recognise melody using this method that had the best performance on MIREX 2014. The output of chord information and/or melody information could be fed to an RNN-RBM as midi which in turn can generate music. I don't know if anybody implemented the entire pipeline as of now. I might have a go at it myself. It is a very interesting question.    Embed Quote
