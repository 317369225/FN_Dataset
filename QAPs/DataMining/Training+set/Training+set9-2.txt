★What are some useful ways to combine text and numerical features in a training set for a machine learning algorithm?e.g. if you have numerical ratings as well as text reviews for movies. How can one create a recommender system which combines text and numerical rating ?
Simply use a vectorizer to convert your text into a bag of words representation (using binary features, word or n-gram counts, frequencies or something more complex like TF-IDF) then add another column (that contains scores) to your bag of words vectors. In scikit, vectorization can be done in many ways. For example, with TfidfVectorizer: sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer - scikit-learn 0.14 documentation To add a new dimension to your vectors, in numpy this can be done with hstack: NumPy v1.7 Manual (DRAFT)    Embed Quote
