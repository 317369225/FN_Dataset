★What are some useful ways to combine text and numerical features in a training set for a machine learning algorithm?e.g. if you have numerical ratings as well as text reviews for movies. How can one create a recommender system which combines text and numerical rating ?
Instead of adding your numerical rating as another column, have two levels of similarity computation. If you combine numerical rating with text vector space, the huge number of text dimension could mask your numerical score. For example, if the vocabulary size is 10000, then the numerical score would be just one among 10001, and this could lower its impact on final score.  So I would suggest you to first compute similarity based on text and combine that similarity score with numerical score to get the final score. This would give you the control to tune weights of individual features.    Embed Quote
