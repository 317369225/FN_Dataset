★What are 'Train Sets' and how do they function?During the Indian Railway Budget speech, the Rail Minisiter has said ".....it is proposed to introduce a very modern train system called train sets. These are similar to bullet trains in design and can run on existing tracks without an engine to haul them...". What are these train sets and how do they function.?
What constitutes a train set ? A train set is a fixed formation train. This includes trains with Distributed Power, such as the Shinkansen or the ICE. It also includes loco hauled trains, such as the early TGV, where the train had a loco at each end, of course painted like a coach. So technically an LHB formation with two WDP4s in push-pull mode, equipped with Locotrol or wired MU, is also a train set. We failed to peddle it as a viable trainset - low cost, high capacity and "already available". Why EMUs or DEMUs are not deemed as train sets? EMUs and DMUs are technically trainsets, but used in suburban services. Normally a train set would denote an Intercity kind of a train. But, that is just a default definition. EMUs, MEMUs and DEMUs are still train sets.    Embed Quote
