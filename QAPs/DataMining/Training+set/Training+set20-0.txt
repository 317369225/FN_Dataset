★Can a one-year-old play with a Brio train set?
Theoretically, a one year old can play with BRIO. The child will at least enjoy holding the train engine. By 18 months my children could push a train along the track, but with many derailments. The train accidents gradually stopped as my children got older. By age 4 my oldest could do everything on his own and have the most fun. Along with Lego, Brio trains are the longest lasting toy in our children's room. It is very nice having a toy like this, because it helps you to understand your child's development when you see her go from just holding and chewing a train car to designing and implementing complete train layouts.    Embed Quote
