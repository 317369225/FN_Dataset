★How to modify classification algorithms such as SVM and NN with backpropagation to handle covarite-shift problem, assuming we have the density ratio between test set and training set?
If your SVM or NN implementation supports class weights (this is the case for libsvm which is wrapped in scikit-learn for instance), then you should be able to compute covariate shift correction class weights using a logistic regression model as explained by Alexander Smola in this blog post:   http://blog.smola.org/post/41102... Disclaimer: I have not tried it myself and I am not knowledgeable on the subject but I guess that reading the paper cited in the comments might help if you want more details.    Embed Quote
