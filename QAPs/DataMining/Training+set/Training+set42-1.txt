★In machine learning, is it better to train your model iteratively across several training/validation sets or is it better to just include all the data in your training set the first time and feed that through the model and why?
it depends on the algorithm for an traditional SVM classifier, this would have no effect this is true of any convex method, up to round off / numerical errors what you are describing is similar to a  transductive SVM and this might affect the convergence of this or any non-convex method (deep learning / neural network  as well )    Embed Quote
