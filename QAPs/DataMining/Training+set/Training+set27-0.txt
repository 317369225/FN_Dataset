★When establishing a ground truth for machine learning, how does one determine if it is a sufficient training set?A ground truth data set is typically used to train, analyze, and compare changes to a filtering algorithm; How important is it that the training set covers all or a majority of possible data scenarios?
The two most common measurements of error are known as bias and variance. High bias means that your model doesn't predict your training set accurately. High variance means that your model predicts your training set, but not your testing/holdout set. When you have high variance, adding more data will help reduce that problem. When you have high bias, adding more rows of data is not useful. You need to try adding different features. Adding more data is not the only solution. Many strategies to reduce bias end up increasing variance, and vice versa.
