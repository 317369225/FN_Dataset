★When training and testing data sets, is it possible to test a complete different data set from the training set?
The assumption of training and testing models using a partition is that both sets are representative of the population. If the test set is significantly different than the training set, what you are doing now is known as extrapolation. That is, say you fit a polynomial to a bunch of points in the interval . What does this really tell you about what the polynomial should do in the intervals and ? The extrapolation performance of a model depends heavily on the assumptions made and in general is a very difficult problem.    Embed Quote
