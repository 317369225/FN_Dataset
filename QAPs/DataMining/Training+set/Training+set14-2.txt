★Logit Regression: What's the purpose of testing sets and training sets?I was looking at a logistic regression video and its talking about making a testing set and training set. I don't know what their purposes are. Its a logit regression vid using health data, but does this happen often in economics or any other field?
Because data are noisy.  When you run a regression, you get a model that fits the data as closely as is possible.  But the model you find isn't necessarily the "true" population model.  Your fits may have been influenced by noise in the data.  Or you may have included variables which aren't actually correlated to the response variables, but they still have some degree of correlation in your sample because of noise. When the model fits to noise instead of signal, you have overfitting.  You validate on a second data set because it can tell you if you've overfitted your model.  If the model is reasonably predictive on the testing set, your model isn't severely overfitted.  If your model doesn't work on the testing set, you probably don't have a good model.    Embed Quote
