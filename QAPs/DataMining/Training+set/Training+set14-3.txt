★Logit Regression: What's the purpose of testing sets and training sets?I was looking at a logistic regression video and its talking about making a testing set and training set. I don't know what their purposes are. Its a logit regression vid using health data, but does this happen often in economics or any other field?
Training and testing sets are used for model validation. Out of your entire data set you randomly choose some portion of the population for training to build your model, then you can validate your model by  getting the predictions on the remaining observations called testing set. Generally the proportion 70:30 for training and testing sets. Basically the idea here is to do an insample and out of sample test to check the validity of your model.    Embed Quote
