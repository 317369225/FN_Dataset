★Logit Regression: What's the purpose of testing sets and training sets?I was looking at a logistic regression video and its talking about making a testing set and training set. I don't know what their purposes are. Its a logit regression vid using health data, but does this happen often in economics or any other field?
To prevent overfitting.  You optimize your algorithm with one set of hyperparameters on the training set.  You choose the best hyperparameters on your development set (e.g., regularization parameters).  But how well will this work on totally new data?  That's what the test set is for.    Embed Quote
