★What is the most ridiculous scientific hypothesis?
In my humble opinion, there arent such thing as ridiculous scientific hypothesis In science we must to proceed experiment to eliminate all hypotheses that show "wrong" and no one knows with is good and with is bad. Pre-judgemments are bad for this process and criticizing ridiculous hypothesis after the test is easy ... If scientists could decide that hypotesis is ridiculous beforehand, it would never be tested and we wouldn't learn something. My last point is that many discoveries (or ideas) were considered ridiculous and it took some years to have their value recognized.    Embed Quote
