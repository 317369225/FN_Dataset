★What is the Red Queen's Hypothesis?See related: What are some criticisms of Matt Ridley's book The Red Queen?
The Red Queen's race is an incident that appears in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass and involves the Red Queen, a representation of a Queen in chess, and Alice constantly running but remaining in the same spot. It is used in evolutionary biology to illustrate that with evolution, because everything is constantly evolving, the competition is continuous (you never win) and you're also not really going anywhere. It's just continuous and aimless change - with hilarious consequences (see Giraffes).    Embed Quote
