★Is the Big Bang hypothesis theory or belief?
Theory and hypothesis have different meanings in science. In colloquial use, "theory" means what "hypothesis" means in science. This seems to cause some confusion for people who haven't been educated in the sciences. You often hear the phrase, "Well, this is only a theory..." What they really mean is, "Well, this is only an hypothesis..." So, ideas start out as hypotheses, and if the available evidence supports the hypothesis, then it can be tagged as theory. This is the case with the Big Bang Theory. But you have to understand, few things can be "proven" to 100% certainty. There is always the possibility, indeed, the likelihood of new knowledge coming to light. So, is the Big Bang Theory a "belief?" Yes, in the strict sense of it being believed because of the preponderance of evidence. It is not a belief in the sense of a faith. Those types of beliefs are accepted without any evidence, or even in spite of contradictory evidence.    Embed Quote
