★How true (if at all) is the Petrodollar hypothesis?
as far as I think the hypothesis is correct, that's how US has been able to hold dollars as the global currency. if u notice US dollar note says that "its a legal tender", nowhere have they mentioned "to pay", hence making it a fiat currency. had they actually printed curreny against reserves then the note would have read "I promise to pay ..." and also the kind of politics used by USA (levying embargo on Iran for trading in currency different from dollars). if they dint do it and all the countries would trade in local currency, they there would be no reason for countries to have reserves in dollars, that would deflate the value of dollar and lead to HYPERINFLATION in USA. I strongly believe in existence of petrodollars hypothesis, and also that its a world accepted fact! (Though off late countries like China have decided to buy in local currency from Russia coz of volatility in dollars)    Embed Quote
