★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
There are 3 forms of the EMH: Weak Form: Prices reflect all past publicly available information. Semi-strong Form: Prices reflect all past publicly available information and instantly reflect all new publicly available information Strong Form: Semi-strong form plus prices reflect all insider information as well. The strong form has the most evidence against it. Both weak and semi-strong forms have mixed evidence. My take: misinformation also masquerades as information, market pundit opinions also influence decisions to create inefficiencies. EDIT: I think I have the biggest problem with EMH in the definition of the ambiguous term 'Information'.  Information comes from human sources, and as a result is subject to interpretation.  I simply do not believe that information hits the market and has its full effect immediately.  People digest the information, analyze it, change their minds, react to the reactions of other players, etc.  It's like a bell - when struck, there is a loud noise which reverberates before dying out.  I believe what EMH classifies as 'Information' has the same effect on pricing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eff...    Embed Quote
