★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
The notion of falsifiability is usually related to claims about the physical universe that are testable, at least in principle. If a claim--even one about the physical universe/multiverse is not testable even in principle it is held to be nonscientific. Philosophy and religion make other sorts of claims, and the falsifiability truth-test does not apply well to them. That does not mean they are true--or false. If this kind of question interests you--where and how science, philosophy, and religious belief intersect, and don't--it's the subject of my blog on Quora called Ad Lapidem.    Embed Quote
