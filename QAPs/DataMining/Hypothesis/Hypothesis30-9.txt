★Do you believe in the hypothesis that suggests that God himself is Satan in disguise?
None else other than God or satan can answer this question. I mean it. The more you make others talk on this, the more you will get confused, if you are serious. My suggestion : Ask God, if he is there, he will reply.    Embed Quote
