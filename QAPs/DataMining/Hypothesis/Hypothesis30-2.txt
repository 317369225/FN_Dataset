★Do you believe in the hypothesis that suggests that God himself is Satan in disguise?
I'm not Christian but I was educated in a Christian school and I studied biblical texts for one of my classes in college. The thing to consider here is free will. God doesn't stop humans from sinning. God gave us the the free will to decide whether to do good or evil. Satan never wanted humans to have free will in the first place, which is what led him to rebel and be cast out of heaven. His role now is to tempt people into sinning and trick them into forgetting that they have free will, which gets them damned and therefore sent to his domain upon death (aka under his rule and control). By that logic alone I can't see God as Satan in disguise because their views on mankind contradict each other.    Embed Quote
