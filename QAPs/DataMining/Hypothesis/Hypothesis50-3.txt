★Is the unfalsifiable hypothesis of "dark energy" the secular equivalent of fairy dust?Isn't belief without evidence typically considered irrational? It's interesting to note, that the Bible explains at least 17 times that the heavens are expanding, and that God "stretches them out like a curtain." I wonder how those ancient primitive people could've known such things with such un-coincidental certainty?
Don't lie. It is a lie to talk about things you have not cared to even study. If there was no force counteracting gravity we would eventually expect gravity to pull everything together into a singular mass. This has not yet happened, and is not happening - instead, the universe is being pulled apart. This is the evidence of 'dark energy' that you haven't even cared to study. Speaking frivolously about such things is insulting to those of us who actually care about what is true. Christians, being emotionally invested in the Bible, are not interested in what is true: they will say anything and everything in the interests of defending it. They will say that day does not mean day, that stone does not mean stone, that genocide does not mean genocide, that unclean does not mean unclean. And they will say that Genesis, simply by having a beginning, is a prophecy of the Big Bang, and that a simple mentioning of curtains somehow equals all the thought of all the people truly interested in cosmic inflation. You can find Muslims lost to the same nonsense about the Koran. Again: don't lie.    Embed Quote
