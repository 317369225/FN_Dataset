★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
Even if markets did have perfect (or more likely equal) information, at the end of the day more of the volatility in stock prices comes from multiple expansion and contraction rather than earnings growth (or lack thereof). The appropriate multiple to pay for any given stock is open to a significant range of differing views, beliefs and assumptions. The view setting the marginal price of an equity shifts over time and there is a game-within-a-game with investors/speculators attempting to guess what multiple everyone else will be willing to pay for a stock. John Maynard Keynes said it elegantly: "It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgement, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks is the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligence to anticipation what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees." So if there is no concrete view on how stocks should be priced and there is an ongoing guessing game about what everyone else is thinking, I am not sure we have the grounds for an efficient market.    Embed Quote
