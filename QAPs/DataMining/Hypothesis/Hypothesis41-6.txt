★Everyone has a hypothesis about why autism is so prevalent nowadays. What is your hypothesis?
I am going to sound like a conspiracy theorist but I believe that modern society is creating many things including Autism and Cancer. The world has become very reliant on drugs for everything, many things being completely unnecessary - some drugs be administered as prevention like the flu jab, or holiday shots. I don't take anything of these things, in fact when I have a headache I just usually lay back, relax and the headache is gone. When I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes I opted to change my diet as opposed to taking tablets everyday and my tests are always normal. So to Autism, there is speculation of links to the MMR vaccine, but for every test that shows a link there will be 20 commissioned by the pharmaceutical companies rubbishing the links - it was the same thing with thalidomide in the 70's. Often we cannot avoid being giving drugs that we don't want like fluoride in our water supplies, preservatives in our food, so it becomes even more difficult to understand where the source of disorders and illnesses are coming from but as long as we continue to just accept processed foods, needless injections, pointless tablets and poisoned water we'll never know if our lives are being shortened or our children's lives are being destroyed. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/healt...    Embed Quote
