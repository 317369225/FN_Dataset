★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
Evolution has been proved over and over again.  The people who create all this hue and cry about evolution only "being a theory" are people who don't understand it. Further, to date not a single fossil has been found in the wrong place or wrong strata. Haldane when asked what could disprove Evolution, stated - "Rabbit fossils in the precambrian".  Every year thousands of fossils are unearthed. Even one of them in the wrong strata could bring down the entire theory of Evolution. I would strongly recommend the book The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins. It is an amazingly written book and will render you with a (almost) complete understanding of Evolution.    Embed Quote
