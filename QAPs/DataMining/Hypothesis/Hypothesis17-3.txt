★Does the God hypothesis violate causality?By definition itself, God is eternal and has always existed. The creator was never created, he has simply existed. We do think in terms of cause and effect, making it difficult to understand that the Big Bang had no cause. How did we end up synthesizing an entity that violates the same? Please be free to point out mistakes in my premise.
Very well answered already: all that I have to add is that causality is a human construct imposed on the universe to help us try and make sense of things. The universe is not inherently divided up into galaxies, or stellar systems, or planets or billiard balls or atoms; it's just a vast collection of stuff with a myriad of things going on inside it all the time. For our convenience it makes sense to separate it into bits and pretend that they are more or less independent of each other, so we can talk about one event involving one object 'causing' another event involving other objects, but from the universe's perspective it's all part of one huge ongoing process. 'Cause' is not part of the universe as such; it's a product of a limited human viewpoint.    Embed Quote
