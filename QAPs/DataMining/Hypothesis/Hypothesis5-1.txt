★Is Singularity a fact or just a hypothesis?
The singularity is a concept. There are multiple theories about how and when it will occur. Common among them is the idea that there will be a convergence of multiple technologies that will compose an intelligence. Core to this is the belief that computer systems will continue to improve their ability to improve their own code in numerous disciplines. At some point in time these systems will become better at improving their own code than humans. Once this comes to pass, the speed of improvement will accelerate at an exponential rate. At some point in this process the abilities of the resulting intelligence will be far more powerful than humanity can control or understand. There are numerous groups working on various theoretical models in an attempt to formalize how the resulting intelligence will function and the nature of the technology platform that will support it. Since the concept is at the theoretical level many assumptions and vagaries are included in the models. Then there are the bottom up efforts to create synthetic intelligence, identify how our brains function, nanotechnologies and others that will be the technologies that converge. The complexity of the various technologies and how to integrate them is well beyond us today. But we are unraveling the mysteries at an increasing rate. There does exist the possibility that a key discovery could be made soon that could vastly accelerate our progress. It is also equally possible that many aspects will remain unsolved for a very long time.    Embed Quote
