★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
Saying something is "only a theory" shows a misunderstanding of what "theory" means in a scientific context.  In everyday speech, people use the word "theory" to mean an idea that has not been proven, but that is not how the word is used in science.  A scientific theory is an explanatory model that describes some aspect of the natural world and has been repeatedly supported by observation and experimentation.  The colloquial use of the word "theory" is closer to a scientific hypothesis.  Calling something a "theory" does not mean it has not been proven.  As others have said, gravity, germs, atoms, and relativity are all still called theories even though they have been proven, or at least have a huge amount of supporting evidence.  There is nothing in science "higher" than a theory. Evolutionary theory contains many facts that have been proven, or at least have so much evidence behind them that it would be foolish to think that they are not true.  It is a fact that all known life on Earth has descended from a common ancestor, it is a fact that natural selection can result in adaptation, etc.  There is a lot of debate as to how exactly evolution works in certain instances, but certain facts are accepted by all scientists.  If you want to know more about evolution and the evidence supporting it, you should read Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne, or The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins.    Embed Quote
