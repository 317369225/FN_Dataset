★What is a scientific hypothesis?
A hypothesis is an explanation of an observed phenomenon based on nothing more than the speculation of the observer.  It doesn't require proof.  The step after making an observation is forming a hypothesis.  After you construct a hypothesis you'll need to start testing it.  Hypothesis means the same thing to scientists as it does to everyone else.  "Theory" is a different story though.  "The sun crosses the sky because it wants to catch the moon" is a hypothesis.  With some testing that will be disproved.    Embed Quote
