★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
What evidence, beyond simple conjecture, has anyone shown for any of it? Every piece of "ancient alien" theory I have ever seen has followed the same pattern  " ... something I cannot explain ... if this were so ... and if this were so ... then wouldn't it be possible that ... YES!" Every one (that I have ever seen) has conjured up about 15 (okay, that's a bit exaggerated) pieces of conjecture to support one baldly stated "possibility".  None of them has ever come out with any evidence to show that any part of it is backed up with any facts what-so-ever.  These things are always (again, that I have ever seen) the "god of the gaps" fallacy to its maximum extent.    Embed Quote
