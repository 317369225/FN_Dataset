★Earth Science: The Gaia Hypothesis: genuine scientific hypothesis or pseudoscientific nonsense?
The modern hypothesis, due to Lynn Margulis, is that the biosphere is not homeostatic but homeorhetic.  That is, the active self-regulation is limited and catastrophic events reset the equilibrium at irregular intervals.  There should be no further discussion of Lovelock's discredited view as we have plenty of evidence of catastrophic disruptions in the geological record, e.g. replacement of methane by oxygen atmosphere by blue-green algae, many major extinctions since, ice ages.  Questions about how human collective action or belief alters the patterns of response or equilibrium are separate.    Embed Quote
