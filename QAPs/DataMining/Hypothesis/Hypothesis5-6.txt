★Is Singularity a fact or just a hypothesis?
The Singularity concept refers to the future, so we can't call it a fact.  You could call it a theory, but what the theory states varies among various thinkers. See http://yudkowsky.net/singularity... Various statements of the Singularity concept: 1. Technology  will move forward faster and faster. 2. There will be a smarter-than-human AI, and soon enough a vastly-smarter-than-human AI. 3. We don't know what that smarter-than-human AI will do, because it will be smarter than us. Of course, it is impossible to predict the future exactly, but we can state theories about what is likely to occur in the future; and, we can make our preferred future happen!    Embed Quote
