★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
The ancient Egypt, since it rose as a civilization, until it was conquered by Alexander, lasted for about 3000 years. After that, it continued as an independent Hellenic kingdom until it was captured by the romans, and it kept a national identity, in spite of being controlled by several empires (Rome, Byzantium, Ottoman, French, English...), and now, 5000 years later, it is one of the richest cultures in Northern Africa. So regarding the question of "what happened to those civilizations", there is that. 5000 years. The USA exist for 1/20th of that. No country in Europe exists for 1/5th of that. That civilization was able to protect itself. For 5000 years.    Embed Quote
