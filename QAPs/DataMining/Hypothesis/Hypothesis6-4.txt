★Is the multiverse a theory or a hypothesis?
A hypothesis must make a statement that can be proven false.  A theory is an explanation that is supported by a considerable amount of evidence. A multiverse is neither one.  It's only a concept, and it's a pretty poor one. I say it's a pretty poor one because the universe we live in is called the universe because it includes the totality of all known or supposed objects and phenomena.  Everything you might imagine to exist in a different universe is actually included in the totality of all known or supposed objects and phenomena.  Therefore, everything you can imagine is part of our own universe.  There is only one universe and it includes everything that possibly exists.    Embed Quote
