★What is the most ridiculous scientific hypothesis?
Andrew Wakefield hypothesized that autism is caused when a vaccine strain measles virus from a shot ended up on the colon, where it causes an infection that causes a break in the gut wall, which allows the virus to travel through the bloodstream to the brain, where it causes autism. Lots of things wrong with this.    Embed Quote
