★What is the aquatic ape hypothesis?What is the AAH and how is it relevant to evolution as we understand it?
Some of the most convincing arguments are the human characteristics which conventional evolutionary theory either ignores or has no coherent explanation of: Bipedalism (walking on two legs), loss of body hair and our body fat distribution.  If you consider an early ape/hominid which had fur and walked on all fours most of the time, the environment most likely to result in its walking on two legs and losing its body hair is a semi aquatic one, where individuals live up to their waists or necks in water most of the time. They'd stand on their hind legs in deeper water and their fur wouldn't keep them warm in water so they'd evolve a layer of fat under the skin (like seals).  If you look a newborn human baby and compare it to a newborn chimpanzee you'll see what I mean.  Conventional evolutionary theory has no coherent explanation as to why they look so different.  The Aquatic Ape Theory does.    Embed Quote
