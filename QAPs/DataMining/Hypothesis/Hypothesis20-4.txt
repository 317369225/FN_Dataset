★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
Look at it this way, the nearest star that science currently speculates might have an earth like planet and support life is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25,000 light years distant. Any civilization capable of traveling that kind of distance  would have to be incredibly technologically advanced far beyond our current comprehension. So what are the chances that they would make that type of journey just  to work with a group of primitives  to build a bunch of stone structures that serve no real purpose other than to impress the locals? As well, all that construction and not a single advanced piece of technology left on the job site? Not an alloy bolt, not a precision saw blade, not even the equivalent  of a Coke can. How likely is that. Most of the construction techniques of the ancients have been explained and generally boil down to a bit of ingenuity and a whole lot of sweat and manpower. Let's face back in the days before television and XBox  the populace needed something to occupy them. Massive civil projects like pyramids kept everyone busy.    Embed Quote
