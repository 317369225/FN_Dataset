★Is the unfalsifiable hypothesis of "dark energy" the secular equivalent of fairy dust?Isn't belief without evidence typically considered irrational? It's interesting to note, that the Bible explains at least 17 times that the heavens are expanding, and that God "stretches them out like a curtain." I wonder how those ancient primitive people could've known such things with such un-coincidental certainty?
You have some serious confirmation bias.  That is, anything in your holy books that by coincidence isn't completely and obviously wrong is un-coincidental certainty.  You ignore things that reflect what the authors actually thought - the sun standing still, pi = 3, the age of the earth, the flood that didn't happen, etc.    Embed Quote
