★How can a theorem or conjecture or hypothesis be proved to be unprovable?
You assume it to be provable and you bring out a contradiction. Godel's proof simplified. He produced a statement which looks like "I am not provable". If it were true, we are done It is not false, it is provable. This is a contradiction The beauty of Godel's proof lies in coming up with a formula which refers to itself, within Bertrand Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica. In fact, when these paradoxes were troubling Mathematicians, Bertrand Russell had claimed that this system is free of self-referencing. Kurt Godel had demonstrated this in Principia Mathematica and promised to show it in related systems too(any system adequate for number theory). Although he never gave a proof, people believe that he is right.    Embed Quote
