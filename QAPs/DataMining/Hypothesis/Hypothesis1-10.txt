★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
A different and perhaps helpful take: EMH or at least some limited interpretation of it (Joel Askey has a a good summary of various approaches above) has been accepted by federal courts with respect to securities regulation. Probably the best illustration of this is the theory of "fraud on the market (FOM)," articulated most prominently in the case of Basic v. Levinson. FOM is the idea that specific reliance (e.g. reliance on a specific fraudulent statement) is not necessary to establish a claim for securities fraud by an investor because any fraudulent statement would immediately taint the entire securities market, as the EMH posits that market prices will reflect all currently available information (including the fraudulent information).    Embed Quote
