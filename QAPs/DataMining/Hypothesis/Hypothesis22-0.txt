★Is the utility maximization hypothesis unfalsifiable?
I disagree with the premise. Economists don't think utility functions or utility maximization are "real." People just act as if they are utility maximizing, so it's a good model of behavior. There is just a good mathematical theorem that says that if people satisfy certain reasonable choice axioms, they act as if their behavior is governed by a utility function whether or not that function is a real object which is measurable. A source of contention is whether the axioms are reasonable. The first is that any two items in the world are comparable. You either prefer one to the other or you are indifferent between them (pretty reasonable). The second is a bit more slippery: transitivity. If you prefer A to be B and B to C, then you prefer A to C. This may not be true as you may prefer Blue to Red and then Red to Green, but you may prefer Green to Blue. This is not too troublesome, because in most situations preferences are found to be transitive.    Embed Quote
