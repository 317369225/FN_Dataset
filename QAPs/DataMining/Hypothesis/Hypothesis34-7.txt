★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
Some specific depictions of God may be able to be falsified, if stated in the proper format. For instance, the postulate "There exists an entity who created the universe 6000 years ago" is easily falsiiable, because the universe is older than 6000 years. The postulate "There exists an entity who created the Universe" with no other claims ... probably not. But because it is not falsifiable, it is not a hypothesis.    Embed Quote
