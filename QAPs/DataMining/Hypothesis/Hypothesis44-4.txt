★What do you think about the mathematical universe hypothesis?Recently I read a paper by Max Tegmark about hypothesis that the whole universe is a mathematical structured. If everything really exists, it should be simple and beautiful. 1st. paper [gr-qc/9704009] Is "the theory of everything'' merely the ultimate ensemble theory? 2nd. paper [0704.0646] The Mathematical Universe
I shall answer from a philosophical perspective which I believe best answers the question. If you consider that the human 'brain' is a computer, then the 'reality' constructed by the 'mind' is a computation. The senses differentiate incoming signals received from a universal whole, then the mind integrates the resulting symbols back into a reality. Reality is thus a computation (representation) - there is no reason to imagine that whatever underlies the measurements from which our realities are constructed is also computable (and there will never be any way of determining this.) Our senses make measurements; measurement is contingent upon identity (things) and ratio (relative proportion); identity and ratio are the arche of mathematics and computation. Therefore, 'reality' is and always will be a computation. 'Reality' (the representation) must, however, be distinguished from that which it represents. (In eastern philosophy this may be referred to as 'Tao' or 'Dao' or 'Sunyata', Anaximander called this 'Apeiron', nowadays this may perhaps translate to 'nothingness' or 'emptiness'. I prefer the term 'Actuality' - thus 'reality' is the map and 'Actuality' the territory.)    Embed Quote
