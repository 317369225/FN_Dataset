★Is the multiverse a theory or a hypothesis?
I see what everyone else is saying here but I would like to add that I saw a documentary a while ago (found it on youtube sorry cannot remember what it was) And it covered this topic with some evidence one of the physicists had that showed what could possibly be an outside influence on galaxies inside our own universe, these said galaxies were moving in a way that was contradictory to what they should be doing as though proximity from a large mass beyond our universe was influencing them. If I ever find the video again and I will look I will post a link here.    Embed Quote
