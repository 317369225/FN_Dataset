★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
In addition to what everyone else has said, the distances between the stars are ENORMOUS.  The closest star to our Sun is Proxima Centauri, and that's over 24 trillion miles away.  You'd have to find a way to transport living beings over those distances, with ALL of the air and water they'd need to survive, carry or produce ALL of the food they'd need, AND carry enough fuel to power the life support systems on their space craft, leave their home planet, enter Earth orbit, and get back out.  On top of that, these people would have to travel that distance in a short amount of time relative to their expected lifetimes.  To put how unlikely that is into perspective, it will take the Voyager 1 space probe almost 72,000 years to travel that distance. Honestly, basic physics means that the alien astronaut theory is, well, the stuff that comes out the back end of a bull.    Embed Quote
