★Do you believe in the hypothesis that suggests that God himself is Satan in disguise?
I am not a Christian and I do not believe in any of the Abrahamic religions. In the east, the concept of god and devil (or evil) is not one that exist outside but inside in your mind. Look at your mental defilement, like anger, hatred or greed, or positive forces like love and compassion, these are not given by any external gods or devils, but are embedded in our mind, but it may have been embedded there through external contacts. But, the big but is, only you can get rid of it, not through any external gods or devils. Your mind is in fact the root cause of your happiness or suffering.    Embed Quote
