★Mathematics Research: Is the continuum hypothesis true?https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...
This is a good question. It's the first of Hilbert's 23 Mathematical Problems of 1900.   Hilbert expected that it could be proved, but that's not the case. It is known that set theory with or without the continuum hypothesis is equally valid.  That is to say, it is independent of ZFC, (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice). Thus, there is a model in which it is true, and there is a model in which it's false.    Embed Quote
