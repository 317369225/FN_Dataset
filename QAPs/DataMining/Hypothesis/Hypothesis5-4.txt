★Is Singularity a fact or just a hypothesis?
The concept of AI being a "singularity" is trying to acknowledge that there is a barrier beyond which we cannot predict the significant changes that will occur because of AI. This is a prediction based on the history of other technical advances. For example, when people were first tinkering around with steam engines, a lot of people envisioned a world just like their own, but horses were exchanged for steam. Some pepole thought the effect of steam power would be limited to creating horseless carriages.  but I think very few accurately predicted the massive social upheaval that came from steam engines. The industrial revolution was, in its own way, a singularity event. This prediction is also based in part on people predicting wild, utopia-like changes from some invention, and completely missing the bad outcomes. Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite, predicted that when both sides of war had enough dynamite, they would be able to annihalate each other in a second, and that people would recoil with horror at the idea and "disband their troops".  What Nobel did not forsee was mutually assured destruction leading to an arms race to accumulate more and more weapons, rather than disbanding them. The point of the singularity is to look at past major technological advances and to get that people are unable to predict the full effect of such an advance. And then take that and apply it to the as-yet-not-invented technological advance that is AI.    Embed Quote
