★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
Interstellar distances are incomprehensibly large. No, really, I mean huge. We don't even have a word for it. The probability of an alien civilization coming here at some time in the past is practically zero. Do the math on the distances to even nearby stars and then pick a speed you believe an alien civilization could reasonably attain. Divide the first number by the second. Take a look at the number in the calculator and let it sink in for a while. FTL is a fantasy. Relativity has been verified to high precision over and over. We toss around the fact that it is theoretically possible to get arbitrarily close to C, but we're only talking about a fistful of protons in a supercollider. That already takes as much energy as a small country. When our ETs have to get a large vehicle packed with other ETs and all their stuff, it becomes extraordinarily unlikely they could get to even 10% of C. Let's face it, even 1% is unlikely for anything big enough to put enough  ETs and fuel inside for a journey that is going to be hundreds of years with even the most generous assumptions. More likely it is thousands of years. So, if our ETs are smart enough to cross interstellar distances, don't you think they might have something more compelling to teach us than just how to pile rocks into a structure whose only purpose is that it  won't fall down?   I mean really? Nothing that might actually improve our lives. No math, no science, no metallurgy, no engineering, no health sciences. Just a bunch of big rocks.    Embed Quote
