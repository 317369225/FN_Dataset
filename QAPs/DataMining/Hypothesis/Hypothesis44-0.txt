★What do you think about the mathematical universe hypothesis?Recently I read a paper by Max Tegmark about hypothesis that the whole universe is a mathematical structured. If everything really exists, it should be simple and beautiful. 1st. paper [gr-qc/9704009] Is "the theory of everything'' merely the ultimate ensemble theory? 2nd. paper [0704.0646] The Mathematical Universe
It's sort of vacuously true, in that there is no positivistic way to see that it is false, or true. It's just a statement without content, unless you specify the size of the computer more precisely, and then it becomes testable. For example, if you say the universe is a computation of size the cosmological horizon area over the Planck area (or some reasonable multiple of this), you get a contradiction with quantum computing. If you say the universe is "structures ZFC set theory" you get ambiguities as described by forcing. You need to be more specific to make it a hypothesis, rather than an empty statement.    Embed Quote
