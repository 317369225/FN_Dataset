★Is the unfalsifiable hypothesis of "dark energy" the secular equivalent of fairy dust?Isn't belief without evidence typically considered irrational? It's interesting to note, that the Bible explains at least 17 times that the heavens are expanding, and that God "stretches them out like a curtain." I wonder how those ancient primitive people could've known such things with such un-coincidental certainty?
Bible explains at least 17 times that the heavens are expanding, and that God "stretches them out like a curtain." I wonder how those ancient primitive people could've known such things with such un-coincidental certainty? So what are you proposing? Psalm 104:2 , in one of a list of quite lyrical adulations, describes the inflation of the universe? That's a pretty far 'stretch'(pun not intended) Even in the bible itself, this does not seem to be a comment on how the universe was created or works, at all. But let's assume it was, for a moment. Religious notions on physical events are not directly related to scientific discoveries, they originate differently. To make it clearer, I would like to refer to my answer to The Big Bang: Does the Big Bang theory prove that God exists? If yes, how so?    Embed Quote
