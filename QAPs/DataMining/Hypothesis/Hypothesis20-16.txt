★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
whats really strange is that most answers seem to say because we understand pyramids there cannot be any substance to an ancient aliens theory, Yet there are many things built back then that defy/defied modern builders, buildings in south america nigeria, nazca lines, pyramids everywhere, sphinx, easter island, working street lamps found in the atlantic, ancient nuclear fallout sites etc the list goes on. There is more to our history than we are made aware of and a few ancient religions were based on the ancient alien belief (sumerian)  and even if you follow an abrahmic based religion, it still implies that elohim and or nephilim came from the heavens, (the sky) not from another dimension as most now believe heaven to be. Plus the ancient aliens theory would answer some pressing questions I have about genetics (as I am sure many have) such as The missing link? Where the genetic material needed to start the evolutionary cycle came from? Where the neanderthal gene came from? and Why many people around the world dont posses it? Also is the knowledge that we dont contain much genes (humans) especially when compared to what is supposed to be our closest ancestors? I heard there are leaves and fruit with more complex genomes than us the supposed pinnacle of evolution While this is not my personal belief system it is worthy of discussion at least as worthy as all the other creation myth and beliefs. I cannot claim its validity in any way, I do think its a very interesting hypothesis    Embed Quote
