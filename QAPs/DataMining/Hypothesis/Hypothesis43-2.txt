★In 20 random studies that reject the null hypothesis with a p value of .05, will one of those studies (on average) erroneously reject a true null hypothesis?
No. In the real world, it is much more probably that none reject a true null, because 1) The null is never exactly true and 2) In real studies, the null is rarely even approximately true. Further, if we assume the null, then, by that assumption, all of the nulls are true so all of the studies erroneously reject the null. However, if you collected a whole lot of data on people, and randomly chose 20 pairs variables test (is hair color related to social security number? Is IQ related to whether you live on a street or an avenue? etc) and then found that all 20 studies had p = 0.05, then your conclusion would be correct.    Embed Quote
