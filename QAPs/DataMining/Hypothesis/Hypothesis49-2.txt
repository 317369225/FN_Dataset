★How can a theorem or conjecture or hypothesis be proved to be unprovable?
Goedel is famous for his Incompleteness Theorem.  The thing that Goedel proved was that there is  no consistent system of axioms  is capable of proving all truths about the relations of the natural numbers (which is arithmetic). Specifically, Russell and Whitehead wrote a mathematical treatise (Principia Mathematica), a set of axioms and proofs, that was claimed to be so complete as to be able to create every single true statement about numbers.  Goedel proved that it could not by using the framework to create the equivalent of the statement "This statement cannot be proven in the Principia Mathematica framework.". Since if this statement were false, then it would mean the statement could be proven, which mean the statement would be true, a natural paradox. Therefore, the original statement must be true, which means that Principia Mathematica and all other math frameworks cannot prove this truth, and are by definition incomplete.  He did not prove or disprove any hypothesis other this one: "For any such system like Principia Mathematica, there will always be statements about the natural  numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system."  His theorem says there will always be true statements that cannot be proven in a given system. Therefore, no math system is complete in that no math system covers all true statements about numbers. Goedel's work cannot be used to show that a conjecture is unprovable. He only showed that it is possible that the conceptual framework in which you are working with your conjecture may not be complete enough to prove or disprove it. Just as an aside, I feel this question is more related to the p vs np problem than Goedel and his incompletness theorem. I do not think Goedel is related to this question.    Embed Quote
