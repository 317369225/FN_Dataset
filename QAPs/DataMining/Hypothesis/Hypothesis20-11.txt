★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
In ancient days there were no 'economic' restrictions. Rulers and emperors just did whatever they wanted, un questioned by any one. Achievements were driven by want and not by need. Sadly, sometimes even the architects had their hands or fingers after they delivered, so that their marvelous work cannot be replicated. They had their 'novel' ways of achieving those marvelous architectural feats. E.G.A few kilometers long ramps with a very gradual elevation to move heavy stones up to the top of a temple, or grinding one stone (suspended so as to reduce the force required to twist it) on top of another to achieve that perfect fit between them so that there are no gaps.    Embed Quote
