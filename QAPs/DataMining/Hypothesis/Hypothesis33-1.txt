Mathematics Research: Is the continuum hypothesis true? In mathematics, an hypothesis is - by definition - something that looks true, walks true and quacks true … but is yet to be formally proven true. Had it ever been proven (or its negation) true, it would have stopped to be called an hypothesis and would move to the room of the theorems, etc. In this case, one can intuitively devise sets whose cardinality would be (strictly? aha) between the integers and the real numbers - the rational numbers come to mind - but can you nail a proof?
