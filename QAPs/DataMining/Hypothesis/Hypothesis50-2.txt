★Is the unfalsifiable hypothesis of "dark energy" the secular equivalent of fairy dust?Isn't belief without evidence typically considered irrational? It's interesting to note, that the Bible explains at least 17 times that the heavens are expanding, and that God "stretches them out like a curtain." I wonder how those ancient primitive people could've known such things with such un-coincidental certainty?
Knowing nothing about physics, I'll cover this from another angle to the brilliant answers below. The great thing about science is that it is self correcting. If it turns out to be a blind alley (or 'fairy dust') science will find a better hypothesis and test that. People often point out that science was wrong about this or that in the past, but then fail to realise that it was *also* science that found it out to be wrong. That is it's strength. Compare this with religious dogma where fundamentalists have to stick what was randomly thought up a several thousand years ago, and stick to it in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary. To answer the question in your detail - "Isn't belief without evidence typically considered irrational?" - You'll probably find that although a lot of scientists may be strongly invested into the idea of dark energy, if it was dis-proven (by scientists - see??) then they wouldn't try to burn them, or make them recant their position, or whatever, but would gradually be convinced by this new evidence. It's not so much a belief, as a favourite hypothesis.    Embed Quote
