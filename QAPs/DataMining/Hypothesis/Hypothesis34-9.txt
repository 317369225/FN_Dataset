★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
In some senses - here's three: 1.  Christians and/or Muslims could be faced with new archeological evidence contradicting Jesus and/or Muhammed's place in their religions.  This obviously does not falsify God directly. 2.  We could encounter an alien species who is the creator of the universe.  Assuming they could convince us that they did it.  This also doesn't falsify God, but gets closer. 3.  A place in the brain could be isolated that correlates with God belief.  If it could be manipulated to be turned "on" and "off", then I think people would question the existence of a real God.  Again, not a straight falsification, but a major challenge for theists.    Embed Quote
