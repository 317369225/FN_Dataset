★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
1. we don't know 2. we don't know 3. don't believe anyone who know. (until there is solid evidence) 4. study the subject(s) yourself. And do not come with an explanation. You are referring to a forgotten High Civilization that is gone. It is a tantalizing theory. Very dangerous to scientists, because the moment you say "Atlantis" you are doomed. Same thing is when you say: "Extra terrestrial." you are doomed. But really, we do not know. There is magic when you read about the ancient sumerians. That is all I can say.    Embed Quote
