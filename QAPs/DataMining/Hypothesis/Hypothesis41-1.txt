★Everyone has a hypothesis about why autism is so prevalent nowadays. What is your hypothesis?
I don't believe it's any more common than it's ever been. It's just that now we are more aware of its existence and more adept at diagnosing the symptoms, whereas before an autistic person would have just been considered stupid or an unusual savant. Though I also think there may be a lot of misdiagnoses going on. Autism, especially the high-functioning variety, seems very easy to misdiagnose. I believe that in the future there will be a pushback against Autism diagnoses the same way there was with ADHD.    Embed Quote
