★What is the most ridiculous scientific hypothesis?
There are plenty of wild ones, for sure.      Feynman had a partially-developed theory that assumed that the Maxwell equations had both solutions going forward in time and backwards too.  The math kinda worked out well for a while, and showed promise of explaining some otherwise puzzling things, like radiation resistance.    But it's on it's face, very "Wacky" as it suggests that every photon knows where it is going, exactly, eve if that destination is billions of years in the future, and is in your eyeball, where you haven't even evolved yet.   You see, really wacky. Another guy actually tried experimentally measuring this effect-- he set up a microwave dish and swung it across the sky.. The idea being that if the dish is looking at a relatively empty section of sky the dish should have a slightly higher radiation resistance, as there's fewer atoms out there telling the dish what its resistance is.       Unfortunately that was before it was known that there were so many hard to see galaxies out there.   He didn't see any difference, and now we know he wouldn't, because even if you can't see the galaxies they're still out there and your dish "knows" that. Can't get much wackier than a dish knowing what's out there, faster-than-light, but that's built into the theory.    Embed Quote
