★What is the aquatic ape hypothesis?What is the AAH and how is it relevant to evolution as we understand it?
The aquatic ape hypothesis holds that a direct human ancestor spent a large portion of its time in the water. The evidence to support this hypothesis is as follows: Body Fat: There are three clades of mammals that store fat subdermally (as opposed to to intramuscularly like a marbled steak). They are cetaceans (whales and dolphins), pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses), and humans. Body hair: There are five clades of mostly hairless mammals (we are covered in small hairs). Cetaceans, hippopotimidae, rhinoceridae, elephantidae, heterocephalus (naked mole rats), and humans. Two are aquatic, two are enormous, one is subterranean, and then humans. Those two points alone beg some serious thought. The difficulty is that finding fossil evidence is problematic, as any fossils would be underwater from rising sea levels. The majority of hominid fossil finds are in dry areas (there are VERY few fossils of our jungle bound chimpanzee ancestors, as wet environments make not fossils), so the preffered narrative is one of savanna-walking.    Embed Quote
