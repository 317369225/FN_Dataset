★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
If you've ever used a minimum price filter when shopping (i.e. show me notebooks priced between $650 and $1000), then you accept the efficient market hypothesis. More seriously, it's not a question of whether you accept it, it's a matter of whether there are low hanging fruit or if the tree is already picked bare. If every investor turned to indexing tomorrow, then there would no longer be the activity in the market that brings prices to their correct value, which means that even trivial effort would get you above market returns. On the other hand, if everyone tries to find undervalued stocks, it is a zero sum game. You'd expect the equilibrium to be where the effort of finding undervalued stocks roughly matches the returns you can gain by finding them. At this point, you'd get roughly equal returns from an index fund or by attempt to pick the winners (after accounting for your costs of the latter). Some people would do better than average, some worse, and a lot of variation would be driven by luck. Warren Buffet has continued to show good returns after rising to prominence due to his stock picking skill (i.e. he isn't just lucky). He's either skilled at picking companies to buy or skilled at increasing their value after he buys them. I suppose for completeness it's theoretically possible he's just skilled at cooking the books.    Embed Quote
