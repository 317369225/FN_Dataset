★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
The Efficient Market Hypothesis is generally accepted by those who do not know how to invest or have failed at it. A very long list of traders conclusively prove this hypothesis wrong.  You would not find them debating this point in Quora or anywhere else.  They are too busy making and enjoying their fortunes.    Embed Quote
