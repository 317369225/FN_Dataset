★How accurate is it to characterise atheism as a null hypothesis?This question is a follow up on the discussion on Mark Harrison's answer to Which position has the burden of proof: atheists or theists? As the title puts it, how accurate it is to characterise atheism as a null hypothesis? Is there something that is missed by this characterisation?
No, atheism is not a null hypothesis, because that refers to the the absence of differences in populations or the assertion that a hypothesis of fact is predicated on sampling or experimental error. Atheism is a catch-all description of a a variety of non-theistic metaphysical explanations for the world and the nature of our being. They range from stridently anti-theist to casual nomological explanations for the world around us. Simply taking for granted that the world and life exist due to natural action rather than the intercession of a omniscient and/or all-powerful being, God, the invisible friend who comforts many people who don't or cannot face the fact that we are alone, except for ourselves and the world, on whom we actually have to depend. Atheistic thinking does not involve dismissing phenomena as statistical aberration, which would suggest there is nothing to argue about, rather it is a active and positive form of engagement with reality without recourse to a supernatural "get out of jail free" card in philosophical arguments.    Embed Quote
