★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
The 80s saw a huge number of pseudo science writers including Erich Von Daniken advancing these theories of the limitations of human labor and technology. Despite the huge following, they were refuted and debunked as trashy science. I went through this phase during high school with avid interest, devouring all the pulp that was being put out. I wanted to believe these weird theories with dubious photographic explanations of Mayan astronauts discovered in stone carvings. It took me a few years to dismiss them as nonsense. Human history is filled with lost knowledge before the advent of comprehensive recorded history post Gutenberg. If you do see the need, you may want to study other possibilities that can explain why these structures were man made before looking for God and/or Astronaut for explanation. Unless you also believe in UFOs and Area 51. In which case, have at it.    Embed Quote
