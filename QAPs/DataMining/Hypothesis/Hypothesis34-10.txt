★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
It is possible. For example, if some aliens came and showed us enough evidence that they were the "God" of Abraham and "God" of Jesus. Showed us everything humans has experienced, and showed us the movies of evolution from billions years ago to today and shows how world was created and explained all things. Then the concept of God was pretty much falsified. Or if we invented a time machine, we maybe able to check whether Bible, Jesus, Moses, Adam, Eve, etc. were true. Or if the life after death is real, we may be able to falsify the God in many religions. But that will be in a different world. But other than these unusual things, I don't think we can falsify God.    Embed Quote
