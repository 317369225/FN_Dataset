★Earth Science: The Gaia Hypothesis: genuine scientific hypothesis or pseudoscientific nonsense?
A challenge with the Gaia hypothesis is that to first evaluate its claim, you have to take on board a lot of system dynamics. The ideas of self-regulating feedback loops and homeostasis is grounded in system dynamics and control theory. Its ideas about stability and instability is getting more mainstream though, with the now frequently mentioned "tipping points" of climate science.   When you have a background in SD, the gaia hypothesis seems neither outrageous nor spiritually mysterious IMHO. "Of course there will be self-regulating feedback effects" you might say. "Scribble a cause-and-effect diagram at random and half the loops will be self-regulating!"   There's also the issue of marrying SD and evolutionary theory in the gaia hypothesis. Evolution has produced homeostasis in our own bodies, but I've got trouble applying natural selection to Gaia, as there seems to be only one 'organism' to select on.    Embed Quote
