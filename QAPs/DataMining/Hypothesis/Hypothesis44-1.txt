★What do you think about the mathematical universe hypothesis?Recently I read a paper by Max Tegmark about hypothesis that the whole universe is a mathematical structured. If everything really exists, it should be simple and beautiful. 1st. paper [gr-qc/9704009] Is "the theory of everything'' merely the ultimate ensemble theory? 2nd. paper [0704.0646] The Mathematical Universe
The Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) says that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. That would mean that you can mathematically define some kind of structure and list axioms for that structure so that the universe is a model of that mathematical structure.  Not only that, but everything about the universe (not just some aspects of it) would be captured. When Euclid axiomatized geometry in the Elements, he was doing that, but only for certain aspects of the universe.  Archimedes did that for certain aspects of statics in his Law of the Lever.  Scientists throughout the ages did that for more and more of the physical world.  Science progressed for centuries uncovering the laws of nature. In the 19th and 20th centuries it became evident that science doesn't do just that.  Science makes models of certain aspects of physical reality, and those models aren't necessarily exact.  When Newton wrote his Principia in the 17th century, it was generally considered that he was writing about reality, but in the 20th century, after Einstein's theory of relativity, Newton's theory became a model of reality that worked well in many situations. The MUH revives the idea that physical reality can be modeled perfectly by an abstract mathematical structure, and, therefore, physical reality is an abstract mathematical structure. Is the MUH correct?  I'm skeptical.  The last 200 years experience in science gives evidence that it's not correct.    Embed Quote
