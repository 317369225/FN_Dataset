★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
This is what I find interesting. As silly as the Ancient Astronaut Theory is, Considering it is pure speculation with absolutely no evidence to back it up, it is not nearly as silly "God" as described in the bible.    Embed Quote
