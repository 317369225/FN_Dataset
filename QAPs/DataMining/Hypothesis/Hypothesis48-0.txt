★Why do we call it the Riemann "Hypothesis?"
Most of these things are just traditional.  For whatever reason Hilbert's zero-locus theorem is always referred to by its German name, the Nullstellensatz, whereas for instance the Hilbert Basis Theorem is referred to by its English name when writing in English.  Fermat's Last Theorem was called "Fermat's Last Theorem" for hundreds of years while it was still a conjecture.  And so forth.  "Bertrand's postulate" was known as a "postulate" when it was a conjecture, and then also after it was proven. Sometimes you can see a bit of the reason why something might have started out that way -- e.g. in the second case it was the last of Fermat's claimed theorems not to have been proven.  The Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that was proposed because of its consequences, not because of any intrinsic interest in the result itself, i.e. it was proposed as a hypothesis of an argument about the distribution of prime numbers.  That at least explains how someone might have come up with the name.    Embed Quote
