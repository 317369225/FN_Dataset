★Is continental drift a hypothesis or a theory?
It's both. It started as a scientific hypothesis. When physical evidence supporting and confirming its predictions was discovered, then it became a theory. Do not confuse the layman's or colloquial use of the word theory (a guess) with the scientific usage of the terms, a verified explanation of a physical phenomena.    Embed Quote
