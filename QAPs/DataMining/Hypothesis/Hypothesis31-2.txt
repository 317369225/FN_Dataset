★Could anyone explain the Riemann Hypothesis in simpler terms?
The Riemann Hypothesis simply states that all the non-trivial 0s of a certain function have a solution with the real number part equaling 1/2. Now for some explanation. This 'certain function' is called a zeta function, which Euler discovered a long time ago, and it's very interesting. What Riemann did was he used the zeta function in another function of his that described the amount of prime numbers up to a certain limit. Mathematicians had been trying to find a function like this since Gauss. Riemann found out that while his other function could take in complex numbers, he only got the answers he wanted with real numbers. He hypothesized that all the solutions to this equation would be real, not imaginary. His function took the real number n and fed it to the zeta function as 1/2 + i*n. He also needed the zeta function to spit out 0 at 1/2 + i*n, so his hypothesis that his other function would only do something useful with real numbers meant that those useful spots would occur when the zeta function was fed 1/2 + i*n and spat out 0. The zeta function has other 0s, like at the negative even numbers (-2, -4, etc) but the are deemed 'trivial' compared to the zeros that look like 1/2 + i*n because those 'non-trivial' zeros (according to the hypothesis) give us solutions to Riemann's other equation which calculates the amount of primes. That's why they're so interesting. Please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is mostly right.    Embed Quote
