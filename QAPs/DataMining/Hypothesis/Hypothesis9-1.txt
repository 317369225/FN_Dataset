★What is the Riemann Hypothesis (in brief)?
The Riemann Hypothesis is a statement about the locations of zeros of a certain function.  That function is called the Riemann Zeta Function, denoted , where is a complex variable.  For , the function is defined as Through a process called meromorphic continuation, one can extend this function to an analytic function on *almost* the entire complex plane .  The exception is that has a (simple) pole at (NB: the series above does *not* give the definition of on the rest of the complex plane.) It turns out that is zero at every negative even integer.  These are the so-called 'trivial zeros'.  The Riemann Hypothesis is simply the statement that all of the other zeros of are on the so-called critical line .  (It is known that all of the other zeros are in the 'critical strip', which is simply )    Embed Quote
