★Do you believe in the hypothesis that suggests that God himself is Satan in disguise?
To be frank, I (like you) believe in neither. But it sounds cool. It reminds me of the Administrator from Team Fortress 2, who makes announcements to events that happen in-game to your team. Outside canon has established it's the same lady making announcements to both teams, and she's just having a lot of fun playing them off each other.    Embed Quote
