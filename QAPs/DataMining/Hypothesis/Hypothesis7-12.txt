★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
Evolution has been "proved" as a theory, to the same degree that the theories of electricity or gravity have been "proved". The biggest problem is that such a large portion of the population is scientifically illiterate, and does not understand the difference between a hypothesis and a theory. Like any theory, evolution is supported by observation, and as new data accumulate, the theory itself will continue to evolve.    Embed Quote
