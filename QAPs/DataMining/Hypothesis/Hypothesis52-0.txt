★What is the definition of hypothesis? What is a good example of a hypothesis?
A hypothesis is just jargon for an idea: "Based on what I know, and the available evidence, I believe that such and such may be true". That's your hypothesis. Now go and test it and see if it immediately fails. If it doesn't, you might be on to something, if it does, back to the drawing board. That's how science moves forward. A few examples from physics could be the Higgs boson: Based on what we know about elementary particles, they should be massless. However, we observe that they have mass. The Higgs mechanism is a way of giving particles mass. If the higgs mechanism exists it will also produce a Higgs boson. Let's go and look for the Boson! We found it! Our hypothesis is at least partially correct, though may be revised at a later date when more tests are done. or dark energy/matter: Based on what we know about the universe and the laws of gravity (general relativity), the universe should be expanding at a certain rate. We observe that it expands at a much faster rate. If we assume the universe is full of a certain amount of dark energy/dark matter, we get the correct expansion rates. Let's go and look for the dark energy/matter! At present, we haven't found it, which could mean we haven't looked hard enough OR that our hypothesis is incorrect i.e. something else is causing the universe to expand in the way we observe it.    Embed Quote
