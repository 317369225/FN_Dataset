★What is the Riemann Hypothesis (in brief)?
The direct way to state the Riemann hypothesis is in terms of the Riemann zeta function. However, the reason Riemann introduced that function was to study the distribution of prime numbers, and we can state the Riemann hypothesis in those terms as well. It's well known that, picking an integer at uniform random between 1 and x, it is prime with probability "approximately" if x is large. Specifically, this is in the sense that the ratio between the probability and the approximation gets arbitrarily close to 1 as x gets arbitrarily large. (This is called the Prime Number Theorem). Therefore, in some shaky sense, an arbitrary number n has probability of being prime, and so, in some sense, we should expect the number of primes below x to be ; even better, we could replace the discrete sum with a continuous integral , which we give the name Li(x). The Riemann hypothesis concerns how good of an approximation Li(x) is to the number of primes below x; specifically, it is equivalent to the statement that the difference between these two is never more than some constant times . So the approximation error, measured as that difference, can grow as x increases, but, the Riemann hypothesis says, it can't grow too fast. (The exponent 1/2 there relates to the claim that 1/2 is the largest real part of a zero of the Riemann zeta function). Disclaimer: Not actually my area.
