★Everyone has a hypothesis about why autism is so prevalent nowadays. What is your hypothesis?
Some, maybe all, of it is identification.  My dad, a successful professional, manifests the traits that got me diagnosed.  My great-grandfather's brother was institutionalized.  He would have been called an idiot or imbecile.  In our terms, it seems like he was probably autistic.  Some of it may be things we do not fully understand.  The interbreeding nerds theory makes as much sense to me as anything else, which is not to say that nerds should necessarily stop.  We just have to make room for the offspring in society.  I wish I understood more.  In my own family, I think the cause is entirely genetic.  Dad and I had different environments through our mothers' pregnancies and our early lives.  We had different exposures, lived in different places, grew up in different kinds of communities.  His parents were probably fifteen years younger when they had him than my he and my mother were when they had me.  Besides genes, what is there?    Embed Quote
