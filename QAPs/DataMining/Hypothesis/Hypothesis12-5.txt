★Earth Science: The Gaia Hypothesis: genuine scientific hypothesis or pseudoscientific nonsense?
Margulis's hypothesis seems a lot more credible to me.  We've seen plenty of tipping in the past, and there's no reason to believe that the self-regulation of Earth's biosphere needs to take into account any particular species or biome.  It's pretty much been 'every biome for itself' in past when an ice age or atmospheric replacement came along.  In other words, we need the earth a lot more than it needs us.    Embed Quote
