★How true (if at all) is the Petrodollar hypothesis?
In 1971, President Nixon cut off the gold standard.This standard was created after WWII and basically said that the US will insure all US dollars held by other countries with gold. If a country wanted US dollars, they had to give the US an amount of gold equal to the amount of dollars they wanted, and that country could, at any time, return these dollars and retain their gold. In the late 1970s, several countries suddenly started trying to return US dollars and get back their gold. The US, obviously, didn't like this. President Nixon created the "Nixon Shock" by suddenly refusing to both take back dollars and give back Gold. This created a large drop in the value of the dollar, so, in an effort to prop up its value, Nixon created a deal with Saudi Arabia. If Saudi Arabia sold its oil in US Dollars, then the United States would protect Saudi Arabian interests and militarily advance the country. Eventually, other oil selling nations (OPEC) followed suit. Since most oil was sold in dollars, the value of the dollar was upheld. Now, if another nation managed to get THEIR currency to be used as the standard for oil purchases from OPEC, then their currency would rise. Thus, the "puertodollar war". Other powerful countries, such as China and Russia wish to use have their currencies used as the standard for oil purchases. Fortunately, the US Dollar is too firmly ingrained in this process but these other countries have not stopped trying. The growing demand for oil creates a growing demand for US dollars to buy that oil. Thus the value of the dollar grows. Please Upvote!    Embed Quote
