★Is the Big Bang hypothesis theory or belief?
By definition a hypothesis (or little theory) is not a theory. Like all empirical theories, the big bang theory gains its designation as a theory due to the number of other observations it helps to explain and the number of predictions it makes which are later confirmed. Hypotheses and theories are similar in that they are provisional and open to correction and refinement. Beliefs differ from hypotheses and theories. Beliefs do not require observational confirmation. Beliefs tend to persist even when observations contradict them or their predictions fail to be confirmed. Finally, beliefs are different from expectations. Like beliefs, expectations do not require observational confirmation. However expectations will fade if they fail to be reinforced by future experience. We call the process of fading expectations "disappointment." Beliefs tend to generate expectations that are often unrealistic. The hallmark of the unrealistic believer is resistance to disappointment. When believers show strong resistance to disappointment, they are said to have "faith." Much profitable confusion can be generated by mixing and matching these distinct concepts. This is because beliefs, hypotheses and theories all exist because of their explanatory power for humanlike consciousness.    Embed Quote
