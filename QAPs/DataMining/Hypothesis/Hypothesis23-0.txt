★What is the Riemann hypothesis used for?
The Riemann hypothesis is a relatively simple-seeming statement with a surprising wide range of applications. There is a significant body of work in mathematics that essentially consists of "if the Riemann hypothesis is true, then this other fact follows...". Wikipedia has a good list of implications (Riemann hypothesis), but the most significant one relates to the distribution of prime numbers. In particular, the error term in the prime number theorem (a theorem for predicting the location of prime numbers) is closely related to the positions of the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function. In fact, Von Koch proved in 1901 that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the best possible error bound on the prime number theorem. The linked article has more details about the various implications of the hypothesis, most of which relate to prime numbers.    Embed Quote
