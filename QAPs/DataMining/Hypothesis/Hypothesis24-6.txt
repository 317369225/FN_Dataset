★What is the null hypothesis: the existence or non-existence of God?
God is an axiom and religion is a theory. Atheists just don't buy a theory that presses itself to be the penultimate truth because the axiom is unnecessary for them. Still, they are thesis and anti-thesis at this point and both sides try hard to make themselves the original thesis. Unfortunately, the null hypothesis is that the term 'God' didn't exist. Theists will claim that haven't ever happened and atheists will point to agrarian society for the term to appear. I know where I stand, but beside that, it's up to how you'd like to believe and live with, as long as we keep our opinions in private and don't force it on other people.    Embed Quote
