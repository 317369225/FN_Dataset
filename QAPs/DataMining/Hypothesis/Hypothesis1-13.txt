★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
No one accepts the EMH. Just look at any of the crashes where stocks have lost over 10% of their value in a day. Is it even vaguely possible that the fair prices actually changed that much in a few hours? Of course not. You bring up Warren Buffett, but his fortune isn't really from stock market trading. He takes stakes big enough to have influence (often buying whole companies), and works to maximize the value of the investments. He's more like a shareholder activist hedge fund manager than someone passively investing in stocks. As I discuss in Jim Seidman's answer to What are the best arguments against efficient market theory?, the EMH is simply a useful working assumption for research. When a researcher sets up a hypothetical situation to model, it can be much easier in some cases to pretend that the EMH is true. But economists and financial analysts no more believe the EMH than physicists believe in the frictionless plane or Newtonian physics.    Embed Quote
