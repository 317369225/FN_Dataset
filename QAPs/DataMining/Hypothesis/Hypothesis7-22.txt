★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
Like gravity, which is still a theory but it has enough evidence behind it,  evolution is still a theory but there is enough evidence to back it up and prove it.    Embed Quote
