★In 20 random studies that reject the null hypothesis with a p value of .05, will one of those studies (on average) erroneously reject a true null hypothesis?
If we assume the null hypothesis - then yes the expected number of erroneously rejected null hypotheses, out of twenty, will be one. Edit: I am interpreting the question as inspecting the false positive count on 20 random studies of significance level .05, to which the outcome is unknown. On a second reading, it seems like the setup may actually be 20 random studies picked from a population of experiments that obtained a p value of .05 and rejected the null hypothesis. In which case there isn't enough to answer the question.    Embed Quote
