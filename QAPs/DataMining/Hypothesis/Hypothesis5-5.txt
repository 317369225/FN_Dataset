★Is Singularity a fact or just a hypothesis?
The so called Singularity has many definitions.  Oddly those who believe in it the most seem to have the most specific predictions for its overt effects.  For instance the 'uploaders' who assert that they will be able to convince others to let a robot claiming to be them inherit a beach house.  These people are no less ridiculous than 'Rapture' cultists and deserve the same overt ridicule and scorn. Vernor Vinge however came close to a formal scientific theory.  It was in effect that: 1.  Intelligence and observation and self-reference matter even to basic physical laws and mathematical coherence:  Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Goedel, Russell and Whitehead...the list goes on.  2. Accordingly, any vast increase in intelligence, observation, or self referential reflection must necessarily make all phenomena less predictable.  Or explainable by multiple coherent or proliferating theories.  3. Such increase has occurred with the Internet, will increase as it embraces all languages and cultures, spawns its own (in games, in social media, etc), and mutates commerce, politics and science. 4.  Emergent and overt collective and machine intelligence will be exponentially disabling of prediction.  That is, prediction becomes less and less likely to be proven correct after the fact as AI rises.  If only because AI rewrote the dictionary between prediction & result. 5. At some point in time predictions, probably varying based on the object of prediction, become so unreliable they amount to noise.  To predict becomes a worthless activity, or merely to persuade. Which might explain why Singularity cultists predict to persuade. :)    Embed Quote
