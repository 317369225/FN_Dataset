★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
Easy, all you'd need to do is give a precise definition of "god" limited in time and space, that's how the hypothesis could be MADE falsifiable.  One could also make predictions dependent on some sort of well defined hypothesis. The problem with god though is that as soon as the hypothesis is falsified, it's slightly modified to adapt to the falsification, of course, there's no direct problem with this, it just reduces credibility since it was supposed to be infallible (one example of this is evolution replacing creationism for every semi-intelligent person, and god being demoted to creator of the big bang or universe rather than life).    Embed Quote
