★Who will solve the Riemann hypothesis?When it's you, please call me and tell me how! Instant messenger is fine, too.
Someone, maybe not even an established mathematician. It's impossible to say who, as it's not something you do by following a procedure. Mathematics is as much about inspiration and genius as it is about hard work and study. The most likely are those mathematicians who are currently working on solving it, of which there are many.    Embed Quote
