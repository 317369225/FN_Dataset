★What is the null hypothesis: the existence or non-existence of God?
Neither. The null hypothesis is disbelief in any positive claim that has not been properly demonstrated to be true. "God exists" is a positive claim. So is "God does not exist". Ergo, neither is the null hypothesis. Suspending belief until you have enough evidence to make an informed decision is the null hypothesis.    Embed Quote
