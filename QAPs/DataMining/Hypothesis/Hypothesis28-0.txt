★Is the Big Bang hypothesis theory or belief?
Both.   Merriam-Webster gives the following definition of "belief", among others: conviction of the truth of some statement or the  reality of some being or phenomenon especially when based on examination  of evidence By that definition, all scientific theories are beliefs.  Of course, by other definitions they are not. Of course, no argument is advanced by making assertions without first agreeing on definitions.   But you can go endlessly around in circles if one party has one definition of "belief" in mind while the other party has another.    Embed Quote
