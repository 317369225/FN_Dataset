★Is the Big Bang hypothesis theory or belief?
Like all scientific explanations of how the universe came to be, the Big Ban Hypothesis is a theory, although a very popular one among scientists. The theory is by far the most prominent one in its field and has substantial evidence compared to all other theories (Big Crunch, Multiverse, etc.) and so is generally accepted by the scientific community as a starting point "assumption"; however, remember this distinction: the theory has not been proved completely, and probably will never be, considering the fact that you probably had to be there billions of years ago to be sure of what actually happened.    Embed Quote
