★Could anyone explain the Riemann Hypothesis in simpler terms?
The Riemann Hypothesis has the following elementary formulation: If you generate an infinite sequence of heads and tails by flipping a fair coin, then the difference between the number of heads and number of tails tends to be very small. How small? Well, if you look at the first k terms of the sequence, then no matter what k is, the magnitude of the difference is always less than a constant multiple of and always less than a constant multiple of  and in fact, always less than a constant multiple of  for any fixed . This bound is sharp in the sense that the magnitude of the difference can be as big as . For natural numbers n that are products of distinct prime numbers, assign n the label ``heads'' if n has an even number of prime factors, and assign it ``tails'' if n has an odd number of prime factors. The Riemann hypothesis states that this labeling is similar to the labeling coming from a fair coin described above, in the sense that if you look at the first k such natural numbers, no matter what k is, the difference between the number of n labelled with heads and the number of n labelled tails is less than a constant multiple of for each fixed .    Embed Quote
