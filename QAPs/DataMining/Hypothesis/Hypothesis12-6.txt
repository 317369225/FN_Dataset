★Earth Science: The Gaia Hypothesis: genuine scientific hypothesis or pseudoscientific nonsense?
Gaia is spoken of as if it has a mind and a will. That doesn't seem very likely. And if it did, what would it think?   I would regard it more as a comforting idea with a sort of romantic appeal, rather than a scientific theory.   To be a theory, it would have to be falsifiable. But how can you falsify it? It would be like trying to falsify the existence of God. It does not appear to be within the realm of science to prove anything either way.    Embed Quote
