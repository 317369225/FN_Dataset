★Earth Science: The Gaia Hypothesis: genuine scientific hypothesis or pseudoscientific nonsense?
If billions of varied cells can evolve and come together to form something called a human being, one that  is self aware, thinks and has imagination; what makes anyone think that the countless numbers of living things on the planet could not also have a collective consciousness? That Gaia is a real entity....a planetary consciousness.    Has it ever occurred to those armchair doubters out there, that all those plant and tree roots that exist all over this planet could very well be connected to each other? Just like neurons in the human brain. This would form a colossal collective intelligence with a memory far greater and living much longer than any human being. How this consciousness would actually appear or manifest itself might not be possible for humans to even notice. However, if Gaia is self aware (and it most likely is), it would take whatever measures in its' capability to protect itself. To protect all life on the planet. This would include life at the microscopic level and the macroscopic. The potential power of a unified collective planetary consciousness may be beyond our capacity to understand or conceptualize. Already Gaia may be making plans to strike back at whatever is destroying or destabilizing the balance of life on Earth.   What everyone fails to accept is, that if man believes it can create an Artificial Intelligence; that would eventually be superior to human intelligence, nature may have done man one up by creating a super intelligence out of itself. One that has emerged over a 4.5  billion year old time period.    Embed Quote
