★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
If you believe that  1) gene mutations 2) survival of the fittest and 3) reproduction are facts, then you can conclude that evolution is also a fact. It takes these ingredients and the some 'time' for the magic to happen. In fact there are software simulators today have proven the hypothesis in a virtual world.    Embed Quote
