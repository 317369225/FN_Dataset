★What is the definition of hypothesis? What is a good example of a hypothesis?
During college, a professor made available to me a survey of 6000 banking customers. I looked at the questions asked, and came up with several "statements" that could be resolved by the data in hand. This is exactly BACKWARDS, the survey should have made some "prediction" first, and then asked the questions to see if that prediction was valid. In any case, one methodology relies on a Null Hypothesis. The Null Hypothesis sets up a problem as follows... Any given attribute will have NO EFFECT on what we're measuring. That sounds weird, until you put real words into the sentence. Age of the respondent will show no difference in cash using behavior. (If they used cash instead of other means to pay for things, that behavior is the same regardless of age.) Now, by asking the right questions to a group of diverse ages, one can see if their cash use is indeed the same, or, if it differs, that gives the opportunity for more research. So, determine what you want to measure (cash use versus age). Create the null hypothesis Describe the research methodology Review the literature on the topic to show why your hypothesis is unique, or is a means to validate research already undertaken. Share the data Come to conclusions That's the basic outline of any scientific paper...    Embed Quote
