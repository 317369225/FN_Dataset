★What is the null hypothesis: the existence or non-existence of God?
Null is always the default, what you conclude if the evidence doesn't give you a 'positive' result, or if there's no noticeable difference between whatever you changed in your experiment and the control. Because you cannot empirically prove the non-existence of anything, this must be the null hypothesis. You would test for the alternative hypothesis, 'god exists'. (Please note that you don't prove anything by falling back on a null hypothesis, just that you don't have enough data to support the alternative hypothesis.)    Embed Quote
