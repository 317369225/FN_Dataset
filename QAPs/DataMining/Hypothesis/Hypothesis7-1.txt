★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
Quoting myself from a previous question (Would it be more accurate to describe evolutionary theory as a hypothesis?) Evolution is an observed fact, in the same way as gravity is an observed fact. We routinely see organisms changing their phenotype over time. That observation is the fact of evolution, just as dropping a coin demonstrates the fact of gravity.  The fact of evolution is explained by the theory of natural selection. The theory provides a framework that explains how and why evolution works. It is conceivable that new observations could overturn the theory of natural selection, but at this point a hundred years of intense and detailed observation have not overturned it. It is not possible for observation to overturn the fact of evolution, just as it is not possible for observation to overturn the fact that the quarter I just dropped fell to the floor.
