★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
Any version that expects a reliable result from a given action is falsifiable. The tricky part is that any version of god which can't be tossed out with little to no thought isn't that easy to predict. Things get too personal, not necessarily because the hypothetical god involved is personal but because its personally or impersonally tailoring its hypothetical actions to people. That is, even if its impersonal its actions are personalized. So if even two people perform precisely the same action, different responses are to be expected. So the testable predictions are abstract, and open to endless amounts of tweaking. So ultimately, specific hypotheses are falsifiable but the essence of the idea itself is so versatile, the details so malleable, as to make gods/goddesses not really falsifiable whatsoever. When a specific hypothesis is falsified, the response is as likely to be "My conception of God is false," as it is to be "There is no God." And actually the first is more reasonable - the second is a bit arrogant.    Embed Quote
