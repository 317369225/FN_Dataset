★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
EMH "works" in the following sense: If (and to the degree) that it is possible to profit from market inefficiency, such inefficiency will tend to disappear. Markets are not perfectly efficient, but they are "almost" perfectly efficient. It is possible to beat the markets, but it is difficult to do. You can occasionally find a $20 bill on the sidewalk, but you shouldn't expect to find many. Note that the AEMH (Almost Efficient Market Hypothesis) doesn't require any of the assumptions normally listed (perfect information, rational actors, etc.). It is merely the expected consequence of the attempts of countless market actors to profit from any residual inefficiency in the market. The reason there aren't many $20 bills on the sidewalk is that passers-by tend to pick them up.    Embed Quote
