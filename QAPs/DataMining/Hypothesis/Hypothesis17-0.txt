★Does the God hypothesis violate causality?By definition itself, God is eternal and has always existed. The creator was never created, he has simply existed. We do think in terms of cause and effect, making it difficult to understand that the Big Bang had no cause. How did we end up synthesizing an entity that violates the same? Please be free to point out mistakes in my premise.
It's more an "exception" than a "violation": "Everything has a cause, except the First Cause". As a hypothesis, that's strictly from hunger, since the exception is arbitrary (and to connect that First Cause with anybody's prior conception of a deity is a non-sequitur). Historically, it was a retroactive way of conceptualizing deities. People had always taken some variant of "time and space are infinite into the past" as an axiom, and tacked creation myths in to account for the particulars of Earth and the visible sky. Later monotheist theologians turned that into a more abstract "first cause" argument and identified that first cause with the deity they had already took as axiomatic. The 20th century discovery that the universe actually did have a beginning, not just the stuff in it but time and space itself, required a re-think of the conceptualization of the deity, but since it was already a "god of the gaps" hypothesis it was readily adapted to the new "gap" of "before the big bang". The notions of time and space required by quantum theory dispense with that kind of causality, but since they're unknown to theologians and non-scientists, the "first cause" can be widely accepted despite being clearly inadequate to account for the data.    Embed Quote
