★Could anyone explain the Riemann Hypothesis in simpler terms?
There really aren't any simpler terms to explain the Riemann Hypothesis in, as the statement is already very simple and direct. However, I can explain some of the parts. Statement: The nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part 1/2 Nontrivial zeros: It is (relatively) easy to show that -2, -4, -6, ... are zeros of the Riemann Zeta function, and these are called the trivial zeroes. The Riemann Hypothesis thus talks about zeros other than these. The Riemann zeta function: For s where it is defined, We can extend this function (analytically) to the entire complex plane, except for a simple pole at s=1 (by means beyond the scope of this answer). Real part 1/2: It has been shown that the Riemann Zeta function has infinite zeros with real part 1/2. Thus, the Riemann Hypothesis is that there are no zeros which don't have real part 1/2.    Embed Quote
