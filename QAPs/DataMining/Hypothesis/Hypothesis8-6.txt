★What is the most ridiculous scientific hypothesis?
Let's go with relatively well established hypotheses - That two events, occurring closer together in time than the time it would take for light to travel between them do not have a definite order of occurrence.  Depending on how fast you are moving and your vector relative to the two events you may see one occur first, or the other, or both simultaneously.    Embed Quote
