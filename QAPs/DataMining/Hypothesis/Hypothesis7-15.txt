★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
Evolution has not been proven. To prove a proposition is to "show that there are no contradictions in its context".  Science cannot prove any proposition regarding the natural world.  To claim otherwise is pejoratively termed 'scienceism'.  One factor limiting science is the use of the Scientific Method.  When applied in tests for cause, the Scientific Method works by eliminating hypotheses.  At best, you can only arrive at a conclusion because you cannot eliminate a particular hypothesis by contradiction, which is not at all a proof. Another factor is the intrinsic limitations of perception.  Your brain could be connected to a supercomputer that is feeding you synthesized perceptions--you cannot know otherwise. Another factor is the limitations of time.  You live only in the current instant.  The universe could have been created 5 min ago with just the right attributes to make it look as it does now--you cannot know otherwise.  The past is only models and memories.  Science can only predict the future. However, evolution is a scientific fact.  That means that I hold evolutionary models to be useful to others, independent of me as an observer.  Utility has no necessary bearing on truth. Evolution is also a theoretical framework.  As such, it does require some skill to apply effectively and reliably.    Embed Quote
