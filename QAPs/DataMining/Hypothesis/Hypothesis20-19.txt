★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
Pretty good theory.  Often it can be lazy theory.  Because when you cannot explain something you can just say 'the aliens did it' and it relieves you of the need to think hard about anything.   A theory that lends itself to this sort of laziness can get in the way of enquiry, even if we have to admit that it could actually be the correct explanation.    Embed Quote
