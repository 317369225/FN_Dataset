★How accurate is it to characterise atheism as a null hypothesis?This question is a follow up on the discussion on Mark Harrison's answer to Which position has the burden of proof: atheists or theists? As the title puts it, how accurate it is to characterise atheism as a null hypothesis? Is there something that is missed by this characterisation?
I've agreed with this for decades now. Theism or atheism; "There is a god" versus "there is no god". The former is the testable statement and the latter is not. That which is untestable must be the default position. Proof of the alternative argument causes one to reject the null argument. It just doesn't work the other way around.    Embed Quote
