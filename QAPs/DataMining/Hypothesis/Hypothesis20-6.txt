★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
Why don't you think rollers are a reasonable explanation when it has been exactly duplicated in recent years? Do you think the laws of physics have changed since Egyptian times? Estimate now say that it would have taken of the order of two thousand workers twenty years to build the largest pyramids. That is an entirely achievable number. And can you give point to the precise assembly that modern technology finds difficult to reproduce? Every example I have seen has been that the first archaeologist to turn up did not understand how it was done, but given a few people with engineering skills as well as some open minded archaeologists, an explanation is usually found in a couple of years. The civilisations were not particularly intelligent, though they were not stupid. Usually they fell to another civilisation, equally but not more intelligent, that specialised (for a while) in war not building. You can't have it both ways: if your economic surplus is going into pyramids, it is not going into,fighting men. Someone who has made the opposite choice will probably defeat you.    Embed Quote
