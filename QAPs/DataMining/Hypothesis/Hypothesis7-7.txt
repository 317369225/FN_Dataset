★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
'Only a theory?' You are misunderstanding what theory means in a scientific context. It isn't some mumbo-jumbo that's been made up. Rather, it's a model that fits and predicts behavior. Scientific theories aren't called theories because they can sometimes be false; they are called theories because its an approximation, albeit a extremely accurate one. Evolution is real, a theory and its happening right now.    Embed Quote
