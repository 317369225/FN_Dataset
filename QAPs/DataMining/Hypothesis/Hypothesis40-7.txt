★Is continental drift a hypothesis or a theory?
As I understand Mr. Wegener's idea, he hypothesized that continents were adrift like islands.  Remember that he lived at a time (1912) when they didn't have satellites to confirm what we now know as fact - that the continents do indeed move in relation to each other due to the processes of subduction, spreading and faulting.  So, I think we evolved to the plate tectonic theory because continental drift did not fit the model anymore.    Embed Quote
