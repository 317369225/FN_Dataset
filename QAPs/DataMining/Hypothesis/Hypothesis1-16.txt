★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
The Behavioral Economics perspective (i.e. humans do not act rationally in many economic environments) as demonstrated by the extensive research work of Kahneman and Teversky has pretty much dismissed the basic tenets underlying the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. EMH provides a straightforward method for analyzing macro economic behavior, but its conclusions assume not only rational behavior by human actors, but also "perfect" pricing information of the market at all instants of time. Both of these assumptions have been proven to be inaccurate, especially during turbulent market environments. My own personal view is EMH was developed for "chumps" and primarily applicable in periods of relative economic stability. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eff... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beh...    Embed Quote
