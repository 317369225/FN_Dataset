★Is the unfalsifiable hypothesis of "dark energy" the secular equivalent of fairy dust?Isn't belief without evidence typically considered irrational? It's interesting to note, that the Bible explains at least 17 times that the heavens are expanding, and that God "stretches them out like a curtain." I wonder how those ancient primitive people could've known such things with such un-coincidental certainty?
There is no reason to believe in fairy dust, and there are no unexplained phenomenal that would be explained by the existence of fairy dust. Dark matter explains the shape of galaxies, and dark energy explains the accelerated expansion of the universe. They are also just place holder names that don't point to anything specific. They could just be something we already know but we didn't know are causing these phenomenal.    Embed Quote
