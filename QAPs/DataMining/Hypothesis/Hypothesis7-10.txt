★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
I'll provide a different perspective. My personal take on the subject is that Evolution as such neither is nor isn't a theory (ditto for being a fact). That doesn't mean it isn't science. Rather, as I see it, Evolution is a framework from which one draws elements with which to construct theories which in turn can be experimentally tested. For example, drawing from the Evolutionary framework, one's able to construct a theory according which species A evolved into species B by going through stages A1, A2, A3..., describing those stages in detail, then test it by trying to actually find fossils A1, A2... in the predicted places, conditions etc., then correcting it in light of new evidence and so on and so forth as required, maybe even in the end adding back to the framework some refined tools or even entirely new tools or tool sets. As a scientific framework, thus, Evolution's place within Biology is similar to that of Mathematics within Physics, and pretty much like you don't "prove" Math from Physics, you just "use" it, you also don't "prove" Evolution from Biology, you just "use" it, for as long as it remains useful. Considering the many successes of Evolutionary Biology, this is going to be a long, long time. Perhaps forever.    Embed Quote
