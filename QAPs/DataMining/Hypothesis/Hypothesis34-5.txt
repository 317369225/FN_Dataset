★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
Contrary to most: YES!!! Out ability to prove non-existence is brought to you by today's sponsor: the law of non-contradiction There are already falsifiable conceptualizations of deities which we can infallibly deduce cannot exist just as we can deduce that there are no circular triangles. This is different than vaguely-defined unicorns and teapots. A god that is perfectly just and perfectly merciful cannot exist. A god that is merely just but inflicts eternal punishment for finite sins cannot exist.    Embed Quote
