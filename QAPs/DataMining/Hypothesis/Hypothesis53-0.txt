★What progress has been made till date on the Riemann hypothesis?
The main progress is the Hilbert-Polya conjecture, that the zeros are the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator of some kind. If you have a Hermitian operator, the eignevalues are real. This is supported strongly now, it is scientifically certain,  from the Montgomery and Dyson business about the zeros being described precisely by the GUE from Random Matrix theory. Wikipedia has a summary. The statistical evidence is overwhelming that the conjecture is true, but that's not a proof. The main approaches today all try to figure out what kind of quantum system it is on the critical line, what Hamiltonian has eigenvalues which are the zeros of the zeta function. There are speculative ideas that I like, I worked out the basic properties of what's called the "primon gas" at some point (a bose gas on primes whose statistics reproduce the zeta function), this is easy and widely rediscovered, but there are various other speculations that I don't know about at all, Michael Berry, of Berry's phase fame, wrote about this in the late 90s. It seems that the conjecture will fall exactly when we understand how to construct the quantum Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are the zeros, from a physics-motivated construction. You can't say for certain that this is a major insight until the problem is solved, but some version of this is where my money would go for the solution.    Embed Quote
