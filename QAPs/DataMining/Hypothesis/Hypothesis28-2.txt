★Is the Big Bang hypothesis theory or belief?
Big bang cosmology rests on three main pillars of evidence. (1) Hubble' Law -- the uniform expansion of the universe at a rate measured by red-shift of distant galaxies, discovered in the 1920s. (2) The cosmic background radiation, discovered in 1965. (3) The relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the universe, with excellent agreement between what's measured and what's calculated by the "standard model" of particle physics.   There is no controversy -- the big bang is now settled fact. It's a "theory" in the scientific sense -- a unified body of knowledge validated by mountains of data. "Theory" does not imply "unproven hypothesis," as used conversationally. I remember, pre-1965, when the big bang was a mere hypothesis that competed with steady state cosmology.    Embed Quote
