★What is the best-supported hypothesis on why we need sleep?
It seems to be something to do with garbage collecting on the days memories. If you watch a film that is a huge amount of input, of which the brain will try and keep two or three scenes long term just to remind you that you have seen it. Likewise all your experiences of the day will be filtered down to a permanent summary. If you go too long without sleep your short-term storage will be exhausted making you sluggish and unresponsive. If something exciting or threatening happens it will be given priority for survival reasons, this can lead to PTSD.    Embed Quote
