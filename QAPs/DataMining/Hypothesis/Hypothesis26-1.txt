★What is a null hypothesis in layman's terms?
Frequentist hypothesis testing is basically a Popperian argument (after Karl Popper's philosophy of science); In science, you will never know if a theory is right. At most, you can know it is wrong. So if you want to use data to demonstrate A, you will go about by showing that "it is unlikely that not-A." In a statistician's terminology, A is the research (or alternative) hypothesis, and "not-A" is the Null Hypothesis. Note that in a frequentist argument, you never try to demonstrate A directly. That is why "not rejecting the null" is not equivalent to accepting it. In a Bayesian argument, there is no real difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative. It is just a terminology spill-over from frequentists.    Embed Quote
