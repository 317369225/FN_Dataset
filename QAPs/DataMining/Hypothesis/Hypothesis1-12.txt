★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
It is in the interest of those who don't believe in EMH to encourage the majority to believe in EMH. Update: I am actually going to expand on my smartass original answer because this is actually a topic that is very interesting and important to me. The market is mostly efficient, especially large cap stocks that are closely followed. They might be slightly overvalued or slightly undervalued depending on sentiment, but enough intelligent investors with large amounts of capital are watchdogging the price for any large deviations from intrinsic value, because these large stocks are the only places where investors with large bankrolls can invest significant amounts of their capital in order to make a meaningful impact on their portfolio performance. Where there is potential for mispricing is in the thousands of micro and small cap stocks where the big professional investors do not have the time or interest to follow. So what they find a stock selling for half of what its worth? They can only buy so much before the massive volume of their whale-like movements changes the price. They will have made a .02% increase in their portfolio for a month's worth of research... not worth the opportunity cost. Thats not to say every micro cap is mispriced, the rare few that significantly are should be valued and kept secret. I'm trying to make a name for myself so I'm publishing my best ideas on seekingalpha currently, but one day... not sharing anymore :p    Embed Quote
