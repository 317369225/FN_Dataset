★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
Evolution is an extremely well substantiated fact. The word theory is simply used more in math and science (yes, there are theories in math), than in everyday use. No one has been able to come up with a valid alternative.    Embed Quote
