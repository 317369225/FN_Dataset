★Is the unfalsifiable hypothesis of "dark energy" the secular equivalent of fairy dust?Isn't belief without evidence typically considered irrational? It's interesting to note, that the Bible explains at least 17 times that the heavens are expanding, and that God "stretches them out like a curtain." I wonder how those ancient primitive people could've known such things with such un-coincidental certainty?
There is lots of evidence for both dark matter and dark energy. Attempts to build a model of the universe without them have, thus far, failed. And the hypotheses are clearly falsifiable - just explain things like galaxy rotation curves, galaxy cluster stability, gravitational lensing by clusters, acceleration expansion of the universe and the CMB fluctuations without them, and you are done.    Embed Quote
