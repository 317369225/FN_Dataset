★What do you think about the mathematical universe hypothesis?Recently I read a paper by Max Tegmark about hypothesis that the whole universe is a mathematical structured. If everything really exists, it should be simple and beautiful. 1st. paper [gr-qc/9704009] Is "the theory of everything'' merely the ultimate ensemble theory? 2nd. paper [0704.0646] The Mathematical Universe
Tegmark is chanelling Plato.  Plato believed Ideas were the real thing and perceptions were distortions of the Real Ideas created by our senses.    Embed Quote
