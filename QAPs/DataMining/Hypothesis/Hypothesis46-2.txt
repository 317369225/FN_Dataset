★HIV: Is the Duesberg hypothesis trustworthy?Which assertions by Duesberg about HIV and AIDS are trustworthy or, at least, merit investigation?
Many years ago there was some debate about how hiv could lead to such a catastrophic breakdown of the immune system given that not every T cell is infected - ergo hiv cannot cause aids. Since then it has been found that hiv causes T cell depletion not simply by destroying the cells it infects but also by triggering the destruction of infected cells by CD8 lymphocytes and even the 'suicide'  of non infected cells. Furthermore hiv causes the death of progenitor T cells in the thymus so less cells are produced to replace those lost. It also affects Cytokine function thereby impairing the immune response by another route. All these effects eventually add up to Aids even though only a small number of T cells may actually be infected with hiv.    Embed Quote
