★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
Nate Anderson's answer is great. A good analogy would be a perpetual motion device. They are (by the laws of physics), impossible. This means that if you think you have one, it means you aren't measuring something. The same thing goes for the EMH, if you think a market is perfectly efficient, you aren't measuring something.    Embed Quote
