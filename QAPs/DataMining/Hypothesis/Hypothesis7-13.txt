★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
No amount of observations consistent with a given theory can prove it's veracity conclusively and yet one observation that does not match the theory, can disprove or at best indicate that said theory is incomplete. That is the nature of the beast. So the question is ill-posed: of course evolution is a theory but as theories go, it's a damn good one! Creationism on the other hand, does not pass the above litmus test: very few "observations" are consistent with it and many, many observations contradict it, e.g. carbon-based dating of ancient human remains. So, creationism too is a theory, albeit one nature clearly chose to forgo...    Embed Quote
