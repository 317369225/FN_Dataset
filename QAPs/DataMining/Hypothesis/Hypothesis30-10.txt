★Do you believe in the hypothesis that suggests that God himself is Satan in disguise?
There are three over-arching reasons why this is a silly thought experiment: First an observation: the notion of flipping the table via a combination of hyper-skepticism and imagination is perhaps an interesting thought experiment.  However its just that a thought experiment.  What if Obama is George Bush , Bill O'Reilly, John McCain, or Mitt Romney in disguise? (to me this proves the ultimate failure of skepticism more than anything) God is by definition all powerful, so He would solve this issue. Why would Satan want people to kill each other less? Or why have a Bible that encourages good behavior if you are just Satan in disguise.  It would be anti-thetical to Satans purposes to be God and do what God did in terms of fighting sin and temptation, influencing culture, and building the Christian movement.    Embed Quote
