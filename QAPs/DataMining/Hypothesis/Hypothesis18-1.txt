★When is a hypothesis accepted?
When it is thoroughly challenged by logical and empirical means and is not thereby falsified.   Just because a hypothesis survives one round of challenges it might not survive a further round when improved technology increases the precision of testing. For nearly 200 years Newtons law of gravitation passed muster until very accurate telescopes revealed an anomaly in the precession of Mercury's orbit that could not be resolved.    Embed Quote
