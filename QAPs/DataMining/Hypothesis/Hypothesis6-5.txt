★Is the multiverse a theory or a hypothesis?
It's a theory. Hypothesis is an ingredient of the theory. Above said it is a theory in a different sense than for example the theory of classical electrodynamics or the theory of quantum electrodynamics, or, ...! While theories I named in the previous sense are in fact models of actual behavior observed in the nature and are in agreement with experimental observations, the multiverse is not based on any known observation to date and as far as we know it predicts nothing that we can test to date.    Embed Quote
