★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
It is accepted in the sense of allowing to establish a baseline.  In other words, public information should be priced into current asset prices at least to some degree.  Once you understand this, then you can look for alpha, or the information which has not been priced in.    Embed Quote
