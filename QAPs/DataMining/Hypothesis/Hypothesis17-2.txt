★Does the God hypothesis violate causality?By definition itself, God is eternal and has always existed. The creator was never created, he has simply existed. We do think in terms of cause and effect, making it difficult to understand that the Big Bang had no cause. How did we end up synthesizing an entity that violates the same? Please be free to point out mistakes in my premise.
For me, as an atheist, the "God hypothesis" is simply folklore, just like all the other hypothetical gods from the various pantheons we now call myths. And, frankly, one does not confuse folklore with science. Maybe "everything" started with the Big Bang. Or maybe there is or was something else going on outside of it or before it. Maybe we'll find out; maybe we won't. The god people will say, as they always do, "GODDIDIT!" The scientists will say, as they always do, "We don't know, but we're working on it." And, frankly, I don't care. I mean, yes, if we knew, I'd be happy to know. But we don't. And that does not make one damn bit of difference in my life.    Embed Quote
