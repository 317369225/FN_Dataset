★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
There are two different components to "proving" something in science. The first is to put forward a theory with all the evidence you can find to support it. The second part involves watching other people try and shoot your theory down in flames. There are lots of people who have put forward a scientific theory they thought was sound only to have it shot through with holes by other people. A scientific idea can't be proven until it's been held up to some scrutiny. No scientific idea in recent history has been so consistently and aggressively attacked as evolution. Since it was first put forward as an idea there have been millions of people throughout the world who have actively worked to try and disprove it as nonsense. None of them have succeeded. Evolution has been subjected to more scrutiny than any other notion science has ever put forward and it's resisted them all.    Embed Quote
