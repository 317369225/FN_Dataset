★How accurate is it to characterise atheism as a null hypothesis?This question is a follow up on the discussion on Mark Harrison's answer to Which position has the burden of proof: atheists or theists? As the title puts it, how accurate it is to characterise atheism as a null hypothesis? Is there something that is missed by this characterisation?
tl;dr - it's accurate, but unlikely to be helpful if you are talking to a theist. I brought it up in the original question in the context of philosophical burdens of proof, so clearly need to give more than I wrote in that answer [1] If you start from a place where the scientific method is important, it works for the reasons that Bert Cattoor [2] If you start from believing in any sort of "being outside the universe" (from Thor, to God, to the theory that we're agents in a Galaxy-size sim in some bigger thing), then it's missing the point to the extent of being irrelevant. Steven Jay Gould advanced the idea of non-overlapping Magisterial - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non... - which gives an explanation' from a philosophical point of view, why this is the case. In my answer, referenced in the question details, I talked about why the fact that it's a null hypothesis doesn't matter in the context of a philisophical Burden of Proof. Sadly, both theists and atheists who answered the original question seem more willing to explain why their magisterium is the only one that matters than actually engage in any dialogue that might lead to common ground. [1] which I never intended to be rigorous, and which contains some really, really bad exposition, but given that the question degenerated into highly upvoted cartoons that bash Christians, wasn't a place in which I cared to continue the discussion. [2] can't link from this device, if anyone wants to suggest an edit with link, I'll add.    Embed Quote
