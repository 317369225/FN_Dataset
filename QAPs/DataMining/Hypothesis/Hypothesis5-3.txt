★Is Singularity a fact or just a hypothesis?
I would describe it as the Geek Rapture. Like the religious one, it's hoped for, but will likely not happen, at least not how we imagine it. There are a few reasons for this. For one, while it's true that technology is advancing faster and faster than before, it's also taking more and more resources to go further. That alone is a major source of drag. Second, we humans aren't yet capable of really taking advantage of everything we do have now. Ethics and morality have fallen way behind technology. So have our education and society. That too retards the supposed ever-increasing progress. Finally, it's hard to imagine what, if it actually happened, what it will even be like, since by its very definition, it's impossible to forecast beyond it; nothing we take for granted would really apply. That said, it sounds wonderful. Cross it, and we enter a post-scarcity, trans-human world of infinite futures. How is that not a geek rapture?    Embed Quote
