★What is a null hypothesis in layman's terms?
The way i was taught, the null hypothesis is " it makes no difference". Example: new cancer treatment; null hypothesis would be those receiving the treatment will live about as long as those who do not. If you can show that those receiving the treatmen either live longer or die sooner the you reject the null. This includes the concept of statistical significance. Complex mathmatical formulas are used to determine if the difference could be random chance. Generally you want less than  a 5 percent chance that it is random variability. You can get this with either a large difference or a small one if the sample is large. So if the new cancer therapy causes a " significant increase in life expectancy" that might actually mean that without it the average is nine months, and wirh it the average is twelve months. The fda would likely approve the drug and the null hypothesis is rejected. However, its not a cure, or even a strong treatment. It is just delaying the inevitable by a few weeks. However, it is still statistically meaningful because we can show it is an actual effect not by chance. By chance would be likely if we only had ten patients. With that size sample, onenor two that survived two years by luck could skew the data    Embed Quote
