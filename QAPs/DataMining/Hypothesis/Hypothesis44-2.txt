★What do you think about the mathematical universe hypothesis?Recently I read a paper by Max Tegmark about hypothesis that the whole universe is a mathematical structured. If everything really exists, it should be simple and beautiful. 1st. paper [gr-qc/9704009] Is "the theory of everything'' merely the ultimate ensemble theory? 2nd. paper [0704.0646] The Mathematical Universe
I'm not terribly qualified to answer this question because I'm not too familiar with the MUH, except that I saw Tegmark give a public lecture at the Hayden Planetarium a few weeks ago, in which he spoke about the idea at a non-technical level. What I took away from the talk is that MUH posits that all of reality can be accurately described in a mathematical theory; in particular, Tegmark is of the opinion that our brains, as part of reality, can be treated as mathematical objects. I asked him at the end of the talk what he thought this said about free will, and he gave me an answer that I wasn't expecting: (paraphrased) "In terms of our ability to predict our future behavior using the mathematical nature of our brains, it turns out to have no effect on our decision-making in the following sense. Suppose you would like to know what actions you will take 10 seconds in the future. It turns out that by far the most efficient way to answer that question is to wait 10 seconds and see what happens." Tegmark is saying that we simply will never have the computational power to predict our future behavior in anywhere near the amount of time it takes for the events to occur anyway, so we cannot have knowledge of the future nor let our decisions be influenced by such knowledge. In his mind, it seems, that's enough to empirically prove that we have free will.    Embed Quote
