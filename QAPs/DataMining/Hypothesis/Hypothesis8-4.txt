★What is the most ridiculous scientific hypothesis?
I would go with the "Blank Slate theory". The theory assumes that Humans become what they are by Nurture, not Nature.   Reasons I believe it is ridiculous:   1) The evidence that it was wrong was present in the 16th Century itself, when this hypothesis was proposed.   2) It contradicts Darwin's Theory of Evolution.   3) It contradicts the science of Human Biology. I mean who could deny that family traits along with innate ones, Genes are inherited from birth. The evidence is so explicit that it takes no genius to infer the absurdity of this hypothesis.   4) The theory sounds so idealistic that It is too good to be scientific.    Embed Quote
