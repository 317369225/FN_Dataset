★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
Thats the catch, even if as an academic endeavour, somebody comes up with a definition and trys to prove it or disapprove it. All others can blatantly disregard it and say thats not the god which we worship. There is no sincerity in the belief, they just want that to be true no matter what, because its based on personal hope. The best example is the case of evolution, even though  the Vatican has declared that yes we agree evolution is the mechanism by which diversity of life is on earth, many Christians still dont give a dam about it.    Embed Quote
