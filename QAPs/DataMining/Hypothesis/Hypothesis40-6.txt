★Is continental drift a hypothesis or a theory?
I consider it a fact. The reason is that the results it predicts can be measured as they occur. After earthquakes and eruptions changes in the position of points on the earth's crust can be measured using GPS and these are in agreement with Plate Tectonics, that is, the amount of change of position in centimeters per year is the same as found to be computed by comparing direct measurement and what can be derived from geology and geophysics.    Embed Quote
