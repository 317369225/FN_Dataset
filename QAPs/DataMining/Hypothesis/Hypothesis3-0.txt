★What is the Gaia hypothesis?How much interest does it currently generate in the scientific community?
I would suggest that while the Gaia Hypothesis may be a useful warning against inaction in the face of man-made global warming, the fact that at least five major extinction events appear in the geological record (Ordovician–Silurian, Late Devonian, Permian–Triassic,Triassic–Jurassic, Cretaceous–Tertiary) rather implies that 'Gaia' doesn't care much for living species at all.    Embed Quote
