★Is the Lipid Hypothesis good science?
I would say yes, considering the evidence at the time I would have said fats were bad too. Although amount of sugar fits better to cardiovascular diseases than fats, but no mechanism was known or trusted so no one believed. But now mechanisms are known. And science need to evolve, that means, that although before we could say that it was the best fitting hypothesis, now it's not anymore.    Embed Quote
