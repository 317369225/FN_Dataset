★Do you believe in the hypothesis that suggests that God himself is Satan in disguise?
Your question requires acceptance of an elaborate story about God, Satan, angels, evil, good....It also suggests attributes of God and Satan that are certainly not in my Bible, although they may appear somewhere in literature. HaSatan is not an angel but is usually identified as the "adversary." Satan is more like God's foil in a literary sense, something to bounce ideas off of. God himself/itself is neither evil nor good  - but holds both within his universe. It is useful to identify an entity which is "evil" so people can point to that thing which is external to themselves which pulls them away from God. However, many religions, including my own, recognize that each person has within him both good and evil and the ability to choose. It is not something external, and one need not resort to concocting an elaborate cast of players to explain it. The Bible may anthropomorphize God to enable our understanding, but there is no image or description that can properly portray the totality of God.    Embed Quote
