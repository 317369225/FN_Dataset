★Is continental drift a hypothesis or a theory?
I'm just a hobby geologist, so take me with a grain of salt on this:  first, my definition of theory is "idea that might explain how some physical phenomenon occurs" and my definition of hypothesis is "theory that is subject to some experimental investigation which may tend to show that it is either correct or incorrect."   There are probably lots of other ways to distinguish between these two similar words.         Continental drift was a theory that the continents were moving around, based on some observations like the match between the outlines of Africa and South America, and similar fossil records in different continents which were hard to explain unless dinosaurs had frequent flyer miles.  However, after investigation, it turned out that continents, per se, don't drift.  They aren't floating around in the ocean like big container ships.     Instead, it is currently believed that the Earth's surface is composed of plates that slide around on top of the aesthenospere and mantle, occasional diving under each other, sliding over eachother, rubbing along side eachother, and sometimes bumping so hard into eachother that crust crumples up into mountains like the Himlayas. The energy for all this movement comes from the heat of the mantle.  So I guess you could say that continental drift was a theory that couldn't be established as a valid hypothesis.  There is a lot of evidence to support the hypothesis of plate tectonics, but it is still not 100% accepted.  Also, just to be clear, the continents and the tectonic plates are not quite the same.  Plates often include land masses as well as ocean floor areas.    Embed Quote
