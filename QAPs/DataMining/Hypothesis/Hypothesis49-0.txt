★How can a theorem or conjecture or hypothesis be proved to be unprovable?
I take your question to mean ask "How do you show that neither a statement nor its negation can be proved?" Usually it's done by means of models.  Suppose you have a theory with axioms A, and a proposition P, and you want to show that neither P  nor  Not P  follows from  A. You find two models, one in which the axioms A and the proposition Not P is true, and another in which the axioms A and the proposition P is true.  From those two models you can conclude that you can't prove  P  from A, and you can't prove  Not P  from A.  Therefore P is independent of A. An example.  The theory of groups is has a binary operation (usually denoted multiplicatively) satisfying the following three axioms Associativity.  For all x, y, and z,  (xy)z = x(yz). Unit. There is an element denoted 1 such that for all x,  x1 = 1x = x. Inverses.   For each x, there is another element y such that xy = 1.Those are the axioms A.  Now for the proposition P take the statement   P.  For each x, xx = 1. To show P is not provable from A, consider the group (that is, a model of the theory of groups) with three elements 1, a, and b  where multiplication is defined by  aa = b, ab = 1,  ba = 1, and bb = a  (and 1 acts as the unit as in axiom 2.) To show  Not P  is not provable from A, consider the group with two elements 1 and a  where multiplication is defined by  aa = 1. Thus, statement P is neither provable nor is its negation provable.    Embed Quote
