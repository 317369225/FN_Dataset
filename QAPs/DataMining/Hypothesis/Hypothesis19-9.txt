★What is the best-supported hypothesis on why we need sleep?
Sleep is needed for proper functioning. There's even this disorder "fatal familial insomnia" where the people affected are unable to sleep. They eventually go crazy and can't even perform daily routine functions. At the end of it they prefer dying. This one guy was however noble enough to donate his body to science so that scientists could study the disease. Sleep also helps reinforce memories. That's why it's beneficial to sleep soon after studying. Sleep is also when maximum growth occurs -growth of neurons=reinforced memories -physical body growth When you're asleep, your body consumes less energy therefore it can be diverted towards growth.    Embed Quote
