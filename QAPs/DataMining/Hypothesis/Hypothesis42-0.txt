★What is the difference between a hypothesis and a null hypothesis?
This is a really good question, and I believe I've seen it asked before on Quora. Basically the null hypothesis starts by assuming that your hypothesis is false, but you want to look out for evidence that proves you that 'au contraire', you are wrong, and thus your initial 'null hypothesis', is wrong. This would be an equivalent of the negative of the negative of your hypothesis, which would be a positive. The hypothesis is when you have an idea and you think it is right, and you go after looking for evidence to justify your belief. Let's go with a more playful and enriching example: SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial LIfe) scientists and Ufologists are two cases of groups that have the same objectives "see if there are aliens out there" but formulate their question from a null hypothesis and hypothesis standpoint respectively. SETI scientists begin by assuming that there is no intelligent life in the universe besides us, but they want to disprove themselves and look for evidence to conclude that they are wrong and that there is intelligent life. Ufologists on the other hand play a "less scientific" role and start by claiming that intelligent life and aliens already exist and are out there, but we have to look for their traces. SETI scientists do science, Ufologists are part of popular fiction and pseudoscience. This is why in statistics starting from the null hypothesis has its benefits.
