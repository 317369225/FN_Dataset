★Is Singularity a fact or just a hypothesis?
If the Technological Singularity (not just the AI one) is true, then looks like we've already passed it, or else are in the middle of it right now. After all, by any measure, human culture has already changed beyond any precedent or previous reference point, or as Stewart Brand puts it, "we are as gods". Unfortunately there also seems to be a lot of geeks who envision another kind of "Singularity" (aka, the "Geek Rapture"… good one, Marq Hwang!), in which they hope to be able to 'download' themselves into machines, and IMHO this is nothing more than the wishful fantasy of emotionally immature folks who can't handle the "real world" to begin with.    Embed Quote
