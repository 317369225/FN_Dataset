★Is Singularity a fact or just a hypothesis?
The Singularity is a concept. It is the result of speculation about the future. It is not a theory, in that you can't test it. It is not a fact, in that it can't be measured. It is an idea; a term used to describe one possible way that the future might develop. Theories and facts relate to describing the world as it is today. You can't really apply those terms to speculation about the future.    Embed Quote
