★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
no it cannot be falsified the same way the unicorn hypothesis cannot be falsified the leprechaun hypothesis cannot be falsified the obama is an alien lizard reptalian  hypothesis cannot be falsified the elvis presley is still alive hypothesis  cannot be falsified (exaggerating ofcourse with these examples) THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING RELATED TO GOD , SURE PEOPLE TAKE THINGS AND SHOUT OUT  'OOOH LOOK A BANANA , EVIDENCE , GOD DID IT !' maybe philosophically you can get somewhere with that question but scientifically the question has no meaning , its like asking is there any scientific proof of the existence of  thor or loki , it has no evidence so its a meaningless question .    Embed Quote
