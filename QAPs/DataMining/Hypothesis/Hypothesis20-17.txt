★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
Very recently, there was a project done where a pyramid was built using precisely the same wooden roller method of the ancient Egyptians, and not only did that work well, it worked better than anyone expected, requiring less manpower than they believed to use the sled on rollers. Further, using only tools available to ancient Egyptians, they were able to build the pyramid with the same level of precision as ancient pyramids had with no real difficulty. You can very likely find the video of this on youtube. I'm not sure what makes you think they were "advanced". They had good scholars, scribes, and engineers, but technology wise they were a fairly typical bronze-age civilization for most of their history. They had a huge number of people, a shared culture, a cultural emphasis on education (rare at the time) and a convenient river to facilitate trade. They protected themselves from numerous invaders over thousands of years (and didn't quite do so from time to time as they were conquered by the Hyskos. And the Nigerians. And the Macedonians. And the Romans). The Greeks of the Old and Middle Kingdom periods were roughly on par with Egypt in terms of "advancement". As to where Ancient Egypt "went", it lasted for nearly 5,000 years (if we count Ptolemy), making it one of the longest lasting civilizations in human history. Eventually it fell from prominence, was conquered by various neighbors and eventually annexed by Rome. It didn't vanish overnight, it had several periods of rising, falling, rallying and rising again, stumbling again, being conquered, achieving independence, being conquered again, trying to relive it's past glories before being assimilated into an overwhelmingly powerful neighbor that seriously wanted it's resources.    Embed Quote
