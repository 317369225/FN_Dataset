★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
You can only disprove a theory because what we call theory is basically an abstraction we make by looking at facts. A model can serve you quite well and can be applied for all the cases but still it can't be proven, this is not mathematics after all. Having said that, there are countless evidences for evolution. Fossil records show sequences of evolution, a thorough observation in nature will also make you come to the same conclusion. Also there are experiments with bacteria for example which show the basic premises of evolution apply. (Bacterias immune to antibiotic for example?) Of course all this if you don't believe in some books written by someone whom no one has ever seen.    Embed Quote
