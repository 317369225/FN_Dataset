★What are the implications of the Riemann Hypothesis?This is a follow-up question to Riemann Hypothesis: What is the Riemann Hypothesis (in brief)?.
There are many theorems in mathematics which have only been proven "conditionally" (i.e. assuming that the Riemann Hypothesis or the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is true). If RH were established, then these proofs would all become valid. It would imply much tighter error bounds on the Prime Number Theorem than are currently known. Specifically, it would mean that Where is the number of primes less than x and is the logarithmic integral. There's a good list here: http://mathoverflow.net/question...    Embed Quote
