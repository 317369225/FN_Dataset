★Is morality truly an unnecessary hypothesis?
It is a fact that this universe admits of an extraordinary range of pleasant an unpleasant experiences for conscious creatures. It is also a fact that movement in this space is constrained by the laws of nature (whatever they turn out to be). Forget, for a moment, that you ever heard the word “morality.” Just admit that we have a navigation problem on our hands: If we go too far in one direction, things reliably get very unpleasant (and not the kind of unpleasant that has a silver lining); go in another, and everyone gets really happy, creative, fulfilled, etc. These differences exist and movement is possible. Now let’s recall this word “morality”: if you don’t think that it would be immoral to move everyone downward into hell, or moral to move them upward in collective flourishing, I don’t know what you’re talking about.- Sam Harris To answer your question, we need great philosophers and scientists to help answer these questions of morality, the same way we need great doctors and scientists to advance the technology in health. A person's potential for a healthy life is always changing, but that doesn't mean we need to question if tuberculosis is bad for me. So why propose the same questions in regards to morality? There might be different but comparative peaks of happiness that exist in different cultures/environments, but that doesn't mean there isn't a right or wrong way of living your life.    Embed Quote
