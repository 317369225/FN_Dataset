★Could the God hypothesis ever be made falsifiable?
Any hypothesis is falsifiable! if we have evidence supporting it, then it becomes a theory. if we don't get any evidence supporting it, we should probably discard it! it's been thousands of years, not a single shred of evidence. The god hypothesis has to be discarded now! We need to move on! PS:I would recommend "The God Delusion" by Richard Dawkins to people interested in this. It has a whole chapter called "The God Hypothesis"    Embed Quote
