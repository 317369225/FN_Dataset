★How valid is the theory of 'God: Ancient Astronauts' (paleocontact hypothesis)?
As valid as those who earn money from writing books and making documentary series about the subject want it to be!  If you're good enough to make a substantial living from any conjectural hypothesis, no matter how wild, you'll always find a way to convince the gullible that it it's valid!    Embed Quote
