★What are the implications of the Riemann Hypothesis?This is a follow-up question to Riemann Hypothesis: What is the Riemann Hypothesis (in brief)?.
My opinion for what it's worth: the significance of the Riemann hypothesis lies in its eventual proof rather than in its implications. The Riemann zeta function is associated with the integers. There are (infinitely many) analogs of the integers called function fields in two variables, otherwise known as curves over finite fields. A curve over a finite field has an associated zeta functions. In 1940, Andre Weil proved the analog of the Riemann hypothesis for these zeta functions. Proving the Riemann hypothesis for the Riemann zeta function will likely involve forming a deeper understanding of the analogy between the integers and a curve over a finite field. Curves over finite fields are a special case of algebraic varieties over finite fields. Algebraic varieties over finite fields have associated zeta functions. Alexander Grothendieck discovered etale cohomology, which is one of the most beautiful mathematical objects, in connection with the study of zeta functions of algebraic varieties over finite fields. In 1974 Pierre Deligne used etale cohomology (together with other tools) to prove the Riemann hypothesis for these zeta functions. The Riemann zeta function is a special case of an automorphic L-function. There is an analog of the Riemann hypothesis which is expected to hold for all automorphic L-functions. Proving it will likely require not only a deeper understanding of the analogy between the integers and curves over finite fields, but also a theory analogous to etale cohomology. So the point of the Riemann hypothesis isn't so much what you can do with it, as much as what we'll learn from coming up with a proof.    Embed Quote
