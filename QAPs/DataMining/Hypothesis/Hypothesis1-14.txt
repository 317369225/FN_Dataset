★Is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) generally accepted?This theory says that markets are "informationally efficient" meaning you will not achieve in excess of market returns on a risk adjusted basis. So basically someone like Warren Buffett has been successful because he flipped the coin heads 90 out of 100 times, not because he has any special knowledge that could enable him to profit more than any other market participant.
The following little story is not strictly on point, but it shows how something can be generally accepted by academics and generally rejected by practitioners. A Questioner is facing a Mathematician and a Trader. He shows them an object which he unequivocally states is a fair coin. He then flips this coin f9 times. It comes up heads each time, and this is observed by the Mathematician and the Trader. Questioner: I am about to flip this coin for the tenth time? What is the probability of heads on this tenth flip? Mathematician: The flips are independent and the coin is fair. The probability is one half. Trader: The probability is at least nine tenths, perhaps more. Questioner: But the flips were fair and I told you the coin was fair. Trader: I don't care what you said. Someone has found a way to cheat. The fact that I don't know how he did it doesn't prevent me from detecting his cheating.    Embed Quote
