★Is continental drift a hypothesis or a theory?
A theory, and lots of evidence about it that one can almost say that it's a fact. Just look at a map and see how the land masses almost go together like jigsaw puzzle pieces, particularly the eastern coast of north-south America and the western coastline of Africa. The whole pacific rim exists because of the ocean floor tearing itself apart or grinding each other along faultlines, and molten rocks spewing forth from the cracks.    Embed Quote
