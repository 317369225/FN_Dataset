★Has evolution been proved or should we consider evolution a hypothesis?Is it only a theory or a fact? Edit: All the answers have been written with eloquence and brilliance. Now I can confidently discuss the "Theory of Evolution" with my creationist friends. :)
1) Newtons Laws 2) Theory of Relativity 3) Quantum Mechanics 4)Theory of Evolution Newtons Laws are superseded by the Theory of Relativity Quantum Mechanics and the Theory of Relativity are incompatible. Evolutions on the other hand applies without exception. Which one is more "True", and less of a "Hypothesis"    Embed Quote
