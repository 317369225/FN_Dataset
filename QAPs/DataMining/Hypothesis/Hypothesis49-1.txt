★How can a theorem or conjecture or hypothesis be proved to be unprovable?
Do as Godel did. Set up a contradiction such that the theorem is provable only if it is false. But the assumption was that arithmetic is consistent.  A similar trick also works with the Halting Problem for the Turing machine.  The Magic Turing Machine that can tell you, given the object Turing machine and an input whether the object Turing machine will stop.  A little fiddling soon gives you the result that the Magic Machine stops only if it does not stop. These are all variants of the Liar Paradox or the Russel Paradox.    Embed Quote
