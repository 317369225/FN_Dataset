★What's the best way to store a password in a plain-text file so that's it's not human-readable?I'm writing a small script which requires my Gmail login credential as part of the script. How can I store an encrypted version of the password and decrypt it whenever I run the script? It doesn't have to be VERY secure, just that someone reading the script shouldn't see the password. The script is going to be Linux-only, so I'm okay with using Bash, though I'd prefer Python as I'm more familiar with it.
I recommend rot-13 :)    Embed Quote
