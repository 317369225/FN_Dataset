★Is plain text email considered anachronistic?I always appreciated the clarity of plain text. I thought it was good for communication hygene. But html-mail seems to have improved a lot in the last decade. Has sticking to plain text email become the same as maintaining a beehive hairstyle?
It depends entirely on your audience, who the recipients are (age, level of computer experience), what platforms and mail clients they will read it on. Older smartphones will not render HTML well. Featurephones almost surely won't. Corporate email gateways will suppress, scrub or block attachments. Or indeed long messages. Even if they don't block or scrub then, it's annoying to read a page of HTML headers before you get the actual message text. With the mail filters of a few years ago, legitimate work-related emails from external senders would get routinely blocked if they contained (e.g. e-business card) GIFs of any size, even just 0.5KB. In general if you're mailing a community newsletter or mailing-list to non-computer types, plain ASCII is best for now.    Embed Quote
