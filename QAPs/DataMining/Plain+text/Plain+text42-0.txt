★Will one day humanity renounce at writing plain text, in favour of infographics?Infographic Why this question? Is it possible that because infographics are easier to understand, and while helped by computer, to never write again plain text, but enhanced text, that will look mostly like present day infographics?
No. That same question was posed with the advent of still photography. Then again with movies. And yet again with television.  The written word and images have co-existed peacefully for thousands of years and, I predict, will do so for thousands more.    Embed Quote
