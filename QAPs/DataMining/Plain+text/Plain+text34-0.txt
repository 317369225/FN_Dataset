★How many (standard 8.5"x11") pages would it take to store 100TB of plain text data?This is a follow up to: Upthere (company): How would you store 100 TB so that it is available for the next 100 years?
I created a word document, removed the margins and set the font to Calibri size 8. I was able to fill one page with 13,330 times the letter 'a'. Assuming one character = 1 byte, that would mean that it would take 10^14 / 13330 = 7.5 x 10^10. So 75 billion pages. This doesn't consider things like variable font size, newlines, unicode encoding (e.g. if the 100TB is in UTF32, you can print 4 times fewer pages) etc. Plus I am sure there's a more efficient way of encoding the text than naively printing it, something inspired by bar codes for instance. I'll try to figure it out and improve upon this answer.    Embed Quote
