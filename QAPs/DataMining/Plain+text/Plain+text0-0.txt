★How do mint.com and similar websites avoid storing passwords in plain text?
For passwords to Mint itself, we compute a secure hash of the user's chosen password and store only the hash (the hash is also salted - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal... ).  Hashing is a one-way function and cannot be reversed.   It is not possible to ever see or recover the password itself.  When the user tries to login, we compute the hash of the password they are attempting to use and compare it to the hashed value on record. (This is a standard technique which every site should use). For banking credentials, we generally must use reversible encryption for which we have special procedures and secure hardware kept in our secure and guarded datacenter.  The decryption keys never leave the hardware device (which is built to destroy the key material if the tamper protection is attacked).  This device will only decrypt after it is activated by a quorum of other keys, each of which is stored on a smartcard and also encrypted by a password known to only one person.  Furthermore the device requires a time-limited cryptographically-signed permission token for each decryption. The system (which I designed and patented) also has facilities for secure remote auditing of each decryption.    Embed Quote
