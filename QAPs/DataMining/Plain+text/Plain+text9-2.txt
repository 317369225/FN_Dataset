★Does a plain text without the a href tags count as a backlink?
Search engine algorithms are, of course, secret. There is disagreement in SEO circles in regard to the effectiveness plaintext "back-links." We are only sure that search engines pay attention to plaintext back-links, because they index and later crawl them. Keep in mind, that search engines are just trying to unite users with appropriate content. They will always try to weed out non-natural SEO gaming. However, some plaintext back-links will appear on sites, which prohibit linking, naturally. So its reasonable to assume that it will be factored in positively or neutrally, as long as it doesn't look suspicious.    Embed Quote
