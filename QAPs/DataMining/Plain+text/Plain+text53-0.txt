★Distributed Algorithms: Does operational transformation work on structured documents such as HTML if simply treated as plain text?The FAQ of Google Wave Protocol says that [HTML] "does not have desirable properties" and that "HTML makes OT (Operational Transforms) difficult if not impossible" [1]. Why is this so? What problems arise if HTML is treated simply as plain text and then OT applied? 1. http://www.waveprotocol.org/faq#...
My guess is that OT should work on HTML if treated as plain text. Though I don't see how one can ensure that the modifications will keep the HTML code operational. In the context of OT you would probably want each modification to keep the HTML code working and not have any intermediate snapshots which break it. Again, just a guess. I also don't any other reason why OT wouldn't work on the underlying HTML text code.    Embed Quote
