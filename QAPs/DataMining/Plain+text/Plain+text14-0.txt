★Is it possible for encrypted material to appear as if it were plain text?That is to a large extent it would not be considered to be encrypted by a casual, or non casual viewer
Yes.  This is called steganography. Hiding truly encrypted data in text is somewhat more difficult than hiding it in images or audio, but it can be done.  Usually the secret message will be much shorter than the "carrier" text.  It may be easier to make your text look like something which is already not supposed to be comprehensible, like the "dictionary salad" at the end of a spam message. Another option is to use a code, where you are talking or writing about one thing, but important words have been substituted with more innocuous ones.  This is much easier to accomplish, but does not offer the same resistance to analysis as a cipher.    Embed Quote
