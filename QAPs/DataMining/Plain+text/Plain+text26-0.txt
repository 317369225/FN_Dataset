★Why does Quora send our passwords in plain text over insecure HTTP?bcrypt: hey @Quora, sending login ... I reproduced myself by going to quora.com in a private tab in Google Chrome, logging in, and watching the traffic in Wireshark. It sent my password as an unencrypted POST over HTTP, not HTTPS. These days, even sites that are clueless about security at least send passwords over SSL. In this age of Starbucks wifi and the NSA, how is Quora still doing this?
I'm guessing that Quora simply hasn't made the switch to requiring https by default like some other sites have.  The option is certainly there, in Settings -> Privacy:    Embed Quote
