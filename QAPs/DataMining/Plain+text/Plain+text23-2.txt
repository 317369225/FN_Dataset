★When copying and pasting text, is there a simple way to purge formatting, and paste just plain text?Say you are copying content and want the text pasted as plain text, without the same style or color. You can always paste to a console window, then re-paste again, but surely there is a better solution? Different answers for Mac/Windows/Linux would be helpful.
The conventional approach in Windows is to paste to a Notepad document, then copy and paste to the target, provided the target does not offer a "paste as plain text" feature. There's a utility "PureText" (http://www.stevemiller.net/puret...) that seems like it would solve the issue, if you don't mind running an extra utility at startup.    Embed Quote
