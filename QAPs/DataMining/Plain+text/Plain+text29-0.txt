★Why did Apple change how weather information is displayed from graphics to plain text (in iOS 7)?
My best guess is the new notification centre is trying to bring the personality of Siri to the information. You can imagine Siri reading you this information. Another hint might be that the dark blurred background is the same for both notification centre and Siri. Your point about users not reading small strings of text doesn't make sense to me. You're probably going into notification centre to do just that, to read the first couple of lines of messages, emails, etc. Another UI like OS X also relies heavily on small strings of text and I don't think the majority of people are finding that too difficult. Personally I find the new notification centre a much nicer experience because it focuses on what is happening right now. It isn't concerned with trying to display anything and everything    Embed Quote
