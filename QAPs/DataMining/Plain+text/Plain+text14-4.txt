★Is it possible for encrypted material to appear as if it were plain text?That is to a large extent it would not be considered to be encrypted by a casual, or non casual viewer
Depends. To a computer: yes. Assuming you have encrypted your text or file using an encryption algorithm such as AES, you then pass the text to another algorithm which takes a random input (your ciphertext) and outputs a text consisting of letters with the same frequency as in the english language (or any other language of your choice). To a human: no. One look would be enough for anyone to be able to tell that above text isnt real english.    Embed Quote
