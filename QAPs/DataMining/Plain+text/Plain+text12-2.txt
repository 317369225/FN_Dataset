★Do plain-text/rich-text emails convert better or worse than HTML emails?
This is a great question.  The bottom line is that you must test for your specific market, list, messaging, etc. There are many factors that impact the performance of an email - From name, subject line, body copy, design, etc.  There are many studies that conclude that html email performs better, while others indicate text can perform better.  The answer is that they can both perform better than the other, but it depends upon your market.  And, within your market, you could discover that some segments perform better with one vs. the other.  S d suggest developing a statistically significant test (it's even worse to do a statistically insignificant test and plow forward assuming you have the right answer when you don't) if you have a big enough list. You can split the list randomly (i.e. 50% get one and 50% get the other), try to vary as few variables as possible, and then begin to uncover through your own metrics what appears to be working better...or worse.    Embed Quote
