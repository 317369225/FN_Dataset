★How can I send a plain text email to 700 contacts without it going to spam or promotions?
If they're already your contacts then the email shouldn't go to Spam. If you have their email address without consent then your message may go astray and you could be breaching the UK Data Protection Act. You could import the emails into an email provider such as MailChimp or Aweber then send a plain text newsletter or (a free) way to do it would be to send the emails through Gmail or Outlook in batches. Always make sure you BCC (blind copy) each contact in rather than putting their email addresses into the TO or CC field or they'll all be able to see each others email addresses - this is VERY bad practice!!    Embed Quote
