★Will secure protocols eventually replace all plain-text protocols online?As bandwidth and CPU power increases, will it make sense for all online communication to be sent through an encrypted layer?
Most secure protocols offer zero value addition to transferring the bulk of internet traffic ( especially for static content on websites), and technical issues aside, it costs extra both in terms of compute power and setting up a server to have appropriate certificates. No matter how good a technology is, if it costs more and doesn't solve a problem, it won't be adopted.    Embed Quote
