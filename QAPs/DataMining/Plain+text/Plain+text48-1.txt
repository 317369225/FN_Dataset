★Is there a way to avoid putting a proxy user name and password in plain text in Ubuntu?
If I have understood your situation correctly, your organization has some proxy settings which requires you to provide your credentials before allowing access to the internet. And you don't want to save your username and password in plain text in configuration files. Initially, when I had to put username and password for connecting to the Intenet via a USB modem using wvdial in /etc/wvdial.conf I had a similar feeling. However when I found out that the username and password are same for every consumer i.e kinda useless I stopped bothering about them being present in plain text on my disk. In your case, if you need your computer to automatically connect to the internet without prompting you for username/password every time it attempts to connect, you will have to save the credentials in on the disk in some manner. While saving in plaintext might sound absurd, saving them in encrypted format would require the application that uses them to be able to decrypt them. So you would end up saving the password to the encrypted credentials in plain text on your hard drive - which sounds doubly absurd. Or encrypt them like the SSH private keys get frustrated by the computer asking you for the password required to decrypt your credential file every time it needed them. Not having to save the password anywhere even in encrypted format is the basis of advanced authentication protocols like OAuth. In my opinion, if the credentials are present in a file that can be read  only by the root user, it makes things pretty much secure. And what is  actually outrageously ridiculous is the proxy service which requires  you to transmit your credentials in plain text over the network.    Embed Quote
