★When copying and pasting text, is there a simple way to purge formatting, and paste just plain text?Say you are copying content and want the text pasted as plain text, without the same style or color. You can always paste to a console window, then re-paste again, but surely there is a better solution? Different answers for Mac/Windows/Linux would be helpful.
On Mac, I use an app called Clipmenu. It allows you to keep a history of snippets i.e. copied text, and paste either formatted or plain text. There are shortcut keys so it is really fast also + you have a history of your last 50-100 copied text.    Embed Quote
