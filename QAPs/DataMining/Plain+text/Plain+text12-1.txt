★Do plain-text/rich-text emails convert better or worse than HTML emails?
Conversion may mean a few things, in this context, I'll assume it means a user performs the call-to-action in the email which is measured by seeing if the user goes to a website where you can track their conversions further. In our experience, plain-text email has a higher deliverability then HTML - we infer that this is because many "scrubbers" and inbox-analysis tools suggest that plaintext emails make it past more bayesian filters and actually have a chance for user engagement.  However, the copy/messaging and segmentation targetting had a dramatic impact in the open rate and conversion.  The same email targetted at a more qualified list obviously performed better.  On the other hand, use of certain forbidden-keywords (like Free, Now, Click, etc) in either the subject or body of the message got scrubbed as frequently if not even more so then HTML emails.  Probably due to the fact that its easier to parse (and learn from bayesian or other spam filtering tools).  In the last year or so, plaintext also got better conversion due to the fact (we think) people are reading it from their mobile devices, they simply load faster (or perceptively load faster since it does not require the "load images, etc")  In our last batch of tests though, our results showed that a strong message with succinct copy work better for broad lists; and HTML with a single call-to-action image (embedding forbidden text in a graphical form such as "Signup Now") and simple inline-css for typography handling work well for targetted segmented list.  Here's a nice guide of what email clients support what: http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/    Embed Quote
