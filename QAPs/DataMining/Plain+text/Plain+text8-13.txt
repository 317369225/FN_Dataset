★What's the best way to store a password in a plain-text file so that's it's not human-readable?I'm writing a small script which requires my Gmail login credential as part of the script. How can I store an encrypted version of the password and decrypt it whenever I run the script? It doesn't have to be VERY secure, just that someone reading the script shouldn't see the password. The script is going to be Linux-only, so I'm okay with using Bash, though I'd prefer Python as I'm more familiar with it.
First use base64 to encrypt the password and then pickle it. store it in text file. To fetch password, unpickle the text, decrypt using base64. There you have your original password.    Embed Quote
