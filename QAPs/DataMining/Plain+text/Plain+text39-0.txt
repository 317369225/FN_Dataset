★How do I get list of articles from web and then parse them to plain text?I am creating an app where you choose a web from given list and the app would automatically get url for each article on web and then parse this article into plain text. I have problem with the part of getting list of all particles, since for the second part I found several softwares like Readability. Any help or hint?
Need more info, what language are you developing in, and in what framework? What do you mean by "web," are you referring to a web-like data structure? Or do you mean an article database on the web? So that you select "pubmed" and you're given all the articles on pubmed? I'm not sure I follow entirely what you're describing, but it's the latter, then good luck! EDIT: Furthermore, what it seems like you're describing would be illegal I believe. My understanding (correct me if I'm wrong) is that you're not allowed to scrape entire article contents and reprint them in your own medium. The best you could do is to simply provide a list of articles, or you'd need a system of credential mapping to ensure that the person retrieving the article has access to its contents.    Embed Quote
