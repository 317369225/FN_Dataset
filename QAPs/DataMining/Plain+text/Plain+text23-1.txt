★When copying and pasting text, is there a simple way to purge formatting, and paste just plain text?Say you are copying content and want the text pasted as plain text, without the same style or color. You can always paste to a console window, then re-paste again, but surely there is a better solution? Different answers for Mac/Windows/Linux would be helpful.
For Windows/Office: In Office 2010, after you paste, press control and you'll get a variety of paste options (paste text only, etc). You can also right click and look for "Paste Special" or use the the "Paste Special" button in the Home>Clipboard section of the Office Ribbon (which also exists in Office 2007).    Embed Quote
