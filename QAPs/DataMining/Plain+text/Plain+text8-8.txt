★What's the best way to store a password in a plain-text file so that's it's not human-readable?I'm writing a small script which requires my Gmail login credential as part of the script. How can I store an encrypted version of the password and decrypt it whenever I run the script? It doesn't have to be VERY secure, just that someone reading the script shouldn't see the password. The script is going to be Linux-only, so I'm okay with using Bash, though I'd prefer Python as I'm more familiar with it.
1. Deploy any reasonable Python scheme herein using a module. 2. Run it once, thus creating a foo.pyc module. 3. Encrypt the plain text foo.py module (decrypt only for any future revisions). 4. The gibberish pyc file is all that is needed henceforth (but note, it can be reverse-engineered with some effort).    Embed Quote
