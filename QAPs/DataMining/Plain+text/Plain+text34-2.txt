★How many (standard 8.5"x11") pages would it take to store 100TB of plain text data?This is a follow up to: Upthere (company): How would you store 100 TB so that it is available for the next 100 years?
Impossible to tell. Assuming an alphabetic language, a 1-byte-per-character encoding (e.g. ASCII) and 2,000 characters per page (a rule-of-thumb approximation for making text in English comfortable to read), that's roughly 5*10^10 pages. But any of these assumptions may or may not be accurate. IBM famously had its name written with 35 xenon atoms. Use that technique and you'll make do with far less paper. If your 100TB are in Unicode, you can further reduce the number of pages by half, and so on.    Embed Quote
