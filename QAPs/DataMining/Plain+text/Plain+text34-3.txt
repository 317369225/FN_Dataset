★How many (standard 8.5"x11") pages would it take to store 100TB of plain text data?This is a follow up to: Upthere (company): How would you store 100 TB so that it is available for the next 100 years?
If you print each page at 80 characters per line with 30 lines the that is 2400 chars per page. a Terra-byte is 1,099,511,627,776 bytes so 1099511627776 / 2400 is 458,129,844.9 pages lets call that 458 million pages. or 46 billion pages for 100TB If you print you pages with a smaller font (say 132 per line) and with closer line spacing then you could cut that number down a bit. I guess however you cannot go too far for long term data storage so the text will still be readable.    Embed Quote
