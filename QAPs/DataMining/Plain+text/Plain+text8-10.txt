★What's the best way to store a password in a plain-text file so that's it's not human-readable?I'm writing a small script which requires my Gmail login credential as part of the script. How can I store an encrypted version of the password and decrypt it whenever I run the script? It doesn't have to be VERY secure, just that someone reading the script shouldn't see the password. The script is going to be Linux-only, so I'm okay with using Bash, though I'd prefer Python as I'm more familiar with it.
Personally, I suggest using 2-step verification and application-specific passwords. Such passwords could be encrypted or stored by one of the ways above, and if someone gains access to them, they won't be too useful and can be easily revoked.    Embed Quote
