★Is it safe to use the hash of the plain text as a key for encryption?Note that the comparability of cipher texts is desired here. The goal is that every party can encrypt data and publish it, and every third party that does not know the plain text can determine if the plain texts of two ciphertexts are the same, but can not recover the plain text.
Using a hash of a message plaintext for a key is not semantically secure [1], since it is trivial to determine whether a given ciphertext is the encryption of a particular plaintext. That is the case for any deterministic encryption scheme. Convergent encryption uses a similar idea [2]. Bitcasa is supposedly using convergent encryption to support file deduplication. Convergent encryption is vulnerable to a dictionary attack guessing the plaintext. That's why the proof in the paper assumes plaintexts are uniformly distributed, which is not realistic.
