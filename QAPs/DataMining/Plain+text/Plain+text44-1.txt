★How can I send a plain text email to 700 contacts without it going to spam or promotions?
There is virtually no 100% sure way of sending marketing email without risking that some will go to spam even if you follow the best practices. It's even more impossible to avoid the Gmail promotion box. That said there is also the concept of transactional email. If you can somehow hook your contact list to a service which is sending them regular notifications then you could apply for a service like sendgrid.com They have a different price for transactional email and for marketing email. Transactional is usually way cheaper. And the delivery rate is close to 100%.  And of course every now and then you could add your text ad at the bottom of the transactional emails.    Embed Quote
