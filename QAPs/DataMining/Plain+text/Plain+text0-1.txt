★How do mint.com and similar websites avoid storing passwords in plain text?
Presumably they need access to the plaintext password in order to scrape banking web sites (or source such scraping to another organization, as I think they do). It's likely that they encrypt users' passwords before storing them, and manage their crypto keys in such a way that a database or even web site compromise would not expose the keys or a decryption oracle for the database's contents.    Embed Quote
