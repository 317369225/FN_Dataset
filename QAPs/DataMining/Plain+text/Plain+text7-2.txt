★Is plain text email considered anachronistic?I always appreciated the clarity of plain text. I thought it was good for communication hygene. But html-mail seems to have improved a lot in the last decade. Has sticking to plain text email become the same as maintaining a beehive hairstyle?
It may by people who are considered to be "tech savvy" (whatever that means at this particular moment) and by people who work exclusively in the tech industry. However, for most people, text-based emails, with the occasional picture or media attachment, are still regarded as “high tech” or "newfangled." And while this may shock many regular Quora users...there are actually several billion people in the world who have either never used email or who have never heard of it. Mind-blowing,eh? HTML-based email will be with us for some time to come. It is easy to use, easy to understand (by many) and it’s easier to teach to people who feel uncomfortable with technology. Video-conferencing has been with us since the 1970s, but isn’t commonly used even in situations where it might benefit all involved. Video phones have been available for consumer use almost since that time as well, but their popularity has never truly "caught on." For many people, change takes place at a glacial pace, if at all. To believe that many or most would adopt changes in a technology that they still view as being "new" (at least to them), is to underestimate how gradual the change process is for some people.    Embed Quote
