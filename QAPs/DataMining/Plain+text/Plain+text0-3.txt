★How do mint.com and similar websites avoid storing passwords in plain text?
As Matt Jones said, Mint probably need to store the full password, rather than just a hash of it, so they can use it to scrape data from other websites.  So they have to store the full password, encrypted in some way.  If you're doing two-way encryption, the question becomes how to stores the keys securely. I used to work for a startup that sold a hardware/software solution for crypto and key management.  (Ingrian, which was later acquired by SafeNet.)  There is special encryption hardware that can store keys in tamper-proof storage with special ACLs, and which can delete the keys if the hardware is messed with. Hopefully they're using something like that, rather than just having the encryption key(s) sitting in a text file somewhere.    Embed Quote
