★What's the best way to store a password in a plain-text file so that's it's not human-readable?I'm writing a small script which requires my Gmail login credential as part of the script. How can I store an encrypted version of the password and decrypt it whenever I run the script? It doesn't have to be VERY secure, just that someone reading the script shouldn't see the password. The script is going to be Linux-only, so I'm okay with using Bash, though I'd prefer Python as I'm more familiar with it.
I think the best way is to use OS-provided password management system (Keychain on Mac, Gnome/KDE keyring on Linux, CryptoKeyring on Win). It was designed for this specific use-case and bundled with distributive. For Python you can use keyring [1]. I'm not sure if there any convenient way to use with Bash.
