★What's the best way to store a password in a plain-text file so that's it's not human-readable?I'm writing a small script which requires my Gmail login credential as part of the script. How can I store an encrypted version of the password and decrypt it whenever I run the script? It doesn't have to be VERY secure, just that someone reading the script shouldn't see the password. The script is going to be Linux-only, so I'm okay with using Bash, though I'd prefer Python as I'm more familiar with it.
Assuming that you are going to store the script someplace that is that is not readable by anyone but you (or root) and that you are running Linux or have the standard tool library available, I would use tr.   http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/tr/ --------------------EDIT Apparetnly the coreutils does not have tr, scratch that. I see the OP is usinig Linux anyway. Or Cygwin on windows or coreutils for win32 here: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/... ------------------End For example using simple ROT13 Encryption (substitution of an alpha to the alpha 13 characters ahead) $ tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M makes password=cnffjbeq    Embed Quote
