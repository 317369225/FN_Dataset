★What are some good examples of/tips for writing plain text resumes?I've got a resume that I carefully laid out in InDesign, and while it works when sending to individuals, sites that use other services or aggregators often want plain text or .doc files. How can I optimize my resume for this?
I used to work as a freelance resume writer for Resume Writing Service and CV Services from the Best Resume Writers and I advise that if you are experiencing any difficulties or need advice, turn to a professional editing service to help you uncover any mistakes or improve your resume. Finding and getting a good, rewarding job is important so do no leave it to trial and error or attempt to save your money. A good job outweighs the cost of a resume.
