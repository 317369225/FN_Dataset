★What is the allure of writing in a plain text editor?
I lay one overarching sin at the door of GUI WYSIWYG: promoting decoration over substance. The time to format text or a spreadsheet is only after you are done gathering the facts, carefully analyzing them, thinking about them critically and writing clearly and persuasively. Instead, too many users spend the bulk of their time trying to make the final report look pretty. Even so, at that they usually fail miserably and church out amatuerish mishmashes full of misspellings, inconsistent formatting, non-existant cross referencing and a parade of other misused features. Templates and styles, let alone macros, seem to be far beyond the ability of even users who have been "trained" in programs like Word and Excel. Writing in plain text minimizes the temptation to substitute poor style for good substance.    Embed Quote
