★What percent of the top 50 most visited websites store passwords in plain text?
It is not possible to answer this question. None of these sites AFAIK sends you back your password, which is the only way to be sure that the passwords are stored in plain text (you could imagine that the password database is encrypted, but this does not help much, security - wise) The sites usually ask you to go to a predefined URL they send you to change your password. You cannot derive from that whether they store the password or a hash. You can have hope, though. Today most of the serious sites moved to a hash, some of them even do it right (by using a SLOW hashing algorithm like bcrypt + salting). Some of them nevertheless have an insane way of handling the passwords. The French Internet provider Free asks for your password (you are supposed to send it to them in an email) to close the mail account they provide (if you choosevto use it and want to have a @free.Fr mail)    Embed Quote
