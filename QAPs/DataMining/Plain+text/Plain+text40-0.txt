★What are the privacy implications of storing OAuth tokens as plain text?OAuth tokens, unlike passwords, are usually stored as plain text in databases. Doesn't this provide a serious privacy concern to the end-user, considering a developer can pull up a console and access any desired permission-granted information?
The whole point of OAuth is to allow a user to tell the provider that the developer is trustworthy so I would argue that saying the developer is trustworthy is a valid assumption. How would you store them otherwise? If you encrypt tokens in a way where the developer cannot recover them, then how is the developer going to tell the provider "oh hey look at this shiny token. it's liek totally valid"? If you obfuscate tokens in a way where the developer can recover them, then the developer can recover them and use them.    Embed Quote
