★Is plain text email considered anachronistic?I always appreciated the clarity of plain text. I thought it was good for communication hygene. But html-mail seems to have improved a lot in the last decade. Has sticking to plain text email become the same as maintaining a beehive hairstyle?
I think it depends on the context. In a business context, I kind of enjoy receiving HTML-email.  It has a tendency of looking very web page like.  Of course, the purpose of these types of e-mails is to create action, one that makes it easy to click onto their site.  In that regard, I would say text-based email looks outdated.  I haven't kept up in the technology of HTML email, but do have to say that services like gmail, sometimes don't handle it well.  They have images turned off by default and the email, frankly, looks pretty ugly until you 'allow' images (but that is a specific action you have to take).  I can't really comment on other major email services. In a personal context, most of my incoming emails are from friends.   The writing and format is primarily text-based.  Some have HTML turned on, so they use their smilies, but if they didn't, I wouldn't think any different.  I'd say that on a personal level emails, plain text is fine.  I think it is unlikely that any of your friends are expecting an informal message to look spectacular.    Embed Quote
