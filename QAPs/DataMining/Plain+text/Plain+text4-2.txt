★Will Evernote ever allow you to export notes to plain text?
Bojan, on what platforms would you want export as plain text and how would you want to handle multiple notes. eg: would you want the choice of generating individual text files or sometimes want them concatenated? Would you be like the chance to possibly concatenate the notes directly into an RTF document, if you wanted to save just a little formatting, say emphasis with bold and italic? I ask because I'm working on a plain text client for iPad, Mac and Windows. I'm considering if it is also worth including my OOFILE report writer to be able to do paginated reports of multiple notes out to various formats.    Embed Quote
