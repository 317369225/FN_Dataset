★How can I send a plain text email to 700 contacts without it going to spam or promotions?
You might get lucky and be able to deliver this many messages before getting banned or throttled, but I wouldn't count on it. You should really use a paid service for this, like MailChimp. Companies like them constantly track and optimize their deliverability rates. You could also use an outbound SMTP service like www.authsmtp.com. But be warned that if enough of your recipients report you for spam, they will cut you off. (I have no affiliation with either of these services, other than being a customer.)    Embed Quote
