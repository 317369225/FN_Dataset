★Do plain-text/rich-text emails convert better or worse than HTML emails?
I ran a split test on a simple transaction email sent to approximately 5k people.  Half of them received an HTML email with only minor styling and branded header image.  The other half received a completely plain text email. The plain text email received a better open rate but the difference was insignificant.  It was the difference of 0.02%. That amount of difference would be considered merely chance and in no way reflective of being better or worse. I think the quality in which your HTML email is coded, the audience you are sending to, and the context of the message are all going to factor into which performances better for each particular scenario.    Embed Quote
