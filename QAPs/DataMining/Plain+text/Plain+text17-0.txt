★Can encrypted data be mined in order to get the original 'plain text'?I'm not sure if the fields of cryptography and data mining have already had a long and fruitful relationship, but was wondering if it hasn't then perhaps it might be a good idea (on a code breaking front)? if not why not? (I'm assuming large amounts of encrypted data would be needed for this...some idea of scale would be interesting to find out)
The very short answer is that there's a lot research aimed at preventing this sort of thing.  In particular, any public key cryptosystem needs to use an encryption method which is hard to learn in some sense, or else it's not secure.  See http://people.csail.mit.edu/rive... for a reasonably non-technical overview.    Embed Quote
