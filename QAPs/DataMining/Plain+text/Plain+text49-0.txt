★What are some ways to break a known plain text 64 bit DES ECB cipher?Looking for ideas to break a known plaintext 64 bit DES ECB cipher. Rent processing, known software, any ideas are helpful?
DES ecb(electronic code block) is a block cipher operation which is basically applying DES encryption/decryption to each block of plaintext. So, as far as I know, DES is vulnerable to analytic attacks, such as differential attack. It uses statistical properties (distribution, and so on) from the plaintext, so It efficient when a cryptanalyst can choose plaintexts and obtain ciphertexts (chosen plaintext). This paper should help I think. Page on ucsb.edu    Embed Quote
