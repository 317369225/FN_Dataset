★Will Evernote ever allow you to export notes to plain text?
In addition to the answer above, many Evernote notes contain "resources" (images, audio and other file attachments) as well as note links. So the process of creating plain text notes could be lossy. If plain text notes are important there's a few possibilities. Evernote supports HTML export from its desktop clients. You can get one HTML file per note. From this point existing tools will allow you to create a text export. As an aside, this is a nice way to get all your resources out of Evernote. Evernote's API also supports getting the text from notes if you're up for a little programming.    Embed Quote
