★What are good plain text and XML datasets?What would be a good XML (or JSON) dataset to load into a Document-oriented Database and try some queries and perhaps analytics? Similar question about plain texts.
Building on Ian McCullough's answer: Census data, for example, makes sense only when it's tied to specific geographies,and for market targeting purposes, the more specific, the better. In this case, you'd want to join mapping data to the survey data. For Mongo, you'd want to convert the TIGER/Line Shapefiles for census tracts or block groups to geoJSON using something like ogr2ogr as suggested in this stackexchange Q&A: How to upload TIGER shapefiles into MongoDB? Generally, the open data governments provide is in older formats rather than JSON, so you'd need to convert it. Block group data can quickly become overwhelming in size, so maybe it's best to start with larger aggregations such as counties or states, and then move down into block groups once you've established a working method.    Embed Quote
