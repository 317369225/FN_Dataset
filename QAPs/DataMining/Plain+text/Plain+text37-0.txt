★What is the best plain text editor (equivalent to the MS Notepad) for Linux? Is there a simple program I can use for plain text that can be sent to Linux, Windows, and Apple machines?
It depends on what you want to do. If you want to use the same editor everywhere, use vi. Specifically, use vi not vim. As great as vim is, systems like Solaris and FreeBSD don't come with it installed. You can run vim in vi-compatible mode too. OpenVMS has a vim version available, as does Solaris and FreeBSD (and its kin). So does Windows and MacOS X. So it's s good choice for portability. If you are using a GUI, you might want to give jedit a try. As I recall, it's a Java app that runs all over the place.    Embed Quote
