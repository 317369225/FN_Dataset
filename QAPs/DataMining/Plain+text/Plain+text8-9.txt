★What's the best way to store a password in a plain-text file so that's it's not human-readable?I'm writing a small script which requires my Gmail login credential as part of the script. How can I store an encrypted version of the password and decrypt it whenever I run the script? It doesn't have to be VERY secure, just that someone reading the script shouldn't see the password. The script is going to be Linux-only, so I'm okay with using Bash, though I'd prefer Python as I'm more familiar with it.
If you would like to be able to have other people view the script but not read your password, why not store the password in an environment variable? This can be done with os.environ(http://docs.python.org/library/o...) For instance, your python code could store a reference to os.environ['APPLICATION_PASSWORD']. Of course, you'd have to set the password at run-time, hopefully with a secured script.    Embed Quote
