★Why is most of the corporate email still being sent in plain text and not encrypted?
Why not? Unencrypted communication is the default, and setting up secure e-mail requires complicated key management. Unless there is an imminent threat, people take the path of least resistance.

What are the chances that a sophisticated hacker is targeting you, and that by some miracle encrypting your e-mail prevented him/her from reading it (even though everything is unencrypted on the endpoints)?    Embed Quote
