★Will secure protocols eventually replace all plain-text protocols online?As bandwidth and CPU power increases, will it make sense for all online communication to be sent through an encrypted layer?
We'd be better off if popular Web sites (and video-distribution services) started making widespread use of multicast and distributed caching everywhere. (They already do make some use of this, e.g. Google with its internal content-distribution network for YouTube and other sites.) Such idealized multicast protocols will generally be unencrypted because the goal is to distribute a site's contents (or a video or file) simultaneously to everybody who is asking for it. So, no, let's hope not.    Embed Quote
