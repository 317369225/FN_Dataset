★Can encrypted data be mined in order to get the original 'plain text'?I'm not sure if the fields of cryptography and data mining have already had a long and fruitful relationship, but was wondering if it hasn't then perhaps it might be a good idea (on a code breaking front)? if not why not? (I'm assuming large amounts of encrypted data would be needed for this...some idea of scale would be interesting to find out)
The whole idea of cryptanalysis is to find patterns in ciphertext or its transformations that would reveal some structure of the key or the plaintext. So you can consider it to be a specialised field within data mining. What you are thinking of is probably a version of differential cryptanalysis or any more general statistical attack on cryptographic algorithms.    Embed Quote
