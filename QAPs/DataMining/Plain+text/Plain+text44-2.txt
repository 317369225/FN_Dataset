★How can I send a plain text email to 700 contacts without it going to spam or promotions?
Sending a message as plain text won't automatically put you in the Junk Folder. Having a message that is only text might be weighed as a factor in your reputation score, but it's only a factor. Other things will also come into play (and the mailbox providers are careful not to let anyone know what all those factors are). As for landing in promotions, it will only land there if it is a promotion. In which case, don't sweat it—you're in good company. It sounds like you're trying to game the system, which is just foolish. Write compelling content, offer people something they want and you won't have to play any silly games to get your content read and for people to respond.    Embed Quote
