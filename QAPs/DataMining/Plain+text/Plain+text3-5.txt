★Will secure protocols eventually replace all plain-text protocols online?As bandwidth and CPU power increases, will it make sense for all online communication to be sent through an encrypted layer?
Secure protocols also imply secure content. Right now, most content caches deduce content-cacheability by the type of traffic. This includes your browser cache. For instance,  in the case of secure content - all images, videos would be held in memory instead of being written to the disk. Using secure communications everywhere would hinder rather than help internet-scale computing.    Embed Quote
