★Twitter widget - plain text?Is it possible to add a plain-text twitter stream to my blog? Are such codes no longer allowed?
I hadn't known it was ever possible to do this - would be interested to see an example of such a thing. Have a look at this page "Editing content" from Warwick Uni, in particular the bit about plaintext=true - I've not tried it though so don't know how well it will work for your needs. The various Twitter widgets bring the bells and whistles version of tweets to a website - the tweets look like tweets and you can interact with them (retweet, reply etc - if you're logged in and have an account). I know that Twitter has said that, after 5 March 2013, it will no longer support RSS output feeds from Twitter streams - possibly RSS has been used to import plain text tweets into a website and will work, but only for another month!
