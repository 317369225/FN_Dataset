★What is the best plain text editor (equivalent to the MS Notepad) for Linux? Is there a simple program I can use for plain text that can be sent to Linux, Windows, and Apple machines?
In all the Linux distros, you get an inbuilt editor called "Gedit" or "Text Editor" which is very plain and simple. It also supports various themes and color schemes and also supports many popular programming languages.    Embed Quote
