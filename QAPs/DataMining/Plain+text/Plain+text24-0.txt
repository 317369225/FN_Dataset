★Why is the plain text on my website appearing with symbols?
This usually happens when the page doesn't provide an encoding header, in which case the browser has to guests what encoding the page uses purely on the text in the page, which can cause confusion since some languages are similar but use different encodings. UTF-8 was created to try to solve this issue, but it's not perfect as well. However, it's a good starting point. If you are the developer of the site, make sure you send a correct UTF8 header tag in all pages so when a visitor visits your site his browser knows what to display.    Embed Quote
