★Why is most of the corporate email still being sent in plain text and not encrypted?
I can only offer a guess as to why encrypted email has not gained mainstream adoption. The majority of large companies CTOs perceive the risk as being negligible.   Think of the trillions of e-mails send everyday with only a handful of them being "truly" sensitive.  It would be like finding a needle in a haystack, the problem being you don't know if the needle is even there. Smaller companies may not even be aware that email encryption is possible.  I think most semi-savvy people are under the firm belief that email is not secure and use it as such (i.e. making a conscious decision not to transmit ultra sensitive documents  electronically).  The remaining balance simply are oblivious to any potential risks or also consider them negligible.    Embed Quote
