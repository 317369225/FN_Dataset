★Is there a way to avoid putting a proxy user name and password in plain text in Ubuntu?
No, there is no way to avoid putting the proxy user name and password in the plain text file. This is by design, since Linux is designed as a server OS, even when running on the desktop. There is no logic that provides for prompting the password in apt-get. However, this is not a fundamental limitation. apt-get would be modified to prompt for the password. But I would think that it is not a priority.    Embed Quote
