★What's the best way to store a password in a plain-text file so that's it's not human-readable?I'm writing a small script which requires my Gmail login credential as part of the script. How can I store an encrypted version of the password and decrypt it whenever I run the script? It doesn't have to be VERY secure, just that someone reading the script shouldn't see the password. The script is going to be Linux-only, so I'm okay with using Bash, though I'd prefer Python as I'm more familiar with it.
As the password is already encrypted I'm going to assume you're working with 'binary data' while likely contains characters which are not easy to work with in text files - some of them will be non printable and will require manual escaping, etc. I suggest just base64 encoding it. As others have pointed out this offers no additional security whatsoever but it would allow you to base64 encode the encrypted password into a copy / pasteable string for easy and convenient use inside the program / config file. You don't need additional security as the password is already encrypted according to your original question. So anyone who sees this string can base64 decode it and be left with an encrypted password.    Embed Quote
