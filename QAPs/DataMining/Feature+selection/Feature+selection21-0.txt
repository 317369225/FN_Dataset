★What is the difference between feature selection and feature learning?I'm just beginner at Machine Learning and recently came across the term feature learning. I would like to know how it is different from feature selection ?
Assume a binary classification problem. Suppose there are 20 different features. But only 10 of these seem useful for classification (either based on experiments or some other evidence). So you choose these 10. This is called as feature selection. In order to do feature selection, you may require to do experiments with features. In general, feature learning refers to learning the relationship between input features and true class of a training instance.    Embed Quote
