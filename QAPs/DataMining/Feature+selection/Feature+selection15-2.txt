★What are the most commonly used ways to perform feature selection for k-means clustering?I have 10,000 data points, each of them having the same 10 features. I want to perform clustering on those data points: what are the most commonly used ways to select the most useful features?
10 features is not a lot, you may not need any feature selection at all, but still sometimes there could be plain noise in attributes. Try this 1. check the correlation between all possible pairs of attributes, if correlation is strong remove one among them 2. Try random subset of attributes and do trial and error for few runs. Points to think: 1. Normalize your data before you run clustering This is very important to get useful results Data Preprocessing - Normalization 2. Selecting features is fine,  do already know any groups or labels for the dataset? if not you cannot easily evaluate how good your clustering is performing. If you cannot evaluate anything, there is no need for feature selection    Embed Quote
