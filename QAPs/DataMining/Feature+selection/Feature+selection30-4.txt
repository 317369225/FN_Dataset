★Which feature selection approach typically yields a more accurate (in out of sample performance) model: black box or intuition (more detailed explanation of question inside)?
In my experience I see more of the former - simply because it's easier.  If architects are confident in their hypothesis then they simply charge ahead and build the algorithm they think is right.  Also, there is no pure form of the latter.  When even with a completely naive bays model the architect still determines the inputs - and subsequently uses his/her bias/expertise to influence the development of the learning algorithm.    Embed Quote
