★What is the best information theory based feature selection approach?
The entropy of fields with a high level of distinctness in their entries, may often be used as a strong signal while running a de-duplication process in a database containing named entities and creating mini-clusters of named entities which might be referring to the same thing - despite slight variations in spelling, text and a few fields. For example - consider a data-base of business places, where the name of the same place might have slight string and spelling variations. If two such rows match on an attribute having high-entropy (high level of distinctness) such as the phone number, then we have a fairly strong signal that they refer to the same place. Not so useful if they match on a low-entry attribute such as say, the kind of menu the restaurant has (Indian/Chinese/Spanish) - there are likely to be a multitude of such restaurants for each kind of menu. [might throw in a clearer example at some point in the future]    Embed Quote
