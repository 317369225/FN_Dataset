★What is the difference between principal component analysis (PCA) and feature selection in machine learning? Is PCA a means of feature selection?
PCA refers to a very specific technique for finding a linear transformation (a matrix) that transforms a data set to a lower dimension.  So if the training data set has vectors (data points) of dimension N, the PCA transformation matrix will have dimension M by N and will transform each vector to a lower dimension M by a simple matrix multiply.  The PCA transformation is the linear transform that most accurately reconstructs the training data when you apply the transform twice: once to transform the data down to the lower M dimension space and a second time to transform it back again to the original space.  The criteria for this is minimum mean squared error, and it can be shown that the optimal PCA matrix is obtained using a singular value decomposition (SVD). Feature selection does not refer to a specific technique or to a specific objective function .  For example you could find the matrix over all matrices that simply select M of N dimension that most accurately reconstructs the original data, but it's unlikely that this would be the same as the PCA transformation for the same data set.  You might also want to find the M features that will give you the best classification performance for a given type of model.    Embed Quote
