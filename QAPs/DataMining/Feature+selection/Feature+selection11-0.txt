★Feature Selection: What are the best alternatives to stepwise & best subsets regression?I'm working with a (relatively small) time series.  I have a number of independent variables that demonstrate both contextual relevance to predicting my dependent variable / meaningful associations with my dependent variable (correlations >90%).  What is the best way to select an ensemble of multivariate independent variables (features) that minimize (out of sample) error?
Keep in mind that stepwise regression is a REALLY easy way to get yourself caught. It's like running down the rabbit hole headfirst, eyes closed, and arms flailing as you are making that implicit assumption that variables with good information criteria are also variables with sound model significance. In less words, stepwise regression is like overfitting, but entirely worse. I would recommend LASSO'ing whatever you've got in front of you. All of the model selection/variable removal/dimension reduction, none of the consequences. The Lasso method basically coaxes your model down to a regularized (read: simplified) model with fewer variables and a minimized cross-validation error. It's basically God's gift to earth in the world of multivariate regression. ___ I suppose that, in a general sense, the Lasso method is similar to stagewise regression methods, but I would contend that it is more similar to boosting methods. With the Lasso, you use a regularization parameter (lambda) to determine how many variables you throw out. Then, using CV methods, you determine the optimum lambda, and then throw out that-many-lambda of variables.    Embed Quote
