★Which feature selection approach typically yields a more accurate (in out of sample performance) model: black box or intuition (more detailed explanation of question inside)?
I think that if you let the machine run and optimize everything, most of the time you will be wrong unless you let an "intuition expert" intercede.  It doesn't matter if you begin with one, or have one sort out the optimized mess that you end up with (even after cross validation).  Intuition knows about all of the covariates that aren't in your model specifications.  And the ones that are in your model that the experts do not know about need lots of data to prove out.  And even with lots of data you need context and also have to worry about Black Swans.  So let us all work together .... :)    Embed Quote
