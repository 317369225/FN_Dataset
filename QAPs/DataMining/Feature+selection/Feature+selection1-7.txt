★How do I perform feature selection?
Learn a hyperplane based ML model and observe weight values. If some thing large it means it is that much valuable. If you only want to train a predictor then take the benefits of elastic net or L1 regularization that implicitly select important features Random Forests is another way of doing this. Analyze the learned nodes and keep the frequency of each feature dimension defined as a tree node. There are many other algorithmic ways also like backward or forward selection that basically selects most distinctive dimension greedily one by one for each iteration Completely different approach is to project data into better space with kernel tricks or PCA, LDA type projection algorithms. However this way loosens the semantic meanings of features.    Embed Quote
