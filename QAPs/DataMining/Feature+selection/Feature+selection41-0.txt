★For a feature selection/dimensionality reduction problem, what's the difference between PCA, LDA, and the AdaBoost algorithm? Which is the best to use and why?
PCA, unsupervised, reduces dimensions of features but doesn't keep the origin meaning of the features anymore . LDA, supervised, reduces dimensions by mapping data to a hyper-plane (so it will be linearly separable) and maximizing the ratio of between group variance and within group variance.    Embed Quote
