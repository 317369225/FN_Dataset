★What is the best feature selection algorithms relative to which kind of data?What are some best working feature selection algorithms and their work cases?
T-test, F-test, AIC/BIC are some of the methods which can be used in feature selection. T-test and F-test have their origins in statistics, while AIC/BIC come from entropy theory. T-test is quite simple and hence it might classify lot of useful features as useless, if used on one feature at a time. F-test is an improvement over it which uses difference in sum of square errors instead of means. AIC is an entropy based measure,BIC is an improvement over it to avoid overfitting. All of above methods work on multivariate numerical data.    Embed Quote
