★Why is feature selection considered a subset of dimensionality reduction?Why aren't those synonyms?
Because there are other ways of reducing dimensions. Let's say that you have a wide dataset with 100 variables. You work it out and select 4 or 5 of them. That is feature selection. When you select features, you are picking part of the ones available. Now let's say that you have the same dataset and you do PCA on it and get 3 principal components. You are not selecting features, you are extracting them. That is not feature selection but extraction. Same thing happens if you compute a new variable that captures the signal from several others. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
