★How can Fourier transform be used for feature selection in machine learning?
What I am about to describe is an example of feature extraction through Fourier transform. Consider a data set of songs and you want to classify them based on their genre. Then we can either extract features we desire from the time or the frequency domain. For extracting from the frequency domain, the Fourier transform is done. In order to conduct the classification, we must do a bit of preprocessing. Here convert to the Mel scale. This is basically converting from the normal scale to a logarithmic scale because we are more sensitive to lower frequencies. Then we take the Fourier transform of the song. This brings us to the frequency domain. Now we apply a few filters based on the importance of the frequencies required. Then we obtain the Mel Cepstral Frequency Coefficients (MFCC)s of the song. Based on the coefficients obtained we can classify the songs.We may use any classification method to sort the songs. We used KNN to classify the songs. We managed to get 93% success rate over 10 genres. If you want the codes or more details about the feature extraction, please fell free to PM me. For feature selection, if you consider an ECG signal, there are several bands of frequencies present. In order to select the QRS complex we have to apply a band pass filter. This could either be done in the time or the frequency domain, it is easier in the frequency domain. Similarly each feature of the PQRST complex may be individually selected using the right band pass filters and proper thresholding. The following image depicts the extraction of the QRS complex from the ECG signal.    Embed Quote
