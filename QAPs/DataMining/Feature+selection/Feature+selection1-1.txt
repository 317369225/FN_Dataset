★How do I perform feature selection?
Feature Selection methods can be classified as Filters and Wrappers.Methods based on statistical tests as mentioned by Olivier Grisel are filters.One can use Weka to obtain such rankings by Infogain, Chisquare, CFS methods.Wrappers on the other hand may use a learning algorithm with a classifier like SVM or Random Forests to search and report optimal feature subsets. For eg. one may use a genetic algorithm(GA) to build a population of random solutions(feature subsets). Each such subset internally generates a reduced dataset which may be fed to SVM that returns  a 10 fold cross validation classification accuracy(CVA) . The 10 fold CVA may be associated with the corresponding subset's fitness function.After the population is built GA takes over and keeps improving the fitness landscape.After a number of iterations one may hope to get an optimal feature subset.    Embed Quote
