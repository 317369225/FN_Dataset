★Which feature selection approach typically yields a more accurate (in out of sample performance) model: black box or intuition (more detailed explanation of question inside)?
A short answer: Feature extraction is a heuristic derived from underlying domain knowledge (Plotz et al. 2011) - that may work on some domains and may not work on others. Therefore the question that which feature selection method is better is quite coarse. Based on these problems, researchers are now trying to learn features directly from the data to find a generic and effective representation and deep learning is emerging as a good methodology to reach that goal.
