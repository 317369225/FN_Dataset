★How valuable do you think feature selection is in machine learning? Which do you think improves accuracy more, feature selection or feature engineering?How valuable is perhaps an analysis like this (see link)  when dealing with a regression or a classification problem? Feature importances with forests of trees     Would it be better to engineer features in your opinion?
Feature engineering is a super-set of  activities which include feature extraction, feature construction and feature selection. Each of the three are important steps and none should be ignored. We could make a generalization of the importance though, from my experience the relative importance of the steps would be feature construction > feature extraction > feature selection.    Embed Quote
