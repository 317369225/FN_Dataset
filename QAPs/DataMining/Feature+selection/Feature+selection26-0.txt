★How can one perform feature selection with textual features?
One example of how this is done is with the bag-of-words models.  A document is represented by a sparse vector of N-grams where each N-gram maps to an index in the vector (I believe this is the map<String, Integer> you are talking about) and has a value corresponding to the frequency count for how often the N-gram occurs in the document (this is the value stored in the bag-of-words vector).  One example of a feature selection approach in the context of a classification problem with a linear classifier is to use the linear classifier's model weights to choose which features to keep.    Embed Quote
