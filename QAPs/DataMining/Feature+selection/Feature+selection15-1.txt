★What are the most commonly used ways to perform feature selection for k-means clustering?I have 10,000 data points, each of them having the same 10 features. I want to perform clustering on those data points: what are the most commonly used ways to select the most useful features?
You might want to try multiple kernel clustering with 10 kernels, each corresponding to one of your features. Have a look at Multiple Kernel Clustering.    Embed Quote
