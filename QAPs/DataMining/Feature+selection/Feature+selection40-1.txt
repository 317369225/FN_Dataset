★What is the difference between feature selection and dimensionality reduction with relation to text data?
Feature selection yields a subset of features from the original set of features, which are best representatives of the data. It is an exhaustive search. Dimensionality reduction transforms the original feature space to yield a subspace, but the basis of the subspace cant be interpreted as a particular feature. In text data, features might be size of characters or some global features of the text. Feature selection will keep only certain features of those. Dimensionality reduction will give you a geometric transform that will give you 'features' which cannot be easily interpreted as say, size or vertical projections, etc. This technique might reduce the correlation or higher order statistics between the features by representing in a different way.    Embed Quote
