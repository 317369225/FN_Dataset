★Support Vector Machines: What is efficiency and effectiveness of the feature selection algorithm?
I assumed that you are asking about feature selection for SVM classifiers SVMs are generally well suited for datasets that have a high dimensional feature space. Unlike statistical classifiers such as Maximum Likelihood, SVMs can better handle high dimentional data. Hence the general opionion in SVM research community is that feature selection process for SVM may not improve the performance. But, there are research papers that shows improvement in overall accuracy and class accuracies when a feature selection process is employed for SVM. Here are some of the papers in my research area that shows the improvement in accuracies when a feature selection is employed for SVM. Non-Uniform  Random Feature Selection and Kernel Density Scoring with SVM based  Ensemble Classification for Hyperspectral Image Analysis IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing April 1, 2013 B.Waske, S.Linden et.al, “Sensitivity of support vector machines to random feature selection in classifying Hyperspectral data,” IEEE Trans Geosci.
