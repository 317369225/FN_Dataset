★What is the best feature selection method when the train data has more features than the number of data points? Assume the data is very large?
Is there any specific task you're working on or are you interested in general? A good way to check whether the selection of features is good, is to run t-SNE and visualize the data. If it is possible to separate distinct classes visually, it is possible to build good prediction model based on same features as well. In general in case of having more features than learning example, I guess neural nets are good choice for prediction model. Anyway in case of selecting neural nets, you have to decide how many units are going to be on input layer (i.e. the number of features) and hidden layers. A good way to select an appropriate configuration is to run bias-variance error diagnosis. If the error on training set is low and the error on test set is large, try to use the smaller number of features. In case both, training and test error are large, try to use larger number of features. There is no general answer for the question but I believe you can build a good model by employing the above described diagnosis.    Embed Quote
