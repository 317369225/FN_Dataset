★Can I have a simple explanation for AdaBoost algorithm? For example, how would I use it for feature selection (dimensionality reduction) in a facial expression recognition system?
Let us say that the task is to classify the gender M/F from a set of 3D data points. Each data point has the height, weight and age of persons. Let us say we have a simple classification rule/hypothesis h1 : we are going to assign the gender based on thresholding the height. If the height of a person is greater than 170 cms, we assign male, else we classify as female. This is an example of a weak classifier whose results would anyway be better than a random classification of the gender (of course we assume a large representative sampling of heights). We can have another stupid hypothesis h2: compute BMI and assign male or female based on some thresholding based on BMI and age. This is another weak classifier. What AdaBoost gives us is a master classifier or hypothesis H whose classification results would be better than either using h1 or h2.
