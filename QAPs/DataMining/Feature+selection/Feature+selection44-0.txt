★Predictive Analytics: What tools do you use for Data Preparation, primarily for outlier detection and removal, Feature Selection etc. If you use R software, what packages do you use?
1. Data Preparation The first thing I do for data analysis is checking empirical distributions of variables.  I use the CRAN - Package Hmisc in R.  It generates a nice LaTeX report including histogram, min, max, quartiles, number of observations, unique values, missing values, etc. (see Data Profiling in R for more options). 2. Handling Outliers Personally, I prefer not to remove outliers, but to mitigate its effect.  For example, for counting variables such as the number of clicks, visitors, etc., log or boxcox transformation works well. If outlier removal is necessary, I use standard [Q1-1.5IQR, Q3+1.5IQR] criteria to detect, and then remove outliers (see Box plot for reference). 3. Feature Selection When the data set is small, stepwise selection with a linear model can be used (see Page on R-project in CRAN - Package MASS ).  When the data set is large with many variables, glmnet (see CRAN - Package glmnet) or SVM with L1-regularization can be trained, and variables with non-zero coefficients can be selected. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
