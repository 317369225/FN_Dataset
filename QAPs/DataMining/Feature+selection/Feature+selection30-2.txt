★Which feature selection approach typically yields a more accurate (in out of sample performance) model: black box or intuition (more detailed explanation of question inside)?
What is your objective? If your objective is just achieving the best performance then there are solid answers here below (courtesy of Waleed and Kevin) about some ways to achieve that. If you work in a more technical setting where performance is the most important thing, then test both methods (black box and intuition), and/or use a hybrid, iterate and work until you can find the best solution. Your objective is the best performance, if you have time then you should use all the tools at your disposal. On the other hand, if you work in a setting where you're the most technical guy, then explaining the model's performance can be just as important as its performance. In that setting, a few percentage points can be sacrificed in order to make sure your bosses/other stakeholders are comfortable with the model, and chances are that model will be less black box (which non-technical people will generally be suspicious of) and more Intuition-based. Over time you can move people in the direction of best performance, but early on you want to make sure you can explain the models so people are comfortable, otherwise they could be incredible but will not be used. I cannot emphasize this point enough: if you are leading the charge on ML initiatives or trying to bring that power to people who have not used it in the past, then being able to explain what it does and get buy-in will be just as challenging as building something great (and this is the situation that the great majority of businesses are in currently). But once you get people into the flow of things and understanding how much value can be created here, you can help the company reach a totally different level.    Embed Quote
