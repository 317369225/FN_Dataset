★Predictive Analytics: What tools do you use for Data Preparation, primarily for outlier detection and removal, Feature Selection etc. If you use R software, what packages do you use?
Check out the Rapid Insight software. They have two tools - one that allows you to clean up your data (including handle missing values, creating new variables, etc.), and another that allows you to analyze and build predictive models with your data. The second tool, Analytics, will detect outliers automatically but lets you decide how to deal with them - so you could choose to cap them rather than throw them all out.  I've tried lots of software package but ended up working for RI after using the software. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
