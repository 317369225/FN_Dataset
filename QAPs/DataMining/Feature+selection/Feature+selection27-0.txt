★How do we use PCA (principle component analysis) for feature selection?PCA combines similar (correlated) attributes and creates new ones. Superior to original attributes.  Is this how PCA does feature selection?
PCA does not combine similar attributes into one. It just changes the basis, or representation of the data, such that the new data is as de-correlated as possible. Also from Eigen values, we know which Principal Components have the maximum variance. This allows us to select which direction in the original representation has maximum variance, and only retain those components, while other least important features can be completely discarded.    Embed Quote
