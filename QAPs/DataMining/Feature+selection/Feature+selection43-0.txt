★Is Facebook violating IP rights by adding Google+-like features (selective sharing, etc)?Google+ advanced the idea of social sharing by allowing users to create circles for sharing. facebook followed suit by allowing it to be shared with everyone, friends or customize it. Do patents work retroactively?
Ron is right. Besides that, the only way Facebook would violate IP rights is if Google had patented the process. Something like "Controlling the way a user shares content through a social network by segmenting their social connections into groups". Even if Google filed for a patent (which they haven't), the fact that Facebook has had the same functionality for years would be a pretty big hurdle to clear in the patenting process ;)    Embed Quote
