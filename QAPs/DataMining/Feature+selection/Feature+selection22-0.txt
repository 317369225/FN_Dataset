★How do i use any library in java that implements RELEIFF algorithm feature selection?i need to implement or use RELIEFF algorithm for comparing my algorithm . i want to know is their any way i can use RELIEFF algorithm in java ? i found the library that implements it ,but couldnt understand how to use it . any help would be appreciated .
I've been doing my own research on machine learning, so I'll answer with what I know so far... I'll assume you're using the java-ml machine learning library at http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/ You'll start with some type of data set.  For this library, you'd want a CSV file with attribute values (double) and a resulting class (String, I think).  Here I'll use the famous Iris data set (UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set).  There's four columns of double values, and the resulting class is in the fifth column, hence the 4 (zero-based) in the FileHandler call.  Here's the code:  1

 /* Load the iris data set */ Dataset data = FileHandler.loadDataset(new File("iris.data"), 4, ","); /* Create the feature scoring algorithm */ RELIEF relief = new RELIEF(); /* Apply the algorithm to the data set */ relief.build(data); /* Print out the score of each attribute */ for (int i = 0; i < relief.noAttributes(); i++) {     System.out.println(relief.score(i)); } Good luck!    Embed Quote
