★What is the current state of the art in feature selection/pruning?Pointers to papers would be appreciated. I would like to throw a pile of features into the mix and have the system decide which ones are actually effective. May not be relevant, but the domain is NLP.
One of the most recent advances is on using massively parallel systems + unsupervised learning to create high-level features. This is remarkable because there's usually much more unsupervised data available than supervised, and it resulted in a 70% increase in image recognition accuracy: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.6209.pdf Summarized in comic form here: http://abstrusegoose.com/496    Embed Quote
