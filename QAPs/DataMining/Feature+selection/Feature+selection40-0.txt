★What is the difference between feature selection and dimensionality reduction with relation to text data?
Let me explain from my experience. I wanted to cluster some textual data. I needed features of the data to apply clustering. I chose word distribution as feature and document term matrix as feature representation.  In my case, document term matrix was very sparse and noisy and hence subsequent clustering was inaccurate. I tried removing common words, applied stemming and lemmatization. Even then, output clusters were not crisp. I found texts of different category fall under same cluster because of word distribution. As you may be aware, DTM involves bag of words approach and hence position of words had no say. So I decided to apply LDA topic modeling and computed topic distribution of each text. This resulted in topic distribution matrix. I ran clustering using this matrix instead of document term matrix. This resulted in better accuracy and also it was computationally efficient as the dimensions of my topic distribution matrix is very small. This can be considered both as feature selection and dimensionality reduction.    Embed Quote
