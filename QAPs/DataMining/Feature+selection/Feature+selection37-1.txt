★How do I use cross validation for feature selection in a linear regression?
I believe the question is more about how to do feature selection in a cross validation scenario. So I am going to specifically address this point. Everytime you have a new data set that you are training in cross validation, do a a phase of feature selection and vote on a particular set of features among the global set. Now, once you have completed the cross validation phase, select those features that have maximum number of votes (from the different phases of cross validation) and now do another round of cross validation on only these set of features - remember you are not going to do feature selection on every phase of cross validation now. Your final round of cross validation should tell you how your model performs on the data. Important note here is that cross validation should be used only to measure how a SINGLE model performs on a given set of data. If you are going to fit features in every cross validation phase, you are not comparing the performance correctly. Hence the voting phase for each of the cross validation phases to select their features which come together later.    Embed Quote
