★What is the best information theory based feature selection approach?
Information gain: the change in information entropy It's used in decision trees for selecting the next best split variable. See here for more details: Information gain in decision trees. In Weka, you can use class InfoGainAttributeEval which  does exactly this. Another good measure is Information gain ratio. It's a ratio of information gain to the entropy of the attribute: In Weka, the class GainRatioAttributeEval  does that. Using any of these measures, you can rank all the attributes and select top or ones that meet some threshold criteria.    Embed Quote
