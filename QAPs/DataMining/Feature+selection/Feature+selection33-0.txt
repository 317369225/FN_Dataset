★Can I have a simple explanation for AdaBoost algorithm? For example, how would I use it for feature selection (dimensionality reduction) in a facial expression recognition system?
The basic concept behind AdaBoost is to create a strong classifier by the conjuncture of many weak classifiers (hit rate barely better than 50%). If you are using it for feature selection for facial expression recognition, you can always look at the OpenCV's haartraining plugin implementation Tutorial: OpenCV haartraining (Rapid Object Detection With A Cascade of Boosted Classifiers Based on Haar-like Features) to inspire yourself. If you want to learn how to implement the AdaBoost itself you can always look for the original article by Freund and Schapire: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yfreund/... If want to use the Adaboost to the detection itself, you can see this article that uses Adaboost for face recognition: http://www.face-rec.org/algorith...    Embed Quote
