★How can I perform feature selection for the features extracted to do human action recognition?
The literature on feature selection for activity recognition is vast and there is no clear winner. In my opinion, since we are extracting features manually, we can choose them wisely - for e.g. why this particular feature is important?. However, if you have generated too many features, then there are 3 types of mindset one can apply Traditional feature selection: A little search of google suggested several papers, 3 of them I post below: Page on ic.ac.uk Page on cloudfront.net A wearable pre-impact fall detector using feature selection and Support Vector Machine People have used all sorts of feature selection algorithms for this task, as stated above, including unsupervised, supervised feature selection methods, wrapper methods, ranking methods and so on. Feature Transformation: If you do not want to interpret the features as such in the final outcome, one can perform feature transformation using PCA, Kernel PCA, Random projection, tSNE etc. Feature Learning: This is what Deep Learning runs after. Instead of extracting features, which is a heuristic after all, why not learn features directly from the raw sensor data itself. The success of feature selection depends mainly on your application, no final solution. As I always suggest, you must know why you want to do feature selection in the first place.    Embed Quote
