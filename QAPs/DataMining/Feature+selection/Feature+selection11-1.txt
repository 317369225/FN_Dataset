★Feature Selection: What are the best alternatives to stepwise & best subsets regression?I'm working with a (relatively small) time series.  I have a number of independent variables that demonstrate both contextual relevance to predicting my dependent variable / meaningful associations with my dependent variable (correlations >90%).  What is the best way to select an ensemble of multivariate independent variables (features) that minimize (out of sample) error?
With time series, you probably shouldn't be using multiple regression at all. You need methods that account for the dependence in the data    Embed Quote
