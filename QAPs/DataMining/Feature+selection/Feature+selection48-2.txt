★All these Machine learning algorithms, what is the point?  It seems like choice of machine learning algorithm, decision tree, neural net, svm, isn't nearly important as the feature selection and feature extraction process which determines what goes in to it, garbage in garbage out, that sort of thing.
This is definitely true, but it also misses the point. Inventing a new type of concrete isn't nearly as important for making a sturdy, low-maintenance-cost building as competent design by a civil engineer and quality construction. But you only have to invent the new concrete once, and then it's always ready to use. You have to design and make each building anew, and tailor it to its function and circumstances. Similarly, machine learning research adds new tools that can be used and re-used and adapted by a data scientist, whereas there is no magic way, apart from an individual's use of judgment and hard work, to extract and clean appropriate features. That said, it's true that often first-order or simple methods are the ones that get the most use in typical data applications, for a large number of reasons. This isn't always true. Targeting ads may be doable without much fancy machine learning, but speech recognition or image search use pretty intense algorithms.    Embed Quote
