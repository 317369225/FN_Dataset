★What are some feature selection methods for SVMs?
Generally, regularized SVMs, with the  regularization chosen by cross-validation will work quite well and not  take too long to setup. Suppose your positive examples are given by and your negative examples are given by , each with features. The new optimization problem is with variables . This  will encourage sparsity in , which corresponds to  sparse feature selection.  Once you have found the non-zero components  of by solving the problem above, then use a standard  SVM (no regularization) over the components that were chosen.    Embed Quote
