★What is a reference parameter?
In a lot of languages, passing an object as a parameter to a method doesn't pass the object itself, but the data that makes it up. Thus, any changes made to the object in the method won't apply once the method finishes. This is often undesirable - sometimes you want a function to mess with an object in another class or another part of the code. To tell the code to do this, instead of passing the object itself, you pass it by reference (as a reference parameter). In a language like C, for example, you'd pass a pointer to the object rather than the object. This allows the code to access and modify the object itself rather than just a clone of its data.    Embed Quote
