★What is the difference between a parameter and a statistic?
A parameter is a measure that describes the entire population, whereas a statistic describes a sample of the population. For example, say my population is all of the students at some high school. If I were to take the mean SAT score of all the students, that would be a parameter, since the mean is describing the entire population  (all of the students.) But, if I took the mean SAT score of a randomly selected group of 50 students, then that mean would be a statistic, since it describes only part of the population.    Embed Quote
