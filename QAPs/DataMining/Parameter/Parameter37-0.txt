★What is the h parameter in a Facebook outbound link?
It appears to be a hash that's used to make sure the url actually was generated by facebook. l.php probably checks that it is the correct hash value for the given url. Without it, l.php would be an open redirect (you could have a url from facebook.com that went to anywhere you want), and that opens up a bunch of XSS vulnerabilities.    Embed Quote
