★In the C programming language, can a void function return any parameter?
I would like to remind that in C functions get their parameters by value, and can not modify them. End of story. You can pass address of the variable, and function could modify the variable, but parameter is the address, and it can't be modified. You can pass address of the address of variable, and then function could modify address of the variable, but still it can't modify the parameter itself. C++ has passing arguments by reference, C doesn't. So void function can modify any number of variables (just pass their addresses), but it can't modify any of its parameters.    Embed Quote
