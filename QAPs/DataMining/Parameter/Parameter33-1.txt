★Doesn't file_get_contents() accept a file path in the first parameter?
Hi, As David Lowry pointed out, you are doing it wrong since using file_get_contents() on a local file will get you the code in the local file, not the processed code by php. If you want to get the content from a local php script via another local script, I see a couple of options: Call another php process (awkward IMO): 1

3
 <?php $result = exec("php -f hello_world.php"); print $result; Use Output buffering: 1

 <php ob_start(); include 'hello_world.php'; $result = ob_get_contents(); ob_end_clean(); print $result; Note that your original code is using an optional option asking file_get_contents() to look into the include path, that seems unnecessary to me. You are also using old PHP syntax to get the directory, that's a bit complex without added value. You could have done just that: 1
 $result = file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/hello_world.php'); Also, note that if you are checking the result in a browser, you probably just see a blank page because you are printing the content of the php script which starts by an opening <?php which is interpreted as invalid html, looking at the source of the page (ctrl+U in Firefox) will show you that you did include the file.    Embed Quote
