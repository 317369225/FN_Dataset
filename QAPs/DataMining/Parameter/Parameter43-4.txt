★What is the difference between a "parameter" and an "argument" in C programming language?I have just started learning C and I came across these terms .
Parameters are what you define when you write a function or sub procedure: they are defined by name in parentheses after the procedure name, and for each parameter, the data type, passing mechanism (by value of reference) - and for some languages whether they are optional - are defined. Arguments are what are specified when you use a function or sub in a calling program, and can consist of variable names, constants and functions.    Embed Quote
