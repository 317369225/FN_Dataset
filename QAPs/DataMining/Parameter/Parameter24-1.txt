★Is Latent Dirichlet Allocation a parametic model or nonparametric?I used to think LDA is a nonparametric model, because the number of parameters do not increase when the dataset grows(like Knn). However, In some papers, i find that "LDA is parametric because the number of topics must be set by user in advance".
LDA is a parametric model, and the parameter is number of topics. There are non-parametric variants of LDA where the number of topics is effectively learned too: Hierarchical Dirichlet process So I guess both could be correct depending on what specifically you are referring to.    Embed Quote
