★When is it philosophically legitimate to regard parameters of probability distributions as random variables?That is, when using probability distributions to model processes in the real world, rather than purely mathematically.
It is alway legitimate to use any model to describe the real world. However, you may find out that some models fit better than others, and that some parameter values fit better than other parameter values. Also it might be that some models are much more elegant and simple than other models. For example the earth oriented model of planetary movement seems less elegant than the sun oriented model. So, when you find it handy to model something in terms of probability distributions, be my guest, and go ahead!    Embed Quote
