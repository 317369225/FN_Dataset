★What parameters are needed to fully describe a fundamental particle?Only three parameters are required to fully describe a black hole : its mass, its electrical charge, and its angular momentum. Is it possible to describe a fundamental particle in a similar way? Which parameters are needed? Mass, electrical charge, spin, color, something else?
I think it depends on the theory with which one is describing the particle's interactions. For instance, for a falling body in a gravitational field, electric charge is not as important as inertial mass. For strong interactions, colour charge is generally more important than electric charge (or mass for that matter). So, for fundamental particles one has at least one type of charge for each symmetry group in the theory. In the standard model of particle physics that means at least electric charge, colour charge, and other quantum numbers. Then there is spin and mass. And if your particle is not at rest you need to add the linear momentum to the mix. There is a useful discussion in Page on users.jyu.fi.    Embed Quote
