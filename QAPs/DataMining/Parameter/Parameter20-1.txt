★What parameters are to be considered when selecting an Adnetwork as an advertiser?I want to promote my services through Ad networks, how do i decide that this network is the right one for me, since none of them barring a few provide free trials. Some networks and your experience with them would be great help.
As Khem notes, there are MANY factors that go into deciding this, many of which can't be observed until you do a test run and get some benchmarks. Beyond that though, I'd really emphasize transparency.  You need to know how they get your traffic and where it is coming from.  Too many networks these days just broker traffic amongst themselves in a giant incestuous circle, without adding any real value.  Likewise, many of them buy traffic from affiliates who may obtain it in ways that you might not approve of. Your budget is another deciding factor as some sources are nice for complimenting a larger campaign, whereas others (like AdWords and AdCenter) tend to form the core of a search campaign (if you are doing search). Also, some networks will give you some free traffic to test with if you are big enough and they are confident enough in their offering. Beyond that, it is important to look at the types of ads that run on their network.  Are there similar advertisers?  Have you noticed them advertising there for quite some time?  Those are good signs.    Embed Quote
