★What parameters are needed to fully describe a fundamental particle?Only three parameters are required to fully describe a black hole : its mass, its electrical charge, and its angular momentum. Is it possible to describe a fundamental particle in a similar way? Which parameters are needed? Mass, electrical charge, spin, color, something else?
Well,it depends on particle.If you are taking electron then their spin and rotation and charge should be taken into consideration.if proton then their charge and neutron their mass.    Embed Quote
