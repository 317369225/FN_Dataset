★What are the parameters determining the degree of responsibility for an action?
I will answer only on a personal level as each individual must determine for themselves how responsible they are.  I accept 100% responsibility for everything I say and do, I make mistakes and it is my responsibility (to myself) to at least learn and do better.    Embed Quote
