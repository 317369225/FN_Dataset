★Why we need to calculate ABCD parameters of transmission lines? We have other parameters like Z and Y parameters, so what is the exact significance of ABCD parameters?my question is how these values help in power generation or transmission or distribution or power delivering ? is it helpful while designing the transmission lines i.e while selecting the materials for transmission lines ? if yes ... then how ?
ABCD parameters helps in finding the performance analysis (finding voltage regulation and transmission efficiency) of a transmission line.. We can specify sending end voltage in terms of receiving end by using ABCD parameters since transmission line can be represented as two port network. .    Embed Quote
