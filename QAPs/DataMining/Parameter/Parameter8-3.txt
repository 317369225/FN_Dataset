★What are the main parameters that determine whether a country is developed or not?Some parameters which come to my mind are GDP, HDI, Literacy rate, per ca pita income, infrastructure etc. What is the absolute factor that determines it?
If the politicians send their kids to the school they built for the public. If the politicians admit themselves in hospitals which they built for public. In short, If the politicians utilize the basic necessities that they provide to all the people.    Embed Quote
