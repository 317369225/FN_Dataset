★In the C programming language, can a void function return any parameter?
Nope. A void function returns nothing. If you want to return any type, then you'd have to first think logically... 1) Is it always a number? Return a double, which is downcasted to other types. 2) (you can allow characters and booleans too) 3) Do you want to return an array of something? Use void* if you are certain there is no type that can encompass them all. 4) (or you can use void* in a structure in which you also hold the type, I think C# does this in the background?) 5) You could return a pointer to a structure (which must be allocated dynamically, btw). That structure should hold all the variants of types you could return (union, anyone?) and an enum to choose between the types; I think THAT is the actual way C# works...    Embed Quote
