★What are the parameters on which the price of a book is decided?
Demand and costs of production. Demand has a priority, e.g. if there is a good demand for this book, it can be sold at a higher price. The downside, however, is that often the demand is fuled by a rather costly promotional campaign. We just have to calculate the ROI in each instance and make a pricing decision accordingly.
