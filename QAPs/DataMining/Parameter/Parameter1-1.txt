★What is an intuitive description of the order parameter?
I think in this context, order parameters describe the similarity and predictability of the members of a population.  Ice, water, and steam are all composed of water molecules.  Ice is more ordered than water, and water is more ordered than steam.  E.g., if you know where one water molecule is in a piece of ice, you can make good predictions about where neighboring water molecules (how far away from the first molecule, angles between neighbors, numbers of nearest and second nearest neighbors, ...).  That predictability is less for water and still less for steam.  So the order parameter is higher for ice, then for water, and lowest for steam. A more fun example might be, the order parameter for conservatives in Texas is higher than for liberals in Texas.  Statistically, a conservative in Texas is likely to have more conservative neighbors than liberal neighbors.    Embed Quote
