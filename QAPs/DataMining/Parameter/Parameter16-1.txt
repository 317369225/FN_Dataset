★What parameters are needed to fully describe a fundamental particle?Only three parameters are required to fully describe a black hole : its mass, its electrical charge, and its angular momentum. Is it possible to describe a fundamental particle in a similar way? Which parameters are needed? Mass, electrical charge, spin, color, something else?
Hmm, let's see: mass and spin definitely, and couplings (electric charge, weak isospin and color charge). And then for quarks and neutrinos you have to know the mixing matrix, otherwise you can't fully describe them (things like lifetime of heavy quarks depend on mixing).    Embed Quote
