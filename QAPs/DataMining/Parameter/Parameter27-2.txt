★Does URLs with UTM parameter crawled as different URLs?Let's say if I have an URL domain.com/my-first-post/ and have some UTM tracking lets say domain.com/my-first-post/?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=first-post Does Search Engines crawl these two pages as different URLs and treat as duplicate pages. If yes then how to avoid it
Yes, they are treated as duplicate pages. Just do a Google search with "allinurl:?utm_source=" and you would notice several such pages indexed in Google. To avoid these issues, there are three ways: 1) Block query strings via Robots.txt OR 2) Use Canonical Tag on each page of your website OR 3) Use URL parameters feature in Google webmaster Tools to instruct Google not to index your pages with these parameters    Embed Quote
