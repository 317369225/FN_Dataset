★Why we need to calculate ABCD parameters of transmission lines? We have other parameters like Z and Y parameters, so what is the exact significance of ABCD parameters?my question is how these values help in power generation or transmission or distribution or power delivering ? is it helpful while designing the transmission lines i.e while selecting the materials for transmission lines ? if yes ... then how ?
One of the main Advantage is in abcd parameter in cascaded network to find out abcd parameter you just have to multiply ABC parameter matrix of individual network. So it's easy in case of transmission line.    Embed Quote
