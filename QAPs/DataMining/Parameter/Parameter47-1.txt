★What are the parameters determining the degree of responsibility for an action?
There are only 3 parameters, in my opinion: Two direct parameters: 1: Did you do it? 2: Did you mean it? In other words, action and motive. Whatever action we're talking about, if you're the person who physically performed that action, there's no denying that you have a direct responsibility in its happening. This must be tempered, however, with the "why" did you do it. A premeditated action doesn't carry the same weight as a spontaneous one. In both cases, you're still responsible for whatever you did but in the first case you have intentions and make plans, whereas in the second case, circumstances may have dictated that you were compelled to do what you did. Which is why we often draw the line between being responsible and being guilty. One indirect parameter: 3. Do you take responsibility? This applies to parents and leaders; in short, whoever is in a position of authority. If you're given the power to make decisions, give orders,... you have to accept the burden of responsibility that it entails. Everything that happens as a consequence of your decisions and orders is your fault. You will no doubt reap the benefits if those consequences are positive, so "man up" and also accept to pay the price if they're negative. I personally think that you're responsible for everything that happens to you. Whether through action OR inaction. It's painful. Makes for lots of regrets and can drive you mad if you dwell too much on the "I should've..." and "I shouldn't have..." but that's how you avoid the coward's way out ("I was just following orders!") and is the most satisfying way to go through life with dignity.    Embed Quote
