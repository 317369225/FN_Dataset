★What is a two-way parameter?Googling this term doesn't actually return any results explaining the meaning of it. Thanks.
I haven't heard these called "two way" parameters, but I'd assume this would be pass-by-reference or parameters that can be changed in the function/procedure they're passed to, and the change to the parameter will persist after the function returns. Some languages make this syntactically explicit: PL/SQL has IN OUT parameters to stored procedures.  IN means the parameter has a valid value on entry, and OUT means it has a possibly different value on exit, and the caller will see the new value when the stored procedure returns.    Embed Quote
