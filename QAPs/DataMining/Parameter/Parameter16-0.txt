★What parameters are needed to fully describe a fundamental particle?Only three parameters are required to fully describe a black hole : its mass, its electrical charge, and its angular momentum. Is it possible to describe a fundamental particle in a similar way? Which parameters are needed? Mass, electrical charge, spin, color, something else?
So a fundamental particle, according to a definition of Wigner, is one that transforms as an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group. This is only a flat space definition, of course, and I will just ignore supersymmetry and superspace here. This means that mass, and spin will be basic parameters needed to describe it. These numbers are related to the values of the quadratic (momentum squared) and quartic (Pauli-Lubanski vector) Casimir operators of the group in the irrep of the group that the particle belongs to. In addition, there may be a number of other parameters needed to describe a fundamental particle, associated with so-called internal symmetries - the various charges of a particle. So I think your question points out a fact that is indeed very interesting - these parameters seem not to be so very different than the parameters that are needed to completely describe the various known kinds of black hole solutions to the Einstein equations, at least as seen from the outside of the black hole.    Embed Quote
