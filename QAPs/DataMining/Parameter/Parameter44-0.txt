★What is the difference between a parameter and an argument of a function/procedure?In most cases I've come across many use the terms interchangeably. One difference I've been told is one you use inside the function while the other you use outside the scope of the function. Some others were where a by-value or by-reference difference is noted. Though I'm still unsure.
Argument is the name for vars on the caller side. Parameter is the name for vars on the called function side. So if I make a call to foo(x); // x in as argument If I have a function: Void foo(int x) // x is a parameter    Embed Quote
