★Why is the average Indian (male or female), so obsessed with fairness of skin as a major parameter for defining beauty?
I am a dusky-skinned person too. And even I do wonder sometimes,like the rest of us, about this hype over fair-skinned people. But the thing is no matter how wrong it is or how wrong we feel it is, it is natural to prefer fair-skinned people. I too, get infatuated with fair-skinned people more than the other kind. And it's not even intentional. They have a natural charm. Not that all fair ones are alluring or the dark ones unattractive. But our senses work that way.    Embed Quote
