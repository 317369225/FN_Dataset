★Is Sensex a parameter of growth in India?I was in an interview where I was asked about the status of the economy in India. I was thinking that economic growth can be measured by the status of SENSEX.
Yes it is, here is why : The SENSEX captures the events of the stock market in the most judicial manner. One can identify the boom and busts of the Indian economy by the SENSEX trends. A rising SENSEX is indicative of a good business climate And greater growth expectations because a rising trend attracts investment from retail investors and Foreign Institutional Investors. it facilitates capital formation with greater ease. With that said, if only some of the measures of growth are to be looked at then the major important ones would be: (a) Trends in GDP and agricultural growth (b) trends in inflation (c) Purchasing Power Parity index (d) Fiscal deficit (e) Interest rates- inclusive of repo rate, reverse repo rate, CRR (f) Balance of Payments (g) Foreign Exchange Reserves.    Embed Quote
