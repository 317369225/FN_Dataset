★What is an intuitive description of the order parameter?
An order parameter is zero in one phase, non-zero in another, and cost some free energy to make larger. To make this intuitive you should think about some phases you are familiar with. Consider a magnet; what is zero when it's in the paramagnetic phase and non-zero when it's in the ferromagnetic phase? What about ice? What changes when you go from liquid to solid? You should check out a little Landau theory. It's an amazing piece of physics and connects very deeply to the concept of the order parameter. Understanding a little bit may make order parameters a bit more intuitive.    Embed Quote
