★Why is the average Indian (male or female), so obsessed with fairness of skin as a major parameter for defining beauty?
If a certain racial group or people with certain features have a disproportionate amount of power and privilege, then it is human nature to want to have those features (whatever they are).  If paler skin represents power and influence (due to historical reasons, etc.) then it will at least be a factor in what is considered desirable.  Another example: hair type.  In Colombia, (racial blend of indigenous, European, and African, and various combinations) dark black people have the least power, and so hair that indicates black ancestry is considered less desirable.  I am the non-paying co-sponsor for two girls in Latin America: a mixed-race girl in Colombia who has naturally tightly curled/frizzy hair but has straightened it more and more often as she gets older, especially for special occasions. While, at the same time, the girl in Guatemala (racial blend: indigenous and European, most are either indigenous Mayan or mestizo) who has very curly hair, has never straightened it.  In Guatemala, there is a great deal of discrimination against Mayans even though they are the majority, and they have straight hair (all that I have seen).  So someone with very curly hair is definitely mestizo, not full-blooded Mayan.    Embed Quote
