★What are the main parameters that determine whether a country is developed or not?Some parameters which come to my mind are GDP, HDI, Literacy rate, per ca pita income, infrastructure etc. What is the absolute factor that determines it?
I judge societies and people by how clean their bathrooms are. If a person's bathroom doesn't stink, is not dingy and kept well, he/she is a developed person. If a country can provide clean bathrooms to everyone, that country is developed. The mindset and resources required to build clean toilets everywhere would indicate that the nation has GDP+HDI and all the other good things. In fact, one of the key things Mahatma Gandhi constantly sought was clean bathrooms. He made his followers clean their own bathrooms (was a big taboo in India at that time) and see the importance of cleanliness. He was often bored of the big talk of policies and round tables, and thought things like clean toilets were more important for the nation.    Embed Quote
