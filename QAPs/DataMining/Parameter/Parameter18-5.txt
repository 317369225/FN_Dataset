★What are the parameters on which the price of a book is decided?
I'm not an expert but translations cost more, the same applies to textbooks and to any book that's gonna be of low demand. Also if in other languages with less speakers, it could easily be pointless to be published as most of the times those interested to the subject are also speakers of languages of far larger populations.    Embed Quote
