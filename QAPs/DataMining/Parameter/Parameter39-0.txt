★What is the self parameter when defining classes?I'm a beginner to programming, and in the book I'm reading it told me that when defining classes and methods to include the "self" parameter. Can somebody give me a more in-depth explanation to what this is and how it is used?
Since you are a beginner, I will give you two golden nuggets of knowledge: 1: Python 'self' explained This explains what you are wondering about 2: The web page 'stackoverflow' (specifically Newest 'python' Questions - Stack Overflow) will be your new best friend for a long time I don't usually answer question by pasting someone else's link, but in this case, I think learning about stackoverflow will help you tremendously, while at the same time answering your exact question.    Embed Quote
