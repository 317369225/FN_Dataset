★Why is the average Indian (male or female), so obsessed with fairness of skin as a major parameter for defining beauty?
Going anon because the theory is EXTREMELY ridiculous but it seems it was popular in medieval(?) europe. Dark skin = blue collar/manual worker, like somebody working in the fields under the hot sun which tanned their skin. Fair skin = aristocracy, who did not have to work outside so their skin remained soft and fair.    Embed Quote
