★Why is the average Indian (male or female), so obsessed with fairness of skin as a major parameter for defining beauty?
1) My 3 crushes were dark skinned 2) My favorite actresses are Manju Warrier (Malayalam actress) and Deepika Manju Warrier Deepika Padukone PS: Please stop using fairness creams to be fair. Most of the people don't give a damn to your skin color.    Embed Quote
