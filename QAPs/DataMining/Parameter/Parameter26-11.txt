★Why is the average Indian (male or female), so obsessed with fairness of skin as a major parameter for defining beauty?
This is an issue quite close to my heart. I was born a dark skinned babe in a fairly fair household. My sisters, my parents , my grandparents are all fair. And almost all my life I have felt inferior to them for that reason. I am much adored; no member of my family has ever uttered a word about it, but that feeling of inferiority is something I have had since I was a small child. So who does this to you? Your family ? Nope. Those aunties in your park who fake worry when they ask your mother "haye yeh bechari thodi saavli hai ?"What kind of question is that,anyway ? Yep. Them. Their daughters who won't let you play or make fun of you behind your back ? Yes. Their sons who overlook you and reject you because "Sorry babe , you just don't look that nice ". These little things batter your soul. And when you grow up,you realize that it doesn't really matter. What matters at the end of the day are your thoughts. Those with a beautiful mind always look beautiful. And a girl with beautiful , fair ,lovely features looks ugly when her thoughts are just so. Cultivate your mind. Get a hot bod. Be fit . Explore the world in all its glory. These tiny things will soon not matter.    Embed Quote
