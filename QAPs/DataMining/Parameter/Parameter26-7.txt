★Why is the average Indian (male or female), so obsessed with fairness of skin as a major parameter for defining beauty?
Our generation is the one which will go on sharing and  "stop racism" ,"The beauty is in the personality not in the skin" and blah blah posts.Yes we are the purist beings.How can we pass a racist remark?Never!! Really?? Yes we will not...But we will be.. 1. Searching for a fair girl (Unfortunately only fair girls are beautiful) to be our girlfriend. 2. We will be judging a girl in our working team by her color (Not surprisingly some of my friends refer a dark complexion girl in their team as "mallu aunty") 3. We would be looking for a fairness cosmetic not a skin care cream as all our so called heroes shahrukh,john et al. are encouraging us to become fair as it will allow us to get most beautiful girls of our town.oh please :\(Fortunately as a teenager when I was falling into this "fairness cream" trap, my sister who is a doctor stopped me) 4. Parents of a dark complexion girl would be worried as hell because nobody would marry a saavli or kaali. Whatever we keep on uttering, we are racists, our criteria of being beautiful is fairness, we do not look beauty of a person but her/his appearance.And this starts from our families only.. My nani is always happy to see me but about 10 times she has commented on my color.. Most of the people would be very very happy if the newborn in our family is gora/gori .The first comment would be "Oh gora hua h".And most of them are with good education background..If our families,our stars are feeding in our mind that it is important for us to be fair, why we would not make skin color as a beauty defining parameter.    Embed Quote
