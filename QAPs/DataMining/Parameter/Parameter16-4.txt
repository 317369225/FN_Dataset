★What parameters are needed to fully describe a fundamental particle?Only three parameters are required to fully describe a black hole : its mass, its electrical charge, and its angular momentum. Is it possible to describe a fundamental particle in a similar way? Which parameters are needed? Mass, electrical charge, spin, color, something else?
We have to find parameters to describe uncertainties with sufficient precision, because the fundamental particles are filled with uncertainty. That's the most difficult thing.    Embed Quote
