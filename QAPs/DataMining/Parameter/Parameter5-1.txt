★What are the parameters for comparing headphones?
Sound fidelity - good genuine low frequencies that don't over power the mids(vocals and instruments) Clear and crisp mid range - not too bright to hurt the ear. Refined and distinct treble - to give a musical rhythm and clarity to the whole music. Physical factors- weight, durability, portability, quality of materials going in. Apt wiring which is sturdy with strong connectors that don't break off after a short span. One thing that you only realise with time - the comfort of the cups . This is one of the most important things as long hours of listening can really damage your ears in a lot of ways apart from the ear drum damage. So good snug fit headphones with comfortable ear pads are a must. Noise cancellation if required but it requires  batteries which makes your cans heavy and yes noise cancellation headphones make a difference.    Embed Quote
