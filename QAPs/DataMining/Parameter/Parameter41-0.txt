★In Google Adwords, what are the meanings of the "gclid" and "aclk" parameters? How are they different?
gclid parameters are appended to an AdWords destination URL that is auto-tagged for Google Analytics. If you have your GA account linked with AdWords, then this parameter will pass all sorts of useful information to your GA views. You might see these in referrer reports if you're not using GA. aclk isn't really a parameter at all. It's the URL path for all ad clicks off of a SERP. http://www.google.com/aclk is the redirect for ad links, organic links use http://www.google.com/url. The remainder of the URL after "/aclk?" are parameters used to track information on that click, for that ad, for that specific auction, and passes that data back to AdWords. Everything after the question mark is a query string parameter, so feasibly you could have a google URL that looks like http://www.google.com/aclk?gclid=... As to the meanings of the 'gclid' and 'aclk' and what the letters stand for, you'll need to ask a Googler.    Embed Quote
