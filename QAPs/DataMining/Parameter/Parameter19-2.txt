★What are the parameters which control transistor amplification?
Transistors tend to be used within one polarity (versus the collector)-- the collector on a NPN has to be kept a few volts positive.    The base has to be kept about 0.6 V positive.   At lower or negative voltages, the base is reverse biased and the collector is forward biased, and you don't get any transistor action. Now to amplify audio, we have to be able to feed in both positive and negative halves of the audio waveform.   The only practical way to do this in one stage is to first bias the transistor with some DC, so it's operating at some idling current, then you add in the AC.    You set up the bias to be high enough so that even on the largest negative peaks of AC, there still is some positive DC bias.   By carefully setting the amount of base bias and choosing the right emitter and collector resistors you can end up with a stage that will amplify both the positive and negative excursions.   At the input and output you can put in a series capacitor to isolate the DC and you have a nice AC amplifier stage. ANother way of doing it without bias is to use complementary transistors,  a NPN to handle the positive and a PNP to handle the negative.   Even then it's best to have a little standing DC bias, as neither transistor amplifies much with under 0.6 V of base bias.    Embed Quote
