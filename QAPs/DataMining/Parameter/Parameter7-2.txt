★Why we need to calculate ABCD parameters of transmission lines? We have other parameters like Z and Y parameters, so what is the exact significance of ABCD parameters?my question is how these values help in power generation or transmission or distribution or power delivering ? is it helpful while designing the transmission lines i.e while selecting the materials for transmission lines ? if yes ... then how ?
Power System Engineers use ABCD parameters extensively for the performance analysis of Transmission lines of any type - short, medium or long.  Why ?   Have a look at the other models.   Let Vs, Vr and Is, Ir be the voltages and currents at the sending and receiving ends. What a power system engineer needs is Vs and Is given the values of Vr and Ir most of the time. Note that the Current Is enters the line (Network) and Ir leaves the line – as is the case in power system networks most of the time. (Matrix representation below follow MATLAB style) Z  parameters   [Vs Vr]'= [Z]  [Is Ir] ' --> solving for Vs and Is is not direct. Also the direction of Ir is into the network (line)  --> not convenient   Y  parameters   [Is Ir]' = [Y]  [Vs Vr]' --> Here too solving for Vs and Is is not direct. Also the direction of Ir is into the network (line) --> not convenient The same will be the case with [g],[ h] parameter models. Now consider ABCD parameters     [Vs Is]' = [ A B; C D] [Vr Ir]'  -->this is the required format and the current directions are also as required. Also, have a look at the properties of ABCD parameters (don’t want to repeat) Tables are available to find the ABCD parameters of cascaded lines, parallel lines and other combinations. Instead of 4 different equations for Vs, Is, Ps, Pr, Qs, Qr, regulation etc for each type (short, medium and long) of lines, only one equation each is required for all types if modeled in terms of ABCD parameters. These are some of the merits of ABCD parameter model.    Embed Quote
