★Doesn't file_get_contents() accept a file path in the first parameter?
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I think you might be doing this wrong. Try putting a var_dump() on the $result instead of the print_r(). ------------ Alternatively You're asking for a "local file" but you want a PHP processed output to be returned. A local file will be a block of PHP code, not a parsed string of text. So, what you're trying *should* conceptually at least return ./file.php => "<?php echo 'hello world'; ?>" while the URL gives the correct response http://localhost/file.php => "hello world"    Embed Quote
