★What are the parameters which control transistor amplification?
Referencing the common emitter biased amplifier below, the bias performs two functions. First, it is set up to enable the input small signal to amplified without getting clipped by either the "supply" or 0V. Second, it temperature stabilizes the amplifier to make sure the "gain" of the amplifier doesn't wander around with temperature. Given the power that may heat up the transistor, this is an important consideration. If the bias point of the amplifier shown above was not set to approximately half way between supply and 0V, the full voltage range would not be achieved because the output signal would begin to be clipped by one rail or the other. The ac input signal can change its polarity because the bias circuitry has set up the output signal such that it goes between Supply and 0V. At some point, the input signal will reach a level in which the output will be clipped at one rail or the other. This reflects the maximum input signal that the amplifier will handle. In a sense, the bias circuit burns up energy and impacts efficiency. The common emitter amplifier shown above is considered a Class A amplifier and has a maximum efficiency of 25%. In other words, for 1 watt of output power, 3 watts is wasted in the bias circuitry. Razvan Baba has shown a class B amplifier which can reach a maximum efficiency of 78.5%. More recently, there have been new specialized amplifier designs such as Class D and Class F and are termed "switching" amplifiers. These amplifiers operate against the rails. The goal is to make sure that when the transistor has maximum voltage drop across the collector/emitter (or drain/source) the current is at its minimum or when the current is at its maximum, the voltage drop is at its minimum. This ensures minimal power consumption by the transistor. Such amplifier designs have a much more complicated bias and support structure.    Embed Quote
