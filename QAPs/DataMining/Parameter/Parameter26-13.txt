★Why is the average Indian (male or female), so obsessed with fairness of skin as a major parameter for defining beauty?
Well I really don't give a rats ass about skin color of a person. But after listening to a colleague of mine I'm writing this answer. She is a fresher who joined my company 3 months back. She is fair, really fair. I know what many might guess, she is from the northern part of India; yes she is, unfortunately. She sits beside me in the office. Whenever she sees a not so fair guy/girl or a brown colored person she makes a disgusting face as if they are not beautiful at all or they do don't have a right to live. This attitude of her pisses me off. She thinks white colored or fair people are the ones who are beautiful. I really do not know why, but while talking with her I came to know that she doesn't want her kids to be brown or what ever color other than fair and she hates kids also who aren't fair, I mean who doesn't like kids even guys like kids even if we don't show it, as girls do. And I was like WTF is wrong with this girl. And she says south Indians are not fair or not beautiful at all, but she forgot Aishwarya rai a world known beautiful actress is from south India. And after conversing her for 3 months I came to know it's the matter of her prestige or what ever she wants to be friends with only fair people as she might be not valued in her friends circle if she has a friend who is not fair. And how will people who are not fair be respected in front of mean girls like her. The same reason what she thinks is the reason today's youth think that being fair is beautiful. I think so. PS: I don't think Girls with this attitude against kids too will be fit to be a good mother.    Embed Quote
