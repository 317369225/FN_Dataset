★Why is the average Indian (male or female), so obsessed with fairness of skin as a major parameter for defining beauty?
Normally people like to grow. And growth in a monarchy is at the summit at the position of a king/ priest in the Indian scenario. Since a long time, the rulers had been lighter in complexion- mostly from/before Hun Invasion. Genetically, Brahmins(priests) who didn't work in the sun got a lighter complexion- even in the south. The rulers appointed their own ilk as officials. So, people started respecting power and thought of resembling the powerful as superior. As more invaders came, it became stronger. And thanks to the British for bringing in the "White Superiority" concept and taking it a very high level. And Aryan invasion is mostly false. Even if you go by that logic, all the higher caste are Aryan. Typically a Vaishya(businessman) in the south is dark- there are many proverbs about them. So, the theory is flawed. So, the reasons must be hereditary priestly class' respect and invasions.    Embed Quote
