★Is Sensex a parameter of growth in India?I was in an interview where I was asked about the status of the economy in India. I was thinking that economic growth can be measured by the status of SENSEX.
As much as the DJIA is a parameter of growth in the US. See my answer to: Is the Dow an accurate indicator of America's financial health?. The RBI, so far as I know, is not very different from the Federal reserve (as evidenced by the continued depreciation of INR in the global market). The only difference is people outside India does not care so much about RBI as about the Federal reserve. Since the RBI operates on a much smaller economy and more concentrated pool of investors and speculators, its effects become more pronounced in the short term, whereas for the Federal reserve, they can export away a lot of their policy effects.    Embed Quote
