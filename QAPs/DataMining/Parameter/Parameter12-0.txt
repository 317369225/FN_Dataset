★What is the density parameter?What is the density parameter (Omega)? the density parameter is the ratio of the observed density to the critical density. But density of what? Is it density of energy?
They're all based on Friedman equations and Hubble's laws and cosmological constant, the latter was refuted I guess but still holds some weird validity of some sort. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu... it's densities that are added that include dark matter, regular matter, and dark energy all become omega values somehow.
