★What parameters are to be considered when selecting an Adnetwork as an advertiser?I want to promote my services through Ad networks, how do i decide that this network is the right one for me, since none of them barring a few provide free trials. Some networks and your experience with them would be great help.
there are so many parameters but primarily you should consider: - The kind of commission they pay (avg commission), you may to check the lowest and highest cpc - how big is the network - What kind of ads they deliver (quality + quantity + relevancy) - TOS - Reports (transparency is must) - Support (help)    Embed Quote
