★Why we need to calculate ABCD parameters of transmission lines? We have other parameters like Z and Y parameters, so what is the exact significance of ABCD parameters?my question is how these values help in power generation or transmission or distribution or power delivering ? is it helpful while designing the transmission lines i.e while selecting the materials for transmission lines ? if yes ... then how ?
ABCD parameters basically describe the relation ( A mathematical relation ) between the sending end and receiving end voltages and currents. A more intuitive understanding would be to calculate the sending and receiving end parameters with known impedance, admittance and gains (ratios of Vr and Vs). Now,  consider the two equations Vs = AVr + BIr Is = CVr + DIr Consider the receiving end is open circuited i.e., Ir is zero. So, we would end up with two ratios Vs/Vr = A and Is/Vr = C From A, I can get the ratio of voltages,  which inturn would indicate whether I got the intended drop or extra drop or even gain (due to Ferranti effect) in the voltage. Similarly what is the admittance offered by the network. Now consider the receiving end is short circuited. Hence Vr = zero. We end up with Vs/Ir = B and Is / Ir = D From B i get the amount of impedance offered by the circuit. And from D, the current gain/loss ratio is obtained. Once measured, they are almost fixed for a network. This is really useful in designing and simulating power system networks. So, when I design a line upto a certain voltage limit and if I can draw a varying amount of power within the limit, how much power should be supplied considering all the losses / drops and impedance can be easily predicted. The reverse can also be done (In ideal cases of constant load). When the power transfer capabilities are known, there are numerous possibilities what we can do with it. Hope this helped.    Embed Quote
