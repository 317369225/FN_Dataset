★What is the difference between a "parameter" and an "argument" in C programming language?I have just started learning C and I came across these terms .
Thanks for A2A ... An argument in context with functions is the actual value that is passed to the function ( as input) ,when it is called. However parameter refers to the variables that are used in the function declaration/definition to represent those arguments that were send to the function during the function call. For example.. Void cube ( int no){ printf("cube= ", no*no*no); } main(){ cube(3); } In this example 3 is argument whereas no is parameter.... Hope that helps...    Embed Quote
