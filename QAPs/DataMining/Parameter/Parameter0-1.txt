★What is the difference between a parameter and a statistic?
Briefly:  A statistic is an estimate, based on a sample of observed data, of a population parameter. Most generally, a statistic is any function of observed data. However, we usually care about a property of the general data-generating process for the entire population (which can include both real data not observed and counterfactual data in addition to the observed sample.)  These general properties are parameters. We can think of functional forms as parameters.  For example, does the data better support the idea that the relationship between X and Y is quadratic or cubic?  This is equivalent to estimating the maximum exponent one should put on X to model Y well, so here the degree of the polynomial is both the functional form and a parameter. Usually functional form is assumed based on some well-supported theory, some ill-supported theory, aesthetics, or wild guesses.  Specific coefficients and other parts of the functional form not specified by the theory are what we usually think of as population parameters. The typical reason for looking at data and summarizing it with some number -- calculating a statistic -- is to estimate one of these population parameters.  Hence the brief definition above.    Embed Quote
