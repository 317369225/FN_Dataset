★What are the parameters on which the price of a book is decided?
The thought process goes a little like this: 1. What kind of a book is it? Where does it fit into the market? 2. What do those kinds of books usually retail for? 3. Is there any reason why this book could command a higher-than-normal retail price? 4. Is publishing the book viable at the price you've identified? Really, you work backwards from the prevailing market price to work out what you can afford to spend producing the book. A paperback 32pp picture book in the UK costs £5.99 or £6.99, and there's no getting around that; if I take a picture book to the Waterstones buyer at £9.99, she'll tell me it's too expensive and won't stock it. (Bear in mind that not a lot of books are actually bought at cover price. The average selling price for a book is often significantly lowered by retailer discounts. So the big Xmas gift book you're setting at £20 might actually sell at the supermarket for £9, or something.) Now and again though you're going to make something that doesn't quite fit into an established category, and so there isn't a yardstick to decide your retail price. Here you're just going to have to guess what the customer will be happy to pay for it. What I don't recommend doing is setting the price based on how much you're spending to produce it. The price point constrains your costs and provides you with a bunch of rules of thumb you can use to set your other parameters. For example: a very rough and ready way to work out what you can afford to spend on actually printing and distributing a book is 10% of cover price. If your book costs £6.99, and your book's unit cost is significantly more than 70p, you probably have a problem. (EDIT: oh, that rule isn't going to work with short print runs or POD, by the way.)    Embed Quote
