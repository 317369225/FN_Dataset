★What parameters are needed to fully describe a fundamental particle?Only three parameters are required to fully describe a black hole : its mass, its electrical charge, and its angular momentum. Is it possible to describe a fundamental particle in a similar way? Which parameters are needed? Mass, electrical charge, spin, color, something else?
Approaching it from the other direction, if I put my hand in the bag, and draw out a particle at random, it must be either a quark (u, d, c, s, t, b) or a lepton (e, mu, tau, Ne, Nmu, Ntau) or a boson (photon, gluon, W+, Z, higgs). That's 17. If it's not one of these, then you have discovered something new to science, and can go directly Stockholm.   So you need just over four bits of information to say which particle you have; one bit to specify whether you have the particle or its anti-particle; one bit to specify whether it is spin-up or spin-down (or H or V polarised); two bits to specify its colour (red, green, blue, n/a); and then N-bits to specify its position/momentum (down to the limit that Heisenberg lets you go).   There's a bit of duplication, above (not all particles have all those concepts applicable to them). But you get the idea of where I was trying to go.    Embed Quote
