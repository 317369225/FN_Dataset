★What are the main parameters that determine whether a country is developed or not?Some parameters which come to my mind are GDP, HDI, Literacy rate, per ca pita income, infrastructure etc. What is the absolute factor that determines it?
There are many parameters that economists keep talking about. One of them is, as mentioned by Balaji, access to sanitation. I have two more to offer Safe drinking water - open a tap and drink without any risk of disease and How friendly the country is for the disabled. In my book, the second is not just a mark of development but also of being civilised in the true sense of the word.    Embed Quote
