★Is Sensex a parameter of growth in India?I was in an interview where I was asked about the status of the economy in India. I was thinking that economic growth can be measured by the status of SENSEX.
Sensex is an index for Bombay stock exchange and tells us about the collective performances of all the companies that are listed with BSE. It can certainly be not considered as the growth calculator but can be one of the growth indicator.    Embed Quote
