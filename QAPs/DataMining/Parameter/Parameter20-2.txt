★What parameters are to be considered when selecting an Adnetwork as an advertiser?I want to promote my services through Ad networks, how do i decide that this network is the right one for me, since none of them barring a few provide free trials. Some networks and your experience with them would be great help.
I would agree with Michael, regarding the importance of ad network transparency. It should have the crystal clear reputation. Moreover, you should also consider the amount of money you can earn, as the rates happen to differ, depending on which exact network you're working with. Besides, you should also keep in mind that not all of the local ones in particular geographic regions (e.g. Asia) are comfortable to deal with. In this respect, it's always good to select the well-known international networks, like Epom Market , if you're interested in increasing your revenue.
