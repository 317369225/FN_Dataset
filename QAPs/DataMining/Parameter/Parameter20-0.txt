★What parameters are to be considered when selecting an Adnetwork as an advertiser?I want to promote my services through Ad networks, how do i decide that this network is the right one for me, since none of them barring a few provide free trials. Some networks and your experience with them would be great help.
I agree with the majority of the responses shared above. However, I would add that your evaluation criteria should be based on your campaign goals. For example, if you're running primarily performance or direct response campaigns, you'll care about metrics like average CPA for advertisers in your vertical. If you're running primarily branding campaigns, you might be more interested in learning which other respectable brands work with that network for their branding initiatives, how many new users they were able to reach and the results of the campaign, as well as the quality of the ad network's content/publishers and transparency. You'll likely be interested in optimization opportunities - are these manual methods that you will be solely responsible for managing/maintaining? If so, do you have access to the tools/reporting necessary in order to properly evaluate campaign performance and make optimization decisions? If they're not manual, are they "programmtic" or model-based? In other words, do they simply do the work for you "automagically"? if so, are you allowed to set any constraints? And, are there are any limitations involved in running a campaign subject to machine optimization as defined by the network? I would start with the higher level, strategic questions and work my way down the funnel. If they're able to share any proof of performance - even nameless, without identifying the advertiser and/or publisher - that should help provide a sense of confidence in what they're sharing with you, of course.    Embed Quote
