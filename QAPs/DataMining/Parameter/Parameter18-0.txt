★What are the parameters on which the price of a book is decided?
The minimum price is what the publishers can afford per copy, with extras taken into account. By "extras" I mean such things as shipping to distributors, paying employees, and paying bills. And beyond that, they will charge as high a price as they believe people are willing to pay. In other words, Mikhail Kotykhov was right. Selling books is a business, and people go into business in order to earn money. It is as simple as that. Thanks for the A2A, Chrysovalantis Anastasiades.    Embed Quote
