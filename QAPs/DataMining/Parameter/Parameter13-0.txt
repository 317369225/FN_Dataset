★What is the rpl query parameter on Quora for?Started seeing it recently when I get to Quora's homepage.
rpl stands for "real page load". An older version of one of the Chrome extensions polls for tons of requests of users' homepages and this was overloading our servers.  To work around this, when we think a client might be the extension requesting the homepage to just check how many notifications there are or similar, we send a very small page with just the number of notifactions and some JS that will redirect a browser to the same page with the rpl parameter.  The extension won't execute the JavaScript and so it will never request the rpl page, but a real browser window will follow the redirect and request the real homepage that way.    Embed Quote
