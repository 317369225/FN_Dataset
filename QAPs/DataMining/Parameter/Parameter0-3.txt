★What is the difference between a parameter and a statistic?
A parameter is a characteristic of a population.  A statistic is a characteristic of a sample. Inferential statistics enables you to make an educated guess about a population parameter based on a statistic computed from a sample randomly drawn from that population.(see below figure) For example, say you want to know the mean income of the subscribers to a particular magazine—a parameter of a population. You draw a random sample of 100 subscribers and determine that their mean income is $27,500 (a statistic). You conclude that the population mean income μ is likely to be close to $27,500 (a parameter) as well. This example is one of statistical inference.    Embed Quote
