★What are the parameters determining the degree of responsibility for an action?
Choice. Responsibility depends choice. Choice depends on the constraints on one's actions.  Such constraints include: Time - You would have less responsibility if you had a split second to react, than if you had an hour. Lack of alternatives - If I don't kill him, he'll kill my family State of mind - Someone drugged me and then I had to make a decision    Embed Quote
