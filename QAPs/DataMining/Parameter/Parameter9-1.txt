★What is a two-way parameter?Googling this term doesn't actually return any results explaining the meaning of it. Thanks.
Unsure about your context, but it's likely a parameter that is passed in by the caller, the callee makes changes to the parameter and then returns the same parameter. The normal design in most mainstream languages would be to pass by reference. C, C++ would be known as passing pointers. Plsql uses in out keywords. The purpose behind such parameters would be that functions normally returns only one value. If you wants to returns several different values, you can't achieve it using functions. Procedures allows you to use two way so that you can return several values at once. To clarify, functions can return several values, but they must actually be wrapped/encapsulated into a single object/value. In OO languages, you will have to create a class to hold the return object. Normally if the object is solely used for a single function, developers will use two way parameters instead.    Embed Quote
