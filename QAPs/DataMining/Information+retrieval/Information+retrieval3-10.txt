★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
My guess is that It is easier to optimize Google's computing framework for one massive data set (the visible web) for all its search users than it is to optimize its computing framework for, let us say, 500 million smaller data sets (the inboxes). Not that it can't be done, but it looks from the outside as mutually exclusive approaches.    Embed Quote
