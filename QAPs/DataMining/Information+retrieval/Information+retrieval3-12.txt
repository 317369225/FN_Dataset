★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
Because the web has already been indexed by Googlebot.  Your mail may not have been indexed yet when you search.    Embed Quote
