★How important are information retrieval systems?Is it worth it to do research specifically in IR systems? (in terms of employment upon graduating)
When you don't feel good, you may choose to visit your doctor. When you do a research, you can go to meet your supervisor. But when you realize that they are too busy engaged with so much small matters, you may want to take some of their work and try to do something by yourself? Then you need information. Can you read ten relevant medical books in a day? This is neither possible nor necessary. The information need is just a piece of pertinent information. Now, IR is such a technology that you cannot ignore.    Embed Quote
