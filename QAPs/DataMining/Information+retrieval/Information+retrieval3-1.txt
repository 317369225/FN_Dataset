★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
I worked on Gmail for a year at Google.  Adam mentioned a few of the technical difficulties already.  The one I want to clarify/emphasize is that Gmail search results have to be real time.  For most of the queries on the web, it's okay for web search to have some latency.  There are exceptions when you think about news/events which is why Google has real time search with twitter integration.  However, the user expectation when they search in their email inbox is that the email or chat or buzz they sent or received 30 secs ago should be at the top of their search results.  Otherwise, the search results are wrong.  This combined with the fact there are no real "popular" queries makes caching much more difficult and therefore latency is a harder problem to solve.  That being said, there's a saying at Google though: nothing is impossible, some things are just non-trivial. :)    Embed Quote
