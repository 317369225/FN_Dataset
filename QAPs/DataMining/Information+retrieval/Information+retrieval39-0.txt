★What are some good books on ranking/information retrieval?I am looking to read one that explains at least one or two algorithms in detail with its applications and list out the others.
One of the best books for obtaining a holistic view of information retrieval is the Introduction to Information Retrieval book by Chris Mannning, Prabhakar Raghavan and Hinrich Schütze. This book lists many of the popular ranking algorithms used over the years. For information on more recent work such as learning to rank algorithms, I would recommend Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval by Tie-Yan Liu.    Embed Quote
