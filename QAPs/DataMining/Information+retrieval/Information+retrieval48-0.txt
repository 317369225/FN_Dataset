★What are examples of "non-adverserial information retrieval"?For reference, here's more information on Adversarial information retrieval: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adv...
It's about who creates or controls the content being indexed. In general content that isn't created with the objective of ranking high in search is non-adversarial. Some examples are repositories of scientific papers, internal search for companies, parts catalogs, etc. Many sites on the internet have content that's created and managed by a small group of people with the same goals, so there is no need to have spam detection algorithms (you are not going to spam yourself). IMDB is the first example that comes to my mind. As a search engine developer, the question you ask yourself is: are the business goals of my search engine aligned with those of the authors of the content it searches? If the answer is yes, it's non-adversarial.    Embed Quote
