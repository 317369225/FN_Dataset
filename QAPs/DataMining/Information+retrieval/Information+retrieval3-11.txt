★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
The other answers cover the technical reasons well enough. But the root causes why they (and you) tolerate a slower search here are economic, and involve some combination of: (1) Google doesn't make as much money from your mail searches, which are unlikely to reveal commercial intent and result in profitable ad clickthroughs; and... (2) once you've committed to Gmail, you can't easily switch to another email-search-provider -- at least not over a few-seconds delay.    Embed Quote
