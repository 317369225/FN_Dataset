★What are the research topics within Information Retrieval which currently receive higher funding?There are various all-encompassing areas like multimedia IR, Real time search, personalization of search etc. There are also topical areas like Legal, Medical, personal (history), etc. I see some research happening in all these areas. Which area do you think has the most scope for original work & has money in terms of research funding?
Honestly I don't know, but I would be interested if information retrieval of audio data (voice) is important and gets funding ? and what are the challenges for it (audio, voice processing) ?    Embed Quote
