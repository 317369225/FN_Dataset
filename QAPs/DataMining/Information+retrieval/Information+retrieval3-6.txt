★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
From Google's paper 'Power Provisioning for a Warehouse-sized Computer'  http://labs.google.com/papers/po... (2007): 'Webmail: This represents a more disk I/O intensive Internet ser- vice. We measure servers running GMail, a web-based email prod- uct with sophisticated searching functionality. Machines in this ser- vice tend to be conﬁgured with a larger number of disk drives, and each request involves a relatively small number of servers. Like Websearch, activity level is correlated with time of day.'    Embed Quote
