★How is information retrieved from black boxes?
A Black Box contrary to its name is actually bright orange in colour, as it's easier to spot brighter colours during a search. Most planes have 2 types of black boxes, one the cockpit voice recorder (CVR)  and the other the flight data recorder (FDR). 1)The CVR as the name indicates records all the conversations that takes place in cockpit. The older generation CVRs used to record upto 30 minutes prior to the crash on a magnetic tape, similar to the ones we used to find in tape recorders. Once the 30 minute time limit was reached it used to record over itself. The retrieval of data from CVR was pretty straight forward, provided the tape recovered was in good condition, the tape could just be played back to listen cockpit conversations. However the modern CVRs can record upto 2 hours of cockpit conversations and are recorded on a flash memory, these can be plugged into a computer and recovery using appropriate softwares 2) The FDR or the flight data recorder, records vital parameters during the flight, like airspeed, altitude, heading, etc it records thousands of various different flight relayed parameters. The earlier generation FDRs were obviously primitive and recorded less parameters they were recorded on magnetic tapes and decoding the data could take months. The modern versions use flash memories to save data hence they have way more capacity and decoding can take mere hours by using computers provided the flash memory circuitry retrieved from the crash site is in good condition else the circuit needs to be repaired to see if any data can be retrieved    Embed Quote
