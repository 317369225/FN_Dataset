★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
One of the key issues is  very large number of Gmail users, over 170 million as of Dec 2009. The amount of RAM available to store an index of each user emails  is very limited by cost. For instance, assume 100MB of RAM per user, the required RAM would be 17 million GB, requiring  millions of decent-sized machines. Note that such an index would be only a fraction of a typical user inbox which easily runs in gigabytes. The end result is that results have to be searched largely from disk. As Gmail is not a profit center for Google, they need to limit cost by supporting many users per machine and limiting how many resources can  be used by individual users. That is of the principal reasons for storage quotas prominently displayed to Gmail users.    Embed Quote
