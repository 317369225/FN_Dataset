★Considering the future of information retrieval, what do you consider the challenges to be for mobile information retrieval?(information on mobile devices, mobile environments)
In a way, the challenges have changed dramatically as compared to 2006 when we were building a mobile-focused search engine called Zook.in. Back then, our challenges were to: Extract record-like information from the web by looking at the DOM layout in the absence of semantic annotation Return the top-ranking results for a user's query without taking more than two small screens (maximum of a text message's worth or 140 characters) Give perfect refinement options to avoid back-and-forth that would cost the customer in text message or data cost As of 2014, the browsable web has a lot of semantically tagged information that can be extracted with relative ease, screen sizes have gone up and data costs have come down. Moreover, with so many touchphones around, navigation is easier, no need to worry about the user having to use the arrow keys to move around. However, there are new challenges now, nearly all of them around the fact that users are looking to perform transactions from the phone and not just consume it passively. The actions can be to book a ticket, a show, a table, a cab etc. So, it's no longer sufficient to get information, but actionable nuggets which involves: Getting information from the deep web behind forms. Information extraction at query time as transactions demand realtime information. Accessing information from and tying into apps. Enabling Deep Links for App Content is a step in that direction. Querying with non-textual information from sensors like location, velocity, imaging, health parameters etc. The content to return in response to a query is increasingly non-textual as well. So, images, videos, audios and more formats may need to be made sense and be associated with the query.    Embed Quote
