★Which is the best document representation for information retrieval systems?
EDIT: Diego, thanks for your clarification. I still believe you are using the wrong method to solve your problem. First, let me restate your problem as I perceive it: You are trying to perform machine learning using around 10^6 documents and 10^5 terms per document. The size of the corpus and vocabulary make your problem explode. You didn't state what the machine learning task is. I will suppose, for argument's sake, this is a classification task. Now the problem is very dependent on the computing environment and framework you use. Apache Mahout is capable to scale to this problem size, using a clever representation of document vectors and parallelizable algorithms. Mahout in Action covers the scaling issues in detail. vowpal_wabbit is a different machine learning framework which I believe also scales well. Again, Let me emphasize that your choice of features should be motivated by the intended application. For example, removing stop words usually helps with topical classification, but hurts sentiment analysis. Hope that helps, Yuval ========================================================= It depends. There is no "best" representation. There might be a representation most suitable for a task at hand. You need to experiment using a sample of the corpus you want to index and a retrieval task similar to the one you want to perform. On top of BOW/BOF, there are various term weighting schemes (e.g. TF/IDF, BM25), similarity measures(e.g. cosine, boolean), length normalization, stop word elimination and more. Some of these issues might be more important than BOW/BOF. In order to solve a real-world information retrieval problem, I would start with an existing search server (e.g. Apache Solr, Elasticsearch, Sphinx (search library)). Index a bunch of documents using the server's default settings, play with queries and see what you need to improve.
