★What are the best books and online resources to study the basics of music information retrieval?I'm currently a software engineer and keen to learn more about the field of Music Information Retrieval outside of my work. What would be your recommendations to get a grasp of the basics?
Check out the ISMIR site ( ISMIR - The International Society for Music Information Retrieval ), read papers and related texts and other information given on the site. Information Retrieval for Music and Motion: Meinard Müller An Introduction to Audio Content Analysis: Applications in Signal Processing and Music Informatics: Alexander LerchMeinard has a free online book on multimodal music processing which is also helpful - PD Dr. Meinard Müller (Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik). He has lecture notes as well along these lines which should be helpful. This should at least get you started in this area.    Embed Quote
