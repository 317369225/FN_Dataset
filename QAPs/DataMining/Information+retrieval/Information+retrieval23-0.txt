★What is the difference between Information Retrieval and Search?What is the fine line between the activity of search and retrieval?
It depends on what you mean by "search".  If you mean, as many commonly do, web search in the sense of Google, Bing, etc., then search is an application of Information Retrieval (IR) techniques.  But IR is a broader field and encompasses a range of techniques that help with web search, but also other related topics, such as information detection, extraction and summarization.  So the general problem is more than pure search, more than just finding the page or document that is related to a query.  The holy grail is to answer the user's questions.  In other words, directly answer the question, "What is the largest bank in Detroit?" rather then just give me pages that might be related to that question and have me sort through and read each page to find the answer.  In the end, we want answers, not just a tool to give us a short list of relevant pages to read.  IBM's Watson gives a sense of where this could be leading us.    Embed Quote
