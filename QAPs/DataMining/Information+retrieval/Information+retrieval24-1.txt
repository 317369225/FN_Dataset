★Information Retrieval: What are some hot research topics in IR?I want to do some research in IR. I want to know some of the current research areas in IR. Some of the areas I know are: Computational Advertising Query Analysis Recommendations Can somebody please suggest me some more topics in this field.
I would say diversity is hot recently. it is an interesting problem, and is not fully studied. Query understanding is always one of the most important problems. it includes verbose query, query intent mining, session, query suggestion, etc. for diversity, one could refer to web track of trec 2009-2012, and those papers in SIGIR. for verbose query, the work of Bruce Croft's group is pretty good. another important problem is learning to rank. if you want to do more theory and machine learning. my personal opinion is that the developing of various learning to rank algorithms is not that hot currently. however, the theory behind ranking, like the data generation assumption, and the bound on expected loss is one of the key challenges in IR. another one is click model, which is part of the morw general problem, user analysis. However, the data is hard to get. but if you have the data, E.G. you are in Microsoft or Google, it will be an interesting topic to work on.    Embed Quote
