★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
Also consider that Google doesn't really 'Search', they already have your answer! They just show it to you real-time. But for Gmail, they need to 'search' your inbox as it does not make sense to pre-search and index everybody's inbox.    Embed Quote
