★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
- Google has (almost) all results cached - Google, even though it says: displaying x out of 10.000.000 results. They really only looked up the first (usually) 10 results - Google makes more money the quicker they display results - Gmail looks up all results (and displays the first 20) - A slower search on Gmail won't increase churn rate as much as slow search on Google (Switching SE is easier than Mail provider) - Gmail's income isn't influenced as much by the load speed of search as Google's And maybe also an interesting one: a Google SERP size is about 160kb (Transfer size) a Gmail SERP is about 1.4MB (transfer size). Which is about 10x more :) So parsing a Gmail page also adds up to the load time difference.    Embed Quote
