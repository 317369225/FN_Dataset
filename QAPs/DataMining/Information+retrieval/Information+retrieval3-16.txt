★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
14 Christopher Cuong Nguyen gave mostly the answer I would.  I do not work at Google, but here's the short: 1. The web index itself is substantially the same for everyone despite some much smaller (than the index) level of personalization. 2, Google will have lots of machines -- possibly hundred or thousands per query -- recursively parallelizing each query you run on the web.  Recursively parallelizing means you'll tell serverA to run a query for "golden retriever" and that will tell 2 servers which will tell 2 servers.  2^n grows rather quickly.  Then it will merge the results up the chain. They're not going to do that for your email.  Most likely they parallelize to the same extent required to keep your data safe.  That means < 10 machines.  There's also that issue of index contention from a writer injecting new email into the index immediately.  A web index has to be eventually consistent whereas your index requires immediate consistency.  Locks slow a lot of things down and demand a different sort of index.    Embed Quote
