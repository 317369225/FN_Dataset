★What are the courses required to learn information retrieval and machine learning?
Look at Practical Machine Learning on Coursera right now. Also, check out Andrew Ng's Machine Learning on coursera. Other courses I highly recommend this summer: -FMRI Image Analysis (Coursera). Good explanation of how FMRI machines work and image processing pipeline. -Introduction to Digital Sound Design (Coursera). Good explanation of music features useful for computer music. -Digital Signal Processing (EDX). Good explanation of Linear Time Invariant Systems theory that is often very convoluted but fundamental to really understanding how to use signal processing well.    Embed Quote
