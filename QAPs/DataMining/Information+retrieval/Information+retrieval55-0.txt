★What is the importance of an information retrieval system to the way a computer works?
Information Retrieval is the process of obtaining relevant information from a collection of informational resources. It does not return information that is restricted to a single object collection but matches several objects which vary in he degree of relevancy to the query. So, we have to think about what concepts IR systems use to model this data so that they can return all the documents that are relevant to the query term and ranked based on certain importance measures. These concepts include dimensionality reduction, data modeling, ranking measures, clustering etc. These tools that IR systems provide would help you get your results faster. So, while computing the results and their relevance, programmers use these concepts to design their system, think of what data structures and procedures are to be used which would increase speed of the searches and better handling of data.    Embed Quote
