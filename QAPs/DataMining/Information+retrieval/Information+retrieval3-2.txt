★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
The key difference is that the storage backend for the web index can be built in batch, and is small enough to serve out of RAM. While the index for email must be updated in real time, and is too large to fit in memory. This means that doing an email search requires loading data off disk, and applying incremental index updates from a log. Also the email search query is handled by a single machine, while web search is sharded across a cluster.    Embed Quote
