★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
Many others have already hit on the right reasons, but I just want to highlight two key factors: Completeness When you do a search in Gmail, it needs to look at your entire mailbox to find those search terms, whether it's in an email you received an instant ago or one you received many decades ago. It must be 100% complete or you'd notice. On the other hand, you probably won't notice if a result is missing in web search. If someone somewhere created a web page, most people won't realize if it's not instantly reflected in the search results. Personal index Web index is efficiently shared by everyone therefore it enjoys speed which comes from caching and other elements, whereas Gmail index is only used by you. Each Gmail user has his/her own index. That being said, Gmail searches these days provide autocomplete-as-you-type so it's actually quite fast.    Embed Quote
