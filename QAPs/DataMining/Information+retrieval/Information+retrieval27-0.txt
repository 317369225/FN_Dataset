★What are some tools for testing web information retrieval parameters?
In the past I've used SnagIt, Fiddler, Charles proxy, and SoapUI. Now I use Paw2 for testing Restful services with JSON object models. It's the most advanced UI I've used so far. If my answer doesn't all apply, please use just what does. In the past I used some Python scripts, but I don't consider that a "tool" in the same way as the free & cheap tools with a UI that I can access directly. Ultimately, Paw is blowing me away right now, but it's still very difficult to use for testing early on Agile teams because the object model keeps changing so often, and there is no "auto update" or way to keep the test objects constantly fresh that I've learned yet. If you find a way to address this issue, other than updating each request, I'd be interested! There may be tools to do this or it may be possible in Paw2, but I've been using it for just a few weeks & am learning.    Embed Quote
