★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
In simple layman's terms: Google search is like going to Inn-n-Out and ordering a Double-Double burger where they might have dedicated resources to prepare Double-Double in a bit advance (read latency) while Gmail is like going to Chipotle and ordering your own customized burrito (read realtime).    Embed Quote
