★What are some good resources to get started with Information Retrieval? Why?
Yes, for a kick start: 1. William Hersh's book "Information Retrieval - A Health and Biomedical Perspective" is a good and brief work on IR, covering almost every aspect of information retrieval. From its origin to state of the art. 2. Manning and Raghwan's book "Introduction to Information Retrieval" is one of the foundations of the domain. 3. Keep in touch t=with the latest happenings in the information retrieval domain bu following special interest groups - http://sigir.org/ 4, Follow other international research groups, tracks and forums like FIRE [Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation], TREC [Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Home Page], CLEF [The CLEF Initiative (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum) - Homepage] Hope this helps!
