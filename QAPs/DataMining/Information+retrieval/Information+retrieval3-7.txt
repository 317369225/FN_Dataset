★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
Architecturally, google does not  have to index the entire web to be successful in search, as a result it can balance cost and benefit by only indexing a subset of the internet. Users of email, on the other hand, must get a complete result from their search.  So rather than limiting the size of the index, it limits the response time.    Embed Quote
