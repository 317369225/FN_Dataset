★Information Retrieval: What is the average monthly cost of a Bloomberg Terminal?
From my experience, I've noticed this varies according to features/usage. Danny is correct, it's roughly $24K/year to run the basic data package on Bloomberg, however if you choose to trade through Bloomberg's Equity Tradebook, they will vastly discount (or even provide for free, based on a minimum monthly volume of trades) the Bloomberg tool. Also, if you want added features such as real time market information or bulk data downloads, the price can rise very quickly.   If you are looking at Bloomberg, you might want to take a peek at what FactSet has to offer as well. They are one of the main competitors to Bloomberg, and depending on your needs they may offer you a better alternative.   Full disclosure, I personally use Bloomberg simply because they are probably the strongest in the fixed income space (in my opinion).   Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
