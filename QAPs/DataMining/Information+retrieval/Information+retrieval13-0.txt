★Information Retrieval: Data fusion vs Learning to rank?
The learning to rank crowd would say machine learning is the way to go, while the data fusion crowd would say data fusion's best. I've seen papers published that argue both sides of the coin in a rather convincing manner. I think it all depends on a number of factors: * Do you have any ground truth data? If so, then you may want to consider a supervised learning technique which will may equal or outperform an unsupervised data fusion technique. * How many retrieval models are you fusing together? If you only have a small number (dozens), then data fusion may work best, as a supervised learning technique may be overkill. My suggestion -- try something simple like CombSUM, CombMNZ, or Reciprocal Rank Fusion (see SIGIR '09 short paper by Cormack et al.) first. If it gives you suitable results, then you're done and don't have to spend the time training any models. Otherwise, I'd try a very lightweight learning to rank approach, like a simple linear model as you suggested. More sophisticated approaches are probably overkill unless you have many, many retrieval models or many, many training examples.    Embed Quote
