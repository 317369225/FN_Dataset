★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
Most simply, it's because GMail Search is not parallelized the way Web Search is (both because of architecture & the problem spaces discussed by Adam D'Angelo). It's not a technical impossibility to overcome, but a matter of resource optimization (yep, Google has to make these choices, too).    Embed Quote
