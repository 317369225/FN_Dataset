★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
It's because Google doesn't search the web, it searches its index. If your inbox had been indexed in the same way, and the index was hosted as robustly, the search would be instant.  Unfortunately it's not practical to index your inbox like the web because a) the search results need to be absolutely up-to-date, and b) unlike the web, only you are ever going to search it.  Gmail would be constantly re-indexing every inbox, and most versions of those indexes would never get searched, so it would be huge waste of server time and power. It's more practical to search the actual data on demand.    Embed Quote
