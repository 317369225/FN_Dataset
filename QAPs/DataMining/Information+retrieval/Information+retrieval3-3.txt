★Information Retrieval: Why does Gmail take longer to search my inbox than Google takes to search the entire web?It often takes 3+ seconds for Gmail to search my inbox, and it usually takes less than 1 second for Google to return results for a search query on the web. Why is there this speed difference?
Google isn't actually "searching the web" in front of you.  It has data gathering crawlers that scan nearly every page on the web.  The results from these crawlers are organized into extremely efficient structures that are actually what your "search" uses when you type in your search.  This web crawling and search structure building can take up to a few days, which is why Google searches can be a bit "stale" on newly-updated web pages. By contrast, mail is a "live" search, where the actual content searching is done in front of you in "realtime".  It's possible to precompute searches in mail in ways similar to Google's web search, but few mail systems do this as it's hugely expensive in terms of space and coding overhead, and most people simply don't have all that much mail.    Embed Quote
