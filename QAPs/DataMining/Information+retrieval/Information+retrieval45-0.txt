★Information Retrieval: What are some of the most important APIs every data scientist must know?
A large number of Data Scientists are involved in Social media analytics. APIs provide a very efficient way to gather a lot of structured (JSON, XML) and semi-structured data, so that we don't have to do the "Janitor work" as The New York Times recently pointed out. First on the list of "APIs every Data Scientist should know about" has to be the Twitter API. Twitter API is so important that UC Berkeley has a full fledged course called Analyzing Big Data With Twitter. Quite a similar case with Facebook's API. There are several other interesting Public APIs, but these are quite esoteric and domain specific. Here's a list of general APIs that you may find useful: Social Networks Facebook - API reference, Tutorial using PHP LinkedIn - API reference, Tutorial on using OAuth with LinkedINMaps Google Moon and Google Mars NASA Extenstions to the Google Maps API OnEarth from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Open Street Maps Data Photos Flickr    Embed Quote
