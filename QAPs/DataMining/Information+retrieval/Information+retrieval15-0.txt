★How has Quora utilized machine learning and information retrieval to improve its user experience?Where have you been able to improve the user experience through the use of machine learning and information retrieval? Are there any applications for machine learning algorithms on your website that you think would improve the user experience but which have not been implemented yet?
I'm not a Quora engineer, but I'm investigating Quora with my startup - MEHayter LLC Page on linkedin.com. They use a crap ton of machine learning to their detriment from what I can tell.  Machine learning has problems because it put you in a box and gives you want you want but not necessarily what you need.  This a big problem with Quora in my opinion.  As far as perspective changes, make better machine learning algorithms that are less exploitable would be a good idea.  With that said I love Quora and I wish the best for it! It's an awesome community of smart people Love it!    Embed Quote
