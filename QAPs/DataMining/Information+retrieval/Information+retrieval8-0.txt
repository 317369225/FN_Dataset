★Information Retrieval: What is the average monthly cost of a Bloomberg Terminal?
Confirmed at approx $2k per month 24k a year. A fun fact is that, almost like a cell phone company, they actually lock you into a 2 year contract. I never realized this during my years at Bank of America, because basically if someone left, the firm apparently held on to the license for the next person who will need one (fully transferable). However, at the Financial Times, some of the premium businesses use Bloomberg for sourcing/communicating with clients. I learned about the intensity of the contract when we tried to cancel our subscription after our product was terminated. They wouldn't allow it and the company (where I no longer work) is stuck with a very expensive license. It's the most amazing technological platform I've ever come across, but be wary regarding contract terms.    Embed Quote
