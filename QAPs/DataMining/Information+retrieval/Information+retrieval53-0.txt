★Which are the best universities for an MS or PhD related to Information Retrieval, and why?Which Universities are the best places for topics related to Multimedia IR, Ranking algorithms, TREC tracks etc?
In the main conference in the information retrieval field - ACM Sigir - universities with more than one paper this year[1] are shown below (note: I was surprised to not find Stanford or MIT on the list). My impression was that the hottest topic this year was machine-learning based ranking. A general advice for researching IR for masters or PhD degree is to get industry experience or cooperate with one of the big web search engine companies in order to find a good IR-related problem to deep-dive into.
