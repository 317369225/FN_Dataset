★How important are information retrieval systems?Is it worth it to do research specifically in IR systems? (in terms of employment upon graduating)
Extremely important. Systems always need both input and output. Storing data and not being able to have a meaningful way to retrieve it is as good as throwing it away.    Embed Quote
