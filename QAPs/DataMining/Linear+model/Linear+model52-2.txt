★Are "quantitative" funds actually still using linear factor models with fixed weighting?I just finished reading the May 31st issue of Pensions and Investments and there were quantitative fund managers claiming that they did not handle last years market conditions well because the weighting coefficients in their factor models were not conditioned on market conditions. Is this is a joke or are quantitative funds 30 years behind in their mathematical models?
Unfortunately this is not a joke, although Daniel Ahn is correct in his points -- and up until the last few years, many slow moving semi-fundamental quant strategies actually performed better than more "technical" strategies. A large subset of these slow moving quant strategies got decimated in August of 2007 and will never recover, and many other slow moving funds have been eliminated by the financial crisis. That being said, I know of more than a couple quant funds that still employ fundamental factors in their models, and do daily weighting targets or even slower. After all, somebody's lunch has to be eaten. Often these funds can stay this way since they're competing with mutual funds, pension funds, and/or are themselves long only index-tracking funds. You can read about these kind of strategies in textbooks now, so naturally they have almost no alpha by themselves, but they're appealing to some types of investors. Bottom line: Quant funds whose defacto correlation with linear factor only based alpha and risk based models are indeed 10-20 years behind and their risk adjusted returns will reflect this. Exception: high frequency space, where the alphas are 1% of the work in many cases, and the execution system and parameterization methodology is the true edge.  - Researcher at top 10 hedge fund.    Embed Quote
