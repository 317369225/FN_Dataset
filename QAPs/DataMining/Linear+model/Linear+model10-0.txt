★What are some non-linear models suitable for fitting large and sparse data?The data are high-dimensional (in the orders of 10k and above) and sparse (most variables are 0). Most variables are binary: they are either 0 or 1. The number of samples is in the same order as that of the number of dimensions.
I'm assuming the asker is referring to nonlinearities that are conjunctions of the input variables. In general this is hard because there are lots of possible conjunctions to sort through. Try something like the GROUP-LASSO (look at chapter 2): Page on stanford.edu. There are some pretty simple SGD algorithms to minimize that particular objective so it's straightforward to prototype: Page on icml2010.org. If the sparsity is coming from indicator features for an NLP task then the asker should look into applying word vectors; even naive applications might outperform the indicator approach.    Embed Quote
