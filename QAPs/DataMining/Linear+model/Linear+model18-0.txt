★What are some algorithms for regressing a nonlinear dataset to locally linear models?
There are a set of approaches from machine learning that allow for axis-aligned subdivisions of the space with locally linear models. These are called model trees (like regression trees, but each leaf node is an equation rather than just a value). There are a few algorithms around the place. The best known of these is Quinlan's M5 (a variant on C4.5): http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/alg.... There's an implementation of this http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc/.... Mauve is also another option (though I'm not sure if an implementation is available: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/vie...) Of course, to get your convex hull, you can simply find all the points that fall into each of the nodes of the decision tree. But the axis aligned representations forms just as good a generalization.    Embed Quote
