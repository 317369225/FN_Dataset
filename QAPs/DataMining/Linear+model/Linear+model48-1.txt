★Is a variable significant in a linear regression model?I've got a linear regression model with the sample and variable observations and I want to know: Whether a specific variable is significant enough to remain included in the model. Whether another variable (with observations) ought to be included in the model.Which statistics can help me out? How can get them most efficiently?
You can use a modified version of the F-statistic to work with this, or even better, the AIC (Aikaike Information Criterion). You can find some information about this here: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~d... You can calculate the AIC for models using R, and it will suggest the best variables to remove/add Happy regressing!    Embed Quote
