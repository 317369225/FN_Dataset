★What is the difference between general linear models and generalized linear models?
A general linear model is a statistical linear model which can be written as -   where Y is the matrix with series of multivariate measurements (also the dependent variable, X can be the design matrix (independent variable), B is the matrix of the parameter estimates and U is the error, noise and the intercept. General linear model incorporates various statistical methods such as ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA, ordinary linear regression, t-test and F-test. For general linear model, the dependent (Y in this case) follows the normal distribution. A generalized linear model is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression models which allows for the response variables (dependent) to have error distribution other than normal distribution. It generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. GLM was developed to unify other statistical methods (linear, logistic, Poisson regression). Popular approach used here is of maximum likelihood.
