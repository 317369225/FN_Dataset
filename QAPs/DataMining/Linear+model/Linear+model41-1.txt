★How do you fit a linear model when the dependent variable is known to always be positive? Does taking the log of the dependent variable have unintended consequences?
A DV > 0 is not a problem for OLS if it is not markedly skewed. Once you regress on residuals, do they look Gaussian? If the DV has a long right tail, a log transform might be good, or switching to a GLM such as the gamma or quasi-Poisson with robust standard errors. Generally regression coefficients on log-transformed DVs have interpretations as percent change. Predicted values are trouble and require dealing with transformation bias implied by Jensen's inequality. What is the variable?    Embed Quote
