★What is the relation between the linear model and Markov model?Does Linear Model belong to Markov Model?
The standard linear model for vectors , matrix of regressors , and matrix of regression weights .  is one that meets a restrictive set of assumptions given by the Gauss–Markov theorem. -Weak endogeneity (i.e., errors are second-order independent from explanatory variables), -Spherical errors (uncorrelated, constant variance, 0 expectation, symmetric distribution). -Linear specification, full column rank, i.e., . In particular, these assumptions imply no serial dependence among the observations. The errors are i.i.d. A Markov chain is a model where the conditional distribution for future states depend only on the present state or some limited number of past states. An example of this kind of model that's very close to a linear model would be an AR(1) process (Autoregressive integrated moving average), where serial dependence is accommodated by a lag one term. In short, the linear model is a very restrictive special case of the more general Markov model. Both the linear model and the Markov model can be generalized to allow for "hidden" states, which are missing independent variables in a regression model. We may be directly interested in the hidden states such as in a classification problem, or may simply use them to specify a model. Additional assumptions are necessary to identify these, e.g., distributional, and conditional independence.    Embed Quote
