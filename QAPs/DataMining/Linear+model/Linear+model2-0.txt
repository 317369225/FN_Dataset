★Hierarchical Linear ModelHi all... Is there a way to set confidence level (p-value) in HLM software ?....If there is not... How to Interpret the p-value given in his output ?
Not sure what you mean. I think HLM gives a p-value, and probably a (95%) confidence interval (but it's been a while since I've used it.  The p-value is the p-value, that doesn't change, you interpret it like a p-value is usually interpreted.[1] The confidence intervals are calculated from the estimate and the standard error. If you really want a different one, it's not hard to calculate.  [1] On second thoughts, perhaps not, as p-values are often misinterpreted.    Embed Quote
