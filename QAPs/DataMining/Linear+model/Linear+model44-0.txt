★If I have two linear models with the same number of parameters, how do I evaluate the significance of the difference in R^2 between the two models?
I wouldn't try to do this.  The significance test in this case (as in most cases) would not answer a useful question. That is, it answers: If, in the population from which this sample was randomly drawn the two models had exactly the same , how likely is it that we get a difference in at least as large as we got? But what you are probably interested in is more like: How much better (either in terms of explanation or prediction) is one model than another? For that, you could look at how well each model matches the actual data.    Embed Quote
