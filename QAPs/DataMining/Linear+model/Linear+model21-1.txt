★What is this formula in the simple linear model environment? (b = Cov(X,Y) / Var(X))b = Cov(X,Y) / Var(X) I have no idea how to get this.
In a linear regression model you try to a fit a model of the following form: where is assumed to be Gaussian noise and and are the predictor matrix and response variable respectively. The OLS solution is given by: . Here is the correlation between and and is proportional to the variance-covariance matrix . In the case where you have just 1 predictor (so that the dimensions of and are the same) we have that is the variance of assuming it has been centered (i.e., its mean is zero). So, going back to our original formulate for we can see that: .    Embed Quote
