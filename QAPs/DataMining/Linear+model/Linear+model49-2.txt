★What are some general ways to improve multiple linear regression models?i.e. What are some ways to increase the adjusted R^2 of a model?
I strongly advise against stepwise. If you use stepwise be ware that: The parameter estimates are biased away from 0 The standard errors are too small The p values are too low The models are too complex See  Regression Modeling Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis (Springer Series in Statistics) or search on "Stopping Stepwise" and my name for a paper I wrote on this I also wouldn't say that increasing adjusted $R^2$ is necessarily the goal of regression, although it partly depends on whether you are interested in prediction or explanation.    Embed Quote
