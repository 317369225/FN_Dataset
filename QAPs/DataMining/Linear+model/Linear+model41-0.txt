★How do you fit a linear model when the dependent variable is known to always be positive? Does taking the log of the dependent variable have unintended consequences?
If you take the log of the dependent variable, then you're fitting a model of the form                                   or, equivalently,                                         which is not a linear model at all, but rather an exponential model.    Embed Quote
