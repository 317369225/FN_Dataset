★What are the "mathematical" prerequisites for reading "Generalized Linear Models" by McCullagh and Nelder?So, I have taken classes where I went through "Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis" by Rice, Sheldon Ross's Introduction to Probability book and few pure math classes. I just want to make sure I am well prepared to handle the book. I have also taken CS 229 by Andrew Ng at Stanford. (I am asking this question because I am considering taking Stats 306a at Stanford which will be taught by Brad Efron)
I think you have to have taken a course on linear model theory in order to really get generalized linear models.  They're always presented as a special case of the standard model which the author is assuming that you're familiar with. That's not to say that you can't read the book and get something out of it with the standard background in linear algebra, probability and math stats.  But you are going to be limited in how much you can get. I'm not incredibly familiar with Stanford's specific classes, but after a brief look at the course pages for 305 and 306a, I would not recommend trying to take 306a without 305 or an equivalent course.    Embed Quote
