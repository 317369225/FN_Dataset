★What are the best ways to visualise Generalised Linear Models (GLM)?I often try and visualise models so a lay audience (such as policymakers) can easily understand and interpret results. How do others approach this?
Of course it will depend on what your major questions are, but... I like boxplots and profile plots.  Put some standard error bars on the profile plot if it doesn't make the plot too messy.  I think profile plots are underused. Somebody posted about violin plots recently on Quora, which are a variation on boxplots.  Those would be great for Generalized models where the distribution can be funky.    Embed Quote
