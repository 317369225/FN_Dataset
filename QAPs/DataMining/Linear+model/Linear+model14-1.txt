★Regression (statistics): How do I fit a linear model to data that has a periodic component?
If I understand your question, it sounds as if you want to solve for the coefficients m1 and m2 in the following equation. y = m1*x + m2*sin(x) + b + e m1 is the slope of the underlying trend. m2 is the amplitude of the sinusoidal behavior (assumed to be constant and not proportional to m1*x) b is the intercept term e is your error term You might want to normalize your independent variable to the apparent periodicity of the sinusoidal behavior.  There should also be some underlying basis for the sinusoidal behavior (e.g. time of day effects grafted onto a rising linear trend) that give you an informed hypothesis about the cyclical behavior.    Embed Quote
