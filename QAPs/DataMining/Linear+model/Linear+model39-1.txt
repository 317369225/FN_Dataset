★What could be the possible reason that adding an interaction term to a generalized linear model change the inference of the main effect?
I think it depends a lot on the details, but let's take a simple case. Suppose treatment is a continuous "dose" but age has just two values ("young" and "old") which are coded using a dummy variable which is 1 when the subject is old and 0 otherwise. The no-interaction model says that the log odds of response is linear in the dose, with the same slope for young and old (but different intercepts). A positive estimate for the dose coefficient says that, overall, the probability of response increases with increasing dose. Adding the interaction means you now assume different intercepts and slopes for the two groups. The "main effect" is really the slope for the young group. If it is now negative it means that, for the young group, the probability of response decreases with increasing dose. Hope that is close enough to your real problem to be helpful.    Embed Quote
