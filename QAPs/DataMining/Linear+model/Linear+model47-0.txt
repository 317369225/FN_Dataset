★How can I calculate the covariance of parameters a and b in the exponential model y=a*exp(b*x), if we use log-linear model (log(y) =log(a) +b*x) to estimate a and b, In R, lm() seems to only show covariance of log(a) and b, not covariance of a and b?
Denote log(a) as c. Denote the mean of b and c as bm and cm respectively; denote the estimation of the mean of a as ae. Cov(a, b) = Cov(exp(c),b) = E[exp(c)(b-b_m)]=E[exp(cm+(c-cm))(b-b_m)] If the variance of c is small, then approximately Cov(a, b) = ae*Cov(c, b). If the variance of c is not small, do Monte Carlo to get the answer.    Embed Quote
