★What is a simple example that shows where linear models break down and require non-linear methods?
Biological systems are a beautiful case study in why nonlinear effects are crucial.  Essentially, biology doesn't have the property that it can be tweaked and designed according to precise calculations, like human machines.  Biology works by building proteins from 20 amino acids, etc., and therefore designs need to be "crude" in the sense that they shouldn't be particularly sensitive on the parameters.  This is where it becomes extremely useful to exploit nonlinear dynamics, where you can make things like oscillators without having to very precisely tune the parameters of your system. Here's a very beautiful example:   the circadian clock in cells.   A few years ago a fairly simple nonlinear dynamics model involving the interplay between a few proteins was presented which seems to reproduce this effect.  The model boils down to what is called a "relaxation oscillator" which, unlike a linear oscillator, essentially consists of one variable very rapidly switching between two states, driven by the slow dynamics of a second variable.   A similar example is the cell cycle, which can be thought of as nonlinear interplay between the proteins cyclin and cdc2. Other examples of nonlinear dynamics in biological systems include population dynamics - e.g., predator-prey models, models about overfishing or forest destruction by invasive species, etc.   One also requires nonlinear dynamics to understand how a system can have a hysteretic effect:  e.g., add enough of a chemical to cause a biological system to begin producing a protein, and then remove that chemical and have the system not stop production.  (This is important because you don't want chemical fluctuations to turn your cell on and off.  If you make the decision to "go", you should just finish.)    Embed Quote
