★Does it suffice to say that "If a linear model with all predictors is not statistically more significant than a model based only on a subset of predictors, than any model between the two would not be more significant (regarding ANOVA)"?E.g. if the full model is y=x1+x2+x3+x4, and it is shown to be no more  statistically significant than y=x1+x2, does this mean that y=x1+x2+x3 and  y=x1+x2+x4 will be no more statistically significant than y=x1+x2?
No.   Although you haven't defined what you mean for a model to be 'more significant' than another model.    Embed Quote
