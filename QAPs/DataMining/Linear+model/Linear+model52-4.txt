★Are "quantitative" funds actually still using linear factor models with fixed weighting?I just finished reading the May 31st issue of Pensions and Investments and there were quantitative fund managers claiming that they did not handle last years market conditions well because the weighting coefficients in their factor models were not conditioned on market conditions. Is this is a joke or are quantitative funds 30 years behind in their mathematical models?
The outcomes/results of the model matter the most - however, it is more comforting to 'know' the story behind the outcomes - i.e. any model that is simple and focuses on fundamental performance parameters as much as valuations/stock prices will pass muster.    Embed Quote
