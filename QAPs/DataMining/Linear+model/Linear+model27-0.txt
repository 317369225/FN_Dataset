★Which of these two linear models is better, R square = 0.99 or R square = 0.7?In case you think the data is insufficient, what other data point do you need to find the better of the two models?
It is impossible to answer based solely on .  First: How complex is each model? And, unless you are talking solely about prediction, more important, the way to judge a model is not by or AIC or BIC or any other such statistic.  The way to judge a model is by the MAGIC criteria: Magnitude: How big is the effect? Articulation: Is it full of "ifs", "ands" and "buts"? Generality: To what population does it apply? Interestingness: Is it interesting? Does it add to knowledge? Credibility: Incredible claims require incredible evidence. Also, in some cases, too high an is suspicious.    Embed Quote
