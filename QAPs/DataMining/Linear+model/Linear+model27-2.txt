★Which of these two linear models is better, R square = 0.99 or R square = 0.7?In case you think the data is insufficient, what other data point do you need to find the better of the two models?
Neither. R-squared is just a number and both high and low values should be explored further. For the higher R-squared, I would further explore the following: Variable selection - a larger number of variables always give a higher R-squared, but may also be introducing more noise than information. You should ideally be using subset selection along with other indicators, including AIC, BIC, Cp and Adjusted R-squared, to come to a conclusion about model fit. Test MSE using cross-validation and holdout testing.For the lower R-squared value, there are several areas you can explore: Distribution of epsilons: The assumption is that epsilons are normally distributed. However, if the epsilons are not normally distributed, this can impact model fit. Mixed models: Sometimes, your data can have a mix of models. This can potentially be flagged by looking at the Std Errors in relation to the variable coefficients and by studying the residual distribution. Distribution of residuals: Checking for patterns in residual distribution is another approach to figuring out reasons for low R-squared. Of particular interest are patterns including heteroskedasticity. Density plots of residuals - Eg. leptokurtic / fat-tailed behavior indicate a mix of multiple epsilons with different Std. Devs.These are just a few steps that you can take from your existing dataset in further analyzing your model fit.    Embed Quote
