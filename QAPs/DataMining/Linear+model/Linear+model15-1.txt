★What is a simple example that shows where linear models break down and require non-linear methods?
Let us say you are a surfer You make your plans, pick up the surf board and then go off to the beach. You know all about how waves are caused, what affects them, how to balance on the board, body movements etc. You can try and break down the movements you will make into small pieces (like they used to make cartoon films with every successive frame shows a small change in position). You have it all planned out - like this Then when you get there you find that there is a huge frigate anchored in the deep sea and that is breaking the patterns of the waves. Then there are hundreds of surfers, some experienced like you and some not so experienced. You had it unless you adjust. You have to account for the unexpected interference in the pattern caused by the frigate. You have to account for the inexperienced surfers cutting across your path. You need to watch for changing wind patterns. In short you cannot proceed exactly as planned unless you  watch the environment and adjust constantly. We live in an incredibly complex and emergent world. There is almost nothing that moves linearly. A minor change in the variables can cause huge shift in the outcome. This is what chaos theorists call The Butterfly Effect (a butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing and it snows in New York).    Embed Quote
