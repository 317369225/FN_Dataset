★Regression (statistics): How do I fit a linear model to data that has a periodic component?
Decomposition is the traditional solution to this problem from time series analysis. You can decompose your time-series into three components: the trend, the periodic component and the noise. You can also extract out multiple types of periodic signals: a seasonal component (highly regular) or a non-cyclic component. The appropriate approach depends on the mechanism causing the oscillation in your data. Sine/cosine regression is not a common approach because typically those functions are not flexible enough to yield good model fits. The exception is when the underlying mechanism generating the periodicity is an actual sine or cosine function. In those cases, you can transform the data with an arcsine transformation and proceed with traditional linear regression.    Embed Quote
