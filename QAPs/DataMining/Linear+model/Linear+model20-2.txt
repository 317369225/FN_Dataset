★What is the latent log-linear model with latent variables and how do you train such a model?One thing with log-linear model that I cannot "capture" till now is the idea of "latent log-linear model" - a log-linear model with latent features. I cannot figure out what is exactly the hidden features; and how to train such a model?
This paper '[Ariadna Quattoni]Hidden Conditional Random Fields' may help you. I think what you mean by latent features is latent variable. In these kind of models, you may need to inference the latent variables ,which may not be solved in polynomial time in general.    Embed Quote
