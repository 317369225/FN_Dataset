★Are "quantitative" funds actually still using linear factor models with fixed weighting?I just finished reading the May 31st issue of Pensions and Investments and there were quantitative fund managers claiming that they did not handle last years market conditions well because the weighting coefficients in their factor models were not conditioned on market conditions. Is this is a joke or are quantitative funds 30 years behind in their mathematical models?
I don't understand the bias. If your fund is long-term oriented and unlevered and your investment philosophy is that there are behavioral inefficiencies in the market that will persist over long time horizons (like value + momentum) then static coefficients make sense. The fact that so many others are changing their approach based on what is working at the moment is precisely what will make your strategy work over the long term. Investing isn't about being mathematically pure, it's about making money. There is more than one way to do that. Don't hate because your way is more "cutting-edge" mathematically.    Embed Quote
