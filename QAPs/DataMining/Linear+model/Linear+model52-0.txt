★Are "quantitative" funds actually still using linear factor models with fixed weighting?I just finished reading the May 31st issue of Pensions and Investments and there were quantitative fund managers claiming that they did not handle last years market conditions well because the weighting coefficients in their factor models were not conditioned on market conditions. Is this is a joke or are quantitative funds 30 years behind in their mathematical models?
Without knowing much about the actual strategies being employed: 1. Just because the model is more complex doesn't mean it's better. In fact, you may lose out if your strategy depends somewhat on execution speed and getting the proper pricing if you are running larger models that take longer to process. 2. There are a lot of quant funds and I'm sure there's some variety in the strategies being employed by these funds (otherwise it would become a processing speed game at some point). Those with wildly successful strategies are unlikely to be forthcoming about how their models work. 3. As a fund manager, I would rather have a model that produces marginally less returns but is far easier to explain to my investors. If introducing more complexity into my models does not greatly enhance my returns, then why not keep it simple and make my fees through additional AUM instead of scaring away new investors (particularly if I don't / my strategy doesn't have an extended track record). 4. I'd be surprised if major funds haven't employed some sort of protection against a massive volatility scenario, either into the models or as a failsafe, to protect against a near complete loss in a situation where the model or the historical information used in the model no longer applies.    Embed Quote
