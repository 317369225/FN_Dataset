★Is a model involving reciprocals a linear regression model?As shown above, I can do a regression of the reciprocals of yi on xi. However, does that count as a linear regression? How do I find the effect of xi on yi in such model?
A linear model is a model that's linear in the parameters, not the variables.  So yes, this is a linear regression, but it has transformed variables. Changing by one unit changes by units, so to figure out the effect of a change in on a change in , you just need to work out the corresponding change in , find how that affects , and then convert that back .  Needless to say, the changes are nonlinear in the original variables.    Embed Quote
