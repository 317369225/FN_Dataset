★I have a nurse rostering problem. In practice, what is the maximum number of nurses that can be scheduled using linear models?I mean, I have a model and I want to solve it using a solver, e.g., CPLEX. I'd like to know opinions about how many nurses I can put in the model so the solver will be able to give me a result in a good time (less than 1h, for example). I know it depends on the model and the solver, but I look for an approximation of the order of magnitude.
For a rostering problem, I'd say that a few 100s to even in the low 1000's is quite doable using CPLEX or similar. I used to work for an airline and we used to solve rostering problems every month. As one related example, if we consider any good sized commercial airline in the world, they might have 5000-10000 pilots or flight attendants that they need to schedule and assign. (The constraints are different than in a Nurse rostering problem, but very similar in spirit.) The airlines solve these problems very regularly. In some cases, it might take a few hours to solve. If you have fewer than a 1000 nurses, just feed it to CPLEX without any fancy pre-processing and have a go. If you have a lot more than 1000 nurses, I'd suggest looking into any number of ideas for grouping/batching that OR practitioners have been trying. These include: 1. Treating groups of nurses as one, and then sub-assigning within those groups. 2. Partitioning the problem into smaller subsets. (This is almost always possible in practice.) 3. Hierarchical and hybrid approaches - roster a few nurses, then come back and assign others and so on. Bottom line: Up to the low 1000's is fairly easy. If your problem structure is good, even much bigger rostering problems can be tackled by commercial solvers such as CPLEX. Hope that helps.    Embed Quote
