★Does it suffice to say that "If a linear model with all predictors is not statistically more significant than a model based only on a subset of predictors, than any model between the two would not be more significant (regarding ANOVA)"?E.g. if the full model is y=x1+x2+x3+x4, and it is shown to be no more  statistically significant than y=x1+x2, does this mean that y=x1+x2+x3 and  y=x1+x2+x4 will be no more statistically significant than y=x1+x2?
The model selection In 1970, Hiritugu Akaike introduced an Information Criterion for model selection, known as the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC). Most likely, your model selection based on sets and subsets of predictors will fall into this area. Perhaps you look up the AIC and follow the model selection process. The references and descriptions are available online and has been widely documented.    Embed Quote
