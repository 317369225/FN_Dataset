★What are some non-linear models suitable for fitting large and sparse data?The data are high-dimensional (in the orders of 10k and above) and sparse (most variables are 0). Most variables are binary: they are either 0 or 1. The number of samples is in the same order as that of the number of dimensions.
Support vector machines are usually the model of choice for this kind of feature space. They deal well with high dimensions and can model non linear structures.    Embed Quote
