★Does it suffice to say that "If a linear model with all predictors is not statistically more significant than a model based only on a subset of predictors, than any model between the two would not be more significant (regarding ANOVA)"?E.g. if the full model is y=x1+x2+x3+x4, and it is shown to be no more  statistically significant than y=x1+x2, does this mean that y=x1+x2+x3 and  y=x1+x2+x4 will be no more statistically significant than y=x1+x2?
It does suffice to say, because of the ambiguity of the question and it's application. If a linear model was termed exactly how you described - it would mean that any model between the two would not be any more or less significant than any other before it because the variables and predictors have not been defined and their application is unknown.  In order to truly answer the question, in the real world, there would need to be many variables and "already understood answers to variables that would be stated in the model".
