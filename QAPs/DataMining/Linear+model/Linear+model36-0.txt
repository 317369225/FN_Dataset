★When can prediction based on multivariate adaptive regression or linear models be better than using the random forest algorithm?
this is an interesting question. Random forests (and recently deep learning) have become the standard off-the-shelf algorithms which perform well in a wide range of regression/classification tasks. The main advantage of such algorithms is that they typically require very little input from the user and are able to learn patterns in the data automatically (this of course comes at a computational cost). However, when the user has a genuine understanding of the process they are looking to model, the use of a linear (or other appropriate model) should  result in similar performance at a much lower computational cost. Finally, it also worth mentioning that when the goal is to get a better understanding of the underlying process then the use of e.g. linear models are preferred as the results will be much more interpretable (i.e. parameters in linear models are easily interpretable).    Embed Quote
