★Can time series analysis be used to predict stock trends?
Well, time series analysis and statistical modeling can help you understand the trends of stock market, but may not be very helpful when it comes to predicting the prices of certain stocks. It's more like, you can understand the trends / patterns looking backwards. One of the biggest factors that leads to changes in stock prices are unexpected events (spike in data points, in terms of time series). To put it in simple words, you can use time series to predict stock trends, but not with very high degree of accuracy, which in essence is futile!    Embed Quote
