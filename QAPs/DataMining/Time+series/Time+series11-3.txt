★Can time series analysis be used to predict stock trends?
A while ago I created some simple statistical models of the stock market and found that indeed, the markets are predictable.  The first model used only the stocks themselves.  These provided very weak predictive power.  Adding in atmospheric data improved the predictions considerably.  Whether the models were good enough to make money on I don't know yet, but consider that in atmospheric simulations, predictive skill is everything.  In market analysis, your predictions only have to be good enough, that is your rate of return has to exceed your risk.  This idea that the markets are not predictable or that the markets are efficient is also nonsense.  While individual humans are hard to predict (actually even that isn't true as the incident with Target and the pregnant 16-year-old proves), as a statistical aggregate, human behaviour is very predictable.  And to address the idea of efficient markets: I would compare this to equilibrium versus non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics.  Efficient markets are like equilibrated systems.  Keep in mind that the principles governing equilibrium systems are almost always discovered first.  While the dynamical rules have long been established in electricity and magnetism (electrostatics was codified first), and there's currently a flurry of work in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and has been for a long time, it seems that economists haven't bothered to go that extra mile yet. Here's a modest suggestion: why trust anyone yelling either yay or nay.  Why not put it to the test?    Embed Quote
