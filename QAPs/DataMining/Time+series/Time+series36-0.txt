★What are the best/most common supervised learning classification algorithms for time series data?Supposing your training data is a time series (with one or a few 'reading' values given at each time step), and certain intervals within this series are classified (into, let's say, 3 levels), what algorithm can best find a predictor function to 'recognize' these special intervals and classify them?
By far the most common algorithm for time series classification is hidden Markov models (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hid...). One thing to consider is: are you classifying isolated time series (think classifying a number between 0 and 9) vs continuous time series (e.g. 141534). The beauty of HMMs is that they can elegantly deal with the continuous time series case. Other algorithms exist, e.g. Dynamic Time Warping (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyn...). There's a level building algorithm you apply on top of DTW to make it work in the continuous case. There are also "wrapper" algorithms that use kernels or primitives to convert it to a conventional classification problem. It's a little out of date, but you may want to read the literature section of my PhD where I go through the state of the art at the time (https://sites.google.com/site/wa...)    Embed Quote
