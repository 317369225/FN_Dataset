★What is the best approach for storing time series data?would like to know your experiences with different dbms for storing time series data.
The most important thing to remember about time series data using any database is to store all information possible. By this I mean, not only the time, but the location of that time. 9pm for me is 10pm for someone 400 miles east. If I enter a record at 3am, it may be 5am for you. Time zones are the key. The best way is to always store your time series data in the database in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time) -- the abbreviation doesn't match because its European -- like SI or International System of measurement. Sometimes you'll see people reference GMT or Greenwich Mean Time. Here's more on UTC vs GMT GMT vs UTC - Difference and Comparison The point is, store the data in the database in a universal time, then translate it to the time of the user. The alternative is to store the time of submission and the timezone it was submitted in. This could be very hairy moving forward, so I don't recommend it. Another option to consider is storing time and date separately. If something is happening on a particular day, your users may enter the whole date, but then don't want that translated to another time zone. Also remember, Times and Dates are very culturally sensitive. The starting day of the week is different. Different countries and cultures input dates differently, some do month/day/year others day/month/year. The type of calendar is also different. Just be aware that time is not the same for everyone as it is for you. That's very important when you're considering time series data used by many different people around the world or across time zones.    Embed Quote
