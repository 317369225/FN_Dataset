★What is a good algorithm to interpolate missing time-series data?
If your time-series is very slowly varying or smooth, a low pass filter aka. moving averages works well enough. You will however not be able to recover any "high frequency" information in the original time series. Chances are though, whether you are dealing with financial time series, or geophysical data, or EEGs, your data is rarely smooth; so it is preferable to use methods that extract more information. Kernel Smoothing Methods: Kernel smoothing methods will look for other patterns in the time series and average points together only when their neighborhoods appear similar to each other. The "kernel" performs the relevant matching and weights different samples according to their similarity.  To start off, you might want to use the Parzen-Rosenblatt or Nadaraya-Watson estimators. Splines for interpolation: Another alternative to low-pass filtering, is to assume that the underlying continuous data is best modeled as a combination of piecewise polynomials of different orders. Linear interpolation would interpolate your data assuming that the relationship in the interval of two samples is a 1st order polynomial (like a line), while cubic interpolation assumes that a 3rd order polynomial would describe the interval between two samples. In general a higher order polynomial is more accurate and helps you recover a cleaner and smoother version of your series. [2a-b] survey different interpolation methods and compares linear (moving average), quadratic and cubic interpolation methods in medical imaging. But the same would apply for time-series as well. One advantage of the spline basis is that it can handle non-uniform spacing of samples. Signal Estimation using Wavelet Transforms: The wavelet basis is optimal for both approximating point singularities in a time series as well as stochastic estimation of such signals. This is probably the hardest to get a handle on if you are unfamiliar with multiresolution and wavelet analysis, but is definitely the most desirable one if accuracy is important. Implementations for all of these can be found in the R package for Time Series [4] [1] Kernel Regression Smoothing of Time Series http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/d...
