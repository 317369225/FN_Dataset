★Is it worth my time to start reading the Wheel Of Time series?I gather that there are 14-15 huge books and that although it starts off pretty well, the pace slackens later. So what i'm asking is whether me putting in months into the series worth the satisfaction. Also, comparisons to other Fantasy Series like "Ice and Fire" and LOTR are most welcome.
Absolutely!! It is probably the best epic series ever!! If you decide to read it, I envy you the journey that awaits you!    Embed Quote
