★Is it worth my time to start reading the Wheel Of Time series?I gather that there are 14-15 huge books and that although it starts off pretty well, the pace slackens later. So what i'm asking is whether me putting in months into the series worth the satisfaction. Also, comparisons to other Fantasy Series like "Ice and Fire" and LOTR are most welcome.
I recently started WOT and have read the first three till now. I found it quite good till now. Rather I was very absorbed in the third book. The first book started very slow but became a fast thriller in the last, I was almost jumping with excitement. The way Jordan writes is quite simple but fascinating. He puts in a lot of inner thoughts of characters, which I personally feel brings the characters from 'heroes' to normal human being's level, you can empathise with them. I would say this is a good time to start reading this series. No waiting time for us, no heartburn!    Embed Quote
