★What are some fantastic books on time series analysis?
I think the mainstay textbook on this (for economists anyway) is James Hamilton's Time Series Analysis [1]. If this is your passion, do get it. However, it's long and very dry and for a first-timer, not great to read at all. If you're just interested into "getting to know" time series from a somewhat advanced level, here's two suggestions with some qualifiers: W.H. Green - Econometric Analysis [2] - Has a mix of cross-section and panel stuff in here, but there's a good chunk dedicated to just time series. Like Hamilton, it's very heavy on the notation but has more words to back it up in case you get lost. Fumio Hayashi - Econometrics [3] - I would actually recommend this book to anyone interested in econometrics in general. It's absolutely the best one out there. Excellent primer in matrix algebra, least squares, etc. Then dives right into the meat of things so flawlessly (method of moments estimators never looked so easy!). If I remember correctly, there's only a couple chapters solely dedicated to time series, but it'll be the best chapters you'll ever read in your life (on this stuff anyway). This was my most favorite textbook in grad school. [1] http://www.amazon.com/Time-Analy... [2] http://www.amazon.com/Econometri... [3] http://www.amazon.com/Econometri...    Embed Quote
