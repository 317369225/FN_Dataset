★What is the best way to store time series data in Redis?
I have two ways I use time series data in redis. 1. Counters by hour, these are key/values partitioned by hour so pv_2010_344_01 would be read as pageviews_year2010_day344oftheyear_hour1am and I just increment the counter +1 for each view 2. Sorted sets -> I want the most recent 10 people who've logged into the site so I use a zset in redis and store the timestamp of their login, then I get the latest 10 users like so: (php) $users = $redis->zrevrange('onlineusers', 0, 9); 3. Lists, you can use lists as queues so that you're always pushing data to the right so items remain in sequence as they arrived to redis, then you can just pop off the left most values to get the oldest data.    Embed Quote
