★What are some novelty detection techniques on time series?i.e. http://scholar.google.com/schola...
There is no general solution to this problem.  You have to apply human reasoning to the specific domain and encode it in your heuristics -- and the success of that depends on how well you understand the domain in question (hence the level of specialization in the field). Anyone who seems to have solved this problem is simply one who has been the lucky enough to have guessed properly during a particular period and, retroactively, claiming credit or authority that they do not have.  Given time, such successes will inevitably appear, but at the same time, such success cannot be sustained.    Embed Quote
