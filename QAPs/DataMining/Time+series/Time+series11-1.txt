★Can time series analysis be used to predict stock trends?
I was a quant trader for some years and I know for a fact that people do it every day in banks and hedge funds. Information is not uniformly available and not everyone has the ability to analyse the stock market in depth. Statsitical arbitrage teams use these advantages to predict trends and trade on them. Of course it's impossible to get rid of the risk but some strategies achieve pretty high Sharpe ratios: Sharpe Ratio Definition | Investopedia. And yes what is involved is some sort of "time series analysis" (this term is very broad). What the quants try to do is correlate past prices and any relevant data about financial events to future stocks performances. And you would be surprised by the simplicity of some predictive models in statistical arbitrage.    Embed Quote
