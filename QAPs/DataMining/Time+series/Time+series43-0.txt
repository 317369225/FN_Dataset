★Would NoSQL databases be a good choice for storing large time series?If so, which is better - Redis, MongoDB, other?
It is difficult to answer your question without knowing how you plan to use that data. Storing time series in NoSQL databases is possible, e.g. StumbleUpon created OpenTSDB on top of HBase for storing time series [1]. And you could probably use many of the others depending on your app requirements. I've also found this other Quora thread on the same topic: Which distributed databases work best for storing time series? [1]: http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/...    Embed Quote
