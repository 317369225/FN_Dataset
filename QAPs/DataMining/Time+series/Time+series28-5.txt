★Is it worth my time to start reading the Wheel Of Time series?I gather that there are 14-15 huge books and that although it starts off pretty well, the pace slackens later. So what i'm asking is whether me putting in months into the series worth the satisfaction. Also, comparisons to other Fantasy Series like "Ice and Fire" and LOTR are most welcome.
i have recently finished the series and i would say that it is one of the most satisfying series i have read until now. its true that because of the large world and multitude of characters the pace did slow around the middle of the series but the details made the world more vibrant and beginning from the 11th buk, i could hardly put the buks down    Embed Quote
