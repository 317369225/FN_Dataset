★What are some time-series classification methods?
Xi, Keogh, Shelton and Wei ran a benchmark comparing various classification methods: Fast Time Series Classification Using Numerosity Reduction, 2006: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/vie... Here are some of the methods cited in their paper: Rodriguez & Alonso (2004) used a DTW based decision tree to classify time series. Nanopoulos & Alcock et al. (2001) used a multi-layer perceptron neural network. Wu & Chang (2004) used a “super-kernel fusion scheme” Chen & Kamel (2005) used “Static Minimization-Maximization approach” to build Multiple Classifier Systems. Kim & Smyth et al. (2004) used hidden Markov Models. Hayashi & Mizuhara et al. (2005) used DTW distances to embed time series into a lower dimensional space using a Laplacian eigenmap. This embedding is designed to both improve accuracy and performance. Chen & Ozsu et al. (2005) used a measure based on multi-scale histograms. Eads & Glocer et al. (2005) applied grammar-guided feature extraction for time series classification. Megalooikonomou & Wang et al. (2005) introduced a symbolic multiresolution approach that appears to slightly outperform DTW. In general the most common time series classification schemes are Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Models, both of which were popularized in Speech Recognition literature in the late 70s and 80s.
