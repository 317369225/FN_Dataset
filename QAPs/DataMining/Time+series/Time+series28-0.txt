★Is it worth my time to start reading the Wheel Of Time series?I gather that there are 14-15 huge books and that although it starts off pretty well, the pace slackens later. So what i'm asking is whether me putting in months into the series worth the satisfaction. Also, comparisons to other Fantasy Series like "Ice and Fire" and LOTR are most welcome.
Devansh, Agreed that it is a monster series. Unlike other books this goes on for 14 books. Sanderson has ended the series this January. As a fan of the series, I would recommend that everyone read through the series. It is awesome. As Vinay has noted, the pace slacked by around book 8. But once Sanderson took over, things have become awesome. In fact the last two books were so good that I must have re-read them 20 - 30 times waiting for the last book to show up. I say go ahead. On the comparisons: Jordan's epic is old school. It is more like the fantasies of the 70s than now. I have never liked LOTR. So I cannot compare. But the battle scenes in WOT are vibrant. From Dumai wells to the battles of Perrin and Mat; it's written well. I am reading the last battle now..    Embed Quote
