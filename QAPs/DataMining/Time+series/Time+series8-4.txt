★What is the best way to store time series data in MongoDB?
I'd say the most logical way to store time series data in MongoDB is to use each element of the series as an individual document. Beyond that you really need to to ask yourself how the data will be queried. PHP|Architect has a quick write up that explains that NoSQL solutions, like MongoDB, are best when structured to handle expected queries (http://bit.ly/dOUvlX). As oppose to SQL solutions that best at handling more dynamic queries. So, what you need to do is ask yourself what kind of queries are going to be run against the data set and optimize your structure for that. For instance if you're going to be querying based on different date attributes (ex: items only on Thursdays) it'd be best to leverage the Mongo's Javascript date object. If you'll simply be dumping chunks of the series in sequence it might be best to just store the time in an int. This isn't super informative but without more info its the best answer I've got :)    Embed Quote
