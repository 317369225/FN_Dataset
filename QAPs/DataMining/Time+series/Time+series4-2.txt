★What is cointegration of time series data in statistics?Thanks for the explanation Edwin and Damien. One question. How do you identify pairs of stocks for trading? Is it based on simple correlation analysis or is there a more rigorous method?
tl;dr:  The dynamics of one time series at the current point in time is a correction of last period’s deviation from the equilibrium plus some possible lag dynamics . PS: If you write equation to represent the above the error terms are white noise and the constants are 0 if there are no deterministic trends in the series.Namely: Detail : The Cointegration method (can be used for contexts like pair detection) is a model based parametric approach. The idea here is that if two asset prices follow a common stochastic trend, the spread between them may be weakly stationary. More precisely, if we have two time series that are both integrated of order d and there is a linear combination of the two that gives a time series which is integrated of order d − b,[1]  with b > 0, then the two series are said to be Cointegrated, i.e. C I (d, b). Advantage : ECM representation (see tl;dr) You can carry forecasts quickly Problems: [1]Spread has to be weakly stationary,o/w no error correcting behaviour . [That whether it is stationary can be tested by running a linear regression of one series on other , if x and y are integrated of order 1, error term is w/s in the order that x and y are ] [2]the context of statistical arbitrage (d - b =0 :stationary ) we do not know which asset to take on the left and which to take on the right hand side.Which is not the same for many tests and you have to test both ways.(what a dull and tedious thing  to do )    Embed Quote
