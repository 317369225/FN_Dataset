★What are some books that are similar to the Wheel of Time series?
The Wheel of Time is my favorite series, hands down.  I also thoroughly enjoyed: The Mistborn Trilogy, by Brandon Sanderson.  Love love love the magic systems he comes up with.  Best part: all his books are connected, and he's planning 30+ books in different parts of the same cosmere to all come together at the end of his career #ambitious #probablyacylon The Way of Kings, also by Brandon Sanderson - first of a series of 10 (See: Stormlight Archive) that he's just started.  The book is a little slow to start (similar to WoT) but the ending is phenomenal. Song of Ice and Fire, by George RR Martin.  Great series, but it doesn't make me happy like WoT does. The Taltos series by Steven Brust - less epic than WoT, but very humorous.  Also incomplete, something like 13 of 19 books have been written.    Embed Quote
