★What are the recent trends in time series data mining?I would like to know about the recent trends in time series in data mining and its application .
Another important trend is temporal data mining is Change Point Detection. Temporal changes usually occur slowly and are difficult to detect. If a normal clustering algorithms like k-means is applied over the temporal data it might just end up putting everything in one cluster or everything in different clusters. So you need to decide the threshold as to where you want the split to happen. That is really difficult with the time series data. Deciding the number of clusters and the threshold (or split criterion) is another trending topic in temporal data mining.   Wikipedia link Change detection You can look at my answer here.
