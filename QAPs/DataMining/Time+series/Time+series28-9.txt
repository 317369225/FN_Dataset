★Is it worth my time to start reading the Wheel Of Time series?I gather that there are 14-15 huge books and that although it starts off pretty well, the pace slackens later. So what i'm asking is whether me putting in months into the series worth the satisfaction. Also, comparisons to other Fantasy Series like "Ice and Fire" and LOTR are most welcome.
Flaming yes I read the whole series (14 books) twice. It slows down in 8th and 9th novel and almost stops in 10th. But, Brandon did a great job after Jordan's death. The finale is worth reading the slow parts.    Embed Quote
