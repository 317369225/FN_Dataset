★Simple algorithm for trend detection in time series data?I'm looking for a simple algorithm to detect trends in time series data. It would be great if there is even an implemented java version of it. I'm not looking for the best most accurate algorithm, but I just want an algorithm that simple and good enough for the job.
Whenever one is dealing with non-stationary time series, two things should be checked: 1. Is the series difference stationary? It is difference stationary if you replace every point of the timeseries with . 2. Is the series trend stationary? We can check this by fitting a straight line or polynomial of higher order using the time as predictor and by using the the ordinary least squares estimate. Almost all software has a package that does ordinary least squares for you. you seems to be interested not in modelling the timeseries itself but more in detecting trends so you should use option 2. Feel free to ask my more questions if it's unclear. source: MSc in Applied Statistics.    Embed Quote
