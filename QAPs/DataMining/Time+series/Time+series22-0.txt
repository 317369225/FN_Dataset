★What are some novelty detection techniques on time series?i.e. http://scholar.google.com/schola...
One should first define in what sense the events will be 'novel'. Sometimes it will be peaks in the time series, sometimes noise over the whole frequency spectrum, etc. This in turn determines the novelty detection technique   You can get to this with a shortcut if you already have an algorithm for predicting the time series. You could use the 'predictability' as an indication for novelty. If the time series is predicted well, nothing novel is going on.    Embed Quote
