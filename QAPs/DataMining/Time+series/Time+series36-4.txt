★What are the best/most common supervised learning classification algorithms for time series data?Supposing your training data is a time series (with one or a few 'reading' values given at each time step), and certain intervals within this series are classified (into, let's say, 3 levels), what algorithm can best find a predictor function to 'recognize' these special intervals and classify them?
There is no such thing as the best algorithm. An algorithm will perform good on some datasets, and bad on other datasets. Any machine learning algorithm can be used for time series analysis using the embedding framework. Here are some Google scholar results: time series forecasting neural networks Results 1 - 100 of about 59,800.   (0.46 sec) time series forecasting decision tree Results 1 - 100 of about 44,300.   (0.42 sec) time series forecasting markov Results 1 - 100 of about 39,700.   (0.44 sec) time series forecasting genetic evolutionary Results 1 - 100 of about 26,600.   (0.46 sec) time series forecasting ARIMA Results 1 - 100 of about 22,900.   (0.61 sec) time series forecasting nearest neighbor Results 1 - 100 of about 18,400.   (0.40 sec)    Embed Quote
