★What is cointegration of time series data in statistics?Thanks for the explanation Edwin and Damien. One question. How do you identify pairs of stocks for trading? Is it based on simple correlation analysis or is there a more rigorous method?
Just adding to the excellent answer Edwin Chen gave, from a trading-related perspective... Pairs trading is a form of statistical arbitrage where you are betting on the preservation of the "long run equilibrium" to use Edwin's terminology. It's common, but not mandatory, to choose products which are natural substitutes as the two entities involved in the pair. The reason for this is because, in theory, as one becomes more/less expensive consumers will switch to the other product at which point market forces (supply/demand) bring them back into equilibrium, eventually. However caution needs to be taken to ensure fundamentals don't change. Here's an example from the energy futures market.  In the graph below it appears that between1998-2009 Heating Oil and Natural Gas are good candidates for pairs trading since they are, in theory, genuine substitutes. However, during 2009 they in fact diverged breaking a long history and the profitability of StatArb-ers not keeping on top of fundamental changes.    Embed Quote
