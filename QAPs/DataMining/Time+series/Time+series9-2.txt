★Are Deep Belief Networks useful for Time Series Forecasting?Nearly every example I have seen involving deep belief networks involves some sort of facial or image recognition problem.  Is there any particular reason why these new techniques aren't being applied to time series forecasting (perhaps they are but are not being published)?  I'd really like to see how one could configure a Neural Network in Matlab that takes advantage of some of these new methods.
It's true that most deep-learning projects are concentrating on images. But the nets learn sound, text and time series just as well. Open-source, distributed deep learning for the JVM, an open-source, distributed deep learning framework for the JVM, uses moving window with deep-belief networks for time series. Recurrent nets are also really popular with that type of data.    Embed Quote
