★What is the best way to store time series data in Redis?
We use sorted sets to store time-series data, with the caveat that to allow for duplicate values you need to include the timestamp in the value. We want to optimize for fast queries at the moment, at the expense of not-so-fast inserts. To optimize for the reverse I'd append the value and timestamp to a list and then potentially post-process at various points to optimize for whatever query patterns you want. I find Redis generally tries to encourage denormalization of data - that is, you might have a list of values that you periodically in batch jobs or at insert time build into forward and reverse indexes.    Embed Quote
