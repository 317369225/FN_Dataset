★Is it worth my time to start reading the Wheel Of Time series?I gather that there are 14-15 huge books and that although it starts off pretty well, the pace slackens later. So what i'm asking is whether me putting in months into the series worth the satisfaction. Also, comparisons to other Fantasy Series like "Ice and Fire" and LOTR are most welcome.
Umm... YES! This book is probably one of the best books I've read in so long. I've read many fantasy books - but this book just... I don't know it just did something for me. The story carries on very well. It was in fact super long, but I was hooked - read all 14 books in like 3 months - every day like clock work. My favorite thing though is that the lines between good and evil are SOOOOO thin its fascinating. Please let me know how it goes for you! and PICK IT UP!    Embed Quote
