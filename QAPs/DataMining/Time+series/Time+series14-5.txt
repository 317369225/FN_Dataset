★How do I learn about time series analysis?
Time Series Analysis is a fun and challenging area of Machine Learning. This is the book I strongly recommend for beginners in addition to William Chen's suggestions. Amazon.com: Modelling Financial Times Series (9789812770844): Stephen J. Taylor: Books Also if you want to understand from a Statistician's perspective this is a good read. Amazon.co.uk: Peter J. Brockwell, Richard A. Davis: 9780387953519: Books I would say once you get some idea on basics, jump on to building a model. It's ok to build a model that's too obvious but then you will improve progressively by building good training sets. Random sampling plays a crucial role. Also make sure get thorough understanding on external factors that could impact datasets. For example if you're working on  stock predictions check what commodities, what major events etc have impacted stocks in the past. Was it a spike or a level up? And why was it? How do deal with Outliers? Build your training sets accordingly. Also it would be interesting to check if Neural Networks can do a better job than standard Regression techniques. You can read this paper to avoid common mistakes while modeling. ATB!    Embed Quote
