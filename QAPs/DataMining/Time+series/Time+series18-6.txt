★What are some books that are similar to the Wheel of Time series?
I would like to support the users who answered A Song of Ice and Fire, Mistborn, and the Kingkiller Chronicles. They are about as fantastic as you get. Personally, I've never felt much fondness for the writing style behind Shannara (although that is a very subjective complaint), and I feel that the Sword of Truth should have ended at book 5 (and objectively, the last 3 books were really unnecessary), but I would recommend beginning each series after checking out those three. I would also like to add Brent Weeks' The Night Angel Trilogy to the mix. It is a potent story, similar to Mistborn, but with a male main character and slightly less potent descriptive techniques. While it is by no means the greatest series on this list, it can hold it's own against many of the series listed here, and depending on your literary preferences, you may find it quite pleasant. Also, just because nobody mentioned it yet, and while it is by no means on the same level as A Song of Ice and Fire or Wheel of Time, I would recommend reading the fantasy novels that began the whole trend: The Lord of the Rings.    Embed Quote
