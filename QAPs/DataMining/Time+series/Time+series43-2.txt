★Would NoSQL databases be a good choice for storing large time series?If so, which is better - Redis, MongoDB, other?
It really, really depends on how you are using the data...and how it comes in? Batching the data into text files and stuffing them into HDFS will let you do anything - as long as you have plenty of time for the answer. Once you want to talk about quicker than Hadoop answers, it's going to come down to the queries - type and performance requirements.  Don't overlook MySQL - particulary using it as a KV - if the data is easily partionable by source or time. Key issue is going to be scaling for aggregate computation as new data comes in...low-queries, big-latency then anything will work...high-query volume, really quick, fewer options. This is a core SQL use case.  Compressing the data massively into a single fact table, partitioned by sensor/stock and then lazily doing aggregates on non-trading hours does work really well for lots + lots of TS applications. Very complex time series states - non-tick data - really need something with Temporal features - not a big thing in the NoSQL world...    Embed Quote
