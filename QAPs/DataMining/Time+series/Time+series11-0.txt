★Can time series analysis be used to predict stock trends?
Generally speaking, no. Proof by contradiction. Assume time series predict that the price of XYZ stock will rise tomorrow. What do you do? Buy today. Result? Price of XYZ is pushed up today so that tomorrow the price doesn't rise. Past (public) information is very quickly incorporated into stock prices so most fluctuations are caused by news/noise. The above answer is only generally speaking because if you had an advantage that others did not, greater speed for example, or if you had much superior techniques then it can work but the techniques are constantly changing and involve much more than "time series analysis."    Embed Quote
