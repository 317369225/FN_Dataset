★What are some interesting examples of time series analysis on data which are not time series?That is, data sets where common time-series analysis methods produce good results because the data or the problem formulation has some commonality with time series analysis.
This is interesting. There are lots of examples where people have used time series mining algorithms for datasets which are not time series. Below are few such examples: 1) For Classifying, Clustering and indexing Two Dimensional shapes.[1] The cool thing about method used in paper is these comparisons between objects are rotation invariant. This has applications in anthropology. 2) Motif discovery for spatial trajectory.[3] (A bit of self promotion here) 3) A novel technique for indexing video surveillance data. [2] 4) Nematode matching [4] 5) Apart from this it has been used for data in neonatal ICU[5], physiological data[6], vital signs data[7]. Although these are time series data, I thought it would be worth mentioning them. I would be happy to add, if you think something is missing and should be part of answer.
