★What are some time series distance/dissimilarity measures?
In addition the those measures listed before, model based measures can also be used. For example, if we have two sequences of data points (represented by vectors f and g) you can fit both f and g using a polynomial and use the polynomial coefficients as features on which standard similarity measures can be applied. There are many possible models one could apply: ARIMA, wavelets, HMM, PCA, etc. Model based methods (normally) also work when f and g are of different length. One could argue that even simple statistics suffice as models, for example one can compute |mean(f) - mean(g)|. This also works when f and g are vectors of different length. Whether this similarity is useful depends on your application domain. A benefit of simple statistics is that reasoning about their "usefulness" is fairly easy compared to features based on complex models.    Embed Quote
