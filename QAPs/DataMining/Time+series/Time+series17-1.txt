★What is the best approach for storing time series data?would like to know your experiences with different dbms for storing time series data.
The important point to keep in mind while storing time series data is that in case of time series data, we have very few or no inserts because data is mostly in increasing order of timestamp and it is indexed by timestamp. So, you can index on timestamp and store in a file. You won't have to reindex again and again because data mostly comes in increasing order of timestamps. Keeping this in mind, we can implement the following approach. We can accumulate data for a time interval (let's say 1 minute) and then write to disk after doing some sort if the data is little out of order. Data is written in segments (let's take 1 segment as 1 MB) which are indexed by timestamp. While write back, we can perform an external merge sort  with the last segment to correctly store out of order data. We can use some compression techniques to make these operations faster by reducing IO and also save some disk space. We can have index by some other columns apart from timestamp as well such as security. If we want to use existing DBs, we can use MongoDB.
