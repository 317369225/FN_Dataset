★What are the major challenges in clustering time series data?
One of the major challenge in temporal clustering is Change Point Detection. Temporal changes usually occur slowly and are difficult to detect. If a normal clustering algorithms like k-means is applied over the temporal data it might just end up putting everything in one cluster or everything in different clusters. So you need to decide the threshold as to where you want the split to happen. That is really difficult with the time series data. Consider an example of changing height of the person. The height may be changing each day but you never realize that height has changed and end up thinking that there is no change (consider that as assigning the point to the same cluster). As the time pass, you keep on thinking that the height was same as yesterday or two days before (and keep on assigning points to the same cluster). But after an year, when you look at some of the images taken long back you realize that the person has totally changed. So maybe you made some mistake in forming clusters. Now you go back and try to split your originally formed cluster. The first question is how many clusters should it split into? The second question is since the height is changing negligibly every day, at which point you should split the cluster and why (putting two points with difference as low as 0.001 into different clusters don't make sense)?  There are many other problems but this is one of the major problems you should be concerned about. Many people tried to address this issue. You can look more about this problem http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha.... Temporal clustering is a challenging problem and still being researched upon.    Embed Quote
