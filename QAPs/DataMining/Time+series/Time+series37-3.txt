★How do I apply supervised learning methods to time series classification?
1. "80/20 split"?  Are you splitting for training + cross-validation + test sets?   60/20/20 is a common split ratio to use. 2. "What model"?  Several to choose, see "Shivam Agrawal" answer above.  I do something similar using 3-layer Neural Nets.  Also thought of trying a Support Vector Machine, and trying to reduce the stored landmarks to relatively 'orthogonal' ones, so that I am not storing every sample (thought experiment only at this stage). 3. "Accounting for Time Properties"?  One approach is to give each frame a 'memory' of previous values, by adding channels, calculated from moving averages of previous values for the channels of-interest.    Embed Quote
