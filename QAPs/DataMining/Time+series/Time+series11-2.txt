★Can time series analysis be used to predict stock trends?
My view on the answer is yes and no.  Have I seen people extrapolate time series analysis into the future and make money yes, I have.  I have also done it and some of the models I know people utilize have this in conjunction with other indicators.  The reason for no is that it doesnt always work, as someone here already mentioned, if you expected price to rise tomorrow, you purchase it today, but by that action it already increase the price.  Not only will the price increase due to your purchase of the stock, but others will have analysed the same data stream and come up with the same conclusion. The model then will no longer work and eventually people will give up. The cycle will be complete, and extrapolating based on time series will work.  This "trend following" tends to work on smaller stocks or markets such as the commodity market.    Embed Quote
