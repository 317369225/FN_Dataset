★Is it worth my time to start reading the Wheel Of Time series?I gather that there are 14-15 huge books and that although it starts off pretty well, the pace slackens later. So what i'm asking is whether me putting in months into the series worth the satisfaction. Also, comparisons to other Fantasy Series like "Ice and Fire" and LOTR are most welcome.
As you said, it started off well with a sort of coming of age of the major protagonists and until the 7-8th or 8th book I actually wanted to know what happened next. After that I began to lose interest. The major characters became less and less likable and the Tarmon Gaidon, the final conflict seemed as far as in the first book. I gave up.    Embed Quote
