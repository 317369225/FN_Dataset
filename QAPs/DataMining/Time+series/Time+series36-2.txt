★What are the best/most common supervised learning classification algorithms for time series data?Supposing your training data is a time series (with one or a few 'reading' values given at each time step), and certain intervals within this series are classified (into, let's say, 3 levels), what algorithm can best find a predictor function to 'recognize' these special intervals and classify them?
CRFs are pretty good for this, and unlike HMMs, you can have them use any number of features. There are also a number of non-linear implementations of CRFs, such as skip-chain CRFs for cases where you want to factor in a more complex window than merely something like the value at time y-1. I've used these before for NLP where context is important. I've never actually used one for time series data, but I imagine they'd work well for the same reason.    Embed Quote
