★Why do we sometimes get nonsense correlations between time series?
There are a number of different cases that can lead to spurious correlation where there shouldn't be any, or correlation being absent when it should be present.  Here are some possible explanations: The time series you are looking at are not stationary.  Then, it is common to get spurious correlation.  See What is cointegration of time series data in statistics? for more details on how to handle this case. The time series appear uncorrelated but are actually dependent.  Their relationship may not be explained by a simple correlation model but may require something like a copula model.  See Are there any generalizations of the notion of correlation to more than two variables? There are not enough observations.  This can usually be determined by looking at the t-stat of the correlation. There is some implicit time offset that is leading to spurious correlation.  For example, the change in price in US markets from yesterday to today and the change in price in Asian markets from today to tomorrow are correlated, but that doesn't mean that the move in Asian markets is predictable.  The correlation is there because the move in Asian markets from today to tomorrow starts at the same time as the move in US markets from the previous day is ending. Data that have been trained to be correlated in-sample has been overfitted and the correlation does not hold up out-of-sample.  See http://www.forbes.com/sites/davi... for amusing examples.    Embed Quote
