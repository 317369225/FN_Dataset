★What are some interesting examples of time series analysis on data which are not time series?That is, data sets where common time-series analysis methods produce good results because the data or the problem formulation has some commonality with time series analysis.
Dynamic time warping is a method for matching similar time series, but has found applications for other types of ordered data too. In seismics, time might correspond to depth and DTW has been used for shapes extending in both time and space [1]. You can also transform a 2D problem into a 1D problem, such as in [2] where word image matching is performed by first translating the image of the letters into a 1D string and then performing DTW, or classifying contours in images by way of defining them as cyclic 1D patterns amenable to DTW analysis [3].     [1] Dave Hale, Dynamic warping of seismic images [2] Rath and Manmatha, Word Image Matching Using Dynamic Time Warping [3] Palazón, Marzal, Speeding up shape classification by means of a cyclic dynamic time warping lower bound    Embed Quote
