★What are some books that are similar to the Wheel of Time series?
I'm intrigued that no one has mentioned David Eddings' Belgariad sequence - he also wrote several more epic high fantasy sequences, in that and two other fictional universes, which also share elements of the classic 'hero's journey' plot. Belgarath the Sorcerer and The Redemption of Althalus are both also well worth the read. An author who is less than well known, but is excellent - Sarah Zettel, specifically for her Isavalta trilogy. She includes elements of both Russian and Indian folklore in her mythology, as well as many other references I'm sure I missed. I mentioned this in a comment above, but the collaboration between Janny Wurts and Raymond E Feist is one of my favourite high fantasy sequences. It's set on the other side of the Rift from Feist's Riftwars 'verse - Daughter of the Empire, Servant of the Empire and Mistress of the Empire. This trilogy features a female protagonist, as does the Isavalta sequence, which does nothing to change the scope of either's plot. As Pullman has been mentioned, I'll throw William Nicholson into the mix, with the sequence beginning with The Wind Singer (not sure, but this may have an alternate title in the US). It's YA, but it's brilliant, epic YA. I'm sure I'll come up with more later, and I'll add them as I think of them.    Embed Quote
