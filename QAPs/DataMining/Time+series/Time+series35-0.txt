★What's the best way to store and chart time-series data?
Redis and/or MongoDB are good choices if you want a relatively easy solution. Both can handle high volumes of frequent writes, which is what you'll need. It may also be possible to design your schema such that it has finite well-defined size limits. For example, per second counts only require a maximum of 86400 entries per day (60*60*24). Even more aggressively you can use something like RRDTool to reduce capacity requirements further by only storing a summary of older data.
