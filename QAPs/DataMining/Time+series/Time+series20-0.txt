★What is the importance and usage of Time Series?I have read on some blogs that Time Series and the Fourier Analysis of Time Series are mandatory topics to be familiar with in the field of Machine Learning. Can you, please, explain precisely what is the importance, context, and usage of these topics/theories?
A time series is just a sequence of measurements of some quantity taken at several discrete times.  For instance, if we wrote down the current price of Apple's stock each minute today, we'd get a time series like this: If we sampled the amplitude of a sound several times a second, we'd get a time series like this: Fourier analysis is a way of taking a complex waveform, like the one above, and resolving it into a bunch of simpler waveforms.  There's plenty of answers about Fourier analysis on Quora already, e.g. What is an intuitive way of explaining how the Fourier transform works? What is fourier transform in layman terms? Since the whole point of machine learning is to take complex data and resolve it into smaller, easier-to-understand pieces, you could say that the Fourier transform is actually a 17th century example of a machine learning algorithm.  On top of this, Fourier analysis is sort of a first step towards many other types of decompositions, e.g. wavelet analysis.    Embed Quote
