★What are the recent trends in time series data mining?I would like to know about the recent trends in time series in data mining and its application .
I’m assuming you wish to know about recent developments (trends) in the field data mining that focuses on time series analysis. As far as I'm aware there are no major breakthroughs this year. Hot research topics in time series analysis are: - Transfer learning - High performance computing for massive data analysis In transfer learning the goal is to take knowledge obtained from solving one problem, and use this knowledge to better solve another but related problem. For example, mobile phone sensor data can be used to predict user activity. Predicting user activity for user 1 is a related problem to predicting user activity for user 2, this is therefore a transfer learning problem. Many new methods are being developed to tackle these types of problems. In high performance computing the goal to develop methods that are capable of analyzing massive amounts of data (e.g. 100GB+). Data of this magnitude is commonly found within the domain of weather forecasting, stock market prediction, and medical machine data like EEG. Super computers are becoming more available and faster every year. And with developments such as CUDA, programming these machines becomes more easy. A lot of research in the last few years has been focused on taking traditional methods for time series analysis and making them suitable for high performance computing. Disclaimer, when searching for papers on Google scholar that appeared since 2012, found trough keywords "time series" or "forecasting", most papers seem to use techniques that have been available for many decades. And most applications seem to be from the finance domain. Even though these papers are from 2012, I would not label them as recent trends.    Embed Quote
