★What is the best way to store time series data in Redis?
I'm thinking about this for irccloud atm - storing chat logs. One option is to use sets, and use a unique precision timestamp as the score. This lets you segment and query by time, but it's log(n) Another is to just use lists, you get o(1) access to add new entries, and fetching the most recent entries is cheap if you just push new items to the head of the list. Ranges queries are more expensive this way though. You might also consider using lists or sets, but partitioning by hour/day/whatever in the key, eg: 20101201 : [a,b,c...] 20101202 : [d,e,f...] or even more granularly by hour, or 10 hours etc. This means you have less data to sift through for any given time range. Slightly off topic, but i'm currently planning to use partitioned tables in postgres via table inheritance and constraints on the timestamps.    Embed Quote
