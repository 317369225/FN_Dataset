★What are the common metrics on time series data?By metric, I mean distance function, in the mathematical sense.
This question is a little too open-ended. 'Metrics' imply a problem domain. If the metrics refer to quality, then measurement metrics apply, such as Nyquist's criterion or Nyquist rate, low levels of missing data and accurately calibrated sensors. If the metrics refer to things we use time series data for, these can range from volume measurements and basic occurrences in the data, to digital signal processing, where signal-to-noise ratio, harmonics and other factors play a part in ascertaining 'metrics'. Perhaps restate the question to include the problem domain, such as asking "what are the common metrics applied to time series data of website activity" or "metrics for frequency domain analysis of time series data" or "metrics for use in the analysis of log files". When talking about metrics for analysis, such as unique website visitors, or peak simultaneous system users, peak system throughput or other factors, these are not referred to as metrics, but rather data or information. 'Metrics' implies a measurement of a single variable for immediate interpretation where I think you might be asking about ways in which we can analyse a time series to extract meaningful information.    Embed Quote
