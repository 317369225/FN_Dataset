★Is it worth my time to start reading the Wheel Of Time series?I gather that there are 14-15 huge books and that although it starts off pretty well, the pace slackens later. So what i'm asking is whether me putting in months into the series worth the satisfaction. Also, comparisons to other Fantasy Series like "Ice and Fire" and LOTR are most welcome.
You heard right. The last book actually written by the author was so shallow and poorly written, I thought he let a kid do it for him. Then someone else wrapped up the series in a way totally unsatisfying. And discordant.    Embed Quote
