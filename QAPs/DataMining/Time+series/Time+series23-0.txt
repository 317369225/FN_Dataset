★How are time series used in physics?
A lot of physical observations are made using time series.   This might be as simple as a human recording the value displayed on an instrument at a fixed time increment - writing down the temperature at the same time every day, for example - or it could be from an automatic sensor, recording values every millisecond.     These raw, numerical observations are then analysed mathematically and statistically to look for patterns.   These might be to confirm predictions made by an existing theory,  or to build up an entirely new theory.   For example, in my field, seismic processing, we analyse the time series recordings made by thousands of sensors for a period of a few seconds after a shockwave is sent into the earth.  From these time series we create an image of the sub-surface rock structures.    Embed Quote
