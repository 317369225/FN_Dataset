★How do I convert non-stationary time series into stationary time series in R?
The default option is to use the diff() function to first-difference the series. One would typically apply this to logged data to remove a trend. You can plot the first-differenced data to see if it is stationary as well as apply some tests, such as acf(), unitroot(), adfTest(), and ur.df()...just google to check which R-libraries are required for the various tests. You could try another (simple) way, if you assume a straight line may be a reasonable model for the trend. Use the lm() function to regress a "y-axis" variable (e.g. stock price) onto an x-axis variable (e.g. the corresponding time) and plot the residuals to see if they are an i.i.d. normal sequence (this is the assumption, if your trend is indeed linear). Something like: linear.trend.fit.residuals = (lm(price~time(price)))$residuals, then plot the variable. Nonstationarity is also present in "seasonal" data. I haven't worked much with seasonal data, aside from at university. So I would advise you to check your data for seasonality as the possible source of nonstationarity. There's a lot of good info online. Google Eric Zivot for starters. He's quite a boss and I've learnt a lot by referencing the work he's put out there. Also check out stats.stackexchange as a good resource.    Embed Quote
