★Can time series analysis be used to predict stock trends?
It is not possible to make accurate predictions due to incomplete data (unknown future events etc.), but whether it is possible to at least have a good probability of doing better than the overall market is open to debate. I have done a fuller answer referring the the efficient markets hypothesis here: Chris Prosser's answer to I want to write a paper about predicting the stock market using data mining to analysis data to get some pattern. I have searched the UCI, but cannot find it. Where can I get the data?    Embed Quote
