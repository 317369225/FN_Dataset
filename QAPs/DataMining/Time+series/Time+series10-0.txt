★What are some time-series compression methods?
The most common one is predictive coding. There are three steps: a) identify a model for your time series (say: y(t) = a*x(t)+ b*x(t-1)+ c*x(t-2))  You can have both linear and non-linear models b) Generate a prediction error (say, e(t) = (y(t) - x(t)) c) Code the residuals (e(t)) using a lossless codec (say, Huffman) You can also quantize the error to achieve even better compression. The receiver (decompressor) needs to know the prediction model. Given the residuals, it can fully reconstruct the original data. The model can also be adaptive based on some characteristics of the time series.    Embed Quote
