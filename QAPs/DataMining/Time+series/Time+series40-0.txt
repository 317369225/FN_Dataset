★How useful is time-series analysis in data science?
The time-series analysis is a very important concept in Data Science. It is basically done in two domains,  frequency-domain and the time-domain. Both of them play a vital role in intense computational analysis and also optimization science. One example is the time-series forecasting, in which the output of a particular process can be forecast by analyzing the previous data, by various methods like exponential smoothening, moving averages,  log-linear regression method, etc. Many data scientists have been using this method for various applications and studies. One premier example can be Prof. Hans Rosling's analysis of child death-rate in the African countries. The frequency domain is also used extensively in the bio-informatics field and also in the study of biological evolution, etc.    Embed Quote
