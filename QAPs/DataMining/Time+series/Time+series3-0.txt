★What are some time series measures?i.e. features that can be used for classification or regression (linear/nonlinear, parametric/nonparametric, univariate/multivariate, time/frequency, similarity/distance measures) This is a follow-up question to What are some measures of complexity?
Univariate linear measures Statistical moments Spectral band power Spectral edge frequency Accumulated energy Characteristics of the autocorrelation function Hjorth parameters Autoregressive model parameters Univariate non-linear measures Measures based on the correlation sum Correlation dimension and integral Correlation density Correlation entropy Approximate Entropy Sample Entropy Fourier entropy Wavelet entropy Renyi Entropy Higher-order methods Marginal predictability Dynamical similarity index State space dissimilarity measures Lyapunov exponent Permutation methods Local flow Other univariate measures Algorithmic complexity Komologrov estimates Hidden Markov states Surrogate time series and surrogate correction Loss of recurrence (degree of non-stationarity) Bivariate linear measures Maximum linear cross-correlation Linear coherence Bivariate non-linear measures Non-linear interdependence Dynamical entrainment Measures for phase synchronization Similarity measures Dynamic Time Warping (thanks to Roar Nybø for the addition) Hidden Markov Models Edit Distance Newey–West estimator Prais-Winsten transformation Data as Vectors in a Metrizable Space Minkowski distance Mahalanobis distanceData as Time Series with Envelopes Global Standard Deviation Local Standard Deviation Windowed Standard DeviationData Interpreted as Stochastic Series Pearson Correlation Spearman CorrelationData Interpreted as a Probability Distribution Function Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Cramér-von Mises criterion References Mormann et al., Seizure Prediction: The long and winding road: http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/...
