★Why cplex use primal dual method？does IPM faster than simplex when solving linear programing?
CPLEX has a fairly complicated internal algorithm for selecting which method it uses to solve linear programs. The logic is partially explained in the parameters manual, in the section on the RootAlg parameter (which is the one that controls the algorithm for both linear programs and for the root node of integer programs). The default setting tells CPLEX to apply its internal logic. You can override that choice and compel it to use a particular algorithm. In general terms, dual simplex seems to be the method CPLEX most often selects. If you give CPLEX a "warm start" (start it from a previously discovered basic feasible solution, say the optimal solution to an earlier run), CPLEX will determine whether the warm start is feasible in the current solution. If it is, CPLEX may use primal simplex. If the warm start is infeasible (needs repairing), CPLEX likely will use dual simplex. I'm speculating on this next part, but I think that if CPLEX detects significant degeneracy, it may switch to the interior point method, which is less vulnerable to the effects of degeneracy. If, during presolve, CPLEX determines that the LP looks substantially like a network flow model, it may switch to the network simplex algorithm. If you are solving a MIP, CPLEX uses a different logic to select the algorithm for solving nodes other than the root node (controlled by the NodeAlg parameter). Since MIP nodes are usually created by adding one or more cuts to the previous node, dual simplex is usually fastest here. (The optimal basis for the parent node provides a superoptimal solution to the child node.)    Embed Quote
