★Why these two linear programs are not equal?
I think your constraints in second formulation's MATLAB code are different from first. In the second your constraints ended up being: -xi less than equals 0 x1+x2 less than equals 100 x3+x4 less than equals 70 x2+x3+x4+x5 less than equals 250 -x1-x2 less than equals 100 -x3-x4 less than equals 70 -x2-x3-x4-x5 less than equals 250 In your solution you can see that x3+x4~=50 instead of 70. By the way your overall formulation is also wrong. You ended up maximising x1+x2+x3+x4+x5 instead of minimising. The obvious minimum for first formulation is 250 with one solution being [0, 100, 35, 35, 80] and the obvious maximum is 350 which is what your program computed. For the second formulation if you would've computed a minimum you should've got 0. And maximum is 350 still. It always pays to know what you should expect from your program and figures out ways to check if your program returned what you expected.    Embed Quote
