★What are some applications of linear programming that are useful in industry or the sciences?I've just learned this set of techniques and they are by far the most interesting I have come across in my study of CS thus far!  How useful are they and what are some applications?  I am planning on applying for a Ph.D. in CS so I'm more academically minded, but applications in industry are appreciated too.
A lot of problems can be expressed as integer programs.  In fact, integer programming is NP-hard, so every problem in NP can (in principle) be expressed as an integer program.  Every integer program can be approximated by a linear program, and the solution to that problem can often be used to find a very good approximate solution to the original problem. It's also worth noting that linear programming is a special case of convex optimization, which deals with what's basically the largest class of realistically solvable optimization problems.  A lot of problems in computational geometry, machine learning/statistics and operations research are either convex or can be very well approximated by a convex problem, so those techniques are incredibly useful.    Embed Quote
