★Linear programming / linear optimization video lectures?Is there a good set of linear programming / linear optimization video lectures somewhere? I found "Linear programming and Extensions" by Prof. Prabha Sharma, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. (http://www.youtube.com/course?li...) Are there other good ones? Thanks.
These ones are totally free and delivered by world class faculty: 1. Coursera - Linear and Integer Programming 2. Coursera -Linear and Discrete Optimization 3. Coursera - Discrete Optimization 4. Video Courses on Academic Earth Page no 2 : Convex Optimization 1 and 2 by Stanford's EE Professor Stephen Boyd cover linear programming (a superset of LP) along with assignments and quizzes.    Embed Quote
