★What are some good resources to learn about linear programming?
The Wikipedia definition of Linear Programming (LP) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin... is a good starting point for beginners. For any serious learner, I strongly recommend the textbook Introduction to Linear Optimization http://athenasc.com/linoptbook.html by Dimitris Bertsimas and John N. Tsitsiklis. This book is unified, comprehensive, and includes many interesting examples (a big plus!!). I know many researchers use the book as their main reference for linear programming. It is also my favorite math textbook. If you cannot afford to read the whole book, bear in mind that linear programming is essentially a method of analyzing a problem by constructing, solving, and interpreting the solution(s) of a linear optimization model. So learning about linear programming involves three major parts: Constructing the model - This is also called model formulation. There are actually quite a number of tricks for efficiently constructing a linear programming model, Chap 1 and 10 of Introduction to Linear Optimization provides a good treatment on this topic. Duality theory http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin... is also relevant here because it can be used to transform the formulation of a model. Solving the model - The two most important algorithms for solving LP are the simplex algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim... and interior point method http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Int.... The most widely used commercial solver is CPLEX (available free of charge for academic use) http://www-01.ibm.com/software/i.... Many programming languages also provide their own functions or software packages to solve linear programming models, such as linprog in MATLAB http://www.mathworks.com/help/to.... But there are dedicated modeling languages (such as AMPL http://www.ampl.com/EXAMPLES/ind...) and software packages (such as CVX http://cvxr.com/cvx/) that facilitate formulating the model in addition to solving it. Interpreting the solution(s) - Duality theory is needed to interpret the solution. Linear programming has rich applications in the real world partly because it is easy to perform sensitivity analysis http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/classes/... to linear programming models. Apart from all above, there are more specialized topics such as large scale optimization, network flow problems, (mixed) integer programming, etc. There are plenty of resources here and there on the web, but again I would recommend a textbook such as Introduction to Linear Optimization, because it is comprehensive and delivers high quality.    Embed Quote
