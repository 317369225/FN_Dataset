★Do any linear programming optimization software kits use Lagrange methods for mathematical optimization or always the simplex method and interior point algorithm?Lagrange multipliers on cmu.edu
I'm not sure what you mean by Lagrangian methods, but I'm going to assume you mean Augmented Lagrangian method or some sort of Penalty methods. When the Lagrangian methods are more general, they don't exploit any structure of the optimization problem. Simplex does exploit to some extent hence it is mostly preferred. Many linear programming packages use Simplex method or some variant of it for small to moderate sized problems whereas they use interior point methods for large scale problems.    Embed Quote
