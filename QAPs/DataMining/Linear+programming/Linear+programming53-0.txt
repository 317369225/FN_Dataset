★Why cplex use primal dual method？does IPM faster than simplex when solving linear programing?
Adding to what Paul said, IPM tends to be faster for large linear programs i.e. with too many variables and/or constraints. So in general if you have a linear program you should always ask CPLEX to use some kind of simplex algorithm since you get the dual solution also for free once it finishes solving. If it takes too much time then may be trying out IPM will work just fine. zverovich et al (2012) did a comprehensive study on the performance of different algorithms on two stage linear stochastic programs, you should check that out. Two stage linear stochastic programs are just HUGE linear programs. Of course in the end, simplex is not a polynomial time algorithm whereas IPM or ellipsoid is! :)    Embed Quote
