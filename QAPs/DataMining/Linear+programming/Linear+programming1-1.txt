★Why is it called Linear Programming?Where is the programming part? A better name would be Linear Optimisation?
I think it's useful to look at different contexts that the terms program (or programme) or programming get used. Radio and tv stations have personnel allocated to programming who decide which shows are scheduled when. Many events feature a document called a program listing the order of the proceedings. Computer programming consists of instructing a computer to carry out an appropriate set of instructions in the correct sequence in order to carry out some larger task. It seems as if there is a common theme of scheduling involved in all these activities. This is in line with Kevin Matzen's answer So, I guess the answer to the question is that the word "programming" had a more general common interpretation before the popularization of computer programming.    Embed Quote
