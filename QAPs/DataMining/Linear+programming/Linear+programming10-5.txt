★What are some applications of linear programming that are useful in industry or the sciences?I've just learned this set of techniques and they are by far the most interesting I have come across in my study of CS thus far!  How useful are they and what are some applications?  I am planning on applying for a Ph.D. in CS so I'm more academically minded, but applications in industry are appreciated too.
Consider the case that you are developing a octa-core processor, but given the "floor space" and the differences in the core's manufacture, you will have to place them in such a way that they provide maximum output by also keeping in mind that they fit-in the available "floor space". That's a sugar-coated version of real-life example.    Embed Quote
