★Linear Programming: Are there any classes of problems for which the simplex method finishes in polynomial time regardless of the pivoting rule?Excluding problems that are in some sense trivial.
The simplex algorithm finishes in polynomial time solving a MDP (Markov Decission Problem) if the discount factor is constant, using the simplest rule of the most negative reduced cost (Dantzig 1947). See for example http://www.stanford.edu/~yyye/si... The pivoting rule first proposed by Dantzig has shown to be exponential for LP problems, so this result is really cool. Hope this helps. :)    Embed Quote
