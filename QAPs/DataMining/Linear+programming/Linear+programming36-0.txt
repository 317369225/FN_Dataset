★What are some good open source alternatives to CPLEX (linear program solver)?
When I need to do something open source GLPK [1] is the first thing that comes to mind. I like that you can formulate problems using GMPL [2] which is an open source subset of AMPL, and that the community is active: I always get prompt, helpful answers from the GLPK gnu mailing list. I've used Lp Solve [3] a little, but I'm not nearly as familiar with it as GLPK. You may also want to check out SCIP [4]. Be forewarned. If you're used to CPLEX or Gurobi prepare for a marked decrease in performance when using any open source alternative.
