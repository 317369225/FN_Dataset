★Does linear programming admit a strongly polynomial-time algorithm?
I am interpreting your question as asking if any linear programming algorithm has polynomial time complexity.   A google search for: linear programming complexity turns up nearly 2M hits.   From glancing at that material, it is clear that the most popular solution to linear programming problems, the Simplex method is not of polynomial time complexity, but the ellipsoid methods, particularly the Karmakar algorithm, are.  See: Page on stanford.edu Complexity analysis of solutions to linear programming problems is not easy.  It is vexing that in theory, the Karmakar algorithm is better, yet in practice, the Simplex algorithm usually wins. In response to the comment that I neglected the "strongly" qualifier on your question about polynomial time complexity, here's another link:   Page on gatech.edu    Embed Quote
