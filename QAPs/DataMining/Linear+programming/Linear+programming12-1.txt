★What is the difference between dynamic programming and linear programming?
This is a little confusing because there are two different things that commonly go by the name "dynamic programming": a principle of algorithm design, and a method of formulating an optimization problem.  I'm going to concentrate on comparing the two optimization methods. A linear program is an optimization problem where we want to minimize a linear function subject to some linear constraints.  See the first example at Wikipedia for a very simple linear programming problem. In a dynamic program, we want to make a series of decisions in such a way as to maximize some function.  The key is that the set of decisions available to us at any given time depends on what we have already decided to do previously.  The simplest example I know of is the optimal consumption and saving problem described at Wikipedia. The key difference between the two is that in dynamic programming we're making one decision at a time, whereas in linear programming we're making all the decisions up front.    Embed Quote
