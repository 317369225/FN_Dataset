★What's the easiest way to learn linear programming?Hello, I am coming from a heavy java background and want to learn LP. What's the best way to do so? Greetings
This book is great for learning about linear programming: Introduction to Linear Optimization The first five chapters develop rigorously the geometry and algebra of linear programming, and the later chapters apply LP towards network flow problems and integer programming problems. The only weakness of the text, in my opinion, is the lack of discussion of state-of-the-art techniques and software packages that are used in practice.    Embed Quote
