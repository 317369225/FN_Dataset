★How do I solve a linear program by the subgradient method?
I think I found the answer! :) 1. In the subgradient method, STEP SIZE must be positive: (slide credit: Stefanie J. (for Suvrit Sra), UC Berkeley) 2. the code uses polyak's stepsize to implement subgradient method: but, here the f* is not known in advance. one solution is using a modified version of polyak's stepsize: (slide credit: Boyd) In the above code It simply ignores f* (or f_best) or any approximation of it. the method that is shown on the above figure converges faster. (note that I can't imagine f*=0 in this case, because when I slolve it by linear programming I see ones(n,1)'*x_min=-1.4083 -> to see check this one line of code "x_min=linprog(ones(n,1),A,b);") the last point that I want to mention to complete my answer is the following: 3. despite gradient vector, subgradient is not unique. any supporting hyperplane can be used as a subgradient. In the above code, It uses the column of A that makes Ax-b maximum at the current x. It can be tought as a most ascent/descent direction. (because we don't have real  gradient and we must choose between subgradients). I really appreciate it, if you notify me of my errors/misconceptions in this answer.    Embed Quote
