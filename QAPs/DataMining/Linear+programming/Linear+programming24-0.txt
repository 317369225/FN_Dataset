★What is the most common programming language for solving linear programming problems?
I would have to say Fortran. It's ideally suited for mathematical problems, there's a wide body of maths libraries for it, it vectorizes where possible and it avoids a lot of needless clutter. APL is pretty much useless, which is why you don't see a lot of compilers for it. It's not a language supported by any of the standard maths bodies and I don't recall seeing a single use of it in the years I wantonly added records to Freshmeat/Freecode. And I'm fairly sure I added just about all the maths libraries out there. Although C is widely adopted, it isn't liked for this sort of work. It's a great language, well supported by the maths community, but it's too easy to make software that blows up.    Embed Quote
