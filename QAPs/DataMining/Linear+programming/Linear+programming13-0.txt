★What day to day problems can be solved with linear programming?
Making change. Avoiding getting a pocketful of nickels and pennies. Deciding what mix of hardware/groceries/office supplies/whatever given constraints of cost, value-per-quantity, storage, volume, transport capacity, freshness, freezer capacity etc. Deciding which items/whether to shop at CostCo/ supermarket/ your local grocer/ online. You don't necessarily need to whip out a spreadsheet solver, but the general methodology applies, and becoming aware of what your constraints are, and how you can trade them off against each other, and when the opportunity cost of a big bargain makes sense and when it doesn't.    Embed Quote
