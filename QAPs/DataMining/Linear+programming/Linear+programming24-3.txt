★What is the most common programming language for solving linear programming problems?
Perhaps you're asking what is the most common language for implementation of linear programming applications.  Then it's really hard to say.  Widely-used LP-based packages offer APIs for a range of popular programming languages, as well as special-purpose languages and class libraries for formulation of optimization problems such as LPs.   Or perhaps you're asking what is the most common language for implementation of linear programming algorithms.  The best-known solver for LPs and related problems is called CPLEX, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to guess that the most common implementation language is C/C++.  But I don't know of anything approaching a systematic study of this, and the proper definition of "most common" is subject to debate in any case.    Embed Quote
