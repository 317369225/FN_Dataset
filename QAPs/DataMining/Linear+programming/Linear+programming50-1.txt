★Do any linear programming optimization software kits use Lagrange methods for mathematical optimization or always the simplex method and interior point algorithm?Lagrange multipliers on cmu.edu
For LP solvers lagrangian duality is somewhat analogous to LP duality. So the problem can be solved by solving the dual of LP. Now since strong duality holds in LP, it depends on a case by case basis which one would you solve for. As for basic solver methods, simplex is very crude and most solvers use blackbox optimizations over it. One approach, for instance, uses a combination of interior point for getting good basic solutions before the simplex iterations. Similarly you could solve with a subset of variables and then use column generation for adding in relevant variables. At the base can be simplex for solving the lowest level problem, however these optimizations make it much faster than a naive simplex method.    Embed Quote
