★How do I model similarity in the objective function of linear programming?Lets say for e.g. there are a set of samples ( sample 1, sample 2, .. ), and a set of Machines ( machine 1, machine 2.. ) . there is a matrix give for time taken by these machines to process those sets of samples . Now, how do i model the objective function so that each machine is being used for same amount of time ? P.S: I am using Excel Solver for solving LP problems
The objective function can be to minimize the total time. The similarity of time to be taken by each machine needs to be added as a constraint.    Embed Quote
