★How are Topology and Linear Programming related?I assumed they were very different areas, but I just noticed that the Linear Programming (Optimization) class at my school is almost always taught by professors that research Topology.  Fluke?
There are some interesting connections between certain areas of linear programming and topology, but they tend to be far more abstract than what I imagine you're looking for. Most of the connections that I can think of stem from the area of Functional Analysis, where we tend to consider the topology induced by a norm (or perhaps by family of semi-norms). The Krein-Millman Theorem [0] gives an important convexity result in infinite-dimensional spaces (e.g. topological vector spaces of functions with some norm, such as the Sobolev or norms). This theorem allows one to effectively recover the interior of a convex set simply by knowing the points "on the boundary." One can apply this theorem to show that there exist solutions to various convex optimization problems. In particular, this theorem relies heavily on the norm topology and can be generalized to families of seminorms. See these notes [1] for more details and examples. Effectively any part of abstract convex analysis that intersects with functional analysis will relate topology (via families of seminorms or norms) to some set of functions that serve as the solution space for convex optimization problems.
