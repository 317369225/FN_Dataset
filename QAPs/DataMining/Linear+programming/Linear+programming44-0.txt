★What level of mathematics do I need to learn linear programming for operations research?
I think the most important math subject you need to learn is linear algebra. You can easily understand why simplex works if you know linear transformation, also applicable to due-simplex method. All the other method like the big M method can be derived likewise based on the similar matrix linear transformation techniques. If you may encounter some problems with a probability model, you may need to know how to calcuate the pre or post - probability using beyesian probability method. Probability is not as important is linear algebra regards to linear programming I think.    Embed Quote
