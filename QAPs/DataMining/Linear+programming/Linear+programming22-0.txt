★Is there a way to assess the similarity between linear programs?I have two linear programs that operate on the same data and produce similar, but not identical, results consistently.  Is there a theoretically sound way of comparing the two?
Let's take the  linear program in its standard form i.e. s.t. . If the objective function and the left hand side remains the same i.e. and , then we can just use the standard sensitivity analysis. Note that if c changes and b remains the same, simply take the dual and analysis follows. (In either case out of the three A, b and c we need A to be fixed and either b or c should be fixed.)
