★What is the difference between dynamic programming and linear programming?
Dynamic programming is a way of  solving  problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.  It is essentially a 'smart' recursion.  Often extra work doesn't have to be repeated if solutions to subproblems are cached after they are solved.  Dynamic programming has a confusing name which traces back to its roots as a field studied by operations researchers. Linear programming is a mathematical method (and associated algorithms) for maximizing or minimizing a function subject to a series of linear constraints.    Embed Quote
