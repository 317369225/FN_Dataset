★What are some applications of linear programming that are useful in industry or the sciences?I've just learned this set of techniques and they are by far the most interesting I have come across in my study of CS thus far!  How useful are they and what are some applications?  I am planning on applying for a Ph.D. in CS so I'm more academically minded, but applications in industry are appreciated too.
Specialized implementation of linear programs in flow models, transportation and assignment algorithms -- though specialized, the complexity scales well enough that they are used in many inventory management solutions. Linear programs are fantastic if you can devise the right cutting planes to support your integer programming solvers. LP + hot starts/cold starts power a number of nonlinear/integer programming solvers. So efficiency of those approaches depend partly on efficiency and effectiveness of linear programs. Many primal dual approximation algorithms depend on LP formulations for guarantees (through upper/lower bounds that define stopping criteria) though they rarely solve them in practice.    Embed Quote
