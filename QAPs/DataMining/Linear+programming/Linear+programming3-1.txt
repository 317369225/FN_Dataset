★How are Topology and Linear Programming related?I assumed they were very different areas, but I just noticed that the Linear Programming (Optimization) class at my school is almost always taught by professors that research Topology.  Fluke?
They're not directly related, but both have a geometric flavor. Topology is obviously geometric, and LP is, since optimizing linear functions subject to linear inequality constraints corresponds to finding an extremal hyperplane that intersects a high-dimensional convex polyhedron, and many LP algorithms make use of theory of convex polyhedra. More specifically, each linear inequality defines a half-space (all the space to one side of a hyperplane), and points satisfying a bunch of these inequalities must lie in the intersection of the corresponding half-spaces. Convex polyhedra are intersections of finitely many halfspaces, so the region you're working with is a convex polyhedron. Now, the level sets of a linear function are just translates of a hyperplane, so to maximize a linear function on a convex polyhedron, you want to find the most extreme translate of the hyperplane that passes through the polyhedron. In most cases, the hyperplane is not parallel to any face of the polyhedron, so this intersection will be at a vertex.    Embed Quote
