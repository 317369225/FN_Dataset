★What are some applications of linear programming that are useful in industry or the sciences?I've just learned this set of techniques and they are by far the most interesting I have come across in my study of CS thus far!  How useful are they and what are some applications?  I am planning on applying for a Ph.D. in CS so I'm more academically minded, but applications in industry are appreciated too.
Many industrial process control applications revolve around linear programs. I've seen statistics that suggest the first generation of (very expensive) mainframe computers were gobbled up by oil companies to solve LP models that determined flows in refineries ... and that the payback period on the purchases was pretty short.    Embed Quote
