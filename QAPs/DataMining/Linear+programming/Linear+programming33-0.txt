★How would you explain linear programming to a five-year-old?
High-dimensional things have lots of corners. Linear functions will always put the highest & lowest value to a corner, not the interior, of a high-dimensional thing. I would also use a temperature map like Weather to explain the concept of assigning a number to a space. The temperatures are definitely nonlinear but there are some regularities like hotter to the south. (In the US.) If you wanted to find the city with the hottest temperature you would want to look along the southern border only. In linear programming it's certain that this will work and there are fast ways to systematically eliminate things you don't need to check --- using what you've already found more effectively than checking every corner. In adult applications it might be related to money. The high-dimensional space might be the possible ways a company or government could do something that they have to do, the cost of each way writes numbers all over that space, and you want to find the lowest number (lowest cost). I'm taking "five-year-old" as a euphemism for "make it as simple as possible". Haven't tested this out on any five-year-olds, but the style of explanation I gave above has worked really well on totally non-mathematical, non-scientific adults I've used it on.    Embed Quote
