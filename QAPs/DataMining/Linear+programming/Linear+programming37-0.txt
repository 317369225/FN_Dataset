★What are some common applications of linear programming in game theory?
Common? LP is the bread and butter of game theory. You formulate the games as linear programs and then solve them using the simplex method. Solve = computing equilibrium. Either Nash or Stackelberg equilibrium. You may also formulate games as quadratic, convex or non-linear programs - the latter is unsolvable and you may have to linearize it to solve it approximately.    Embed Quote
