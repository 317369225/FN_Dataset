★What level of mathematics do I need to learn linear programming for operations research?
For linear programming, the most important tool you need is Linear Algebra. Let me quickly explain why. For starters, they share the word "Linear" in their names, and this is no coincidence. In linear programming, you deal with systems of linear inequalities and the best way to solve these systems is by converting them to linear equations and using techniques of linear algebra to solve them in a systematic fashion. The famous Simplex Method, the hallmark method of linear programming, is at its core all about linear algebra. With linear algebra, you can lucidly understand and follow the mechanics of the algorithm with ease. Also, linear algebra helps you follow theorems that are written in compact matrix/vector notation. You'll come across this almost any linear optimization text. Might as well get used to it! An investment in linear algebra is never a bad one. Whether you find yourself in research or in practice, you will heavily utilize the techniques of linear algebra one way or another. If you really want to dive deep into LP theory, you might also want to consider an Analysis course, but that would depend on your mathematical maturity. Analysis is not an easy subject for non-mathematicians, but the course itself is worthwhile.    Embed Quote
