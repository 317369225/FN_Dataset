★How would you explain linear programming to a five-year-old?
Not at all. Let him first learn what mathematics is. Then explain what it means to optimize things in a way that (s)he understands it like "You try to produce the things demanded at the lowest costs and have to ensure you have a valid solution e.g. by not extending capacities. If you can only produce 100 units per day, you cannot calculate to produce 101 units" Then you can explain, that you calculate it with the help of mathematics. But I think we talk about a 8 to 10 year old child, not a five year old.    Embed Quote
