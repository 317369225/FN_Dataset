★How would you explain linear programming to a five-year-old?
Let'see, linear programming try to use hyper-plane to partition hyper-dimension into regions, and solve the problem with fast algorithm. So what is the same concept in one or two dimensions? (And forget about the fast algorithm) In one dimension, it is inequality and regions formed by inequality. So that is close to the spirit in linear programming if you teach it right. But I really don't understand why one want to emphasize linear programming to a youth. (One of my professor told us, it is a shame that an undergraduate doesn't understand the linear programming method, but it seems that "the shame" continues on.)    Embed Quote
